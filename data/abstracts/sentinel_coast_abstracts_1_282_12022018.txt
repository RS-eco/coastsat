While significant advances have been made in mangrove mapping using remote sensing, no study has documented long-term changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone-one of the most vulnerable countries in West Africa. Such understanding is critical for devising regional management strategies that can support local livelihoods. We utilize multi-date Landsat data and cloud computational techniques to quantify spatiotemporal changes in land cover, with focus on mangrove ecosystems, for 1990-2016 along the coast of Sierra Leone. We specifically focus on four estuaries-Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Yawri Bay, and Sherbro. We relied on the k-means approach for an unsupervised classification, and validated the classified map from 2016 using ground truth data collected from Sentinel-2 and high-resolution images and during field research (accuracy: 95%). Our findings indicate that the Scarcies river estuary witnessed the greatest mangrove loss since 1990 (45%), while the Sierra Leone river estuary experienced mangrove gain over the last 26 years (22%). Overall, the Sierra Leone coast lost 25% of its mangroves between 1990 and 2016, with the lowest coverage in 2000, during the period of civil war (1991-2002). However, natural mangrove dynamics, as supported by field observations, indicate the potential for regeneration and sustainability under carefully constructed management strategies.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							12	10.3390/s18010012								WOS:000423286300012

An assessment of commonly employed satellite-based remote sensors for mapping mangrove species in Mexico using an NDVI-based classification scheme	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Optimizing the classification accuracy of a mangrove forest is of utmost importance for conservation practitioners. Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle. When considering such type of sensors, the higher spatial resolution can be particularly important in mapping small mangrove islands that often occur in degraded mangrove systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							23	10.1007/s10661-017-6399-z								WOS:000422680800032

Species dominating the upper trophic level are vulnerable to these effects due to bioaccumulation. In Bass Strait, the Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) is an important top order predator and sentinel species for ecosystem health. An alopecia syndrome is seen at high prevalence in juvenile, female Australian fur seals at Lady Julia Percy Island, Victoria, Australia. Previous investigations suggest causality could be due to an endocrine-like toxicant. The alopecia syndrome has significance for thermoregulation and is a likely risk factor for mortality. Fur collected from case (alopecic) and control (unaffected) seals sampled at Lady Julia Percy Island were analysed for POPs. To investigate the utility of fur for monitoring POPs concentrations in pinnipeds, a comparison of POPs concentrations in the fur and blubber of Australian fur seals stranded along the Victorian coast was undertaken. The concentration of selected POPs including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate/perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOS/PFOA) were determined in fur using either High Resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Results indicate detectable, and in some individuals, elevated levels of dl-PCBs, PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in juvenile fur seals sampled on Lady Julia Percy Island, with significantly higher levels of dl-PCBs in case compared to control seals. Elevated levels of dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs were found in blubber samples collected from stranded fur seals with significant correlations between blubber and fur concentrations seen, particularly for dl-PCBs. This study discusses the significance of POPs concentrations in relation to the causality of an alopecia syndrome in the Australian fur seal, and assesses the utility of fur as a non-invasive biomarker to monitor POPs exposure in this sentinel species.

S.; Sang, Rosemary			Dengue and yellow fever virus vectors: seasonal abundance, diversity and resting preferences in three Kenyan cities	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: The transmission patterns of dengue (DENV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses, especially in urban settings, are influenced by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquito abundance and behavior. Despite recurrent dengue outbreaks on the Kenyan coast, these parameters remain poorly defined in this and other areas of contrasting dengue endemicity in Kenya. In assessing the transmission risk of DENV/YFV in three Kenyan cities, we determined adult abundance and resting habits of potential Aedes (Stegomyia) vectors in Kilifi (dengue-outbreak prone), and Nairobi and Kisumu (no dengue outbreaks reported). In addition, mosquito diversity, an important consideration for changing mosquito-borne disease dynamics, was compared. Methods: Between October 2014 and June 2016, host-seeking adult mosquitoes were sampled using CO2-baited BG-Sentinel traps (12 traps daily) placed in vegetation around homesteads, across study sites in the three major cities. Also, indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes were sampled using Prokopack aspirators. Three samplings, each of five consecutive days, were conducted during the long-rains, short-rains and dry season for each city. Intercity and seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and diversity was evaluated using general linear models while mosquito-resting preference (indoors vs outdoors) was compared using Chi-square test. Results: Aedes aegypti, which comprised 60% (n = 7772) of the total 12,937 host-seeking mosquitoes collected, had comparable numbers in Kisumu (45.2%, n = 3513) and Kilifi (37.7%, n = 2932), both being significantly higher than Nairobi (17.1%, n = 1327). Aedes aegypti abundance was significantly lower in the short-rains and dry season relative to the long-rains (P < 0.0001). Aedes bromeliae, which occurred in low numbers, did not differ significantly between seasons or cities. Mosquito diversity was highest during the long-rains and in Nairobi. Only 10% (n = 43) of the 450 houses aspirated were found positive for resting Ae. aegypti, with overall low captures in all areas. Aedes aegypti densities were comparable indoors/outdoors in Kilifi; but with higher densities outdoors than indoors in Kisumu and Nairobi. Conclusions: The presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti near human habitations and dwellings, especially in Kilifi/Kisumu, is suggestive of increased DENV transmission risk due to higher prospects of human vector contact. Despite low abundance of Ae. bromeliae suggestive of low YFV transmission risk, its proximity to human habitation as well as the observed diversity of potential YFV vectors should be of public health concern and monitored closely for targeted control. The largely outdoor resting behavior for Ae. aegypti provides insights for targeted adult vector control especially during emergency outbreak situations.

J	Di Beneditto, APM; Siciliano, S				Madeira Di Beneditto, Ana Paula; Siciliano, Salvatore			Marine debris boost in juvenile Magellanic penguins stranded in south-eastern Brazil in less than a decade: Insights into feeding habits and habitat use	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a marine sentinel for the southern Atlantic Ocean that is a proxy of environmental quality. The presence of marine debris (macro-debris) in the stomach contents of emaciated juvenile penguins stranded from 21 degrees S to 23 degrees S was compared at different times (2000 and 2008), and the debris ingestion pathway was determined. The frequency of marine debris in the stomachs doubled in less than a decade, and flexible plastics remained the main ingested item over time (68-70%). The pelagic octopus, Argonauta nodosa, which inhabits the sea surface, was the most important prey species recovered in the stomach contents. The poor physical condition of the penguins that reach the northern migration limit (study area) reduces the diving capacity of the animals and increases their vulnerability to debris ingestion. Considering their preferred prey and physical condition, we conclude that the penguins likely ingested the marine debris in surface waters.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					330	333		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.09.044								WOS:000418727000048	28958439

Evaluation of the potential genotoxic activity in seawater of Asin Bay, Gulf of Gulluk, Mugla, Aegean coast of Turkey	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												This research examined the genotoxic activity in the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) located in Mugla, Turkey, Aegean coast of Turkey. Genotoxic activities of 66 raw samples, taken from 17 different stations in the spring and summer seasons of the year 2013, were determined by using in vitro mutagenicity assay SOS chromotest with Escherichia coli PQ37 strain bacteria activities. In the applied procedure, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity, alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, and different solvent controls were taken into account to generate reliable results in terms of the corrected induction factors (CIF) used as a quantitative measure of genotoxic activity level. The SOS chromotest procedure was simply and rapidly performed as an early assay to explore for whether a potential genotoxic activity was presence in the in the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) with no special measuring devices except a microplate reader. The implemented assay was successfully completed within only 24 h including the revival of the bacteria. The results showed that 11 samples (% 17 of total) were close to the threshold value of 1.5. The findings of this study clearly revealed that the seawater of Asin Bay (Gulf of Gulluk) had no potential genotoxic risks in terms of the organisms in marine ecosystem, since all of the calculated CIF values were determined to be below the threshold level. It was concluded that according to the SOS chromotest results, the levels of potential genotoxic agents were found to be under the limits for the offshore fishery.																	1790-7632					DEC	2017	19	4					658	665										WOS:000422866200011

Detecting Landscape Disturbance at the Nasca Lines Using SAR Data Collected from Airborne and Satellite Platforms	GEOSCIENCES												We used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected over Peru's Lines and Geoglyphs of Nasca and Palpa World Heritage Site to detect and measure landscape disturbance threatening world-renowned archaeological features and ecosystems. We employed algorithms to calculate correlations between pairs of SAR returns, collected at different times, and generate correlation images. Landscape disturbances even on the scale of pedestrian travel are discernible in correlation images generated from airborne, L-band SAR. Correlation images derived from C-band SAR data collected by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellites also provide detailed landscape change information. Because the two Sentinel-1 satellites together have a repeat pass interval that can be as short as six days, products derived from their data can not only provide information on the location and degree of ground disturbance, but also identify a time window of about one to three weeks during which disturbance must have occurred. For Sentinel-1, this does not depend on collecting data in fine-beam modes, which generally sacrifice the size of the area covered for a higher spatial resolution. We also report on pixel value stretching for a visual analysis of SAR data, quantitative assessment of landscape disturbance, and statistical testing for significant landscape change.

J	La, TV; Khenchaf, A; Comblet, F; Nahum, C				Tran Vu La; Khenchaf, Ali; Comblet, Fabrice; Nahum, Carole			Exploitation of C-Band Sentinel-1 Images for High-Resolution Wind Field Retrieval in Coastal Zones (Iroise Coast, France)	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the favorite ools for earth observation applications, i.e., oceanography, land use mapping, climate change since this device can offer the data at a high spatial resolution and in most meteorological conditions. This is more significant when the data acquired by the Sentinel-1, a new C-band satellite, are exploited. For high-resolution wind field extraction, two different approaches are proposed. In the scatterometry-based approach, wind direction is first extracted by the local gradient method at different scales, i.e., 1-5-km wind resolutions. It is then applied to the empirical geophysical model functions, i.e., CMOD (C-band), for surface wind speed estimation. The advantage of this approach is to deliver accurate wind speed estimates in the range of 2-25 m/s from different SAR data. However, it requires wind direction as an input parameter. This can lead to errors in wind speed estimation due to uncertain wind directions. Therefore, for comparison, in the second approach, we propose the use of the model without wind direction input proposed by Komarov et al. In general, the obtained wind fields based on two proposed approaches are quite similar, and they have good agreement with in situ measurements from the meteorological stations along the Iroise coast.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2017	10	12	2				5458	5471		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2746349								WOS:000418871200012

A Multi-Sensor Approach for Assessing Mangrove Biophysical Characteristics in Coastal Odisha, India	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Mangroves around the world play a major role in coastal ecosystem processes by mitigating erosion and serving as a barrier against storm surges. India holds approximately 5% of the world's mangroves, over half of which are found along its east coast. Situated in the state of Odisha, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary are two wetlands of local importance in need of effective management. This study demonstrated the use of Terra, Landsat, and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove health at these two sites. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, were examined to develop biophysical prediction tools and derive a 17-year time-series (from 2000 to 2016) of leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The long-term analysis revealed phenological patterns in the biophysical characteristics such as high values during wet season and low values during the dry season. Correlations between biophysical characteristics and meteorological factors revealed a time lag exists in response to precipitation and associated runoff. In contrast, surface temperature did not show any lag in response time. This study also utilized Sentinel-1 radar data for the first time for Odisha mangroves to show seasonal variability in LAI, GPP, and CHL. The results from radar data were consistent with optical sensors and proved useful for capturing the rainy season, where data were limited due to cloud cover. This study revealed the advantages of using a multi-sensor approach for monitoring mangrove health and defining future monitoring protocols.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					679	700		10.1007/s40010-017-0441-y								WOS:000418819200015

Simple Approaches to Oil Spill Detection Using Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP)-Ocean Application Tools and Texture Analysis: A Comparative Study	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Effective and efficient monitoring of oil spills that originate from ships, offshore platforms and any accidents are of immense importance from the viewpoint of public safety and environmental protection. Detection of spilled oil is also essential to estimate the potential spread and drift from the source to the nearby coastal areas. In this regard, utilization of SAR data for the detection and monitoring of oil spills has received considerable attention in recent times, due to their wide area coverage, day-night and all-weather capabilities. In this paper, two oil spills incidents along the coast of Mumbai, India are investigated; (1) The 2010 oil spill that occurred after the MV MSC Chitra and MV Khalijia-3 collided and (2) the oil spill caused due to sinking of MV RAK carrier in 2011. Two simple and relatively quick approaches for oil spill detection have been applied to VV polarized Radarsat-2 imagery of the incidents and a comparison is made of the results obtained. The first approach utilizes the oil spill detection tool of Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and the second explores texture analysis using Grey Level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The results of the study show that texture analysis proves to be an efficient method for oil spill detection as compared to the SNAP oil spill detection tool. Nevertheless, both the proposed methodologies are useful for detection of oil spills and for subsequent utilization of the results, timely and cost effectively, for the calibration and validation of numerical models that predict oil spill dispersion trajectories.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				DEC	2017	45	6					1065	1075		10.1007/s12524-016-0658-2								WOS:000416900000015

Exploring the presence of pollutants at sea: Monitoring heavy metals and pesticides in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) from the western Mediterranean	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Marine turtles are considered good sentinel species for environmental assessment because of their long lifespan, feeding ecology, habitat use and migratory nature. In the present study, we assessed presence of cadmium, lead and mercury, together with organic pollutants, both in fat and muscle tissue of 25 stranded loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) stranded along the Valencian Community coast (East Spain) (43.7 +/- 13.5 cm). Mean concentrations of Cd, Pb and Hg were 0.04 mu g/g w.w., 0.09 mu g/g w.w. and 0.03 mu g/g w.w. in fat and 0.05 mu g/g, 0.08 mu g/g and 0.04 mu g/g in muscle, respectively. These measures indicate a relatively low mean heavy metal concentration, which may be explained by juvenile size and developmental stage of the turtles analysed. A preliminary non targeted analysis (using time-of-flight (TOF) technology), made for the first time in marine turtles, allowed to detect 39 different pesticides, most of them previously undetected in this species. Most of the organic substances detected are used in agricultural activities, and the use of 15 of them (38.5%) is not approved in the European Union. Our sample did not show any trend on pollutant contents in relation to turtle size or stranding location, probably because of the high diversity of pollutants found. However, the potential for a positive latitudinal gradient should be explored in future studies due to riverine inputs and high agricultural and industrial activities in the area. Despite the high diversity of pollutants found here, comparative studies of pollutants in other matrices at sea are needed to ascertain whether the loggerhead turtle is a good sentinel of chemical pollution in the western Mediterranean.

Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar Survey of Subsidence in Hampton Roads, Virginia (USA)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Over the past century, the Hampton Roads area of the Chesapeake Bay region has experienced one of the highest rates of relative sea level rise on the Atlantic coast of the United States. This rate of relative sea level rise results from a combination of land subsidence, which has long been known to be present in the region, and rising seas associated with global warming on long timescales and exacerbated by shifts in ocean dynamics on shorter timescales. An understanding of the current-day magnitude of each component is needed to create accurate projections of future relative sea level rise upon which to base planning efforts. The objective of this study is to estimate the land component of relative sea level rise using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis applied to ALOS-1 synthetic aperture radar data acquired during 2007-2011 to generate high-spatial resolution (20-30 m) estimates of vertical land motion. Although these results are limited by the uncertainty associated with the small set of available historical SAR data, they highlight both localized rates of high subsidence and a significant spatial variability in subsidence, emphasizing the need for further measurement, which could be done with Sentinel-1 and NASA's upcoming NISAR mission.

The MinA technique allows discrimination and time-evolution monitoring of the inherent two-dimensional components (i.e., with respect to east-west and up-down directions) of the ongoing deformation processes. It represents an effective post-processing tool that allows an easy combination of preliminarily-retrieved multiple-satellite Line-Of-Sight-projected displacement time-series, obtained by using one (or more) of the currently available multi-pass DInSAR toolboxes. Specifically, in our work, the well-known small baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm has been exploited to recover LOS deformation time-series from two sets of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data relevant to the coast of Shanghai, collected from 2014 to 2017 by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and the Sentinel-1A (S1-A) sensors. The achieved results evidence that the Shanghai ocean-reclaimed areas were still subject to residual deformations in 2016, with maximum subsidence rates of about 30 mm/year. Moreover, the investigation has revealed that the detected deformations are predominantly vertical, whereas the east-west deformations are less significant.

Geospatial drivers of the groundwater delta O-18 isoscape in a temperate maritime climate (Republic of Ireland)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In recent years, the concept of "isoscapes" has been used to describe spatiotemporal stable isotope distributions within natural environments including groundwater systems at multiple scales. This study presents an updated groundwater delta O-18 isoscape for the Republic of Ireland and describes the climatic and geological drivers influencing O-18 composition. In all, 142 geographically and geologically representative groundwater installations were sampled and analysed, in addition to 35 samples from six nested boreholes. Geospatially, Irish groundwater exhibits high delta O-18 values in southern and western coastal regions, becoming progressively depleted inland before reaching lowest measured values along the eastern coast, equating to a national groundwater delta O-18 profile range of approximately 3 parts per thousand. Groundwater delta O-18 composition is primarily driven by location with respect to orographically influenced rainfall deposition and annual precipitation volume, with a bias towards winter recharge. Results also demonstrate that local/regional (hydro)geological setting exerts a secondary influence on delta O-18 composition via infiltration and recharge mechanisms. "Flashy" groundwater systems (e.g. karst limestones) are more likely to exhibit seasonal groundwater delta O-18 patterns, whereas low productivity systems with high residence times (e.g. granites), tend to display a dampened composition to groundwater recharge and exhibit more temporally constant delta O-18 values. The derived delta O-18 isoscape enhances current understanding of what is a geologically distinct groundwater setting, whilst also potentially serving as a delta O-18 "sentinel" for continental Europe, with respect to both groundwater and precipitation, due to Ireland's geographic location.

Use of biomarkers to assess the pollution effects assumes that the effects of pollutants on the biomarkers exceed the natural background variability; yet this assumption has rarely been tested. We exposed mussels at different reproductive stages and nutritive states to two concentrations of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (fluoranthene, 3 and 60 mu g L-1) for three weeks. Expression levels of the molecular biomarkers related to the detoxification and general stress response [cytochrome P450 oxidase (CYP450), glutathione S-transferases (GST-alpha; GST-S1; GST-S2), the multixenobiotic resistance protein P-glycoprotein (PgP), metallothioneins (MT10 and MT20), heat shock proteins (HSP22, HSP70-2; HSP70-3; HSP70-4), as well as mRNA expression of two reproduction-related genes, vitellogenin (Vitel) and vitelline coat lysin M7 (VCLM7)] were measured. The mussels' nutrition and reproductive state affected the baseline mRNA levels of molecular biomarkers and modulated the transcriptional responses of biomarker genes to the pollutant exposure. Thus, mussel physiological state could act as a confounding factor in the evaluation of the response of pollution through molecular biomarkers.

Therefore, there is a strong need to validate the OLCI products to be sure that the technical capabilities provided will be used in the best possible way in water quality monitoring and research. The Baltic Sea is an optically complex waterbody where many ocean colour products, performing well in other waterbodies, fail. We tested the performance of standard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain in retrieving water reflectance, inherent optical properties (IOPs), and water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a, total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Baltic Sea. The reflectance spectra produced by the C2RCC are realistic in both shape and magnitude. However, the IOPs, and consequently the water quality parameters estimated by the C2RCC, did not have correlation with in situ data. On the other hand, some tested empirical remote sensing algorithms performed well in retrieving chlorophyll a, TSM, CDOM and Secchi depth from the reflectance produced by the C2RCC. This suggests that the atmospheric correction part of the processor performs relatively well while IOP retrieval part of the neural network needs extensive training with actual IOP data before it can produce reasonable estimates for the Baltic Sea.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1070	10.3390/rs9101070								WOS:000414650600100

Dead Sea, Jordan	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												This article presents and analyses the results obtained from Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques applied to ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, ALOS-PALSAR, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A datasets over the Lisan Peninsula, located in the southern part of the Dead Sea, Jordan. The novelty comes from the integration of three different wavelengths to study the dynamics of a salt dome. The monitoring activity entirely covers the period extending from 1992 to 2016. Five displacement maps have been produced, carefully checked and then fused to provide a total cumulated map of the displacements in the area. The ground movements have been analysed by comparison with in-situ tectonic observations collected by various authors since the mid-1980s. The study shows an episodic rising of the Lisan diapir. The presented results can be useful to update the knowledge of the displacement rates occurring in the area and to better comprehend the complex dynamics of the Lisan Peninsula.

Health and Environmental Risk Assessment Project for bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus from the southeastern USA. II. Environmental aspects	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus are the most common apex predators found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems along the southeastern coast of the USA, where these animals are exposed to multiple chemical pollutants and microbial agents. In this review, we summarize the results of investigations of environmental exposures evaluated in 360 free-ranging dolphins between 2003 and 2015. Bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (IRL, n = 246), and coastal waters of Charleston, South Carolina (CHS, n = 114), were captured, given comprehensive health examinations, and released as part of a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional study of individual and population health. High concentrations of persistent organic pollutants including legacy contaminants (DDT and other pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds) as well as 'emerging' contaminants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluorinated compounds) were detected in dolphins from CHS, with lower concentrations in the IRL. Conversely, the concentrations of mercury in the blood and skin of IRL dolphins were among the highest reported worldwide and approximately 5 times as high as those found in CHS dolphins. A high prevalence of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in humans and animals was detected in bacteria isolated from fecal, blowhole, and/or gastric samples at both sites, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at CHS. Collectively, these studies illustrate the importance of long-term surveillance of estuarine populations of bottlenose dolphins and reaffirm their important role as sentinels for marine ecosystems and public health.																	0177-5103	1616-1580				JUL 24	2017	125	2					155	166		10.3354/dao03143								WOS:000407439500007	28737160

Characterization and productivity profiles of Aedes aegypti (L.) breeding habitats across rural and urban landscapes in western and coastal Kenya	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Aedes aegypti, the principal vector for dengue and other emerging arboviruses, breeds preferentially in various man-made and natural container habitats. In the absence of vaccine, epidemiological surveillance and vector control remain the best practices for preventing dengue outbreaks. Effective vector control depends on a good understanding of larval and adult vector ecology of which little is known in Kenya. In the current study, we sought to characterize breeding habitats and establish container productivity profiles of Ae. aegypti in rural and urban sites in western and coastal Kenya. Methods: Twenty sentinel houses in each of four study sites (in western and coastal Kenya) were assessed for immature mosquito infestation once a month for a period of 24 months (June 2014 to May 2016). All water-holding containers in and around the households were inspected for Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae. Results: Collections were made from a total of 22,144 container visits: Chulaimbo (7575) and Kisumu (8003) in the west, and from Msambweni (3199) and Ukunda (3367) on the coast. Of these, only 4-5.6% were positive for Ae. aegypti immatures. In all four sites, significantly more positive containers were located outdoors than indoors. A total of 17,537 Ae. aegypti immatures were sampled from 10 container types. The most important habitat types were buckets, drums, tires, and pots, which produced over 75% of all the pupae. Key outdoor containers in the coast were buckets, drums and tires, which accounted for 82% of the pupae, while pots and tires were the only key containers in the western region producing 70% of the pupae. Drums, buckets and pots were the key indoor containers, producing nearly all of the pupae in the coastal sites. No pupae were collected indoors in the western region. The coastal region produced significantly more Ae. aegypti immatures than the western region both inside and outside the sentinel houses. Conclusions: These results indicate that productive Ae. aegypti larval habitats are abundant outdoors and that only a few containers produce a majority of the pupae. Although the numbers were lower, productive habitats were detected within households. Targeting source reduction efforts towards these productive containers both inside and outside homes is likely to be a cost-effective way to reduce arboviral transmission in these regions.																	1756-3305					JUL 12	2017	10								331	10.1186/s13071-017-2271-9								WOS:000405902600003	28701194

Mainy species have been identified as being threatened by collision, entanglement or ingestion of debris, generally plastics, which constitute the predominant part of the recorded marine debris. Assessing sensitive areas, where exposure to debris are high, is thus crucial, in particular for sea turtles which have been proposed as sentinels of debris levels for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and for the Unep-MedPol convention. Our objective here was to assess sea turtle exposure to marine debris in the 3 metropolitan French fronts. Using aerial surveys performed in the Channel, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean regions in winter and summer 2011-2012, we evaluated exposure areas and magnitude in terms of spatial overlap, encounter probability and density of surrounding debris at various spatial scales. Major overlapping areas appeared in the Atlantic and Mediterranean fronts, concerning mostly the leatherback and the loggerhead turtles respectively. The probability for individuals to be in contact with debris (around 90% of individuals within a radius of 2 km) and the density of debris surrounding individuals (up to 16 items with a radius of 2 km, 88 items within a radius of 10 km) were very high, whatever the considered spatial scale, especially in the Mediterranean region and during the summer season. The comparison of the observed mean debris density with random distribution suggested that turtles selected debris areas. This may occur if both debris and turtles drift to the same areas due to currents, if turtles meet debris accidentally by selecting high food concentration areas, and/or if turtles actively seek debris out, confounding them with their preys. Various factors such as species-specific foraging strategies or oceanic features which condition the passive diffusion of debris, and sea turtles in part, may explain spatio-temporal variations in sensitive areas. Further research on exposure to debris is urgently needed. Empirical data on sea turtles and debris distributions, such as those collected aerially, are essential to better identify the location and the factors determining risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

New insight into transmission dynamics of the crustacean pathogen Hematodinium perezi (Dinoflagellata) using a novel sentinel methodology	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Hematodinium perezi causes disease and mortality in several decapod crustaceans along the eastern seaboard and Gulf coast of the USA. The route of transmission of the parasite is unknown, but infections exhibit a sharp seasonal cycle in its primary host, the blue crab Call-inectes sapidus, that indicates the possibility of a short transmission period in its life cycle. We developed a sentinel methodology based on the use of naive, uninfected, early benthic juvenile crabs (instars C1 to C10) to investigate the transmission of H. perezi. Crabs were collected from a non-endemic site, held for a short period for evaluation, and then deployed in a highly endemic site for 14 d. Transmission of the pathogen was successful; 12.7 to 25.7% of the crabs deployed at the endemic site became infected over this period. Infections developed rapidly, with 25% of new infections developing into heavy infections during the deployment. The large number of infections that developed using the sentinel methodology allowed for the first estimates of incidence (the proportion of new infections in a population over time) in this system. Incidence varied from 0.9 to 1.8% of the resident crab population per day and accounts for the high prevalence levels observed in the endemic coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula. The development of this sentinel methodology has broad application for studying disease ecology in this system and in other pathogens that infect decapods.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				JUN 21	2017	573						73	84		10.3354/meps12175								WOS:000404123900006

Rise and fall of Ross Sea emperor penguin colony populations: 2000 to 2012	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												There are seven emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies distributed throughout the traditional boundaries of the Ross Sea from Cape Roget to Cape Colbeck. This coastline is c. 10% of the entire coast of Antarctica. From 2000 to 2012, there has been a nearly continuous record of population size of most, and sometimes all, of these colonies. Data were obtained by analysing aerial photographs. We found large annual variations in populations of individual colonies, and conclude that a trend from a single emperor penguin colony may not be a good environmental sentinel. There are at least four possibilities for census count fluctuations: i) this species is not bound to a nesting site like other penguins, and birds move within the colony and possibly to other colonies, ii) harsh environmental conditions cause a die-off of chicks in the colony or of adults elsewhere, iii) the adults skip a year of breeding if pre-breeding foraging is inadequate and iv) if sea ice conditions are unsatisfactory at autumn arrival of the adults, they skip breeding or go elsewhere. Such variability indicates that birds at all Ross Sea colonies should be counted annually if there is to be any possibility of understanding the causes of population changes.																	0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	2017	29	3					201	208		10.1017/S0954102016000559								WOS:000404282500002

This study extracted coastlines of Qinghai Lake and surrounding lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from multitemporal remote sensing data from 1973 to 2015. The geomorphological processes and the reasons for area and coastline variations were then analyzed. The results showed that: the changes of the total lake area were divided into three stages: the stable decrease stage (1973-1988), the fluctuant decrease stage (1988-2005), and the rapidly increase stage (2005-2015). The changes of Qinghai Lake area and Gahai Lake area showed a similar trend as the total lake area. The Erhai Lake area fluctuated from 1973 to 2004 and then increased from 2004 to 2015. Haiyanwan Lake was isolated from Qinghai Lake in 2003 and was linked into Qinghai Lake in 2006, again. The lakes area variations, excluding Erhai Lake and Shadao Lake, were positively correlated with the variation of the Qinghai Lake level, and estuary area variations were significantly negatively correlated to the lake level, indicating that the higher lake level led to more land being submerged. The evolutionary processes of lakes in the Shadao Region were influenced by aeolian sand and lake water balance experiencing relatively low precipitation and strong evaporation. Erhai Lake was also influenced by river runoff from Daotang River. Sediment loads from rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, except for Buha River, were relative low and only slightly influenced the estuary. Aeolian sand transported by the lake waves and currents from west coast to east coast will form subaqueous barriers, the Shadao Region land area will increase slowly, and the coastline of the Shadao Region will extend towards the lake. Therefore, the diameter of Qinghai Lake from the west to east coast will become shorter, while the diameter from the south to north coast will become longer in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Multi-residue analysis of 36 priority and emerging pollutants in marine echinoderms (Holothuria tubulosa) and marine sediments by solid-liquid extraction followed by dispersive solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis	TALANTA												Marine echinoderms are filter-feeding invertebrates widely distributed along the coasts, and which are therefore extensively exposed to anthropogenic xenobiotics. They can serve as good sentinels for monitoring a large variety of contaminants in marine ecosystems. In this context, a multi-residue analytical method has been validated and applied to Holothuria tubulosa specimens and marine sediments for the determination of 36 organic compounds, which belong to some of the most problematic groups of emerging and priority pollutants (perfluoroalkyl compounds, estrogens, parabens, benzophenones, plasticizers, surfactants, brominated flame retardants and alkylphenols). Lyophilization of samples prior to solvent extraction and clean-up of extracts with C18, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, is proposed. A Box-Behnken design was used for optimization of the most influential variables affecting the extraction and clean-up steps. For validation, matrix-matched calibration and recovery assay were applied. Linearity (% r(2)) higher than 99%, recoveries between 80% and 114% (except in LAS and NP1EO), RSD (precision) lower than 15% and limits of quantification between 0.03 and 12.5 ng g(-1) dry weight (d.w.) were achieved. The method was applied to nine samples of Holothuria collected along the coast of Granada (Spain), and to marine sediments around the animals. The results demonstrated high bioaccumulation of certain pollutants. A total of 25 out of the 36 studied compounds were quantified, being surfactants, alkylphenols, perfluoroalkyl compounds, triclocarban and parabens the most frequently detected. Nonylphenol was found in the highest concentration (340 and 323 ng g(-1) d.w. in sediment and Holothuria samples, respectively).

Non-native molluscan colonizers on deliberately placed shipwrecks in the Florida Keys, with description of a new species of potentially invasive worm-snail (Gastropoda: Vermetidae)	PEERJ												Artificial reefs created by deliberately sinking ships off the coast of the Florida Keys island chain are providing new habitat for marine invertebrates. This newly developing fouling community includes the previously reported invasive orange tube coral Tubastraea coccinea and the non-native giant foam oyster Hyotissa hyotis. New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper, middle, and lower Florida Keys, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi, the latter also common in the natural reef areas, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile, suspension-feeding, worm-snail, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler, Rawlings & Collins n. sp. (Vermetidae), is described from the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg off Key West and discussed as potentially invasive. This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and, as such, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species. Ongoing monitoring of the developing molluscan fauna on the artificial reefs of the Florida Keys is necessary to recognize new invasions and identify potential eradication targets, thereby assuring the health of the nearby natural barrier reef.																	2167-8359					APR 5	2017	5								e3158	10.7717/peerj.3158								WOS:000398662500004	28392984

A broad continental shelf, extensive flood flats and higher plateaus, formed in older sedimentary rocks, characterize this coast. Coastal environments are naturally vulnerable to morphodynamic processes, such as erosion and sediment deposition, and this condition intensifies in wet tropical conditions. This study presents an approach for morphological mapping and change detection in coastal zone, based on C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), in areas with intense coastal dynamics and systematic cloud cover. The method is based on the amplitude SAR processing chain for a temporal profile of ERS-1/2, ENVISAT and SENTINEL-1A data, acquired between 1992 and 2015 and provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). The backscattering coefficient primary information, as well as auxiliary data extracted from the Haralick texture and shape indices were used to describe coastal environments. The total area of coastal changes detected between 1992 and 2015 was 646.15 km(2).year(-1), with erosive sedimentary balance in -2.32 km(2) under the rate of -0,10 km(2).year(-1). The time profile of coastal changes is in equilibrium and presented an erosive condition in the period from 1992 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1999, while in the period from 1993 to 2006 and 2006 to 2015 the accretion condition occurred. The accuracy of the maps of environments and coastal changes, respectively obtained an overall accuracy of 78.35% and 48.54%, and Kappa coeffi cient of 0.65 and 0.32. The ERS, ENVISAT and SENTINEL data allowed a satisfactory mapping of the morphological changes in the flat and dynamic relief of the Amazonian coast due to the availability of a historical series of C-band SAR images with parallel vertical polarization and steeper to shallow incidence. Such application was essential for the systematic monitoring of the shoreline on a regional spatial scale (1: 250,000) and eventual temporal scale (annual to decadal).																	1519-1540	2236-5664				APR-JUN	2017	18	2					257	278		10.20502/rbg.v18i2.998								WOS:000411512900002

This algorithm, named the cycling MPPT algorithm, is compared to a perturb and observe algorithm described in numerous literature. Both algorithms were initially tested during 2012 ocean tests of the half-scale prototype Wave Energy Technology - New Zealand (WET-NZ) WEC off the Oregon coast. During these sea trials the perturb and observe algorithm failed to provide effective control of the WET-NZ, while the cycling algorithm was observed to give effective control. More complete investigations were later carried out using MATLAB-Simulink simulations of an autonomous WEC (AWEC) being developed at Oregon State University. The results of the AWEC simulations also showed the cycling algorithm provided better control than the perturb and observe algorithm. The operation of the cycling algorithm was fully characterized during the AWEC simulations and these results are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In feathers and blood of four gull species: herring gull (Larus argentatus), common gull (Larus canus), black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and great black-backed gull (Larus marinus), concentration of total mercury (Hg-T) was assayed, taking into account the type of feathers, sex, and age. Stable isotopes (delta N-15, delta C-13) were used as tracers of trophic position in the food web. In the study, feathers and blood were compared as non-invasive indicators of alimentary exposure introducing mercury into the system. In order to do that, the correlations between mercury concentrations in the blood, feathers, and the birds' internal tissues were examined. The strongest relations were observed in the liver for each species R-Common Gull(2) = 0.94, p = 0.001; R-Black-headed Gull(2) = 0.89, p = 0.001; RGreat Black-backed (2)(Gull) = 0.53, p = 0.001; R-Herring Gull(2) = 0.78, p = 0.001. While no correlation was found with feathers, only developing feathers of juvenile herring gulls were found to be a good indicator immediate of exposure through food (R-muscle(2) = 0.71, p = 0.001; R-kidneys(2) = 0.73, p = 0.001; R-heart(2) = 0.89, p = 0.001; R-lungs(2) = 0.86, p= 0.001; R-brain(2) = 0.83, p = 0.001). Additionally, based on studies of herring gull primary feathers, decrease of mercury concentration in the diet of birds over the last two decades is also discussed.

J	Philpott, SM; Bichier, P				Philpott, Stacy M.; Bichier, Peter			Local and landscape drivers of predation services in urban gardens	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In agroecosystems, local and landscape features, as well as natural enemy abundance and richness, are significant predictors of predation services that may result in biological control of pests. Despite the increasing importance of urban gardening for provisioning of food to urban populations, most urban gardeners suffer from high pest problems, and have little knowledge about how to manage their plots to increase biological control services. We examined the influence of local, garden scale (i.e., herbaceous and arboreal vegetation abundance and diversity, ground cover) and landscape (i.e., landscape diversity and surrounding land use types) characteristics on predation services provided by naturally occurring predators in 19 urban gardens in the California central coast. We introduced sentinel pests (moth eggs and larvae and pea aphids) onto greenhouse-raised plants taken to gardens and assigned to open or bagged (predator exclosure) treatments. We found high predation rates with between 40% and 90% of prey items removed in open treatments. Predation services varied with local and landscape factors, but significant predictors differed by prey species. Predation of eggs and aphids increased with vegetation complexity in gardens, but larvae predation declined with vegetation complexity. Smaller gardens experienced higher predation services, likely due to increases in predator abundance in smaller gardens. Several ground cover features influenced predation services. In contrast to patterns in rural agricultural landscapes, predation on aphids declined with increases in landscape diversity. In sum, we report the relationships between several local management factors, as well as landscape surroundings, and implications for garden management.

In the south of France, sporadic cases are frequently described and the virus is endemic in Italy with frequent cases and outbreaks. The aim of this study was to identify a possible WNV circulation in Corsica (French island in the Mediterranean Sea) in sheep, horses, and dogs as sentinel animals for the virus surveillance. In 2014, 386 blood samples were collected from 219 sheep, 96 horses, and 71 dogs, in 12 localities in Corsica, in the oriental coast of Corsica. Each sample was systematically tested for WNV immunoglobulin G using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) with inactivated WNV as antigen. The result of the ELISA for the WNV antibody test on the sheep sera was all negative, whereas 9 of 96 horses (9.4%) and 6 of 71 dogs (8.4%) presented WNV antibodies. All the positive samples from horses and dogs were confirmed by serum neutralization test. Although no clinical case in humans and horses was reported to date, this report highlights the necessity to improve WNV surveillance in animals and humans, as well as in blood donors in Corsica.																	1530-3667	1557-7759				APR	2017	17	4					275	277		10.1089/vbz.2016.2024								WOS:000397584900010	28075236

A Production Calendar Based on Water Temperature, Spat Size, and Husbandry Practices Reduce OsHV-1 mu var Impact on Cultured Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas in the Ebro Delta (Catalonia), Mediterranean Coast of Spain	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												Since 2006, the production of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in the Ebro Delta area has dramatically declined from around 800 metric tons (MT) per year to 138 MT in 2011. This decline in production has had a significant socio-economic impact in a region where the shellfish sector is a traditional economic activity for many families. The identified agent responsible for this reduction in C. gigas production was Ostreid Herpesvirus microvar (OsHV-1 mu var), which has been associated with C. gigas spat mortalities in France, and in many other countries. In Spain the episodes of mortality became critical for the regional shellfish production between 2008 until 2014, with mortality percentage up to 100%. In this study, local hatchery C. gigas spat was used as sentinel animals for epidemiological studies and management tests carried out with the aim of reducing oyster mortality in the Ebro Delta area. A production calendar mainly based on water temperature dynamics was designed around an optimal schedule for spat immersion. The immersion calendar included two optimal periods for spat immersion, in summer when temperatures are >= 25 degrees C and at the end of autumn and beginning of winter when they are <= 13 degrees C. Such production planning has reduced mortalities from 80% (in 2014 and previous years) to 2-7.5% in 2015 in cemented oysters. Furthermore, other recommendations related to spat immersion size, culture density and methodology, and cementing calendar, which helped to achieve the results presented, were also recorded and transferred to local producers. This work presents a successfully tested management strategy reducing OsHV-1 mu var impact by designing new field management practices mainly focused on the handling and timing of spat immersion. This approach could be used as a management model in areas presenting similar production practices and environmental characteristics.

This led to restrictions on abalone harvesting and triggered continued PST monitoring by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC-FLD) of abalone and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), and concurrent phytoplankton monitoring, between 2011 and 2013. PST up to 2437 lig STX mu q kg(-1) (three times the bivalve regulatory limit) were confirmed in abalone viscera, with toxicity up to 586 pg STX mu q kg(-1) in the muscular foot (mainly doSTX and minor proportions of SIX and doSTX). Mussels accumulated PST at a faster rate than abalone which suggests they can serve as sentinels of PST accumulation to inform abalone risk management protocols. Three lines of evidence for G. catenatum as the source of PST in abalone were established: (1) PST in abalone tissues increased and declined in association with dinoflagellate blooms; (2) G. catenatum DNA was detected by real-time PCR in abalone digestive tracts; and (3) the PST analogues (toxin profile) observed in both abalone viscera and mussels were similar suggesting a common PST source. This is the first time a conclusive linkage between the occurrence of PST in abalone and a dinoflagellate source has been demonstrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Williamson, A; Newman, A; Cummins, P				Williamson, Amy; Newman, Andrew; Cummins, Phil			Reconstruction of coseismic slip from the 2015 Illapel earthquake using combined geodetic and tsunami waveform data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												On 16 September 2015, a moment magnitude (M-w) 8.3 earthquake struck off the coast of central Chile, generating a large tsunami with nearby coastal wave heights observed on tide gauges in Chile and Peru of up to 4.7m and distal observations of over 40cm in the Kuril Islands across the Pacific Ocean. Through a transcoastal geodetic study, including tsunami time series recorded at open ocean pressure gauges, subaerial deformation observed through interferometric synthetic aperture radar from the Sentinel-1 A satellite and continuous GPS, we identify the location and extent of coseismic slip. We find that most coseismic slip was concentrated in a patch immediately offshore, with little modeled slip near the trench. This result satisfies the tsunami waveforms measured in the deep ocean north of the rupture area, with wave heights up to 10cm. While the event exhibits some features of a slow tsunami earthquake (moderately large tsunami and possible slow second-stage rupture), our inversion results do not require substantial near-trench rupture. However, the prevalence of large and shallow thrust along subduction megathrusts along central Chile raises the question of the likelihood of future such events and the implications for future hazardous tsunamigenic earthquakes.																	2169-9313	2169-9356				MAR	2017	122	3					2119	2130		10.1002/2016JB013883								WOS:000399660300031

Long-term 2007-2013 monitoring of reproductive disturbance in the dun sentinel Assiminea grayana with regard to polymeric materials pollution at the coast of Lower Saxony, North Sea, Germany	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												During biological effect monitoring studies of endocrine active compounds with the snail Assiminea grayana in 2007-2013, reproductive disorders including atresia, transformation of capsule/albumen glands into prostates in females and ovotestis, transformation of prostates to capsule/albumen glands, disruption of spermatogenesis, and calcification of tubules in males, were encountered in several years. The search of sources of endocrine active substances was first directed to antifouling biocides from paint particles and extended to leaching compounds from polymeric materials. In contrast to the reference sites, most of the observed disorders occurred at a station near harbors and dockyards polluted with residues from antifouling paints and polymeric materials. Beside of investigations about the potential ingestion of polymer particles by the snails, further investigations of compounds of polymeric materials with endocrine potential should follow.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3352	3362		10.1007/s11356-016-8058-2								WOS:000397004600011	27864739

Harbor porpoises Phocoena phocoena have a coastal distribution, and stranded animals function as sentinels for population and ecosystem health. The goal of this retrospective study was to join datasets from the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific coasts of Canada to investigate causes of morbidity and mortality in this species. A total of 241 necropsy records were reviewed including 147 (61%) from the Pacific region and 94 (39%) from the Atlantic region from 1988 to 2011. A cause of death could be determined with confidence in 118 (49%) of these cases. Of these 118 cases, the leading cause of mortality for both regions, together and separately, was infectious disease. In the Pacific region, this was followed by traumatic and anthropogenic causes, whereas in the Atlantic region, it was followed by emaciation/starvation, mortality of dependent calves, and anthropogenic causes. Pathogens of potential zoonotic significance or indicative of environmental contamination, e.g. Salmonella sp. and Cryptococcus gattii, were identified. Numerous parasitic species were observed within the lungs, liver, stomach, middle ear, and subcutaneous tissues, although they were usually interpreted as incidental findings. Anthropogenic causes may be underrepresented as they are notoriously difficult to diagnose with certainty, thereby making up a proportion of the `unknown causes of death' (51%) category. Improved standardization of data collection and documentation is required to better understand harbor porpoise and ecosystem health.																	0177-5103	1616-1580				JAN 24	2017	122	3					171	183		10.3354/dao03080								WOS:000395422600001	28117296

While matchups are usually good in open ocean waters, significant discrepancies are observed in coastal areas which are primarily due to the more complex atmospheres near the coast and therefore less accurate atmospheric correction. Satellite-derived water leaving radiances are determined by applying atmospheric correction procedures which include assumptions about the characteristics of atmospheric aerosols. At sea level, SeaPRISM makes direct measurements of nLw from the ocean, as well as observations of sky from which aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness, single scattering albedo, fraction of fine and coarse aerosols, and others are determined. Using NASA SeaDAS software for OC satellite data processing, characteristics of aerosols in atmospheric correction models for VIIRS sensor are explicitly retrieved and compared with the ones from AERONET-OC data, primarily in terms of aerosol optical depth (AOD), thus characterizing the validity of the aerosol models and evaluating possible errors and reasons for discrepancies. Comparisons are presented for the coastal site at CCNY's Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory (LISCO) and a less coastal WaveCIS Gulf of Mexico' AERONET-OC site with variable water and atmospheric conditions.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104220H	10.1117/12.2279150								WOS:000418795400011

The species is exposed to different threats and is considered an environmental sentinel that indicates variation among, and the severity of hazards to marine ecosystems. This study aimed to describe both anthropogenic impacts, and infectious and parasitic diseases in C. mydas - including cases along the Brazilian coast - and implications for conservation. Bycatch is reported as the main threat to the conservation of this species, followed by debris ingestion, collisions with boats, dredging, and chronic environmental contamination. All of these impacts may directly or indirectly cause death, by facilitating contact with pathological agents and by increasing vulnerability to secondary diseases. The pathological agents associated with lesions include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths. Fibropapillomatosis is an example of a chronic disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral tumors that affects mostly juvenile C. mydas worldwide and is associated with the Chelonid herpesvirus 5. The bacterias Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Pseudomonas fluorescens are found in the aquatic environment and among C. mydas lesions in various organs. Trematode adults and eggs of the family Spirorchiidae are also frequent in systemic cardiovascular diseases of C. mydas. The direct impacts of anthropogenic activities and diseases are synergistic and may affect the specie's health and conservation. Therefore, the monitoring and systematic diagnosing of diseases and causes of death - including necropsy, histopathology, and molecular exams - are necessary to assess a population's health, to support appropriate decisions of coastal management and to target future research topics that optimize C. mydas conservation.

Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal ((w)) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. (w) relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7%. Despite some inaccuracies in (w) retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries' monitoring networks provided satisfactory results. The multi-sensor approach together with the multi-conditional algorithm presented here can be applied to the latest generation of ocean color sensors (namely Sentinel2/MSI and Sentinel3/OLCI) to study SPM dynamics in the coastal ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

The reference quantity for performance assessment is in situ total chlorophyll a (TChl a) concentration estimated through a phytoplankton absorption coefficient (i.e. equivalent to API2). Additional comparison of data products has also been addressed for TChl a concentration determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The MERIS matchup analysis revealed a systematic underestimation of TChl a, which was confirmed with an independent comparison of product map analysis. The study demonstrates the importance of regional algorithms for the study area that could complement upcoming standard results of the current Sentinel-3/OLCI space mission.

Research Contributing to Improvements in Controlling Florida's Mosquitoes and Mosquito-Borne Diseases	INSECTS												Research on mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases has contributed to improvements in providing effective, efficient, and environmentally proper mosquito control. Florida has benefitted from several research accomplishments that have increased the state's mosquito control capabilities. Research with Florida's mosquitoes has resulted in the development of ecologically sound management of mosquito impoundments on Florida's east coast. This strategy, called Rotational Impoundment Management (RIM), has improved the ability to target the delivery of pesticides and has helped to reduce non-target effects and environmental damage. Research has led to the development of an arbovirus surveillance system which includes sentinel chicken surveillance, real time use of environmental contributing factors like meteorology and hydrology to target mosquito control, as well as public health efforts to mitigate disease outbreaks to areas with risk of disease. These research driven improvements have provided substantial benefits to all of Florida. More research is needed to meet the future challenges to reduce emerging pathogens like Zika virus and the consequences of environmental changes like global climate change that are likely to influence the effects of mosquito-borne pathogens on human health and well-being.																	2075-4450					DEC	2016	7	4							50	10.3390/insects7040050								WOS:000392274800004

Histological examination of tissues from a stranded Florida manatee Trichechus manatus latirostris revealed protozoal cysts in the cerebrum and intrahistiocytic tachyzoites in the liver and caudal mesenteric lymph node. Disseminated Toxoplasma gondii infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region of formalin-fixed tissues. The lack of baseline information on Florida manatees' exposure to this pathogen prompted a study into the seroprevalence of T. gondii in 2 separate geographic habitats in Florida, USA, during the winters from 2011-2014. Serum was collected during routine health assessments of 44 apparently healthy manatees from Crystal River (n = 26) on the west central coast of Florida and Brevard County (n = 18) on the east coast of Florida. Serum was screened for detection of T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies via the modified agglutination test. Two animals from Crystal River from 2011 and 2012 (7.7%) and one animal from Brevard County from 2011 (5.6%) tested positive for T. gondii antibodies. Overall seroprevalence for T. gondii was low in the 2 sampled populations and may reflect a low seroprevalence or animal susceptibility. However, continued monitoring of this pathogen in aquatic ecosystems is warranted due to both possible anthropogenic sources and zoonotic potential.

Funded as part of NASA's Earth Venture program, HS3 conducted 5-week campaigns during the hurricane seasons of 2012-14 using the NASA Global Hawk aircraft, along with a second Global Hawk in 2013 and a WB-57f aircraft in 2014. Flying from a base at Wallops Island, Virginia, the Global Hawk could be on station over storms for up to 18 h off the East Coast of the United States and up to about 6 h off the western coast of Africa. Over the 3 years, HS3 flew 21 missions over nine named storms, along with flights over two nondeveloping systems and several Saharan air layer (SAL) outbreaks. This article summarizes the HS3 experiment, the missions flown, and some preliminary findings related to the rapid intensification and outflow structure of Hurricane Edouard (2014) and the interaction of Hurricane Nadine (2012) with the SAL.

This innovative mode is capable of successfully tracking the backscatter signal over rapidly varying terrains, and thus it overcomes one of the limitations of the closed-loop Poseidon-2 tracker on board Jason-1. DIODE/DEM achieves this improvement thanks to a predetermined DEM on board that, when combined with DIODE orbit ephemeris, provides improved acquisition timing and reduced data loss in the coastal zone. As a further enhancement, Jason-3 and the Sentinel-3 programs will be capable of autonomously switching to this innovative mode in selected regions. To help recommend how these missions should utilize DIODE/DEM, the authors studied the impact of the tracker mode on the accuracy and precision of wave heights and wind speed, the continuity of the sea level climate data record, and the coverage in coastal regions. The results show close agreement between the open-and closed-loop trackermodes over the open ocean with the exception of some differences at high-tidal variability areas, the coastal zone, and sea ice regions. The DIODE/DEM tracker shows better performance than the closed-loop tracker mode at the coast and in the presence of sea ice. Jason-2, when operating in open-loop mode, allows for an approximately 5% increase of successful acquisitions at the ocean-to-land transition. However, open-loop tracking exhibits more variability in regions of high tides than closed-loop.

In this study, samples from 589 marine mammal species and 34 European otters (Lutra lutra), stranded on the coasts of Scotland, Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Germany, were tested for the presence of T. gondii. Brain samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of parasite DNA. Blood and muscle fluid samples were tested for specific antibodies using a modified agglutination test (MAT), a commercial multi-species enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Out of 193 animals tested by PCR, only two harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) cerebrum samples, obtained from animals stranded on the Dutch coast, tested positive. The serological results showed a wide variation depending on the test used. Using a cut-off value of 1/40 dilution in MAT, 141 out of 292 animals (41%) were positive. Using IFA, 30 out of 244 tested samples (12%) were positive at a 1/50 dilution. The commercial ELISA yielded 7% positives with a cut-off of the sample-to-positive (SAP) ratio > 50; and 12% when the cut-off was set at SAP ratio > 20. The high number of positives in MAT may be an overestimation due to the high degree of haemolysis of the samples and/or the presence of lipids. The ELISA results could be an underestimation due to the use of a multispecies conjugate. Our results confirm the presence of T. gondii in marine mammals in The Netherlands and show exposure to the parasite in both the North Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. We also highlight the limitations of the tests used to diagnose T. gondii in stranded marine mammals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report the emergence of this parasite in grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the Baltic Sea. One hundred eighty-three of 1 554 grey seals (11.9%) examined from 2002-2013 had detectable hepatobiliary trematode infection. Parasite identification was confirmed as P. truncatum by sequencing the ITS2 region of a pool of five to 10 trematodes from each of ten seals collected off the coast of seven different Swedish counties. The proportion of seals parasitized by P. truncatum increased significantly over time and with increasing age of seals. Males were 3.1 times more likely to be parasitized than females and animals killed in fishery interactions were less likely to be parasitized than animals found dead or hunted. There was no significant difference in parasitism of seals examined from the Gulf of Bothnia versus those examined from the Baltic Proper. Although the majority of infections were mild, P. truncatum can cause severe hepatobiliary disease and resulted in liver failure in at least one seal. Because cyprinid fish are the second intermediate host for opisthorchiid trematodes, diets of grey seals from the Baltic Sea were analysed regarding presence of cyprinids. The proportion of gastrointestinal tracts containing cyprinid remains was ten times higher in seals examined from 2008 to 2013 (12.2%) than those examined from 2002 to 2007 (1.2%) and coincided with a general increase of trematode parasitism in the host population. The emergence and relatively common occurrence of P. truncatum in grey seals signals the presence of this parasite in the Baltic Sea ecosystem and demonstrates how aquatic mammals can serve as excellent sentinels of marine ecosystem change. Investigation of drivers behind P. truncatum emergence and infection risk for other mammals, including humans, is highly warranted.

For intensive tests we applied the algorithm to the total ozone columns and cloud data of the satellite instruments GOME, SCIA-MACHY, OMI, GOME-2A and GOME-2B. Thereby a time series of 20 years (1995-2015) of tropospheric column ozone was generated. To have a consistent total ozone data set for all sensors, one common retrieval algorithm, namely GOD-FITv3, was applied and the L1 reflectances were also soft calibrated. The total ozone columns and the cloud data were input into the tropospheric ozone retrieval. However, the tropical tropospheric column ozone (TCO) for the individual instruments still showed small differences and, therefore, we harmonised the data set. For this purpose, a multilinear function was fitted to the averaged difference between SCIA-MACHY's TCO and those from the other sensors. The original TCO was corrected by the fitted offset. GOME-2B data were corrected relative to the harmonised data from OMI and GOME-2A. The harmonisation leads to a better agreement between the different instruments. Also, a direct comparison of the TCO in the overlapping periods proves that GOME-2A agrees much better with SCIAMACHY after the harmonisation. The improvements for OMI were small. Based on the harmonised observations, we created a merged data product, containing the TCO from July 1995 to December 2015. A first application of this 20-year record is a trend analysis. The tropical trend is 0.7 +/- 0.12 DU decade(-1). Regionally the trends reach up to 1.8 DU decade(-1) like on the African Atlantic coast, while over the western Pacific the tropospheric ozone declined over the last 20 years with up to 0.8 DU decade(-1). The tropical tropospheric data record will be extended in the future with the TROPOMI/S5P data, where the TCO is part of the operational products.																	1867-1381	1867-8548				OCT 13	2016	9	10					5037	5051		10.5194/amt-9-5037-2016								WOS:000385408500001

The event triggered widespread environmental effects at the south and western part of the island while, the intensity and severity of these earthquake-induced deformations is substantially decreased towards the eastern part of the island. Relocation of seismicity and inversion of geophysical (GPS, InSAR) data indicate that the seismic fault runs parallel to the west coast of Lefkada, along the Aegean Apulia plate boundary. The fault plane strikes N20 +/- 5 degrees E and dips to east with an angle of about 70 +/- 5 degrees. Coseismic deformation was measured in the order of tens of centimeters of horizontal motion by continuous GPS stations of NOANET (the NOA GPS network) and by InSAR (Sentinel 1 A image pairs). A coseismic uniform-slip model was produced from inversion of InSAR data and permanent GPS stations. The earthquake measured Mw = 6.5 using both the geodetic moment produced by the slip model, as well as the PGD relation of Melgar et al. (2015, GRL). In the field we observed no significant vertical motion of the shoreline or surface expression of faulting, this is consistent with the predictions of the model. The interferograms show a large decorrelation area that extends almost along all the western coast of Lefkada. This area correlates well with the mapped landslides. The 2003-2015 pattern of seismicity in the Ionian Sea region indicates the existence of a 15-km seismic gap offshore NW Cephalonia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rondeau-Genesse, G; Trudel, M; Leconte, R				Rondeau-Genesse, Gabriel; Trudel, Melanie; Leconte, Robert			Monitoring snow wetness in an Alpine Basin using combined C-band SAR and MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

The study considered the seismogenic zones as sources of potential earthquakes for the area, the Italian accelerometric network as the recording network for seismic event occurrence, and the performances of the software platform PRESTo (Plus) for data analysis and processing. We analyze the distribution of lead-times for all possible threatening seismic sources for each municipality in the region under study by extracting the lead-time value corresponding to the 5th, 10th and 25th percentiles of the distributions. We discuss the results for the 5th percentile in order to analyze the worst-case scenario: in the case of a single site, the lead-time is expected to be larger than this value in the 95 % of the cases. Since the population distribution in Campania is uneven and most of the people live nearby the coast, whilst the most destructive earthquakes occur along the Apennine chain, we can conclude that an efficient EEWS can allow most of the schools in the area to undertake some mitigating actions. The testing of the EEWS was carried out in the high school ITIS 'E. Majorana', located at Somma Vesuviana, about 80 km from the seismogenic Irpinia region. For this purpose, the Sentinel, an actuator made up of low-cost hardware (i.e., Arduino(A (R))), was developed in close cooperation with students and teachers of the school to receive alert messages from the PRESTo (Plus) platform and warn the school users in case of a seismic event. The EEWS and the Sentinel were successfully tested during some blind drills performed during normal school activities.				zollo, aldo/B-5344-2010; Picozzi, Matteo/B-1015-2015; Emolo, Antonio/E-3124-2010; Festa, Gaetano/F-8525-2010	zollo, aldo/0000-0002-8191-9566; Picozzi, Matteo/0000-0001-8078-9416; Emolo, Antonio/0000-0001-8390-4168; Festa, Gaetano/0000-0002-2588-8160												1570-761X	1573-1456				SEP	2016	14	9					2513	2529		10.1007/s10518-016-9865-z								WOS:000381152400006						
J	Marino, A; Dierking, W; Wesche, C				Marino, Armando; Dierking, Wolfgang; Wesche, Christine			A Depolarization Ratio Anomaly Detector to Identify Icebergs in Sea Ice Using Dual-Polarization SAR Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Icebergs represent hazards to maritime traffic and offshore operations. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is very valuable for the observation of polar regions, and extensive work was already carried out on detection and tracking of large icebergs. However, the identification of small icebergs is still challenging especially when these are embedded in sea ice. In this paper, a new detector is proposed based on incoherent dual-polarization SAR images. The algorithm considers the limited extension of small icebergs, which are supposed to have a stronger cross-polarization and higher cross-over copolarization ratio compared to the surrounding sea or sea ice background. The new detector is tested with two satellite systems. First, RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric images are analyzed to evaluate the effects of high-resolution data. Subsequently, a more exhaustive analysis is carried out using dual-polarization ground-detected Sentinel-1a extra wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test areas are in the east coast of Greenland, where several icebergs have been observed. A quantitative analysis and a comparison with a detector using only the cross-polarization channel are carried out, exploiting grounded icebergs as test targets. The proposed methodology improves the contrast between icebergs and sea ice clutter by up to 75 times. This returns an improved probability of detection.

Clams in the spilled sites displayed unusually high proportion of granulocytes, which may result in higher phagocytosis capacity and reactive oxygen species production. Hemocytes in clams from the polluted sites also displayed less DNA damage and mortality than in the control site, possibly due to a faster phagocytosis of the impaired cells. Glycogen, the major energetic reserve, was depleted in clams from the spilled sites, potentially due to energetic consumption for maintenance of a large pool of granulocytes, detoxification processes and oxidative stress. Modified hemocyte parameters in clams in the spilled area, may reflect sub-lethal physiological stresses caused by the residual oils in the sediment, in conjunction with environmental modifications such as food availability and pathogens pattern.

J	Filipkowska, A; Lubecki, L				Filipkowska, Anna; Lubecki, Ludwik			Endocrine disruptors in blue mussels and sediments from the Gulf of GdaA"sk (Southern Baltic)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Samples of blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus) and sediment were collected in the Gulf of GdaA"sk (Southern Baltic Sea) to assess the extent of their contamination with two groups of endocrine disruptors: 4-nonylphenols and organotins (butyl- and phenyltins). Five sampling stations were chosen along the coastline of the Tricity Agglomeration (GdaA"sk, Sopot, Gdynia) in 2008, 2012, and 2013. No evident differences between the three campaigns were found in either the mussel or the sediment samples. The mussels were moderately contaminated with 4-nonylphenols (30-111 ng g(-1) d.w.), whereas the levels of these compounds in the sediment samples were very low (0.8-2.7 ng g(-1) d.w.). Total concentrations of butyltin compounds in the mussels and sediments ranged between 41 and 164 ng Sn g(-1) d.w., and from below the limit of detection to 22 ng Sn g(-1) d.w., respectively, whereas phenyltins were not detected in any of the samples. Butyltin degradation indices indicate an old tributyltin input into the coastal environment, which is characterized by intense maritime activity. The results obtained from this work demonstrate that 5 years after the total ban on using organotin-based antifouling paints was imposed, butyltins are still present in mussels and sediments of the Gulf of GdaA"sk.

Seroprevalence of Toscana virus in dogs from Corsica, France	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Toscana virus (TOSV) is an arbovirus belonging to the Bunyaviridae, a family of negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected female sand fly of the genus Phlebotomus. Infections are usually asymptomatic but the virus is known to cause aseptic meningitis and/or meningo-encephalitis in the Mediterranean countries. Dogs are good sentinels for detection of viral circulation and are more easily accessible than wild animals. Findings: In 2013 and 2014, we collected sera from 231 adult dogs living in 26 counties in two departments in Corsica, a French island in the Mediterranean. The virus microneutralization-based seroprevalence assay revealed a seropositivity of 3.9 % dogs on the eastern coast of Corsica. Conclusions: Our study confirms the circulation of TOSV in Corsica. Accordingly, in geographical areas where dogs possess TOSV neutralizing antibodies, direct and indirect TOSV diagnosis should be implemented in patients presenting with febrile illnesses and central nervous system infections such as meningitis and encephalitis.																	1756-3305					JUL 1	2016	9								381	10.1186/s13071-016-1665-4								WOS:000378839000002	27368162

In the present study, we evaluated the level of contamination of the invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans, all around the island. Concentrations of chlordecone varied from 3 to 144 mu g.kg(-1) wet weight. The highest concentrations were recorded when samples were captured in the marine zones located downstream of the previous banana plantations. This contamination seemed to decrease rapidly with the distance from the coast. Mean concentration of chlordecone in Pterois volitans was higher than that of five other fish species collected in similar sites. Due to its position at the top of the trophic web, lion fish was affected by bioaccumulation of chlordecone and can be used as a sentinel species to assess and control the level of contamination of the marine environment by chlordecone.

The SAR-derived wind fields have been obtained analyzing images of the COSMO-SkyMed, Radarsat-2, and Sentinel-1A satellites through a fully two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform (2-D-CWT) method. The analysis of the wind directions has shown that the model variability is limited if compared to that inferred by 2-D-CWT method, which mostly respects the variability evidenced by in situ data. As the use of model directions to compute the SAR wind fields is a standard in many studies, the impact on the SAR wind speed retrieval of using the model instead of the SAR-derived directions has been assessed: differences of wind speed greater than +/- 10% occur for about the 20% of data. The spatial variability of the SAR and model wind speed fields results quite different at both local and domain scales. The knowledge of the spatial variations of the surface wind fields can be very important for the oceanographic applications and constitutes the added value brought by SAR in the description of the coastal wind.

Standard API1 data are those delivered by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) orbiting sensor. Equivalent quantities are computed by applying a regional inversion scheme using as input both MERIS and in situ remote sensing reflectances (R-rs). Reference data for the development of the regional algorithm and for the analysis of tested products include field measurements of total concentration of chlorophyll a (TChla) and coincident R-rs values collected at different distances from the coast. Validation results, based on matchup analysis, identifies a systematic overestimation of standard API1 versus the reference TChla values. The additional comparison of product maps in selected regions of interest confirms this tendency and demonstrates the feasibility and relevance of using regional algorithms for investigating spaceborne products. Analogous applications are hence devised for the early-stage evaluation of the forthcoming Sentinel-3/OLCI data products.

To meet the requirement of very high co-registration precision, an improved spectral diversity method was proposed to correct the co-registration slope error in the azimuth direction induced by multiple Sentinel-1A TOPS data frames. All phase jumps that appear in the conventional processing method have been corrected after applying the proposed method. The 2D deformation fields in the east-west and vertical directions are also resolved by combing D-InSAR and Offset Tracking measurements. The results reveal that the east-west component dominated the 2D displacement, where up to 2 m displacement towards the west was measured in the coastal area. Vertical deformations ranging between -0.25 and 0.25 m were found. The 2D displacements imply the collision of the Nazca plate squeezed the coast, which shows good accordance with the geological background of the region.

Here, we perform coseismic slip fault modeling based on multi-orbit Sentinel 1-A (S1A) data. To do this, we generate ascending and descending S1A interferograms, whose combination allows us to retrieve the EW and vertical components of deformation. In particular, the EW displacement map highlights a westward displacement of about 210 cm, while the vertical map shows an uplift of about 25 cm along the coast, surrounded by a subsidence of about 20 cm. Following this analysis, we jointly invert the multi-orbit S1A interferograms by using an analytical approach to search for the coseismic fault parameters and related slip values. Most of the slip occurs northwest of the epicenter, with a maximum located in the shallowest 20 km. Finally, we refine our modeling approach by exploiting the Finite Element method, which allows us to take geological and structural complexities into account to simulate the slip along the slab curvature, the von Mises stress distribution, and the principal stress axes orientation. The von Mises stress distribution shows a close similarity to the depth distribution of the aftershock hypocenters. Likewise, the maximum principal stress orientation highlights a compressive regime in correspondence of the deeper portion of the slab and an extensional regime at its shallower segment; these findings are supported by seismological data.

Toward predicting Dinophysis blooms off NW Iberia: A decade of events	HARMFUL ALGAE												Dinophysis acuminata and Dinophysis acuta are recurrent species off NW Iberia but their outbreaks occur under different conditions. A decade (2004-2013) of weekly data for each species at two sentinel stations located at the entrance of Rias de Aveiro-AV (NW Portugal, 40 degrees 38.6' N) and Pontevedra-PO (Galicia, Spain, 42 degrees 21.5' N), were used to investigate the regional synchronism and mesoscale differences related to species detection, bloom (>200 cells L-1) initiation and development. Results highlight the high interannual variability of bloom events and summarize the associated meteorological/oceanographic conditions. D. acuta blooms were observed in 2004-2008 and 2013, and the species highest maxima at AV occurred after the highest maxima of its prey Mesodinium, with a time-lag of 2-3 weeks. D. acuminate blooms were observed every year at both stations. The cell concentration time series shows that the blooms generally present a sequence starting in March with D. acuminata in PO and three weeks later in AV, followed by D. acuta that starts at AV and three months later in PO. Exceptionally, D. acuminate blooms occurred earlier at AV than PO, namely in high spring upwelling (2007) or river runoff (2010) years. A four-year gap (2009-2012) of D. acuta blooms occurred after an anomalous 2008 autumn with intense upwelling which is interpreted as the result of an equatorward displacement of the population core. Numerical model solutions are used to analyze monthly alongshore current anomalies and test transport hypotheses for selected events. The results show a strong interannual variability in the poleward/equatorward currents associated with changes in upwelling forcing winds, the advection of D. acute blooms from AV to PO and the possibility that D. acuminata blooms at AV might result from inocula advected southward from PO. However, the sensitivity of the results to vertical position of the lagrangian tracers call for more studies on species distribution at the various bloom stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The concentrations of 12 Metallic Trace Elements (MTEs), 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), 7 PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), and 3 organotin derivatives were measured in 7 marine sponges collected in the Etel River (South Brittany, France). Results indicated Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Pb, and Ti particularly accumulated in marine sponges such as Hymeniacidon perlevis and Raspailia ramosa at higher levels compared to oysters. At the opposite, Cu and Zn accumulated significantly at higher concentrations in oysters. Among PAHs analyzed, benzo(a)pyrene bioaccumulated in H. perlevis at levels up to 17-fold higher than in oysters. In contrast, PCBs bioaccumulated preferentially in oysters. Significant differences exist in the abilities of marine phyla and sponge species to accumulate organic and metallic pollutants however, among the few sponge species studied, H. perlevis showed impressive bioaccumulation properties. The use of this species as bioindicator and/or bioremediator near shellfish farming areas is also discussed.																	1093-4529	1532-4117				FEB 23	2016	51	3					213	219		10.1080/10934529.2015.1094327								WOS:000367389600003	26634290

Modeling Cs-137 bioaccumulation in the salmon-resident killer whale food web of the Northeastern Pacific following the Fukushima Nuclear Accident	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												To track the long term bioaccumulation of Cs-137 in marine organisms off the Pacific Northwest coast of Canada, we developed a time dependent bioaccumulation model for Cs-137 in a marine mammalian food web that included fish-eating resident killer whales. The model outcomes show that Cs-137 can be expected to gradually bioaccumulate in the food web over time as demonstrated by the increase of the apparent trophic magnification factor of Cs-137, ranging from 0.76 after 1 month of exposure to 2.0 following 30 years of exposure. Cs-137 bioaccumulation is driven by relatively rapid dietary uptake rates, moderate depuration rates in lower trophic level organisms and slow elimination rates in high trophic level organisms. Model estimates of the Cs-137 activity in species of the food web, based on current measurements and forecasts of Cs-137 activities in oceanic waters and sediments off the Canadian Pacific Northwest, indicate that the long term Cs-137 activities in fish species including Pacific herring, wild Pacific salmon, sablefish and halibut will remain well below the current Cs-137-Canada Action Level for consumption (1000 Bq/kg) following a nuclear emergency. Killer whales and Pacific salmon are expected to exhibit the largest long term Cs-137 activities and may be good sentinels for monitoring Cs-137 in the region. Assessment of the long term consequences of Cs-137 releases from the Fukushima aftermath should consider the extent of ecological magnification in addition to ocean dilution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing Disease and Mortality among Small Cetaceans Stranded at a World Heritage Site in Southern Brazil	PLOS ONE												Cetaceans are considered environmental sentinels and their health often reflects either anthropogenic or natural spatio-temporal disturbances. This study investigated the pathological findings and mortality of small cetaceans with the aim of detecting hazards and monitoring health trends in a high-biodiversity area. Between 2007 and 2012, 218 stranded cetaceans were recorded on the Parana coast, southern Brazil. Fifty-seven (26.1%) of these animals, including 50 Sotalia guianensis, 2 Pontoporia blainvillei, 2 Stenella frontalis, 1 Stenella longirostris, 1 Tursiops truncatus and 1 Globicephala melas were necropsied and samples were collected for histopathology. Causes of death were determined in 46 of the 57 (80.7%) animals and most (30 or 65.2%) were ascribed to anthropogenic activities, including fisheries bycatch (28/30) and trauma (2/30). The remaining 16 fatalities were considered natural, and attributed to pneumonia (10/16), emaciation (3/16), septicemia (1/16), neonatal pathology (1/16) and choking via food obstruction (1/16). Irrespective of the cause, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, associated with parasitism, lymphadenitis and membranous glomerulonephritis were common findings among all fatalities. These results suggest, that while anthropogenic activities are a leading cause of cetacean strandings in Parana, underlying pre-existing diseases may contribute towards deaths. Although the studied area is considered a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, complex anthropogenic and natural interactions might be occurring, increasing cetacean susceptibility to hazards. This study may help facilitate developing an effective conservation plan for coastal cetaceans focusing on reducing fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and pollution as mechanisms for ultimately increasing species resilience.

Mercury-induced genotoxicity in marine diatom (Chaetoceros tenuissimus)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this paper, we present an evaluation of genotoxic responses in marine diatom, Chaetoceros tenuissimus, isolated from Kandla Creek (lat 23.03A degrees N, long 70.22A degrees E), Gujarat, India, in terms of impairment of DNA integrity as a function of their exposure to elevated levels of mercury (Hg) under laboratory conditions. DNA integrity in C. tenuissimus was determined by partial alkaline unwinding assay. To our knowledge, this is the first such genotoxicity study to be conducted on marine diatom cultures towards understanding the relationship between Hg toxicity and DNA damage. Furthermore, we studied the impact of Hg on the growth of C. tenuissimus as a function of their exposure to enhanced levels of Hg in terms of decreasing chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations. The data show the genotoxic effect of Hg on the growth of C. tenuissimus as well as DNA integrity to a great extent. Based on the results of our investigations, it is suggested that C. tenuissimus can be used as sentinel species for bio-monitoring of pollution due to genotoxic contaminants.

In this work, a new detector is proposed based on dual-polarized incoherent SAR images. Small icebergs have a stronger cross polarization accompanied by a higher cross- over co-polarization ratio compared to sea ice in many cases. This is the rational at the base of the detector. The new detector is tested with dual-polarization ground detected Sentinel-la Extra Wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test area is on the East Coast of Greenland, where large numbers of icebergs occur. This work is mostly focused on the development of an appropriate Constant False Alarm Rate for the contrast enhanced image, that is based on a modification of the Cell-Averaging CFAR. A quantitative comparison of the proposed detector with an ordinary CA-CFAR using only the cross polarization channel is provided. We focus on grounded icebergs as test targets. The proposed methodology seems able to improve the contrast between icebergs and sea ice clutter up to 75 times. This returns an increased probability of detection and reduced probability of false alarms.																			978-2-8748-7045-3				2016							73	76										WOS:000400068400018

Infected Donor Biomass and Active Feeding Increase Waterborne Transmission of Ichthyophonus sp to Rainbow Trout Sentinels	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												The precise nature of Ichthyophonus sp. transmission among wild fishes has eluded description for over a century. Transmission among piscivores is direct, via ingestion of infected prey, but there is also evidence for waterborne transmission between infected and uninfected individuals. Transmission among planktivores is believed to be via a waterborne infectious cell, but definitive proof of this mechanism has not been forthcoming. To explore possible mechanisms of transmission we used Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss as a model system and examined the consequence of housing infected donor fish with uninfected (sentinel) fish, without physical contact. We examined two variables linked to transmission: (1) feeding and nonfeeding sentinel fish, and (2) biomass of infected donor fish. Specific-pathogen free sentinel trout were placed in fine-mesh baskets suspended in tanks containing varying numbers of larger Ichthyophonus-infected donor fish and held for 10 weeks, during which time they were examined by in vitro explant culture for the presence of Ichthyophonus. Treatment groups consisted of fed and unfed sentinels housed with infected donors of increasing biomass. After 10 weeks infection prevalence in fed sentinels was significantly higher than in unfed sentinels, and Ichthyophonus was detected earlier in fed fish than in unfed fish. There was no correlation between infection prevalence and donor biomass in fed sentinels, but there was a strong correlation between infection prevalence and increasing donor biomass in unfed sentinels. These data suggest that Ichthyophonus is maintained in wild fish populations by two distinct mechanisms: (1) waterborne infectious cells ingested directly from the water by planktivores, and (2) both infected prey and waterborne infectious cells ingested by piscivores.																	0899-7659	1548-8667					2016	28	2					107	113		10.1080/08997659.2016.1159623								WOS:000378895700005	27195430

To clarify if this mortality was related to organophosphate (OP) and/or carbamate (CB) poisoning, chemical and spontaneous cholinesterase (ChE) reactivation was tested in the brain of the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). Initial brain ChE activity in L. michahellis was 40.92 +/- 5.23 U/mg of protein (average +/- SE). Following chemical and spontaneous reactivation, ChE activity increased in average 70.38 +/- 48.59 % and 131.95 +/- 92.64 %, respectively. ChE reactivation was found to decrease at increasing concentrations of the oxime pyridine-2-aldoxime methochloride and dilution factor, underscoring the importance of first optimizing the assay conditions prior to its use on bird species. These results suggest that birds analysed could have been exposed to OP and CB pesticide compounds and that in most cases CB exposure appeared to be the main cause of birds poisoning. These results are an important contribution to environmental monitoring as it demonstrates the suitability of L. michaellis as sentinel species of OP and CB pesticides within an urban environment.

(210)Polonium was detected above the minimum detectable concentration in 33 (92%) of the analysed samples. Molluscs displayed significantly elevated activity concentrations relative to all other species groups. No significant regional variation in activity concentrations were determined. Two dose assessment models for high seafood consumers were undertaken. Dose contribution from (137)Caesium was minimal and far below the dose exemption limit of 1 mSv/year. Exposure to (210)Polonium was significant in high seafood consumers at 0.44-0.77 mSv/year (5th-95th percentile). (137)Caesium is concluded to be a valuable sentinel radionuclide for monitoring anthropogenic releases, such as global fallout and reactor releases, in the marine environment. (210)Polonium is of importance as a natural radionuclide sentinel due to its high contribution to dietary committed dose in seafood consumers. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Natural and anthropogenic radionuclide activity concentrations in the New Zealand diet	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												To support New Zealand's food safety monitoring regime, a survey was undertaken to establish radionuclide activity concentrations across the New Zealand diet. This survey was undertaken to better understand the radioactivity content of the modern diet and also to assess the suitability of the current use of milk as a sentinel for dietary radionuclide trends. Thirteen radionuclides were analysed in 40 common food commodities, including animal products, fruits, vegetables, cereal grains and seafood. Activity was detected for (137)Caesium, (90)Strontium and (131)Iodine. No other anthropogenic radionuclides were detected. Activity concentrations of the three natural radionuclides of Uranium and the daughter radionuclide (210)Polonium were detected in the majority of food sampled, with a large variation in magnitude. The maximum activity concentrations were detected in shellfish for all these radionuclides. Based on the established activity concentrations and ranges, the New Zealand diet contains activity concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides far below the Codex Alimentarius guideline levels. Activity concentrations obtained for milk support its continued use as a sentinel for monitoring fallout radionuclides in terrestrial agriculture. The significant levels of natural and anthropogenic radionuclide activity concentrations detected in finfish and molluscs support undertaking further research to identify a suitable sentinel for New Zealand seafood monitoring.

The consequences on naturally acquired immunity are unclear. A magnetic bead-based immunoassay (MBA) to assess antibody levels in populations living in endemic areas was previously evaluated. In this study, the effect of clinical attacks on immunity was analysed in three sentinel sites of Ivory Coast. Methods: Recombinant proteins or peptides derived from liver or blood stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum (CSP, LSA1(41), LSA3, SALSA, PF13-DBL1 alpha(1), GLURP, AMA1, MSP1p19, MSP4p20), the CSP of Plasmodium malariae and the salivary glands antigen of Anopheles gambiae (gSG6) were covalently linked to a colour-coded microsphere (Luminex (TM) beads) for the multiplex assay. ELISA was used for whole parasite extract antigen. Blood samples (n = 94) of patients consulting for symptomatic malaria attacks and living in three different malaria endemic settings (rural and periurban) were analysed. Results: Highly variable seroprevalence of antibody responses against parasite antigens was found ranging from 3 (gSG6) to 97 % (MSP4p20). A marked prevalence and significantly higher level of antibodies was found in patients from the rural site (Korhogo), those harbouring the lowest level of parasitaemia. The use of whole schizont extract could not discriminate immunity level, contrary to parasite-derived recombinant proteins or peptides. Prevalence of responders to LSA1(41) and levels of antibodies to PF13 were significantly different between the three settings. Moreover, the post-treatment clearance of parasites was clearly associated with a significantly higher level of antibody response for almost 50 % of the parasite antigens tested. Conclusion: The multiplex MBA-Magpix technology assay provides an accurate high throughput monitoring of parasite-specific antibodies during symptomatic malaria. The levels of antibody responses may provide a risk criterion with respect to the degree of parasitic infection. Additionally, they can be used as an indicator in the implementation of malaria prevention and local control strategies.

Two complementary analytical techniques, ICP-MS and NAA, allowed for determination of concentrations of 31 major and trace elements including heavy metals and arsenic in the soft tissues of the mussels. Distinct seasonal patterns were found in the dynamics of these concentrations, with the mussels accumulating much more trace elements in winter than in the summer. In general, the mussels that grew naturally also demonstrated higher concentrations of As, Cd, Fe, Hg and Zn than those that were farmed. Fe showed the highest levels with a maximum concentration of 444 mg/kg followed by Zn with a maximum of 228 mg/kg. The concentrations of Mn and Pb were significantly higher in the Port of Saldanha close to the jetty where ores containing these metals are loaded in comparison with the other sampling sites. It was concluded that bivalve molluscs present themselves as effective biomonitors when assessing marine aquatic pollution by inorganic contaminants in the Saldanha Bay region.

Analytical protocols included the recording of parasites and pathologies. Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) harbored significantly more parasitic taxa than mussels (Mytilidae). Cases where body burden was higher in mytilids were exclusively eukaryotic parasites, trematode metacercariae and trematode sporocysts. Oysters had higher body burdens of Nematopsis, alimentary tract ciliates, prokaryotic inclusions, and a number of unique taxa including haplosporidians, Perkinsus marinus, cestodes, and nematodes. Major pathologies were much more common in mytilids. For oysters, many parasitic taxa were more common in the Gulf of Mexico, including Nematopsis, P. marinus, trematode sporocysts, and nematodes. For mytilids, most parasites and pathologies were more common on the East Coast. Most parasite distributions were clinal on the East and West coasts, with clear relationships to well-known provincial boundaries. West Coast mytilids and East Coast oysters showed a similar trend toward increased parasite weighted prevalence in the south. The greater body burdens in Gulf Coast oysters might be a continuation of this trend. East Coast mytilids offer an opposing trend with higher body burdens in the Gulf of Maine. An increasing incidence of pathologies in mytilids at northern latitudes on both coasts runs contrary to the antithetical trends on the two coasts for parasite weighted prevalences. Within the parasite-rich Gulf of Mexico, oysters from the Texas coast were notable for their higher parasite body burdens. Some parasites and pathologies tended to have low variance-to-mean ratios and thus be identified as having even distributional patterns. Others showed a large range of weighted prevalences within a region and thus had contagious distributional patterns. With the exception of P. marinus, most of the contagious parasites were single celled. The multicellular taxa were more uniformly distributed: they tended to have much lower variance-to-mean ratios. Likely, the difference in spatial distribution between single-celled and multicellular taxa is due to the tendency for single-celled organisms to proliferate within the host or, being small, the ability to accumulate in larger numbers within the host.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				DEC	2015	34	3					939	965		10.2983/035.034.0324								WOS:000367745300024

Sentinel bivalves included mytilid mussels, dreissenid mussels, and oysters. This comprehensive dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine long-term temporal dynamics of parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices of these sentinel bivalves. Temporal dynamics fell into a few clear categories. Significant differences between years occurred commonly for parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices; the absence of significant change over time was more noteworthy. In a few cases, these trends were characterized by multiyear increases or decreases in value within the time series. Such behavior might be produced by a multiyear cycle and, in fact, such behavior was much more common along the southern East Coast, the Gulf Coast, and Southern California where a relatively short cycle, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is well documented. More interestingly, for a number of parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices, significant trends existed across the time series. These trends substantively exceed the time span of climate cycles influencing these regions such as ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation. A few of these longer term coherent trends were continental in scale, being observed across sentinel taxa and multiple coasts. Continental scale trends were restricted to the physiological indices such as length. Regional trends were important for a subset of parasites, pathologies, and physiological indices. In general, the regional trends were produced by single-celled proliferating parasites such as Perkinsus marinus, the major pathologies, and certain physiological indices. The multicellular eukaryotes and the gregarines often showed significant year-to-year changes without trend. Temporal trends were prominently represented by oyster parasites on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and by mytilid parasites on the West Coast. Pathologies by contrast had strong temporal signals in northeastern mytilids.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				DEC	2015	34	3					967	993		10.2983/035.034.0325								WOS:000367745300025

A Systematic Review of Changes in Marine Mammal Health in North America, 1972-2012: The Need for a Novel Integrated Approach	PLOS ONE												Marine mammals are often cited as "sentinels of ocean health" yet accessible, synthesized data on their health changes that could effectively warn of ocean health changes are rare. The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'.

Deep-ocean foraging northern elephant seals bioaccumulate persistent organic pollutants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As top predators in the northeast Pacific Ocean, northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) are vulnerable to bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Our study examined a suite of POPs in blubber (inner and outer) and blood (serum) of free-ranging northern elephant seals. For adult females (N=24), we satellite tracked and sampled the same seals before and after their approximately seven month long foraging trip. For males, we sampled different adults and sub-adults before (N=14) and after (N=15) the same foraging trip. For females, we calculated blubber burdens for all compounds. The highest POP concentrations in males and females were found for Sigma DDTs and Sigma PCBs. In blubber and serum, males had significantly greater concentrations than females for almost all compounds. For males and females, Sigma DDT and Sigma PBDEs were highly correlated in blubber and serum. While Sigma PCBs were highly correlated with Sigma DDTs and Sigma PBDEs in blubber and serum for males, Sigma PCBs showed weaker correlations with both compounds in females. As females gained mass while foraging, concentrations of nearly all POPs in inner and outer blubber significantly decreased; however, the absolute burden in blubber significantly increased, indicating ingestion of contaminants while foraging. Additionally, we identified three clusters of seal foraging behavior, based on geography, diving behavior, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, which corresponded with differences in Sigma DDTs, Sigma PBDEs, MeO-BDE 47, as well as the ratio of Sigma DDTs to Sigma PCBs, indicating the potential for behavior to heighten or mitigate contaminant exposure. The greatest concentrations of Sigma DDTs and Sigma PBDEs were observed in the cluster that foraged closer to the coast and had blood samples more enriched in C-13. Bioaccumulation of POPs by elephant seals supports mesopelagic food webs as a sink for POPs and highlights elephant seals as a potential sentinel of contamination in deep ocean food webs.

However, remote estimation of leaf and canopy biochemical properties and vegetation condition remains challenging. In this paper, we (i) tested the performance of selected hyperspectral and broad band indices to predict chlorophyll concentration (CC) on mangrove leaves and (ii) showed the potential of Landsat 8 for estimation of mangrove CC at the landscape level. Relative leaf CC and leaf spectral response were measured at 12 Elementary Sampling Units (ESU) distributed along the northwest coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Linear regression models and coefficients of determination were computed to measure the association between CC and spectral response. At leaf level, the narrow band indices with the largest correlation with CC were Vogelmann indices and the MTCI (R2> 0.5). Indices with spectral bands around the red edge (705-753 nm) were more sensitive to mangrove leaf CC. At the ESU level Landsat 8 NDVI green, which uses the green band in its formulation explained most of the variation in CC (R-2 > 0.8). Accuracy assessment between estimated CC and observed CC using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method yielded a root mean squared error (RMSE) = 15 mu g center dot cm(-2), and R2 = 0.703. CC maps showing the spatiotemporal variation of CC at landscape scale were created using the linear model. Our results indicate that Landsat 8 NDVI green can be employed to estimate CC in large mangrove areas where ground networks cannot be applied, and mapping techniques based on satellite data, are necessary. Furthermore, using upcoming technologies that will include two bands around the red edge such as Sentinel 2 will improve mangrove monitoring at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.																	2072-4292					NOV	2015	7	11					14530	14558		10.3390/rs71114530								WOS:000366185200012

Known as the nation's salad bowl, and producing up to 90% of U.S. production of lettuces, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, this region is a mosaic of fresh vegetable fields, coastal meadow, chaparral shrubs, riparian and woodland habitat. We tested for relationships between the percent cover of crops, riparian and other natural landscape vegetation and the species richness of parasitic wasps and flies foraging in crops, such as broccoli, kale and cauliflower, and interpreted our results with respect to the decrease in natural habitat and increase in cropland cover prompted by a local microbial contamination event in 2006. Our key results are that: (1) as cropland cover in the landscape increased, fewer species of parasitoids were captured in the crop field, (2) parasitoid richness overall was positively associated with the amount of riparian and other natural vegetation in the surrounding 500m, (3) different groups of parasitoids were associated with unique types of natural vegetation, and (4) parasitism rates of sentinel -cabbage aphid and cabbage looper pests were correlated with landscape vegetation features according to which parasitoids caused the mortality. Although individual species of parasitoids may thrive in landscapes that are predominantly short season crops, the robust associations found in this study across specialist and generalist parasitoids and different taxa (tachinid flies, ichneumon wasps, braconid wasps) shows that recent food safety practices targeting removal of natural vegetation around vegetable fields in an attempt to eliminate wildlife may harm natural enemy communities and reduce ecosystem services. We argue that enhancing biological diversity is a key goal for transforming agroecosystems for future productivity, sustainability and public health.

Mercury concentrations in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, Florida: Patterns of spatial and temporal distribution	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon, FL (IRL) have tissue mercury concentrations among the highest reported worldwide. Analysis of total mercury (THg) concentrations in blood collected between 2003 and 2012 showed a significant linear decrease over time (p = 0.04). Significant differences in the spatial distribution of THg in resident IRL dolphins were also observed with a general gradient in concentration from north to south. Evaluation of local biogeochemistry and accumulation of mercury in prey species is needed to better understand factors influencing the distribution of Hg in the apex predator. Analyses of temporal and spatial patterns of exposure to THg in this sentinel species may have implications for both ecosystem and public health in the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Coliform risk assessment through use of the clam Anomalocardia brasiliana as animal sentinel for shellfish harvesting areas in Brazil's northeast	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MYSORE												Outbreaks of food-borne diseases related to consumption of contaminated shellfish have been reported in many countries, but not in Brazil, possibly due to deficient reporting. Here we investigated the suitability of the clam Anomalocardia brasiliana as an animal sentinel for coliform monitoring in shellfish harvesting areas of Brazil's northeast. Samples of shellfish meats (40 clams per sample; n = 8 per collection) were collected at random from April 2009 through March 2010 in the bay area of Mangue Seco (state of Pernambuco). The numbers of thermotolerant coliforms were analyzed through the most probable number technique, and these contamination levels were tentatively correlated with the precipitation recorded on the day of sampling or 24 to 48 h beforehand. A. brasiliana shellfish meats from local retail shops (250 g per sample/ n = 3 per market) sold frozen were also investigated from August 2010 through June 2011. We found that the highest coliform contamination levels were correlated with recent rainfall events, limited to 24 h before sampling. However, irrespective of the rainfall level, the mean contamination above the Brazilian legal threshold of < 3 x 10(2) MPN/ 100 g for shellfish harvesting areas ranged from 18.7 to 93.7 % of samples analyzed monthly. Additionally, a large number of samples obtained from retail shops were also highly contaminated by coliforms during rainy periods, and therefore were not proper for human consumption. We conclude that A. brasiliana can be successfully used to monitor the contamination levels of coliforms in shellfish harvesting areas in Brazil's northeast coast.

Measurements were performed on different biological levels, from the molecular to the organismal, including measurements of messenger RNA (mRNA), proteins, cellular and tissue changes, and reproductive success. Results revealed that eelpout captured in Stenungsund had significantly higher hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, high levels of both cytochrome P4501A and diablo homolog mRNA, and high prevalence of dead larvae and nuclear damage in erythrocytes. Eelpout collected in Goteborg harbor displayed extensive macrovesicular steatosis, whereby the majority of hepatocytes were affected throughout the liver, which could indicate an effect on lipid metabolism. Results also indicate that eelpouts collected at polluted sites might have an affected immune system, with lower mRNA expression of genes involved in the innate immune system and a higher number of lymphocytes. Biomarker assessment also was performed on livers dissected from unborn eelpout larvae collected from the ovary of the females. No significant differences were noted, which might indicate that the larvae to some extent are protected from effects of environmental pollutants. In conclusion, usage of the selected set of biological markers, covering responses from gene to organism, has demonstrated site-specific biomarker patterns that provided a broad and comprehensive picture of the impact of environmental stressors.

In the past years, coastal waters have been exposed to an increase in copper concentration due to anthropogenic inputs. One well known case is the Chanaral area (Easter South Pacific coast), where a long term coastal copper enrichment event has occurred. That event strongly affected benthic marine diversity, including microbial communities. In this work, microcosm experiments were carried out to address the changes on picophytoplankton community composition of the disturbed area, when challenged to copper additions. Eukaryotic picophytoplankton communities from two areas were analyzed: one in the most copper-perturbed area and another at the north edge of the perturbed area. Flow cytometry data showed that 25g L-1 of copper addition exerted a positive effect in the growth kinetics on part of the eukaryotic picophytoplankton communities, independently of the site. 16S-plastid terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis suggested that eukaryotic picophytoplankton display a short and directional response to high copper levels. Members of the Prasinophyceae class, a Coscinodiscophyceae diatom, as well as Phaeocystis, respond in a short time to the environmental disturbance, making them excellent candidates for further studies to evaluate phytoplanktonic species as sentinels for copper disturbances in coastal marine ecosystems.

Under the auspices of a long-term monitoring program of Tundra Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius) at Assateague (Maryland) and South Padre Islands (Texas), we measured the 16 parent (unsubstituted) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), priority pollutants identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and components of crude oil, in peripheral blood cells of migrating Peregrine Falcons from 2009 to 2011. The study was designed to assess the spatial and temporal trends of crude oil exposure associated with the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill which started 20 April 2010 and was capped on 15 July of that year. Basal PAH blood distributions were determined from pre-DWH oil spill (2009) and unaffected reference area sampling. This sentinel species, a predator of shorebirds and seabirds during migration, was potentially exposed to residual oil from the spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Results demonstrate an increased incidence (frequency of PAH detection and blood concentrations) of PAH contamination in 2010 fall migrants sampled along the Texas Gulf Coast, declining to near basal levels in 2011. Kaplan-Meier peak mean aPAH blood concentration estimates varied with age (Juveniles-16.28 +/- A 1.25, Adults-5.41 +/- A 1.10 ng/g, wet weight) and PAHs detected, likely attributed to the discussed Tundra Peregrine natural history traits. Increased incidence of fluorene, pyrene and anthracene, with the presence of alkylated PAHs in peregrine blood suggests an additional crude oil source after DWH oil spill. The analyses of PAHs in Peregrine Falcon blood provide a convenient repeatable method, in conjunction with ongoing banding efforts, to monitoring crude oil contamination in this avian predator.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2015	24	5					1102	1111		10.1007/s10646-015-1450-8								WOS:000355927100012	25794559

Assessment of heavy metal contamination in Hediste diversicolor (OF Muller, 1776), Mugil cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758), and surface sediments of Bafa Lake (Eastern Aegean)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In the present study, the bioaccumulation of six heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn) in Hediste (Nereis) diversicolor (O.F. Muller, 1776) and also in the muscle and liver of Mugil cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758) collected from seven stations in the Bafa Lake was investigated. Sediment samples were also collected in each site to assess heavy metal levels and to provide additional information on pollution of the lake. The mean concentrations of heavy metals in sediment, H. diversicolor, and muscle and liver of the fish were found to be in the magnitude of Cr > Pb > Zn > Cu > Cd > Hg, Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Hg > Cd, Zn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Hg > Cd, and Cu > Zn > Cr > Cd > Pb > Hg, respectively. Hg, Cu, and Zn in H. diversicolor and Hg and Zn in muscle and also Hg, Cd, Cu, and Zn in liver of fish accumulated in a higher degree than in sediment. There was no clear relationship between metal concentrations in sediments, polychaetes, and fish, except Cr. According to international criteria and Turkish regulations, Pb and Zn values in edible muscle of the fish collected from stations S6 and S5 exceeded the food safety limits, respectively. The results of this study suggest that these sentinel species can be considered as good anthropogenic biological indicators for heavy metal pollution along the Bafa Lake.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2015	22	11					8702	8718		10.1007/s11356-014-4047-5								WOS:000354960300068	25567060

Although Colombia has witnessed an important decrease in malaria transmission, the disease remains a public health problem with an estimated similar to 10 million people currently living in areas with malaria risk and similar to 61,000 cases reported in 2012. This study aimed to establish the malaria prevalence in three endemic regions of Colombia to aid in designing new interventions for malaria elimination. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three regions of Colombia with different malaria epidemiological profiles: Tierralta (Ta), Tumaco (Tu) and Buenaventura (Bv). The Annual Parasite Index (API) was 10.7, 6.9 and 3.1, respectively. Participants were asked to respond to a sociodemographic questionnaire and then were bled to determine the Duffy genotype and the prevalence of malaria infection by microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Results: The study was conducted between October 2011 and January 2012. Eight sentinel sites with 1,169 subjects from 267 households were included. The overall prevalence of sub-microscopic infections measured by thick blood smear (TBS) was 0.3% (n = 4) whereas by qPCR it was 9.7% (n = 113), with a greater proportion (13%) in 40-50 years old individuals. Furthermore, different regions displayed different prevalence of sub-microscopic infections: Bv 12%, Ta 15%, and Tu 4%. From these 113 samples (qPCR), 74% were positive for P. vivax and 22% for P. falciparum, and 4% were mixed infections, which correlates to the overall parasite prevalence in Colombia. This study showed that in the southern Pacific coast of Colombia (Bv and Tu), around 56% of the population have a Duffy-negative genotype, compared to the northern region (Ta) where the percentage of Duffy-negative genotype is around 3%. Conclusions: Sub-microscopic infections are prevalent across different regions in Colombia, particularly in areas with relatively low transmission intensity. The poor microscopy results suggest the need for more sensitive diagnostic tools for detection of sub-microscopic infections. This study underscores the importance of conducting active case surveillance to more accurately determine malaria incidence, and highlights the need for updating the malaria guidelines to track and treat sub-microscopic malaria infections.

However, there are various gaps in the knowledge of many sentinel organisms and the interference of confounding factors. This work aimed (i) to develop a detailed semi-quantitative histopathological index of the digestive gland and gonad of the Mytilus galloprovincialis mussel collected from five sites contaminated with distinct patterns of organic and inorganic toxicants along the Basque coast (SE Bay of Biscay) and (ii) to investigate whether seasonal variability and parasitosis act as confounding factors. A total of twenty-three histopathological alterations were analysed in the digestive gland and gonad following a weighed condition index approach. The alterations were integrated into a single value for a better understanding of the mussels' health status. The digestive gland was consistently more damaged than the gonad. Mussels from the most impacted sites endured the most significant deleterious effects showing inflammation-related alterations together with digestive tubule atrophy and necrosis. Neoplastic diseases were scarce, with only a few cases of fibromas (benign neoplasia). In contrast, in moderately or little impacted sites, contamination levels did not cause significant tissue damage. However, parasites contributed to overestimating the values of histopathological indices (i.e. more severe tissue damage) in mussels from little impacted sites, whilst the opposite occurred in mussels from highly polluted sites. Accordingly, inter-site differences were more pronounced in autumn when natural physiological responses of advanced maturation stages did not interfere in the histological response. In conclusion, although seasonal variability and parasitosis mask the response of histopathological indices, this biomonitoring approach may provide good sensitivity for assessing the health status of mussels if fluctuations of these confounding factors are considered.

Persistent organic pollutants in a marine bivalve on the Marennes-Oleron Bay and the Gironde Estuary (French Atlantic Coast)-Part 1: Bioaccumulation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The aim of this study was to determine 1) the relevance of using the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas as a sentinel organism, at a juvenile stage, for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and persistent organic pollutant (polychlorobiphenyl, PCB, polybromodimethylether, PBDE, and organochlorine pesticide, OCP) contamination, 2) the potential levels of chemical organic contamination in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, and their potential sources and 3) the potential influence of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant body burdens in oysters. To this end, juvenile oysters purchased from an oyster hatchery were transplanted to a reference site, in Bouin, and to different transplantation sites in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, the first oyster production area in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Transplantations were done during summer and winter. Whole oyster soft tissues from each site were analysed for PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs. Results obtained with a transplantation period of 3 months suggest that C. gigas, at the juvenile stage, is a relevant sentinel organism for short-term assessment of contamination for these contaminants. In addition, no significant effects of physiological factors on contaminant body burdens were observed. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct groups of contaminants (PAHs and OPCs, and PCBs and PBDEs) and three groups of sites: 1) the reference site, 2) Les Palles (LP) and Boyard (BOY) in winter and 3) all the other sites. The group of LP and BOY was clearly defined by the levels of PAHs and OCPs, suggesting higher levels of contamination of these chemical compounds on these sites, potentially due to local contamination sources. In addition, no relevant effects of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant body burdens were observed. Results suggest also a predominance of contaminants related to agricultural activities along the Marennes-Oleron Bay, and therefore, further studies on the presence of pesticides in this region should be considered.

Plasma cholinesterase activity as environmental impact biomarker for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) on the coast of Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Brazil	PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA												Biomarkers can be used in a predictive manner, permitting actions control to be taken before they occur irreversible damage with severe environmental ecological consequences, however, sentinel species are needed to evaluate these markers. Sea turtles affected by fibropapillomas are considered sentinel species, signaling the marine environmental imbalance in their areas of occurrence. With the objective to use the plasma cholinesterase activity in green turtles (Chelonia mydas) as a biomarker, the measurement of enzyme activity was evaluated in healthy animals and in location of low pollution impact (Fernando de Noronha, Pernambuco, Brazil) to serve as a reference for comparison with animals trapped in places with higher pollution impact. Were analyzed heparinized plasma samples from 35 captured animals. All samples analyzed showed enzymatic activity of plasma cholinesterase. The values obtained ranged between 162379 IU/L, with mean and standard deviation of 216.4 +/- 51.4 IU/L. In studies of repeatability and reproducibility were obtained variance coefficients of less than 5% in all analyzes, so the analytical methodology proved successful. The longevity of marine turtles of the species C. mydas, feeding behavior, along with the fact possess detectable enzyme activity may indicate this species as a bioindicator of exposure to pollutants that influence plasma cholinesterase activity.

The average levels, in order of concentration, were 14.64 mg/kg As, 3.58 mg/kg Cr, 1.18 mg/kg Pb, 1.15 mg/kg Ni, and 0.07 mg/kg Cd. Dry weight concentrations described bioaccumulation of As and Cr, and, to a lesser extent, Ni and Pb. A hotspot of As at the station near the delta of Marangone stream reflected the effect of mine waste deposits of galena, pyrite, and marcasite in this basin. The As concentration in the northern part of the study area increased closer to the Mignone delta, and according to the prevailing winds, this could reflect enrichment from the combustion of coal at the Torrevaldaliga power plant. Comparing data with the literature, As in marine sediments show a ratio of 0.7 in the tissues of P. lividus from the Civitavecchia area. These results were also compared to those found in P. lividus in an environmental biomonitoring program currently ongoing to control the emissions from the coal-fired power plant in Torrevaldaliga Nord, highlighting a substantial quantitative correspondence. In view of the presence of various industrial activities in the study area that can influence the enrichment of these elements, this work emphasizes the need for performing further studies aimed at assessing the actual contribution of anthropogenic activities even when the background concentrations in marine sediments and marine organisms are high, because burning coal is considered the major anthropogenic source of many trace elements especially As.

The unique attributes of marine mammal fauna such as species richness, risk condition, energy consumption and calving in this region are historically and geographically important. Marine mammals in the Baja California seas have been hunted for the past 10,000 years and they are also currently subject to severe anthropogenic impacts. Commercial hunting started in the late 18th century and some populations declined until the 1970s. Anthropogenic impacts on marine mammals diversified during the 20th century, with fisheries and pollution now being their greatest threats. Currently, the coasts surrounding Baja California seas are home to 3.06% of Mexican people and 1.77% live in relation with maritime activities. This is a relatively small population that has been growing since the Spanish conquest in the 16th century together with decimation of the regional indigenous populations. The scarce people around Baja California seas have important contributions to Mexican economy and marine disturbance, mostly because the arid environments of northwestern Mexico have historically encouraged marine fisheries as the major intake of natural living resources in the region. Therefore, the region's environmental problems do not stem from an overpopulation requiring ecosystem services, with the exception that exhaustion of the underground aquifers is of great concern, but from historical Problems related with social and economic development. Conservation of marine mammals in the Baja California seas may be helpful to geographically and socially integrate human development and ecosystem protection, to address current problems of illegality, sectorial conflicts and partiality in conservation actions as well as to monitor the modifications and functionality of the marine ecosystem.

SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC) applied to MERIS data over inland and coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The launch of several new satellites such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, HyspIRI, EnMAP and PRISMA in the very near future, opens new perspectives for the inland and coastal water community. The monitoring of the water quality closer to the coast, within estuaries or small lakes with satellite data will become feasible. However for these inland and nearshore coastal waters, adjacency effects may hamper the correct retrieval of water quality parameters from remotely sensed imagery. Here, we present a sensor-generic adjacency pre-processing method, SIMilarity Environment Correction (SIMEC). The correction algorithm estimates the contribution of the background radiance based on the correspondence with the Near-INfrared (NIR) similarity spectrum. The performance of SIMEC was tested on MERIS FR images both above highly reflecting waters with high SPM loads, as well as dark lake waters with high CDOM absorption. The results show that SIMEC has a positive or neutral effect on the normalized remote sensing reflectance above optically-complex waters, retrieved with the MERIS MEGS or UR processor.

Mapping the Serological Prevalence Rate of West Nile fever in Equids, Tunisia	TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES												West Nile fever (WNF) is a viral disease of wild birds transmitted by mosquitoes. Humans and equids can also be affected and suffer from meningoencephalitis. In Tunisia, two outbreaks of WNF occurred in humans in 1997 and 2003; sporadic cases were reported on several other years. Small-scale serological surveys revealed the presence of antibodies against WN virus (WNV) in equid sera. However, clinical cases were never reported in equids, although their population is abundant in Tunisia. This study was achieved to characterize the nationwide serological status of WNV in Tunisian equids. In total, 1189 sera were collected in 2009 during a cross-sectional survey. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies, using ELISA and microneutralization tests. The estimated overall seroprevalence rate was 28%, 95% confidence interval [22; 34]. The highest rates were observed (i) in the north-eastern governorates (Jendouba, 74%), (ii) on the eastern coast (Monastir, 64%) and (iii) in the lowlands of Chott El Jerid and Chott el Gharsa (Kebili, 58%; Tozeur, 52%). Environmental risk factors were assessed, including various indicators of wetlands, wild avifauna, night temperature and chlorophyllous activity (normalized difference vegetation index: NDVI). Multimodel inference showed that lower distance to ornithological sites and wetlands, lower night-time temperature, and higher NDVI in late spring and late fall were associated with higher serological prevalence rate. The model-predicted nationwide map of WNF seroprevalence rate in Tunisian equids highlighted different areas with high seroprevalence probability. These findings are discussed in the perspective of implementing a better WNF surveillance system in Tunisia. This system might rely on (i) a longitudinal survey of sentinel birds in high-risk areas and time periods for WNV transmission, (ii) investigations of bird die-offs and (iii) syndromic surveillance of equine meningoencephalitis.																	1865-1674	1865-1682				FEB	2015	62	1					55	66		10.1111/tbed.12077								WOS:000347332000007	23906318

WATERLINE DETECTION AND MONITORING IN THE GERMAN WADDEN SEA USING HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE-BASED RADAR MEASUREMENTS	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					High resolution TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X as well as Sentinel-1 remote sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are used to determine and monitor the waterline in the Wadden Sea. In this very unique and dynamic coastal region in the southeastern North Sea, tidal flats extend several kilometers away from the coast during low tide with features like tidal inlets and sand banks. Under the influence of tidal water currents transporting large amounts of eroded material, inlets and sand banks move over time; heavy storms can even cause large variations in their extensions in merely a few hours. Observation of these obstacles is crucial for maritime security as high ship traffic is caused by the ports of Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Wilhelmshaven and others. Conventional monitoring campaigns with ships or airplanes are economically expensive and can only provide limited coverage. We present an automatic algorithm with Near Real-Time capability for extracting the waterline at the time of recording from SAR images, which allows for a fast and large scale determination of changes in coastal outlines. The comparison of recent acquisitions of TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 to bathymetry data of the Elbe estuary obtained in 2010 reveals significant changes in tidal flat structures.

The basins are Henley, Chidley and Holton Basins and expanded the extent of the Hawke Basin. On behalf of Nalcor Energy, C-CORE recently completed the Offshore Newfoundland and Labrador Metocean Study which summarizes environmental conditions of these regions to support offshore petroleum exploration and development in the Labrador Sea and to outline the resource potential to the global oil and gas industry. Defining iceberg densities was one of the required tasks for the study. Among various environmental conditions, iceberg density is one of the most challenging parameter to define accurately both spatially and temporally. Aerial iceberg reconnaissance flight surveys provided by HP (International Ice Patrol) and CIS (Canadian Ice Service) were studied, classified and analyzed to compute iceberg density (number of icebergs per square km). Only open water icebergs were considered for analysis because of the difficulty associated with reliably identifying icebergs in pack ice, which may lead to an underestimation of iceberg occurrence. Therefore, aerial reconnaissance data were compared with CIS pack ice charts to eliminate any possibility of iceberg sightings in pack ice being included in the analysis. Satellite radar data acquired using Envisat wide swath mode (WSM) imagery was also used for iceberg detections in order to provide full coverage of the study area. Again, sea ice was outlined in the imagery to ensure no targets in sea ice were counted. The WSM imagery provided a 400 km wide swath with an approximate radar resolution of 150 m, meaning smaller targets were not detected. In order to combine satellite radar data with aerial reconnaissance surveys a non-detection factor was calculated using a comparison of concurrent Envisat and aerial coverage to compensate for missed targets due to the coarser radar resolution. The resulting map of open water iceberg densities will provide a baseline for the region which shall be further refined through an on-going program using high-resolution Sentinel satellite data. Detailed descriptions of the analysis, procedures and results are presented in this paper. Areal density results of the newly defined basins are compared to the other frontier regions, where iceberg risks are higher.																			978-0-7918-5656-7				2015									V008T07A002									WOS:000379793700002

Impacts of Coastal Development on the Ecology of Tidal Creek Ecosystems of the US Southeast Including Consequences to Humans	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Upland areas of southeastern United States tidal creek watersheds are popular locations for development, and they form part of the estuarine ecosystem characterized by high economic and ecological value. The primary objective of this work was to define the relationships between coastal development, with its concomitant land use changes and associated increases in nonpoint source pollution loading, and the ecological condition of tidal creek ecosystems including related consequences to human populations and coastal communities. Nineteen tidal creek systems, located along the southeastern US coast from southern North Carolina to southern Georgia, were sampled in the summer, 2005 and 2006. Within each system, creeks were divided into two primary segments based upon tidal zoning-intertidal (i.e., shallow, narrow headwater sections) and subtidal (i.e., deeper and wider sections)-and then watersheds were delineated for each segment. Relationships between coastal development, concomitant land use changes, nonpoint source pollution loading, the ecological condition of tidal creek ecosystems, and the potential impacts to human populations and coastal communities were evaluated. In particular, relationships were identified between the amount of impervious cover (indicator of coastal development) and a range of exposure and response measures including increased chemical contamination of the sediments, increased pathogens in the water, increased nitrate/nitrite levels, increased salinity range, decreased biological productivity of the macrobenthos, alterations to the food web, increased flooding potential, and increased human risk of exposure to pathogens and harmful chemicals. The integrity of tidal creeks, particularly the headwaters or intertidally dominated sections, was impaired by increases in nonpoint source pollution associated with sprawling urbanization (i.e., increases in impervious cover). This finding suggests that these habitats are valuable early warning sentinels of ensuing ecological impacts and potential public health and flooding risk from sprawling coastal development. The results also validate the use of a conceptual model with impervious cover thresholds for tidal creek systems in the southeast region.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JAN	2015	38			1			S49	S66		10.1007/s12237-013-9635-y								WOS:000347956700005						
J	Cook, TC; James, K; Bearzi, M				Cook, Taylor C.; James, Kira; Bearzi, Maddalena			Angler perceptions of California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) depredation and marine policy in Southern California	MARINE POLICY												California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) off the coast of Southern California are known to damage both commercial and recreational fishing activities, causing decreases to fish catch and damage to gear. Their increasing population has intensified the potential for conflict between sea lions and anglers, likely requiring changes to current legislation. The recreational fishing community in Southern California is a valuable and largely underutilized source for information and potential solutions to management and legislative problems. This recreational fishing survey-based study conducted in 2013 utilized personal interviews, conducted in the field with recreational anglers and commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) crews in Southern California, to gather data on: (a) the occurrence and impact of sea lion depredation on the local fishing, (b) angler awareness and opinions on current legislation, and (c) the conflict between fishing activities and conservation efforts. Results show that surveyed CPFV operators and private boaters had the most conflict with sea lions and perceive them as more of a problem than anglers on piers, jetties or kayaks. The conflict was also reportedly more prevalent in San Diego County compared to the other counties surveyed (Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura). Participating CPFV operators were overwhelmingly in support of a government culling program for sea lions, while recreational angler respondents did not feel that a control program was necessary. These CPFV operators reported more money lost, and were willing to pay more for an effective deterrent device. There was also a consensus among respondents that fish catch is declining, yet anglers were unsatisfied with the effectiveness of current legislation designed to increase fish stocks. These data will provide a better understanding of California sea lion depredation in Southern California and its effect on recreational anglers in order to aid future mitigation efforts. Additionally, these results provide stakeholder feedback on local marine protected areas and other fisheries management legislation, and build a foundation for future conservation and education programs.

Tim			Effects of wildfire on sea otter (Enhydra lutris) gene transcript profiles	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Wildfires have been shown to impact terrestrial species over a range of temporal scales. Little is known, however, about the more subtle toxicological effects of wildfires, particularly in downstream marine or downwind locations from the wildfire perimeter. These down-current effects may be just as substantial as those effects within the perimeter. We used gene transcription technology, a sensitive indicator of immunological perturbation, to study the effects of the 2008 Basin Complex Fire on the California coast on a sentinel marine species, the sea otter (Enhydra lutris). We captured sea otters in 2008 (3 mo after the Basin Complex Fire was controlled) and 2009 (15 mo after the Basin Complex Fire was controlled) in the adjacent nearshore environment near Big Sur, California. Gene responses were distinctly different between Big Sur temporal groups, signifying detoxification of PAHs, possible associated response to potential malignant transformation, and suppression of immune function as the primary responses of sea otters to fire in 2008 compared to those captured in 2009. In general, gene transcription patterns in the 2008 sea otters were indicative of molecular reactions to organic exposure, malignant transformation, and decreased ability to respond to pathogens that seemed to consistent with short-term hydrocarbon exposure.																	0824-0469	1748-7692				JAN	2015	31	1					191	210		10.1111/mms.12151								WOS:000346769200011

Biotechnological Potential of Marine Microbes	SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												The world's oceans, from the coasts to the abysses, harbor an incredible level of microbial diversity. This marine microbial biosphere is an enormous, untapped resource of biotechnological interest. This chapter reviews the potential of marine microbes in biotechnology. The biotechnological potential is considerable, ranging from the synthesis of bioactive molecules to the production of biofuels, cosmeceuticals, nutraceuticals, and biopolymers; from the engineering of marine microbes for biomedical purposes to the degradation of pollutants, and the use of microbial biosensors as sentinels for environmental quality. Marine viruses have great biotechnological potential, yet the exploration of the marine virome, and the associated gene and protein pool, is only beginning. Marine archaea have so far been exploited for the isolation of enzymes, yet many biotechnological exploitations can be foreseen. Bacteria and microbial eukaryotes, especially fungi and photosynthetic protists, provide an important contribution to biotechnology; the combination of omics-driven technologies and improved cultivation techniques is widening the knowledge on their biological diversity, paving the way for new biotechnological exploitations. The exploration of the marine microbial biosphere, and its extraordinary genetic and physiological diversity, will undoubtedly continue to offer chances for the development of new and sustainable blue biotechnologies, helping to solve important societal challenges of the twenty-first century.																			978-3-642-53971-8; 978-3-642-53970-1				2015							651	661			10.1007/978-3-642-53971-8							WOS:000401724500026

Three P. perna cultivation areas, located at three bays in southeastern Brazil were used in this study. The three estuaries are under different degrees of environmental impact. Variations in the OCP and PCB concentrations bioaccumulated by the bivalves tended to be similar to those observed in the sediment, but differed from those found in SS. This latter difference might suggest that the SS trapping apparatuses should have been left in place for approximately 60 days (not only 15 days). This longer period would allow the integration of the environmental variability of the OCP and PCB burden adsorbed to this compartment. Authors encourage future studies to evaluate P. perna exposure to OCPs and PCBs through the evaluation of sediment concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Health status assessment through an integrative biomarker approach in mussels of different ages with a different history of exposure to the Prestige oil spill	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A battery of cell and tissue-level biomarkers was applied in mussels of 6 size-classes collected from Galicia and the Basque coast in summer 2007 in an attempt to examine the health status of individuals affected as adults (mature before 2003), affected during their developmental or juvenile stages (2003-2004 offspring), or not directly affected by the Prestige oil spill (POS) exposure (presumably 2005-2006 offspring). This battery of biomarkers was akin to those formerly applied on mussels of 3.5-4.5 cm shell length for which there exist biomarker reference values in the studied geographical areas. The cause-effect relationship between biological responses and the different history of exposure to POS fuel oil was intricate for different reasons: (a) growth rate was dissimilar in mussels of the two studied localities and much lower than expected, (b) a chronological basis could not be directly associated to POS events (all mussels except the smallest from Galicia had been subjected to the direct POS impact at one or another stage of their life-cycle); and (c) some biomarkers and histopathology seemingly depended on size/age irrespectively of the locality and the POS chronology. As a whole, the present study gives a very useful set of reference values of biomarkers obtained for Mytilus galloproyincialis of different size-classes. Finally, it is recommended that Mussel Watch programmes should be designed by standardising the age of the sentinel mussels rather than their size, especially if the programme covers large or diverse geographical areas, if long-term trends are relevant or if significant pollution effects on growth are expected.

Improved detection of coastal acid sulfate soil hotspots through biomonitoring of metal(loid) accumulation in water lilies (Nymphaea capensis)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Anthropogenically disturbed coastal acid sulfate soils along the east coast of Australia, and worldwide, periodically result in the discharge of acid waters containing high concentrations of metals. Identifying priority sites (hotspots) within a catchment for acid sulfate soil remediation activities typically involves long-term monitoring of drainwater chemistry, including the capture of data on unpredictable rain-induced groundwater discharge events. To improve upon this monitoring approach, this study investigated using the water lily (Nymphaea capensis) as a biomonitor of drainage waters to identify hotspots in three acid sulfate soil impacted catchments (83 km(2)) in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. In one catchment where the location of hotspots was known, water lily lamina concentrations of a suite of metal(loid)s were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than plants collected from an unpolluted 'reference' drainage channel, thus validating the concept of using this species as a biomonitor. A catchment-scale water lily sampling program undertaken in catchments with unidentified hotspots revealed within catchment variation of plant metal concentrations up to 70-fold. High resolution maps produced from these results, therefore, provided strong evidence for the location of potential hotspots which were confirmed with measurements of drainwater chemistry during rain-induced groundwater discharge events. Median catchment lily accumulation was ca. 160 mg Al kg(-1) and 1300 mg Fe kg(-1) with hotspots containing up to 6- and 10-fold higher Al and Fe concentrations. These findings suggest that biomonitoring with N. capensis can be an important tool to rapidly identify priority sites for remediation in acid sulfate soil impacted landscapes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Vinson and the evolution of US policy on Antarctic mountaineering, 1960-1966	POLAR RECORD												The full extent of the height and scale of the Sentinel Range, Antarctica, was not known until reconnaissance flights and scientific traverses in the International Geophysical Year (IGY), 1957-1958. These explorations revealed the range to be twenty miles in length, with a large number of high peaks culminating in Mt. Vinson, the highest on the Antarctic continent at nearly 4900 meters. The discoveries captured the interest of the U.S. and world mountaineering communities setting off a competition to achieve the first climb of Vinson. The challenge was tempered only by the range's remoteness from the coast of Antarctica and the formidable logistics of mounting a mountaineering expedition. The US which had the most advanced ski-equipped cargo aircraft, had an established post-IGY policy that prohibited adventure expeditions that could divert logistic resources from the scientific programme. This paper discusses Mt. Vinson competition within the US and international climbing communities, mounting national pressures to achieve the first climb, and a reversal in policy by the US Antarctic Policy Group that resulted in the 1966-1967 American Antarctic Mountaineering Expedition's first ascents of Vinson and five other high peaks. Today, between 100 and 200 persons climb Mt. Vinson each austral summer.																	0032-2474	1475-3057				JUN	2014	50	3					277	283		10.1017/S0032247413000211								WOS:000337752900004

Ecological relevance of sentinels' biomarker responses: A multi-level approach	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In response to the need for more sensitive and rapid indicators of environmental quality, sublethal effects on the lowest levels of biological organization have been investigated. The ecological relevance of these responses assumes a prevailing role to assure effectiveness as indicator of ecological status. This study aimed to investigate the linkages between biomarker responses of caged bivalves and descriptive parameters of macrobenthic community structure. For this purpose a multi-level environmental assessment of marine and estuarine zones was performed in Sao Paulo coast, Brazil. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify linkages between biological responses and ecological indices, as well as to characterizing the studied stations. Individuals of the marine mussel Perna perna caged along Santos Bay showed signs of oxidative stress, lysosomal membrane destabilization, histological alterations and reduced embryonic development. The estuarine oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae caged along Santos Port Channel showed alterations on biotransformation enzymes and antioxidant system, DNA damage and lysosomal membrane destabilization. The benthic community analysis showed reduced richness and diversity in the same areas of the Santos bay and estuary where biomarker responses were altered. Our results revealed that xenobiotics are inducing physiological stress, which may lead to changes of the benthic community structure and deterioration of the ecological status over time. Integrating biomarker responses and ecological indexes improved certainty that alterations found at community level could be related to xenobiotic as stressors, which was very useful to improve the discriminatory power of the environmental assessment.

J	Koenig, S; Sole, M				Koenig, Samuel; Sole, Montserrat			Muscular cholinesterase and lactate dehydrogenase activities in deep-sea fish from the NW Mediterranean	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Organisms inhabiting submarine canyons can be potentially exposed to higher inputs of anthropogenic chemicals than their counterparts from the adjacent areas. To find out to what extend this observation applies to a NW Mediterranean canyon (i.e. Blanes canyon) off the Catalan coast, four deep-sea fish species were collected from inside the canyon (BC) and the adjacent open slope (OS). The selected species were: Alepocephalus rostratus, Lepidion lepidion, Coelorinchus mediterraneus and Bathypterois mediterraneus. Prior to the choice of an adequate sentinel species, the natural variation of the selected parameters (biomarkers) in relation to factors such as size, sex, sampling depth and seasonality need to be characterised. In this study, the activities of cholinesterases (ChEs) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymes were determined in the muscle of the four deep-sea fish. Of all ChEs, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was dominant and selected for further monitoring. Overall, AChE activity exhibited a significant relationship with fish size whereas LDH activity was mostly dependent on the sex and gonadal development status, although in a species-dependent manner. The seasonal variability of LDH activity was more marked than for AChE activity, and inside-outside canyon (BC-OS) differences were not consistent in all contrasted fish species, and in fact they were more dependent on biological traits. Thus, they did not suggest a differential stress condition between sites inside and outside the canyon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address this uncertainty about current status, we conducted a comprehensive aerial survey of this population during August, 2011, when the region was ice-free and bears were on shore. We flew a combination of overland transects oriented perpendicular to the coastline, coastal transects parallel to shore, and transects across small islands. We used distance sampling and sight-resight protocols to estimate abundance. Bears were concentrated along the coast in central and southern Manitoba and Ontario portions of the population, although sightings >10 km inland were not uncommon in central Manitoba. We analyzed 2 combinations of data and derived an abundance estimate of 1030 bears (95% CI: similar to 754-1406). This figure is similar to a 2004 mark-recapture estimate but higher than projections indicating declining abundance since then. Our results suggest that mark-recapture estimates may have been negatively biased due to limited spatial sampling. We observed large numbers of bears summering in southeastern WH, an area not regularly sampled by mark-recapture. Consequently, previous mark-recapture estimates are not directly comparable to our aerial survey of the entire population. Whereas our results do not necessarily contradict the reported declines in this population, we believe that improvements are needed in monitoring, and methodological limitations and inconsistencies must be resolved to accurately assess status and the impacts of climate change.

Mangrove swamps: sentinel ecosystem in front of the climatic change, Gulf of Mexico	MADERA Y BOSQUES												Considering the challenge that the economic, social and ecological systems face -in order to know and mitigate the global climate change-, evidences of the functional structure of mangroves ecological system are presented revisiting the hypothesis presented by Yanez-Arancibia et al. (1998), and revised latter by Yanez-Arancibia et al. (2010): "the mangroves as a critical forest habitat of the coastal zone present accommodation responses to the environmental variability that induces global change playing an structural and functional role in the stability of the coastline, the persistence of habitats and biodiversity, the metabolism of the ecosystem, reducing risks and uncertainty for the sustainable development of the use of its resources". Recent evidences indicates that mangroves in the Gulf of Mexico follows this hypothesis and -as answer to climate change and its effects in the coastal zone- shows a consistent pattern of geographical distribution colonizing all over the northern coast of the Gulf, including the Atlantic coast of Florida Peninsula because of the opportunity of "global tropicalization of the Gulf of Mexico". Moreover, at present the four mangrove species in the Gulf of Mexico are distributed in the Texas state U.S. We conclude that mangrove ecosystem is a "sentinel-ecosystem" in front of climate change impact in the Gulf of Mexico.																	1405-0471						2014	20				SI		39	75										WOS:000346409900002

Exposure to wave energy plays a dominant role in shaping the Orkney landscape and determining the ecological community, but little is known of the consequences of commercial scale removal of energy from the environment. An extensive long-term monitoring programme to assess the impacts of altering wave-energy exposure on these rocky shores alongside responses to other systemic forcing agents such as climate change is continuing. Within the programme are photographic surveys, including quadrat and fixed viewpoint techniques, littoral studies of sentinel species, and the development of cost-effective wave-energy quantifying devices. Software has been developed to analyse images efficiently, to produce quantitative data on species and biotope coverage. Additionally, extensive surveys along the shoreline provide detailed image records, including areas without prior scientific description, and have helped identify locations of environmental sensitivity. Collectively, the data provide a comprehensive pre-development baseline along this important coast.																	2213-607X		978-94-017-8002-5; 978-94-017-8001-8				2014							21	38		10.1007/978-94-017-8002-5_3	10.1007/978-94-017-8002-5							WOS:000344882300003

Using sentinel cages to estimate infestation pressure on salmonids from sea lice in Loch Shieldaig, Scotland	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Sentinel Atlantic salmon, held in cages, were used to estimate the monthly infestation pressure of sea lice at 3 locations along a salmonid migration route in Loch Shieldaig, a Scottish west coast sea loch. The study lasted 30 mo, covering an entire production cycle and fallow period at nearby fish farms. A total of 5007 sea lice were sampled from 3097 sentinel fish, with over 99% of these being Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Infestation pressure was higher in cages nearer the head of the loch and the River Shieldaig estuary. Copepodids were the main infective life cycle stage, but a few (0.5% of total lice sampled) mobile pre-adult and adult stages were also found on the sentinel fish. Infestation pressure on the sentinel fish was correlated with gravid L. salmonis counts from nearby farms. However, there was no evidence that particular events, such as treatments, at the farms led directly to changes in infestation pressure. These findings suggest that, although aquaculture is a contributor of sea lice larvae into the Torridon system, further work is required to determine factors influencing the relationship between farm sea lice levels and infestation pressure in the wider environment.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2014	5	1					49	59		10.3354/aei00094								WOS:000335583000004

Development of quantitative RNA biomarkers for detecting dioxin-like and estrogenic pollutants in Costa Rican native fish species	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Monitoring the environmental impact on native species is crucial for the correct management of tropical ecosystems. The Costa Rican fish Parachromis dovii (Cichlidae) and Poecilia gillii (Poecillidae) were used as sentinel species for freshwater bodies under considerable pressure by intensive agriculture Cichlidae development. Suitable qRT-PCR probes for the quantification of hepatic mRNA levels of two stress-related genes -vitellogen in (estrogenic effects) and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A, dioxin-like compounds) - for both species were designed and validated in experimental treatments with model effectors (17 beta-estradiol and beta-naphtoflavone, respectively), demonstrating their usefulness as markers of exposure to these two kinds of pollutants. Analysis of fish transplanted across pesticide contaminated sites near Palo Verde National Park, Pacific Coast of Costa Rica did show significant changes on hepatic Cyp1A in both species. In P. dovii, Cyp1A levels were enhanced in Barbubal and in the impacted Cabuyo sites in the rainy season whereas in P. gillii fish CyplA transcripts were down-regulated differently across rainy and dry seasons. Vitellogen in mRNA levels in P. gillii varied between males and females with males showing always low values which indicated no estrogenic effects.

JOHN'S	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	SEP 14-19, 2014	St Johns, CANADA					High quality water level time series are important for providing tidal datums for littoral boundaries, long term relative sea level trends, information for navigation as well as emergency management information during tropical storms and hurricanes. Gaps occasionally appear as a result of gauge malfunction, transmission problem or damage to the station. Gaps can be minimized by collocating redundant sensors. Dual water level measurements are typically collected by sensors based on different physical principles, such as, acoustic and pressure based measurements for this study. The resulting differences in measured values must be accounted for prior to filling gaps. Presently, gap filling of water level time series is primarily performed by an expert using a hierarchy of techniques including linear fits, back-up data, least squares fit or nearby station records selected based on the length of the gap and ocean conditions. This paper presents an automated gap filling method and the assessment of its performance for gaps of six minutes to 120 hours for a set of 15 tide stations in different coastal settings, such as, open coast, embayment, lagoons, and ship channels. In this method, a fourth order polynomial is calibrated over a period of 30 days around the gap to be filled. The 30 day calibration period was selected to include a tidal cycle and several weather events such as frontal passages. Longer calibration periods did not improve the performance of the method. The fourth degree polynomial was found to be more flexible than a simple linear regression allowing for the modeling of shifts in the relationship between the two sensors particularly during events, such as, larger waves or higher winds. In particular a fourth order polynomial was found to improve upon the accuracy of lower order polynomials for the modeling of the highest and lowest 1% of water levels. The statistical significance of the improved accuracy gained from using a fourth order polynomial was established based on a t-test. Other steps of the method include verifying that the selected data is at least 90% gap free and detecting and removing potential outliers by comparing the primary measurements with the corresponding values modeled with a simple linear model based on the back-up measurements. The comparison between modeled and measured values further allows detecting potential drifts in the instruments identified by an usually large number of outliers or an overall poor average performance of a linear model. A final improvement to the gap fill is produced by adding a linear correction based on the difference between the fourth order model and the primary water level on each side of the gap. The method's accuracy is compared with four other gap filling methods, (1) linear interpolation across the gap, (2) linear interpolation of the surge component, (3) back-up data with a simple offset, and (4) fourth order polynomial fit without further adjustments. The accuracy of the methods are compared by randomly generating 1,000 gaps of increasing lengths from six minutes to 120 hours at random locations in one year data sets and filling the gaps using the methods described above. The new method has the best gap filling performance for all stations and all gap lengths. Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) are lower than 0.010 m for 13 of the stations for gap lengths up to five days. For two of the stations, Texas Point and Galveston Bay Entrance/North Jetty, the MAE is below 0.010 m only up to six hours and nine hours, respectively. MAEs for the longest tested gap, 120 hours, are 0.017 m and 0.011 m, respectively. These two stations are sentinel stations designed to sustain the storm surge and conditions of hurricanes up to category four. The lower performance of the gap filling method is attributed to the stations' longer stilling wells leading to larger and varying temperature gradients presently not accounted for in the acoustic measurements. Identified oceanic and atmospheric forcing influencing the relationship between the primary and backup measurements include wave climate, water and air temperatures, and wind. The algorithm is now implemented as part of a mostly automated data processing system. The gap filled data, using proven scientific methods, is considered to be of the same quality as the observed data for datum computation purposes.

A SYBR Green 1-based in vitro test of susceptibility of Ghanaian Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates to a panel of anti-malarial drugs	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: Based on report of declining efficacy of chloroquine, Ghana shifted to the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in 2005 as the first-line anti-malarial drug. Since then, there has not been any major evaluation of the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs in Ghana in vitro. The sensitivity of Ghanaian Plasmodium falciparum isolates to anti-malarial drugs was, therefore, assessed and the data compared with that obtained prior to the change in the malaria treatment policy. Methods: A SYBR Green 1 fluorescent-based in vitro drug sensitivity assay was used to assess the susceptibility of clinical isolates of P. falciparum to a panel of 12 anti-malarial drugs in three distinct eco-epidemiological zones in Ghana. The isolates were obtained from children visiting health facilities in sentinel sites located in Hohoe, Navrongo and Cape Coast municipalities. The concentration of anti-malarial drug inhibiting parasite growth by 50% (IC50) for each drug was estimated using the online program, ICEstimator. Results: Pooled results from all the sentinel sites indicated geometric mean IC50 values of 1.60, 3.80, 4.00, 4.56, 5.20, 6.11, 10.12, 28.32, 31.56, 93.60, 107.20, and 8952.50 nM for atovaquone, artesunate, dihydroartemisin, artemether, lumefantrine, amodiaquine, mefloquine, piperaquine, chloroquine, tafenoquine, quinine, and doxycycline, respectively. With reference to the literature threshold value indicative of resistance, the parasites showed resistance to all the test drugs except the artemisinin derivatives, atovaquone and to a lesser extent, lumefantrine. There was nearly a two-fold decrease in the IC50 value determined for chloroquine in this study compared to that determined in 2004 (57.56 nM). This observation is important, since it suggests a significant improvement in the efficacy of chloroquine, probably as a direct consequence of reduced drug pressure after cessation of its use. Compared to that measured prior to the change in treatment policy, significant elevation of artesunate IC50 value was observed. The results also suggest the existence of possible cross-resistance among some of the test drugs. Conclusion: Ghanaian P. falciparum isolates, to some extent, have become susceptible to chloroquine in vitro, however the increasing trend in artesunate IC50 value observed should be of concern. Continuous monitoring of ACT in Ghana is recommended.

The catfish Genidens genidens (Cuvier, 1829) as a potential sentinel species in Brazilian estuarine waters	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Major difficulties in studies monitoring or evaluating general environmental conditions are the intraspecific differences in population descriptors, such as the growth and reproductive period among different localities. The identification of feasible candidates for sentinel species requires basic information on these population parameters. Attention is drawn to the potential of the catfish Genidens genidens as a sentinel species for Brazilian estuarine environments, based on its compliance with a set of population descriptors and characteristics along a latitudinal gradient, and by providing new data from Guanabara Bay, one of the most important estuarine systems on the Brazilian coast. Populations of G.genidens along the southern and southeastern Brazilian coast vary little, showing a similar reproductive period and shape of the length-weight relationship among localities. This catfish is abundant, easy to catch, economically important, tolerant of environmental variations and human impacts, does not migrate, and can be found in reference localities, fulfilling the majority of the requirements for a sentinel species.																	0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2013	29	6					1297	1303		10.1111/jai.12280								WOS:000327212000019

Coastal national parks have many low-lying areas that are at risk from inundation resulting from these impacts. To help park managers meet their goal of preserving resources, we developed a methodology to evaluate risk of inundation from sea level rise and storm surge at sentinel sites, areas of importance for natural, cultural, and infrastructural resources. We selected the most recent, readily available, and appropriate geospatial tools, models, and data sets to conduct case studies of our coastal inundation risk assessments in two northeastern coastal national parks-Cape Cod National Seashore, MA, and Assateague Island National Seashore, MD/VA. We collected elevation data at sentinel sites using real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK GPS) technology. We used three modeling approaches: modified bathtub modeling; the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM); and the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model to assess the likelihood of inundation at sentinel sites. Cape Cod's sentinel sites, which in many cases occurred in high-elevation settings, were found to be less vulnerable to inundation than were Assateague Island's sentinel sites, which were distributed in low-lying areas along the barrier beach island. This inundation risk assessment methodology can be applied to other coastal areas and to the same coastal parks at different times as more accurate elevation data sets and updated sea level rise projections become available.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2013	29	6A		S			1	16		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00196.1								WOS:000327567200002

One or several species were analysed at each site depending on their availability, including mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), clams (Venerupis pullastra and Ruditapes decussatus) and razor shells (Ensis siliqua). The general spatial distribution of contaminants was consistent in spite of the different sources of contamination. High inter-species variability was also observed. M. galloprovincialis and V. pullastra showed the highest levels of contaminants and intra-spatial variability, which highlights them as suitable species to be used as sentinel organisms. The area of 0 Burgo showed some worrisome results: PCB sediment concentrations were within the range that could cause biological effects. Also the level of heptachlor observed in V. pullastra was above limits accepted on edible seafood. Finally TBT concentration in mussels correlated with concentrations causing imposex in snails.

Spatial distribution of mortality in Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas: reflection on mechanisms of OsHV-1 transmission	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												The ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 has the potential to devastate Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas culture in Australia as it has done in many other countries, highlighting the need for a better understanding of disease expression and transmission. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial distribution of OsHV-1-associated mortalities in one of only two infected areas in Australia, Woolooware Bay (Botany Bay, New South Wales). In October 2011, healthy sentinel Pacific oysters were placed in 3 different locations at 3 different tidal levels, and OsHV-1 associated mortalities were closely monitored over 7 mo. The outbreak started in November 2011, and the disease remained active until April 2012. Three major mortality events were detected. Rather than being a propagating epizootic, it appeared that most oysters were infected from a common environmental source. The distribution of OsHV-1-associated mortalities was spatially clustered, highly variable and clearly dependent on the age of oysters and their position in the water column. Non-random distribution of mortalities at macro scale (sites several km apart) and micro scale (within rearing trays), and vertical clustering patterns in the water column are discussed in regard to factors known to influence mechanism of disease transmission in aquatic environments (hydro dynamics, physical disturbances, host density/distribution, and variations of environmental parameters). A new hypothesis proposing that OsHV-1 may be carried through water by particles, possibly plankton, is also suggested to explain the patchy distribution of mortalities in Woolooware Bay.

These tests were conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMAEC) at its Pacific Ocean test site off the coast of Newport, Oregon. The WET-NZ is the product of a research consortium between Callaghan Innovation, a New Zealand Crown. Entity, and Power Projects Limited (PPL), a Wellington, New Zealand private company. The Oregon deployment was project managed by Northwest Energy Innovations (NWEI), a Portland, OR firm. NNMREC is a Department of Energy sponsored partnership between Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Washington (UW), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The Ocean Sentinel was deployed and operated for the first during the 2012 WET-NZ tests. During these tests, the operation of the WET-NZ was demonstrated and its performance was chracterized, while also proving successful deployment and operation of the Ocean Sentinel.																	0025-3324					JUL-AUG	2013	47	4					164	176		10.4031/MTSJ.47.4.4								WOS:000324844400017

Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins and Other Lipophilic Toxins of Human Health Concern in Washington State	MARINE DRUGS												The illness of three people in 2011 after their ingestion of mussels collected from Sequim Bay State Park, Washington State, USA, demonstrated the need to monitor diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in Washington State for the protection of human health. Following these cases of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, monitoring for DSTs in Washington State became formalized in 2012, guided by routine monitoring of Dinophysis species by the SoundToxins program in Puget Sound and the Olympic Region Harmful Algal Bloom (ORHAB) partnership on the outer Washington State coast. Here we show that the DSTs at concentrations above the guidance level of 16 mu g okadaic acid (OA) + dinophysistoxins (DTXs)/100 g shellfish tissue were widespread in sentinel mussels throughout Puget Sound in summer 2012 and included harvest closures of California mussel, varnish clam, manila clam and Pacific oyster. Concentrations of toxins in Pacific oyster and manila clam were often at least half those measured in blue mussels at the same site. The primary toxin isomer in shellfish and plankton samples was dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) with D. acuminata as the primary Dinophysis species. Other lipophilic toxins in shellfish were pectenotoxin-2 (PTX-2) and yessotoxin (YTX) with azaspiracid-2 (AZA-2) also measured in phytoplankton samples. Okadaic acid, azaspiracid-1 (AZA-1) and azaspiracid-3 (AZA-3) were all below the levels of detection by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A shellfish closure at Ruby Beach, Washington, was the first ever noted on the Washington State Pacific coast due to DSTs. The greater than average Fraser River flow during the summers of 2011 and 2012 may have provided an environment conducive to dinoflagellates and played a role in the prevalence of toxigenic Dinophysis in Puget Sound.																	1660-3397					JUN	2013	11	6					1815	1835		10.3390/md11061815								WOS:000320772100004	23760013

Testing the species limits of the tarantulas (Araneae: Theraphosidae) endemic to California's Southern Coast Ranges, USA	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY												The California floristic province is home to several threatened or endangered species and has been the focus of numerous conservation efforts. These conservation efforts have largely ignored the diverse and distinctive arthropod fauna found in this region. We investigate the species boundaries of the four tarantula (Araneae: Theraphosidae) species endemic to California's Southern Coast Ranges through molecular phylogenetic analysis using a 680bp region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 from 51 individuals. Our analysis resulted in a well-supported phylogeny showing three distinct clades. As a result, we recognise only one species in the Southern Coast Ranges (Aphonopelma brunnius, with A. chamberlini and A. smithi treated as junior synonyms; if the holotype of A. rileyi is located it will likely be a synonym as well). Two additional species were found in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Although the tarantulas in California's Southern Coast Ranges are not as endemic as was previously thought, their position as top arthropod predators make them ideal sentinel species, suggesting they should be targeted by conservationists. Furthermore, our analyses illustrate the importance in using molecular tools to investigate biodiversity.

A common strategy for acquiring such information is to drill sentinel wells near the coast to monitor changes in water salinity with time. However, installation and operation of sentinel wells is costly and provides limited spatial coverage. We studied the use of noninvasive electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods as an alternative to installation of monitoring wells for characterizing coastal aquifers. We tested the feasibility of using EM methods at a field site in northern California to identify the potential for and/or presence of hydraulic communication between an unconfined saline aquifer and a confined freshwater aquifer. One-dimensional soundings were acquired using the time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) methods. We compared inverted resistivity models of TDEM and AMT data obtained from several inversion algorithms. We found that multiple interpretations of inverted models can be supported by the same data set, but that there were consistencies between all data sets and inversion algorithms. Results from all collected data sets suggested that EM methods are capable of reliably identifying a saltwater-saturated zone in the unconfined aquifer. Geophysical data indicated that the impermeable clay between aquifers may be more continuous than is supported by current models.																	0016-8033					MAR-APR	2013	78	2					B77	B88		10.1190/GEO2012-0004.1								WOS:000319858000003

Development and assessment of a biophysical dispersal model for sea lice	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Salmon aquaculture in Scotland continues to increase; however, one of the potential limitations to its further sustainable growth is the ectoparasitic sea louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis. The industry in Scotland undertakes coordinated management procedures to control the levels of sea lice on farms in designated production areas. We developed a biophysical sea lice dispersal model for Loch Linnhe, one of the largest fjords on the west coast of Scotland, to provide further information to help establish more effective farm management areas. We successfully extend modelling principles previously applied to a small Scottish fjordic system. Modelling scenarios demonstrate heterogeneity in the distribution of sea lice within the system and simulations, suggesting that lice could be transmitted up to 30km. The scenarios are assessed by comparing model predictions against lice sampled by both planktonic trawls and settlement on sentinel caged fish. The model predicts the ranked abundance of both planktonic and settled lice assuming that the lice input to the system is relative to host biomass. Data collection is ongoing for undertaking and assessing additional scenarios.

Risk assessment of herbicides and booster biocides along estuarine continuums in the Bay of Vilaine area (Brittany, France)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												A 2-year study was implemented to characterize the contamination of estuarine continuums in the Bay of Vilaine area (NW Atlantic Coast, Southern Brittany, France) by 30 pesticide and biocide active substances and metabolites. Among these, 11 triazines (ametryn, atrazine, desethylatrazine, desethylterbuthylazine, desisopropyl atrazine, Irgarol 1051, prometryn, propazine, simazine, terbuthylazine, and terbutryn), 10 phenylureas (chlortoluron, diuron, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea, fenuron, isoproturon, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-3-methylurea, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, linuron, metoxuron, and monuron), and 4 chloroacetanilides (acetochlor, alachlor, metolachlor, and metazachlor) were detected at least once. The objectives were to assess the corresponding risk for aquatic primary producers and to provide exposure information for connected studies on the responses of biological parameters in invertebrate sentinel species. The risk associated with contaminants was assessed using risk quotients based on the comparison of measured concentrations with original species sensitivity distribution-derived hazardous concentration values. For EU Water Framework Directive priority substances, results of monitoring were also compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards. The highest residue concentrations and risks for primary producers were recorded for diuron and Irgarol 1051 in Arzal reservoir, close to a marina. Diuron was present during almost the all survey periods, whereas Irgarol 1051 exhibited a clear seasonal pattern, with highest concentrations recorded in June and July. These results suggest that the use of antifouling biocides is responsible for a major part of the contamination of the lower part of the Vilaine River course for Irgarol 1051. For diuron, agricultural sources may also be involved. The presence of isoproturon and chloroacetanilide herbicides on some dates indicated a significant contribution of the use of plant protection products in agriculture to the contamination of Vilaine River. Concentration levels and associated risk were always lower in estuarine sites than in the reservoir, suggesting that Arzal dam reduces downstream transfer of contaminants and favors their degradation in the freshwater part of the estuary. Results of the additional monitoring of two tidal streams located downstream of Arzal dam suggested that, although some compounds may be transferred to the estuary, their impact was probably very low. Dilution by marine water associated with tidal current was also a major factor of concentration reduction. It is concluded that the highest risks associated to herbicides and booster biocides concerned the freshwater part of the estuary and that its brackish/saltwater part was exposed to a moderate risk, although some substances may sometimes exhibit high concentration but mainly at low tide and on an irregular basis.

Toxoplasmosis in a Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) from Parana, Brazil	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												This study describes toxoplasmosis in a by caught Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guinensis) from Paranagua Bay, Parana, Brazil. Interstitial pneumonia, multisystemic arteritis, multifocal adrenalitis and hepatitis were the primary lesions observed. These tissues had moderate to severe necrosis and mononuclear cells infiltration usually surrounded by tachyzoites and tissue cysts. Moderate lymphoid depletion was evident in the spleen. Toxoplasma gondii was positive by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation. Furthermore, the animal was negative for Morbillivirus by immunohistochemistry and had low levels of persistent organochlorines. There is evidence of environmental changes in the Paranagua Bay that could justify the occurrence of toxoplasmosis in Guiana dolphin. The sewage run-off from main urban areas and the presence of domestic and wild felids in areas surrounding the bay could be a source of T. gondii oocysts from land to sea. Based on its habitat, the authors recommend this dolphin species as sentinels for the health of bays and estuaries where they occur. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Following the emergence of CQ-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, most African countries discontinued the use of CQ, and now promote artemisinin-based combination therapy as the first-line treatment. This change was generally initiated during the last decade in West and Central Africa. The aim of this study is to describe the changes in CQ susceptibility in this African region, using travellers returning from this region as a sentinel system. Methods: The study was conducted by the Malaria National Reference Centre, France. The database collated the pfcrtK76T molecular marker for CQ susceptibility and the in vitro response to CQ of parasites from travellers' isolates returning from Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast or Cameroon. As a proxy of drug pressure, data regarding CQ intake in febrile children were collated for the study period. Logistic regression models were used to detect trends in the proportions of CQ resistant isolates. Results: A total of 2874 parasite isolates were genotyped between 2000-2011. The prevalence of the pfcrt76T mutant genotype significantly decreased for Senegal (from 78% to 47%), Ivory Coast (from 63% to 37%), Cameroon (from 90% to 59%) and remained stable for Mali. The geometric mean of the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of CQ in vitro susceptibility and the proportion of resistant isolates (defining resistance as an IC50 value > 100 nM) significantly decreased for Senegal (from 86 nM (59%) to 39 nM (25%)), Mali (from 84 nM (50%) to 51 nM (31%)), Ivory Coast (from 75 nM (59%) to 29 nM (16%)) and Cameroon (from 181 nM (75%) to 51 nM (37%)). Both analyses (molecular and in vitro susceptibility) were performed for the 2004-2011 period, after the four countries had officially discontinued CQ and showed an accelerated decline of the resistant isolates for the four countries. Meanwhile, CQ use among children significantly deceased in this region (fixed effects slope = -0.3, p < 10(-3)). Conclusions: An increase in CQ susceptibility following official withdrawal of the drug was observed in travellers returning from West and Central African countries. The same trends were observed for molecular and in vitro analysis between 2004-2011and they correlated to the decrease of the drug pressure.

The foreseen standard Wide Area Product (WAP), with its higher spatial and temporal resolution than comparable SAR missions, will provide the basement for the use of new wide scale and multitemporal analysis. By now the use of SAR interferometry methods with respect to risk assessment are mainly conducted for active tectonic zones, plate boundaries, volcanoes as well as urban areas, where local surface movement rates exceed the expected error and enough pixels per area contain a relatively stable phase. This study, in contrast, aims to focus on infrastructural sites that are located outside cities and are therefore surrounded by rural landscapes. The stumbling bock was given by the communication letter by the European Commission with regard to the stress tests of nuclear power plants in Europe in 2012. It is mentioned that continuously re-evaluated risk and safety assessments are necessary to guarantee highest possible security to the European citizens and environment. This is also true for other infrastructural sites, that are prone to diverse geophysical hazards. In combination with GPS and broadband seismology, multitemporal Differential Interferometric SAR approaches demonstrated great potential in contributing valuable information to surface movement phenomenas. At this stage of the project, first results of the Stamps-MTI approach (combined PSInSAR and SBAS) will be presented for the industrial area around Priolo Gargallo in South East Sicily by using ENVISAT ASAR IM mode data from 2003-2010. This area is located between the Malta Escarpment fault system and the Hyblean plateau and is prone to earthquake and tsunami risk. It features a high density of oil refineries that are directly located at the coast. The general potential of these techniques with respect to the SENTINEL-1 mission will be shown for this area and a road-map for further improvements is given in order to overcome limitations that refer to the influence of the atmosphere, orbit or DEM errors. Further steps will also include validation and tectonic modeling for risk assessment.					zucca, francesco/0000-0003-4119-5484												0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9760-4				2013	8891								88910D	10.1117/12.2032173								WOS:000327079900010

Here, we sought to discover the previously unknown microhabitats of nymphs of the primary vector, the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus), in 3 moderately to heavily-utilized state parks in the Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles County; to elucidate the seasonal distribution and abundance of adults of I. pacificus and another human-biter, the Pacific Coast tick (Dermacentor occidentalis); and to determine what Lyme-disease or relapsing-fever group borreliae are present in questing nymphs or adult ticks. I. pacificus nymphs were collected infrequently at various times of day in 2 chaparral or 7 woodland litter areas by dragging (combined mean = 0.4 nymphs per hour). The western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) was a choice sentinel animal for detecting the presence of I. pacificus nymphs (and larvae) in diverse biotopes even when dragging litter in them was fruitless. The abundance and seasonality of I. pacificus and D. occidentalis adults resembled what had been documented previously for these ticks in northern California. Overall, zero of 27 free-living and 118 lizard-infesting I. pacificus nymphs, 7 (0.29%) of 2392 I. pacificus adults and 2 (0.22%) of 896 D. occidentalis adults were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb sl), but none of them harbored B. miyamotoi, a relapsing-fever group spirochete implicated recently as a zoonotic pathogen in Russia. Borrelia americana and the human pathogen B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were each detected in one (0.04%), and uncharacterized Bb sl in 5 adult I. pacificus (0.21%) that clustered with B. americana. Both PCR-positive D. occidentalis adults contained B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. We conclude that the acarologic risk of being bitten by a B. burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ixodid tick in the habitats studied is slight, which offers a plausible explanation for the low reported incidence of Lyme disease in south coastal California.

J	Keledjian, AJ; Mesnick, S				Keledjian, Amanda J.; Mesnick, Sarah			The Impacts of El Nino Conditions on California Sea Lion (Zalophus californianus) Fisheries Interactions: Predicting Spatial and Temporal Hotspots Along the California Coast	AQUATIC MAMMALS												California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are often viewed as a sentinel species whose health can be affected by prevailing oceanographic conditions and environmental quality. For this reason, it has become increasingly important to study natural stressors and anthropogenic impacts that can lead to diminished health and survival among individuals of this coastal species. In this study, Z. californianus stranding records spanning 1983 to 2010 were used to first identify regional and seasonal fisheries interaction hotspots in California, and second, to examine how these hotspots might change under additional environmental stress induced by El Nino oceanographic conditions that can affect prey availability. Analyzing mean monthly fisheries interaction cases as an example of human-related stranding revealed that (1) the number of monthly fisheries interaction cases has risen significantly over time proportional to statewide abundance estimates; (2) cases were significantly higher in Monterey, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties; (3) cases peaked May through August; and (4) fisheries interactions were significantly greater during El Nino conditions throughout the state. These results indicated that over a 27-y period, California sea lion health was affected by oceanographic conditions and that anthropogenic impacts may be heightened in early summer following the weaning period when young animals learning to forage may be less successful in El Nino conditions. Spatially and temporally explicit data such as these can be useful in mapping marine mammal health and understanding the dynamic natural and anthropogenic landscapes in which they are a part.																	0167-5427						2013	39	3					221	232		10.1578/AM.39.3.2013.221								WOS:000323549300002

Field and laboratory studies on Corridor disease (Theileria parva infection) in cattle population at the livestock/game interface of uPhongolo-Mkuze area, South Africa	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Corridor disease (Theileria parva infection in cattle associated with carrier buffaloes) had not been reported to cause serious outbreaks in South Africa prior to 1994. In recent years, there has been an increase in the introduction of T. parva-infected buffaloes onto private game parks in Northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The objectives of this study were to investigate the number of T. parva outbreaks in cattle at the livestock/wildlife interface and to establish the possible T. parva carrier status in cattle which were diagnosed to have recovered from clinical disease. The occurrence of outbreaks was closely monitored from 2004 to 2009 covering a total of 15 localities. The observations included the number of cattle involved in the outbreaks, clinical signs, parasitological and post-mortem examinations, as well as serological and molecular tests specific for T. parva. Sentinel cattle were introduced to monitor tick transmission and some of these recovered from clinical T. parva infection in the field and confirmed to be positive by PCR, were challenged using lethal T. parva stabilates to ascertain their immune status. Thirty-one Corridor disease outbreaks were recorded during the study period. Of the 846 cattle tested for Corridor disease during the study period, 140(16.5%) were found positive by the real time PCR and IFA tests. Eighty-two (9.7%) cattle were found positive by the IFA test only. The prevalence of T. parva infection was 26.2%. Adult R. appendiculatus fed as nymphs on 5 bovines which recovered from clinical T. parva infection in the field transmitted only T. taurotragi to susceptible bovines. However, 8 of the field-recovered cattle resisted lethal challenge using T. parva tick stabilate. Though the study could not demonstrate cattle-to-cattle transmission by ticks using 5 previously infected cattle in the field, it is suggested that Corridor disease should be considered a potential emerging disease, and more stringent control methods should be implemented.

Coris julis (Linneaus, 1758) was chosen as a sentinel organism, and the specimens were collected from three well-known sites along the Ionic coast of Sicily: the protected marine area (P.M.A) "Cyclops Islands" of Acitrezza (CT), used as a control site, Riposto (CT), and the industrial site of Augusta (SR). Abiotic levels of contaminants were also detected. High levels of biotic and abiotic accumulation were found at the industrial site in which the presence of genotoxic and oxidative damage were also evidenced, measured by Micronuclei, Alkaline and Fpg-modified Comet assays. The protein expression analysis showed metallothioneins (MTs) as good tissue-specific markers of metal accumulation. Their levels were significantly higher in muscle than in liver tissue for all the sampling sites, with a positive correlation among tissue levels and the degree of pollution at the sites. Conversely, heat shock proteins 70 (HSP70) expression was higher in Augusta and Riposto than in the control site, but no significant difference was found between the examined tissues among all sites.

Mercury sources and fate in the Gulf of Maine	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Most human exposure to mercury (Hg) in the United States is from consuming marine fish and shellfish. The Gulf of Maine is a complex marine ecosystem comprising twelve physioregions, including the Bay of Fundy, coastal shelf areas and deeper basins that contain highly productive fishing grounds. Here we review available data on spatial and temporal Hg trends to better understand the drivers of human and biological exposures. Atmospheric Hg deposition from U.S. and Canadian sources has declined since the mid-1990s in concert with emissions reductions and deposition from global sources has increased. Oceanographic circulation is the dominant source of total Hg inputs to the entire Gulf of Maine region (59%), followed by atmospheric deposition (28%), wastewater/industrial sources (8%) and rivers (5%). Resuspension of sediments increases MeHg inputs to overlying waters, raising concerns about benthic trawling activities in shelf regions. In the near coastal areas, elevated sediment and mussel Hg levels are co-located in urban embayments and near large historical point sources. Temporal patterns in sentinel species (mussels and birds) have in some cases declined in response to localized point source mercury reductions but overall Hg trends do not show consistent declines. For example, levels of Hg have either declined or remained stable in eggs from four seabird species collected in the Bay of Fundy since 1972. Quantitatively linking Hg exposures from fish harvested from the Gulf of Maine to human health risks is challenging at this time because no data are available on the geographic origin of seafood consumed by coastal residents. In addition, there is virtually no information on Hg levels in commercial species for offshore regions of the Gulf of Maine where some of the most productive fisheries are located. Both of these data gaps should be priorities for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Higher levels of catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferases (GST) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) were observed in the hepatopancreas of T. maxima and in the liver of E. men-a compared to muscle. CAT and TBARs levels were significantly higher in the hepatopancreas of clams collected from the impacted site (Vaiare) compared to the reference site (bay of Cook). The same pattern was observed for TBARs levels in the liver of E. men-a. These results indicate that both organisms from the impacted site were exposed to contaminants leading to an oxidative stress and demonstrate, for the first time, the usefulness of T. maxima and E. men-a as sentinel species for biomonitoring reef environments.

Imposex levels in P. morio from Ceara River Estuary were assessed by a non-lethal method. The obtained imposex parameters were: percentage = 37.1 %, female penis length index (FPLI) = 0.93 mm, relative penis length index (RPLI) = 6.5 %, and vas deferens sequence index (VDSI) = 1.0. Because imposex is induced by tributyltin, and P. morio is widely distributed on the East coast of South America, the species can be used as a tributyltin contamination sentinel in these estuaries. Additionally, a non-lethal method of evaluating imposex minimized the impact on the population of P. morio from sample collection, as all organisms were returned to the environment.

Alonso			Health Assessment and Seroepidemiologic Survey of Potential Pathogens in Wild Antillean Manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus)	PLOS ONE												The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus), a subspecies of the West Indian manatee, inhabits fresh, brackish, and warm coastal waters distributed along the eastern border of Central America, the northern coast of South America, and throughout the Wider Caribbean Region. Threatened primarily by human encroachment, poaching, and habitat degradation, Antillean manatees are listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The impact of disease on population viability remains unknown in spite of concerns surrounding the species' ability to rebound from a population crash should an epizootic occur. To gain insight on the baseline health of this subspecies, a total of 191 blood samples were collected opportunistically from wild Antillean manatees in Belize between 1997 and 2009. Hematologic and biochemical reference intervals were established, and antibody prevalence to eight pathogens with zoonotic potential was determined. Age was found to be a significant factor of variation in mean blood values, whereas sex, capture site, and season contributed less to overall differences in parameter values. Negative antibody titers were reported for all pathogens surveyed except for Leptospira bratislava, L. canicola, and L. icterohemorrhagiae, Toxoplasma gondii, and morbillivirus. As part of comprehensive health assessment in manatees from Belize, this study will serve as a benchmark aiding in early disease detection and in the discernment of important epidemiologic patterns in the manatees of this region. Additionally, it will provide some of the initial tools to explore the broader application of manatees as sentinel species of nearshore ecosystem health.

Heavy metals and related biomarkers in Perna viridis (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) collected on the coast of Sucre State, Venezuela	CIENCIAS MARINAS												The green mussel Perna viridis has been used as a sentinel organism in marine and coastal ecosystem health assessments. In this study the degree of contamination at three sites on the coast of Sucre State (Venezuela) was analyzed using molecular, cellular, and immunological biomarkers in P viridis. Specimens were collected from Chacopata-Guayacan (CG, Araya Peninsula), Rio Caribe (RC, Paria Peninsula), and San Antonio del Golfo (SAG, southern Gulf of Cariaco). We determined the concentration of heavy metals in the soft tissue of each individual, as well as the total number, viability, phagocytosis, and stability of the lysosomal membranes in hemocytes. The oxidative damage to lipids (TBARS), sulfhydryl group levels, total proteins, and lysozyme activity were quantified in the digestive gland. The results revealed high concentrations of Zn, Cr, and Cd in the organisms from CG. The total hemolymph cell count was lower in organisms from RC and CG A slight increase in the number of phagocytes was observed in the organisms from RC and CG relative to those from SAG. The highest percentage of hemocytes with destabilized lysosomal membranes was recorded for the organisms from CG, followed by RC, indicating a weak association with the content of peroxidized lipids (TBARS); these values could be associated with the body loads of heavy metals.. According to the results, the mussels from CG show slight signs of contamination by heavy metals, likely originated by human activities. The use of biological markers to estimate the effect of heavy metals on sentinel organisms is recommended.																	0185-3880					SEP	2012	38	3					517	528		10.7773/cm.v38i3.2046								WOS:000309309500004

A recurrent feature at both the population and community level was the differentiation of the samples along the increasing PCB levels simultaneously registered in the sediments. Both directly transmitted ectoparasites and endoparasites with complex life-cycles transmitted via food chains exhibited a decrease in abundance with the increase in PCB levels. Parasite numerical responses translated into significant differences in infracommunity structure with decreasing predictability associated with increasing PCB levels. The abundance of two species, the specialist Opecoeloides furcatus and the generalist nematode Hysterothylacium fabri, contributed substantially to the observed dissimilarity between infracommunity samples along the gradient. The observed parasite responses to moderate levels of pollution were simultaneously validated by both chemical monitoring and effect biomarkers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on histological observations, L. pholis ovarian development in adult is asynchronous, and 7 ovarian germ cells can be described (oogonia, early and late perinuclear oocytes, cortical-alveolar oocytes, early vitellogenic oocytes, vitellogenic oocytes and spawning oocytes). Using a stereological approach together with the morphologic characteristics of ovarian cells, the ovarian cycle of L. pholis was divided into 3 maturation stages: early oogenesis (May); mid-oogenesis (September), and spawning (November to January). Ovarian cell proportions and gonadosomatic index confirmed that the reproductive period of L. pholis near the southern limit of distribution of the species occurs during cold-water periods, between November and May. The collected data will help to fill some of the gaps in information that still exist on L. pholis oogenesis, thus allowing a better integration of this species as a sentinel for the detection of contaminants in European coastal waters.

Sampling activities and laboratory analyses have been carried out on two sentinel species, the blackbelly rosefish, Helicolenus daclylopterus, and the European conger, Conger conger, collected in a CWA dumping site 35 nm from the coast of Apulia, Italy, and from a reference site. Fish were analyzed through an ecotoxicological approach, integrating chemical analysis and biological responses. Degradation products of the blister agents bis-(2-chloroethyl)sulphide, commonly known as mustard agent or yperite (also called sulfur or sulfur mustard), were found in sediment samples collected nearby aerial bombs. Although no evidence of these compounds was detected in tissues of either fish, levels of heavy metals (arsenic and mercury), potentially released by rusted chemical weapons, were significantly higher in sediment and fish from the CWA site compared to the reference site. Severe external and internal lesions were observed in fish captured in the CWA site, with congers displaying small to large skin ulcers along the body. Health assessment index (HAI) values, as well as spleen melano-macrophages centres and CYP1A ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity were higher in fish from the CWA site, indicating a chronic state of illness and environment degradation. The working procedures and analyses performed during these surveys could be suitable for future biomonitoring studies in other CWA dumping sites.

Crabs from two mangrove sites, Korangi creek and Sandspit were sampled every month during Mar 2001 to Feb 2002 to study their populations. The average density of crabs ranged between 1 to 24 m(-2). For the density distribution, the nested design ANOVA showed no significant difference between stations, but significant difference within seasons and different tidal height (low tide level) at Sandspit and significant difference among tidal level at Korangi creek were observed. Significantly more small sized crabs were observed at the lower intertidal region. The present study demonstrates the importance of substratum characteristics in influencing the distribution and abundance of these sentinal crabs. 't' test showed carapace width (CW) of male and female crabs were significantly different at Sandspit and Korangi creek. The recruitment of juvenile crabs (CW < 5 mm) was observed throughout the year and the presence of ovigerous females from October to May indicated seasonal reproduction. The average size of ovigerous females was CW= 10.4 mm and the smallest ovigerous female was CW =7.0 mm.																	0030-9923					MAY-JUN	2012	44	3					615	623										WOS:000305718900002						
J	Castro, IB; Fillmann, G				Castro, Italo Braga; Fillmann, Gilberto			High tributyltin and imposex levels in the commercial muricid Thais chocolata from two Peruvian harbor areas	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The first appraisal of butyltin (BT) contamination linked with imposex incidence in Peruvian coastal areas was performed in the present study. Imposex occurrence and BT levels in female bodies were analyzed in the rock snail Thais chocolata distributed along 10 sites in areas under the influence of Callao and Chimbote Harbors. Imposex levels associated to high tributyltin (TBT) concentrations were observed in six of 10 studied sites, and the highest imposex levels were seen in gastropods collected near the harbor terminals. Tributyltin concentrations were the highest reported for gastropod mollusks (up to 662?ng?Sn?g-1) in recent studies. Although TBT-based antifouling paints have been banned globally (International Maritime Organization, 2008), the combination of high imposex and TBTs level with butyltin degradation index values indicated fresh TBT inputs in these Peruvian coastal areas. Thus, the need to implement local regulatory strategies related to the use of TBT-free antifouling paints is urgent, as is a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of the TBT global ban. Moreover, the wide distribution of T. chocolata combined with its capability to elicit imposex and bioaccumulate BTs renders this a good sentinel species for TBT contamination along the western South American coast.

A total of 235 cloacal swabs from 147 live-captured and 88 hunter-harvested mottled ducks during summer (June August 2007) and winter (November 2007 to January 2008), respectively, were collected along the upper Texas coast. Samples were screened for AIV using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR); all rRT-PCR positive samples were processed for virus isolation. Three samples were positive for AIV by AIV-matrix rRT-PCR. One of these samples also was positive for H5 by rRT-PCR, and a low pathogenic H5N2 AIV was isolated. Although isolation of AIVs from mottled ducks during the winter has been reported previously, to the authors' lcnowledge, this is the first H5 isolate from mottled ducks. Interestingly, this isolation was made during the same season that other H5N2 viruses were obtained from migratory waterfowl on the Texas coast, which suggests AIV transmission among waterfowl on the wintering grounds and the potential role of mottled ducks as a naturally occurring sentinel species for AIV surveillance.

Chromatin specialization in bivalve molluscs: A leap forward for the evaluation of Okadaic Acid genotoxicity in the marine environment	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Marine biotoxins synthesized by Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) represent one of the most important sources of contamination in marine environments as well as a serious threat to fisheries and aquaculture-based industries in coastal areas. Among these biotoxins Okadaic Acid (OA) is of critical interest as it represents the most predominant Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning biotoxin in the European coasts. Furthermore, OA is a potent tumor promoter with aneugenic and clastogenic effects on the hereditary material, most notably DNA breaks and alterations in DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, a great effort has been devoted to the biomonitoring of OA in the marine environment during the last two decades, mainly based on physicochemical and physiological parameters using mussels as sentinel organisms. However, the molecular genotoxic effects of this biotoxin make chromatin structure a good candidate for an alternative strategy for toxicity assessment with faster and more sensitive evaluation. To date, the development of chromatin-based studies to this purpose has been hampered by the complete lack of information on chromatin of invertebrate marine organisms, especially in bivalve molluscs. Our preliminary results have revealed the presence of histone variants involved in DNA repair and chromatin specialization in mussels and clams. In this work we use this information to put forward a proposal focused on the development of chromatin-based tests for OA genotoxicity in the marine environment. The implementation of such tests in natural populations has the potential to provide an important leap in the biomonitoring of this biotoxin. The outcome of such monitoring may have critical implications for the evaluation of DNA damage in these marine organisms. They will provide as well important tools for the optimization of their harvesting and for the elaboration of additional tests designed to evaluate the safety of their consumption and potential implications for consumer's health.

Populations at low densities may offer an unobstructed view of basic environmental and physiological interactions that impact individual fitness and thus population productivity. The energy reserves of an organism are reflected in its body condition, a measure linking individual fitness and the environment. From 1997 to 2007, we monitored the critically endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) population on its primary summer feeding ground off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia. This effort resulted in a large data set of photo-identification images from 5,007 sightings of 168 individual whales that we used to visually assess western gray whale body condition. We quantified temporal variation in the resulting 1,539 monthly body condition determinations with respect to observations of reproductive status and sex. Western gray whale body condition varied annually, and we identified years of significantly better (2004) and worse ((999, 2006, and 2007) body condition. This study is the 1st to track the within-season body condition of individual whales. Body condition improved significantly as the summer progressed, although results suggest that not all whales replenish their energy stores by the end of the season. The body condition of lactating females was significantly worse than that of other whales at all times and was most often determined to be compromised. The body condition of their weaning calves exhibited no temporal variation and was consistently good. It is possible lactating females provide an energetic buffer to their offspring at the expense of their own body condition and future reproductive success. Findings from the analysis establish a foundation for quantifying links between western gray whale body condition, demographic parameters, and environmental conditions; and provide a baseline for monitoring individual and population condition of an ecosystem sentinel species in a changing environment. Overall, this study highlights the presence of density-independent environmental and physiological mechanisms that affect the abundance and growth of populations.

Lymphatic filariasis mapping by Immunochromatographic Test cards and baseline microfilaria survey prior to mass drug administration in Sierra Leone	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: National mapping of lymphatic filariasis (LF) was conducted using Immunochromatographic tests (ICT) in 2005 to determine endemicity and geographic spread of the disease. A baseline microfilaria survey was then conducted to determine LF prevalence and microfilaria intensity. Methods: In 2005 1,982 persons of 15 years and over from 14 health districts were selected and fingertip blood samples were tested with ICT cards. In 2007-8 blood samples were taken between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. and examined for microfilaria (mf) from 9,288 persons from 16 sentinel sites representing each district and 2 additional sites for districts with populations over 500,000 (Bo and Kenema). Results: The overall LF prevalence by ICT cards was 21% (males 28%, females 15%). All districts had a prevalence of Wuchereria bancrofti antigen > 1%. Distribution of LF prevalence showed a strong spatial correlation pattern with high prevalence in a large area in the northeast gradually decreasing to a relatively low prevalence in the southwest coast. High prevalence was found in the northeast, Bombali (52%), Koinadugu (46%), Tonkolili (37%) and Kono (30%). Low prevalence was found in the southwest, Bonthe (3%) and Pujehun (4%). The mf prevalence was higher in the northeast: Bombali, 6.7%, Koinadugu 5.7%, Port Loko 4.4% and Kono 2.4%. Overall there was a significant difference in mf prevalence by gender: males 2.9%, females 1.8% (p = 0.0002) and within districts in Kailahun, Kono, Port Loko, Moyamba and Koinadugu (all p < 0.05). The mf prevalence was higher in people > 20 years (2.5%) than in people = 20 years (1.7%) (p = 0.043). The overall arithmetic mean mf density was 50.30 mf/ml among mf-positive individuals and 1.19 mf/ml in the population examined which varied significantly between districts. Conclusions: The ICT results showed that LF was endemic nationwide and that preventive chemotherapy (PCT) was justified across the country. Both the ICT and microfilaraemia surveys found that prevalence was greater in males than females. The increase in microfilaraemia prevalence by age was evident when grouped as = 20 versus > 20 years demonstrating early exposure. Baseline LF microfilaria load will be used to monitor PCT program progress.																	1756-3305					JAN 11	2012	5								10	10.1186/1756-3305-5-10								WOS:000300372900001	22236419

Mussels were sampled seasonally at five sites (mariculture Lim, Pula and Rijeka harbours, industrialized site Bakar and reference site Brestova) in the period from March 2002 to October 2007. Mussels from mariculture site Lim and reference site Brestova generally displayed good health conditions. The highest level of general stress in mussels was mostly evident at sites in the inner part of Pula and Rijeka harbours and to a lesser extent at industrialized site Bakar. Temporal changes revealed improvement trends of the mussels' health status at site Lim. The evaluation of lysosomal membrane stability confirmed to be a useful tool for discrimination of stressed from non-stressed marine environments and revealed long - term trends during the assessment of marine water quality.																	0001-5113						2012	53	3		1			457	466										WOS:000318670500012

Monitoring Temporal Abundance and Spatial Distribution of Aedes polynesiensis Using BG-Sentinel Traps in Neighboring Habitats on Raiatea, Society Archipelago, French Polynesia	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Adult numbers and sizes of mosquitoes were monitored for 2 yr in neighboring habitats on the western coast of Raiatea (Society Archipelago) in anticipation of testing new vector control technologies. Aedes polynesiensis Marks females comprised the overwhelming majority (approximate to 99%) of the three species of mosquitoes captured in Biogent Sentinel traps placed at fixed sites on three small satellite islands (motus) of the western lagoon and on the shoreline of Raiatea. Aedes polynesiensis males, Aedes aegypti (L.), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say rarely were collected. Numbers of Ae. polynesiensis females per collection differed among trapping dates and locations, with the majority of females captured on two mob's, Horea and Toamaro. Shoreline and Horea females had significantly longer mean wing lengths than females from Tiano and Toamaro. Thus, wing lengths were influenced more by local developmental conditions than overall numbers of adults. Significantly more females were captured during the wet season than the dry season. Nonetheless, at least on the two highly productive motus, dry-season females had larger wing lengths than their wet season counterparts. Local weather patterns predicted about half the variation in mosquito numbers. Differences in vector abundance observed when comparing neighboring motus are likely because of differences in human activity and mosquito suppression.

Testes specific accumulation of tributyltin in turbot Scophthalmus maximus from the southern Baltic Sea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Concentrations of tributyltin (TBT) and its breakdown products, dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MTB), were measured in tissues of male turbot Scophthalmus maximus from the Gulf of Gdansk (GDA) and the Pomeranian Bay (POM) in the southern Baltic Sea. The fish (n = 206) were collected during the spawning seasons of 2008-2009. All specimens were at the same maturity stage and in full breeding condition. The ripe testes of the turbot appeared to be a target tissue for TBT accumulation. We report that TBT is extensively eliminated at the specific whole-body level and that the males from TBT-contaminated location (GDA) reach this specific level at 23-24 cm in total length.

Mature males were used to determine the annual maturation cycle, using a stereological approach. The spermatogenic cycle was classified into three stages: early spermatogenesis (May), mid spermatogenesis (September), and spawning (November and January). The testes were asynchronously arranged with various cell types observable during all seasons, although in different proportions. Gonadosomatic index and spermatozoa proportions confirmed the established reproductive season. Differences between the sampled populations and those from septentrional locations are discussed, namely the absence of "resting" and "spent" periods.

The use of limpets as monitor of PAHs pollution in the Cantabrian coast	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The concentrations of 24 parental and methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels in common limpet (Patella vulgata) were measured in 15 coastal localities of the southern Bay of Biscay and 2 sites per locality for 2 years (spring and autumn of 2004 and 2005, respectively). Although the average concentrations shown a wide variability among the sites and the season, several sites showed a remarkable high concentration (PAH(tot) > 900 ng g(-1) d.w.) or medium (300-800 ng g(-1) d.w) levels, but in most of the cases the initial high concentrations decreased sharply from one campaign to the following. Moreover, based on ratios of individual isomers concentration, petrogenic and pyrolitic sources were distinguished suggesting more than one source. Finally, based on the results of this work and comparing with previously reported data, it can concluded that limpets can be used as sentinel organisms in coastal environmental monitoring, even when oil spills are involved.

CHEMOSPHERE												The reproductive cycle of bivalves is regulated by several natural environmental factors but exposure to chemical pollutants can also interfere and may result in advanced or delayed spawning season. To our knowledge, the gametogenic cycle of the suspension-feeder bivalve Donax trunculus has not yet been used as biomonitoring tool in ecotoxicological surveys. The aim of this study was to examine over a year physiological reproductive endpoints (sex-ratio, gametogenic and energy reserve cycles) and biological indices (condition index, allometry) in D. trunculus originating from two sites differing by their level of contamination. Specimens were collected bimonthly from November 2008 to October 2009 from a polluted site (Rades Meliane) and a comparatively reference site (Sidi Jehmi) in the Gulf of Tunis (Tunisia). Five stages were depicted by histological examination of gonads: undifferentiated, developing, mature, spawn and spent. Differences in the gametogenic cycle according to the site of origin of bivalves were observed. The spawning period began in March and was maximum in May in bivalves from both sites, but the percentage of spawning animals was higher in the polluted site vs the reference site. The spawning period was shorter in animals from the polluted site comparatively to the reference site. Energy reserves (glycogen, lipids) were higher in March and May comparatively to the other studied periods in bivalves from both sites. Lower energy reserves levels were usually observed in animals from the polluted site compared to the reference site. Seasonal variations of the condition index were associated to the reproductive and nutritive status of bivalves. Differences in allometry were depicted between bivalves from both studied sites. If we try to link allometry, energy reserves and reproduction, it can be hypothesized that for bivalves from the reference site, energy reserves are allocated to gametogenesis and length growth. For bivalves from the polluted site, energy reserves could be devoted to tolerance to chemical stress and to reproductive processes. Therefore, D. trunculus appears as a suitable sentinel species for the assessment of the ecotoxicological risk of contaminants such as endocrine disruptors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Rubella during pregnancy can cause serious fetal abnormalities and death. Peru has had integrated measles/rubella surveillance since 2000 but did not implement congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) surveillance until 2004, in accordance with the Pan American Health Organization recommendations for rubella elimination. The article describes the experience from the CRS sentinel surveillance system in Peru. Methods. Peru has maintained a national sentinel surveillance system for reporting confirmed and suspected CRS cases since 2004. A surveillance protocol was implemented with standardized case definitions and instruments in the selected sentinel sites. Each sentinel site completes their case investigations and report forms and sends the reports to the Health Region Epidemiology Department, which forwards the data to the national Epidemiology Department. CRS surveillance data were analyzed for the period 2004-2007. Results. During the period 2004-2007, 16 health facilities, which are located in 9 of the 33 health regions, representing the 3 main geographical areas (coast, mountain, and jungle), were included as sentinel sites for the CRS surveillance. A total of 2061 suspected CRS cases were reported to the system. Of these, 11 were classified as CRS and 23 as congenital rubella infection. Factors significantly associated with rubella vertical transmission were: (1) in the mother, maternal history of rash during pregnancy (odds ratio [OR], 12.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-37.8); (2) and in the infant, pigmentary retinopathy (OR, 18.4; 95% CI, 3.2-104.6), purpura (OR, 14.7; 95% CI, 2.8-78.3), and developmental delay (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.75-11.1). Conclusions. The surveillance system has been able to identify rubella vertical transmission, reinforcing the evidence that rubella was a public health problem in Peru. This system may serve as a platform to implement surveillance for other congenital infections in Peru.																	0022-1899					SEP 1	2011	204			2			S706	S712		10.1093/infdis/jir407								WOS:000295511800024	21954270

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMPOSEX AND TRIBUTYLTIN (TBT) CONCENTRATION IN STROMBUS GIGAS FROM THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												The queen conch, Strombus gigas (Linnaeus, 1758), was collected from sites with substantial boating activity and adjacent reference sites from the British Virgin Islands in 2008-2009 to determine the incidence and severity of imposex. Comparisons were made to a previous study by Phillip (2000) in the same area to determine if there were any changes in imposex over the last decade. Imposex was present in S. gigas at all sites with boating activity, but not found in individuals collected at reference sites. Tributyltin (TBT) and its degradative product, dibutyltin (DBT), were found in S. gigas, turtle grass, Thalassia testidium (Banks ex Konig), and marine algae from sites with known point sources of TBT. We established a relationship between the highest incidence and severity of imposex and TBT concentrations in the tissues of S. gigas from sites with elevated boating activity (Road Harbour > Nanny Cay > Trellis Bay), suggesting that TBT, a known inducer of imposex in female prosobranch gastropods, is the causative agent. Strombus gigas is the second most important commercial fishery species in the Caribbean and any factors that could affect reproduction and population ecology are important in maintaining a viable population and managing a sustainable fishery. We suggest using S. gigas as a sentinel of TBT pollution despite not meeting all of the recommended criterion, such as lack of non-dispersive larvae.																	0007-4977					JUL	2011	87	3					421	435		10.5343/bms.2010.1093								WOS:000292994500009

The characteristic development of Intersex in L. littorea has been widely applied as a biomarker for tributyltin (TBT) contamination. Here, we assess the potential of L. littorea as a novel sentinel species for evaluating the sublethal effects in wild populations of widely distributed contaminants. We collected animals from six sites across the South coast of England. Tissue concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organotin compounds (OTCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured and compared with biomarkers of damage to DNA (Cornet assay), lysosomal stability (NRR assay), and endocrine disruption (Intersex development). There was a strong correlation between DNA damage and PAH bioaccumulation (n = 6, r = 0.84, p < 0.05), as well as that between Intersex development and OTC pollution (n = 6, r = 0.91, p < 0.05). The relationship between PAH bioaccumulation and DNA strand breaks was nonlinear, highlighting the need to consider the role of adaptive mechanisms in the interpretation of field results. These results illustrate the potential use of periwinkles for monitoring a wide range of priority pollutants.

Along the Bohai coast of China, there are dominantly distributed three species of clams (White, Liangdao Red and Zebra in Yantai population) endowed with distinct tolerances to environmental stressors. In this study, adductor muscle samples were collected from both control and acute mercury exposed White, Liangdao Red and Zebra clams, and the extracts were analyzed by NMR-based metabolomics to compare the metabolic profiles and responses to the acute mercury exposure to determine the most sensitive clam species capable of acting as abioindicator for heavy metal pollution monitoring. The major abundant metabolites in the White clam sample were branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), lactate, arginine, aspartate, acetylcholine, homarine and ATP/ADP, while the metabolite profile of Zebra clam sample comprised high levels of glutamine, acetoacetate, betaine, taurine and one unidentified metabolite. For the Liangdao Red clam sample, the metabolite profile relatively exhibited high amount of branched-chain amino acids, arginine, glutamate, succinate, acetylcholine, homarine and two unassigned metabolites. After 48h exposure of 20 mu g L-1 Hg2+, the metabolic profiles showed significant differences between three clam species, which included increased lactate, succinate, taurine, acetylcholine, betaine and homarine and decreased alanine, arginine, glutamine, glutamate, acetoacetate, glycine and ATP/ADP in White clam samples, and elevated succinate, taurine and acetylcholine, and declined glutamine, glycine, and aspartate in Liangdao Red clam samples, while the increased branched-chain amino acids, lactate, succinate, acetylcholine and homarine, and reduced alanine, acetoacetate, glycine and taurine were observed in the Zebra clam samples. Overall, our findings showed that White clams could be a preferable bioindicator for the metal pollution monitoring based on the more sensitive metabolic changes in the adductor muscle compared with other two (Liangdao Red and Zebra) clam species.

J	Bellucci, CJ; Becker, M; Beauchene, M				Bellucci, Christopher J.; Becker, Mary; Beauchene, Mike			Characteristics of Macroinvertebrate and Fish Communities From 30 Least Disturbed Small Streams in Connecticut	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Water quality programs in Connecticut and nationally have focused on restoring impaired waters, while modest attention has been allocated to healthy watersheds in the least disturbed condition. The objective of our study was to document the geographic location of least disturbed streams in Connecticut, describe the aquatic biota from these systems, and describe important environmental variables that may help explain the distribution of these biota. We used geographic information systems to select drainage basins by their natural attributes and by eliminating anthropogenic stressor variables in order to best approximate a least disturbed watershed condition in Connecticut. We then sampled the fish and macroinvertebrate communities, water chemistry, and associated GIS-derived watershed attributes to determine the variables that best described the sampled biota. We identified 30 least disturbed streams that had drainage areas <29 km(2), whose stream order ranged from 1-4, and that contained <4% total impervious cover in the upstream watershed. Least disturbed streams were generally located in three geographic areas of the state northwest Connecticut, northeast Connecticut, and the central Connecticut valley and were absent from the southern coast of Connecticut and southwestern Connecticut. Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling of macroinvertebrate taxa in the Orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera showed 3 macroinvertebrate stream classes, with 12 significant indicator species (P < 0.05). Drainage area, water temperature, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) may explain some of the differences in taxa between macroinvertebrate stream classes. Cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling of fish species also showed three fish stream classes, with 9 significant indicator species (P < 0.05). Drainage area, stratified drift, dam density, water temperature, total suspended solids, alkalinity, hardness, ammonia, TN, and TP may explain some of the differences in species between fish stream classes. Ninety percent of the least disturbed streams sampled contained Salvelinus fontinalis (Brook Trout), which can be considered a sentinel fish species for small, least disturbed streams in Connecticut.																	1092-6194						2011	18	4					411	444		10.1656/045.018.0402								WOS:000302828800002

Exposure to infectious agents in dogs in remote coastal British Columbia: Possible sentinels of diseases in wildlife and humans	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE VETERINAIRE												Ranked among the top threats to conservation worldwide, infectious disease is of particular concern for wild canids because domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) may serve as sources and reservoirs of infection. On British Columbia's largely undeveloped but rapidly changing central and north coasts, little is known about diseases in wolves (Canis lupus) or other wildlife. However, several threats exist for transfer of diseases among unvaccinated dogs and wolves. To gain baseline data on infectious agents in this area, including those with zoonotic potential, we collected blood and stool samples from 107 dogs in 5 remote communities in May and September 2007. Serology revealed that the dogs had been exposed to canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine respiratory coronavirus, and Leptospira interrogans. No dogs showed evidence of exposure to Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Dirofilaria immitis, or Cryptococcus gattii. Of 75 stool samples, 31 contained at least 1 parasitic infection, including Taeniid tapeworms, the nematodes Toxocara canis and Toxascaris leonina, and the protozoans Isospora sp., Giardia sp., Cryptosporidium sp., and Sarcocystis sp. This work provides a sound baseline for future monitoring of infectious agents that could affect dogs, sympatric wild canids, other wildlife, and humans.

Extreme ecosystems and geosystems in the Canadian High Arctic: Ward Hunt Island and vicinity	ECOSCIENCE												Global circulation models predict that the strongest and most rapid effects of global warming will take place at the highest latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Consistent with this prediction, the Ward Hunt Island region at the northern terrestrial limit of Arctic Canada is experiencing the onset of major environmental changes. This article provides a synthesis of research including new observations on the diverse geosystems/ecosystems of this coastal region of northern Ellesmere Island that extends to latitude 83.11 degrees N (Cape Aldrich). The climate is extreme, with an average annual air temperature of -17.2 degrees C, similar to Antarctic regions such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The region is geologically distinct (the Pearya Terrane) and contains steep mountainous terrain intersected by deep fiords and fluvial valleys. Numerous glaciers flow into the valleys, fiords, and bays, and thick multi-year sea ice and ice shelves occur along the coast. These extreme ice features are currently undergoing rapid attrition. The polar desert landscape contains sparse, discontinuous patches of vegetation, including dense stands of the prostrate shrub Salix arctica (Artic willow) at some sites, and 37 species of vascular plants on Ward Hunt Island. Diverse aquatic ecosystems occur throughout the area, including meromictic, epishelf, and perennially ice-covered lakes. Many of these have responded strongly to climate shifts in the past and like other geosystems/ecosystems of the region are now sentinels of ongoing global climate change.

In the first part of the study, range and pattern of AChE activity annual variation was established by monthly investigation of two populations of mussels originating from different natural habitats. No correlation of AChE activity and environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, oxygen) was found. Seasonal monitoring along the coast at sites with presumably different level and type of contamination was also performed in order to study the spatial and temporal trend of AChE activity in mussels, in relation to possible exposure to neurotoxic compounds. Significantly lower enzyme activity in comparison to reference site was recorded at sites in the close vicinity to urban and industrial areas (P and R). In addition, AChE activity decreased at the site within the area of Lim Bay (L1). AChE reduction in the gills of mussels, recorded mostly in the polluted harbours, could be related to the presence of common environmental pollutants. The results obtained in this study will be useful as background data for future biomonitoring surveys along the Adriatic coast using M. galloprovincialis as sentinel organisms.

Woody vegetative cover dynamics in response to recent climate change on an Atlantic coast barrier island: a remote sensing approach	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Considering impacts of predicted increases in sea-level, storms, and alterations in precipitation patterns on geomorphological and associated ecological processes, woody vegetation dynamics may serve as sentinels to climate change on barrier islands. We examined island-scale conversion of land (i.e. sand to grassland to woody cover) while relating the importance of climate variables on rate of woody expansion. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) was used to evaluate potential distribution of woody species based on distance to shoreline and elevation. Using Landsat TM imagery, we monitored changes in island size and vegetation classes (1984-2010). These comparisons revealed conversion of grassland to woody cover (285% increase) was closely linked to air temperature, precipitation and atmospheric [CO2]. LiDAR data indicated that woody species have not expanded completely into the potential range. Our results suggest that woody species are responsive to climate change, thus serving as sentinels on Virginia barrier islands.																	1010-6049						2011	26	8			SI		595	612		10.1080/10106049.2011.621031								WOS:000208631900002

The catalase, glutathione S-transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, acetycholinesterase activities; and metallothionein and malonediladehyde levels in gills were evaluated. Results revealed differences among sites in relation to each specific biomarker. Hence, a suite of biomarkers can be used to discriminate sampling sites according to types of pollution, reflecting differing conditions of anthropogenic impact. Based on Integrated Biomarker Response, the highest values and critical biochemical alteration were observed at Khniss and Ksibat in response to urban and industrial discharges and the lowest IBR value was found at reference site. The current study has shown clearly that a biomarker-based index is usefulness tool in the monitoring Tunisian coast using C. maenas as sentinel specie.

Validating a multi-biomarker approach with the shanny Lipophrys pholis to monitor oil spills in European marine ecosystems	CHEMOSPHERE												Oil spills are an importance source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the aquatic environment. Intertidal communities are particularly sensitive since most organisms from these ecosystems are sessile or present reduced mobility. Hence, it is important to validate the use of resident species as sentinels to characterize the impact of oil spills on the rocky shores and the improvement during the restoration process. Recently the advantages of using the shanny Lipophrys pholis in pollution monitoring within the northwestern Atlantic coast has been pointed out. Therefore, with the aim of further validating the use of L. pholis in pollution monitoring associated with petrogenic hydrocarbon contamination, a multi-biomarker approach study was carried out 1 week after a moderate oil spill from the waste treatment plant (WTP) of the major Portuguese refinery in the north of Portugal (Petrogal). Fish collected at 2 km from the accident displayed a significant induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD) and fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) in bile (up to a 5-fold induction) in comparison with the pre-spill scenario, and a 15% induction in erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA), a biomarker of genotoxicity. In contrast, no significant differences were recorded in the reference site. In order to better characterize the time-course accumulation of FACs in bile after a PAH insult, laboratory exposure of L pholis to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was performed. A clear dose response accumulation of B[a]P metabolites was observed that closely reflected nominal exposure concentrations already after 3 d. Overall, the findings of the present study highlight the potential of L. pholis in pollution monitoring dealing not only with chronic contamination, but also with oil spill accidents of a moderate scale. Taking into consideration that EROD and FACs determinations in L pholis are cost effective, rapid and easy to use, they offer a great potential to be incorporated into risk assessment of PAHs in the scope of national monitoring programs and the European Water Policy legislation.

The intra-sedimentary bivalve Donax trunculus commonly found in West Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts is a sentinel species useful for biomonitoring studies in sandy beaches. The objective of this work was to link responses at the infra-individual level (core biomarkers as early and sensitive tools) to supra-individual level (population for its ecological relevance). D. trunculus. originating from a polluted site (Rades Meliane) and a comparatively reference site (Sidi Jehmi) in the Gulf of Tunis (Tunisia), were collected bimonthly from November 2008 to October 2009. An increase in catalase activities was usually observed in bivalves from the polluted site compared to the reference site whereas no differences in TBARs were depicted. The anti-oxydant enzyme (catalase) could be able to prevent the deleterious effect on the lipid membranes. Usually GST activities were decreased in the polluted site. Significantly high inhibition in AChE activities in bivalves from the polluted site suggested neurotoxicity disturbances to their in situ exposure to compounds such as organophosphate and carbamates pesticides, heavy metals. Size-distribution of populations of D. trunculus from the polluted Rades Meliane site consisted of four cohorts whereas five cohorts were depicted in the comparatively reference Sidi Jehmi site. The mean total length size and the growth rate of cohorts were significantly reduced in the impacted site compared to the reference site. In conclusion, it may be suggested that disturbances in responses to chemical stress at the infra-individual level could be linked to the responses observed at the population level.

Here, we document the distribution of diatoms among the diverse habitat types and long environmental gradients represented by the shallow topographic relief of the South Florida, USA, coastline. A total of 592 species were encountered from 38 freshwater, mangrove, and marine locations in the Everglades wetland and Florida Bay during two seasonal collections, with the highest diversity occurring at sites of high salinity and low water column organic carbon concentration (WTOC). Freshwater, mangrove, and estuarine assemblages were compositionally distinct, but seasonal differences were only detected in mangrove and estuarine sites where solute concentration differed greatly between wet and dry seasons. Epiphytic, planktonic, and sediment assemblages were compositionally similar, implying a high degree of mixing along the shallow, tidal, and storm-prone coast. The relationships between diatom taxa and salinity, water total phosphorus (WTP), water total nitrogen (WTN), and WTOC concentrations were determined and incorporated into weighted averaging partial least squares regression models. Salinity was the most influential variable, resulting in a highly predictive model (r(apparent)(2)=0.97, r(jackknife)(2)=0.95) that can be used in the future to infer changes in coastal freshwater delivery or sea-level rise in South Florida and compositionally similar environments. Models predicting WTN (r(apparent)(2)=0.75, r(jackknife)(2)=0.46), WTP (r(apparent)(2)=0.75, r(jackknife)(2)= 0.49), and WTOC (r(apparent)(2)=0.79, r(jackknife)(2)=0.57) were also strong, suggesting that diatoms can provide reliable inferences of changes in solute delivery to the coastal ecosystem.																	1559-2723					SEP	2010	33	5					1080	1098		10.1007/s12237-010-9283-4								WOS:000282510200004

A guide to toxicity assessment and monitoring effects at lower levels of biological organization following marine oil spills in European waters	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The usefulness of applying biological-effects techniques (bioassays and biomarkers) as tools to assist in evaluating damage to the health of marine ecosystems produced by oil spills has been demonstrated clearly during recent decades. Guidelines are provided for the use of biological-effects techniques in oil spill pollution monitoring for the NE Atlantic coasts and the NW Mediterranean Sea. The emphasis is on fish and invertebrates and on methods at lower levels of organization (in vitro, suborganismal, and individual). Guidance is provided to researchers and environmental managers on: hazard identification of the fuel oil released; selection of appropriate bioassays and biomarkers for environmental risk assessment; selection of sentinel species; the design of spatial and temporal surveys; and the control of potential confounding factors in the sampling and interpretation of biological-effects data. It is proposed that after an oil spill incident, a monitoring programme using integrated chemical and biological techniques be initiated as soon as possible for ecological risk assessment, pollution control, and monitoring the efficacy of remediation.

Quantitative changes on liver mRNA levels of five stress-related genes - metallothionein (metal exposure), vitellogenin, (estrogenic effects), cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A, dioxin-like compounds), superoxide dismutase (oxidative stress) and HSP70 (general stress) - were tested as markers of exposure to pollutants both in natural populations and in experimental treatments with model effectors. Analysis of fish from a metal-contaminated site in the Tunisian coast (Sfax) indicated that fish presenting spinal deformities (eight times more frequent at this site than in reference sites) showed increased levels of hepatic CYP1A mRNA levels compared to non-deformed fish from the same site or from the reference Louza site, suggesting a combined impact by metals and organic pollutants. Due to the strategy used in their design, these quantitative RNA markers will likely be useful to analyze environmental impacts on other related fish species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

An epizootic of bovine ephemeral fever in New South Wales in 2008 associated with long-distance dispersal of vectors	AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL												Objective To report the rapid transmission of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) virus from north-western New South Wales south to the Victorian border in January 2008 and to present data that suggests an uncommon meteorological event caused this rapid southward dispersal of vectors. Procedure The locations of reported clinical cases, data from sentinel herds and results from a survey of cattle in the southern affected area were examined to delineate the distribution of virus transmission. Synoptic weather charts for January 2008 were examined for meteorological conditions that may have favoured movement of vectors in a southerly direction. Results Cases of BEF and exposure to BEF virus in NSW were confirmed west of the Great Dividing Range, extending from the Queensland border to Finley, on the far North Coast and around the Hunter Valley. A low-pressure system moved south across the state on 18-19 January 2008, preceding the first cases of BEF in the south of NSW by 1-2 days. Conclusion Heavy rainfall in December 2007 provided a suitable environment for vector breeding, resulting in the initiation of and support for continuing BEF virus transmission in north-western NSW. The movement of a low-pressure system south across central western NSW in mid-January 2008 after the commencement of BEF virus transmission in the north-west of the state provided a vehicle for rapid southward movement of infected vectors.

Eosinophilia and biotoxin exposure in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from a coastal area impacted by repeated mortality events	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting coastal waters in the northern Gulf of Mexico have been impacted by recurrent unusual mortality events over the past few decades. Several of these mortality events along the Florida panhandle have been tentatively attributed to poisoning from brevetoxin produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. While dolphins in other regions of the Florida coast are often exposed to K. brevis blooms, large-scale dolphin mortality events are relatively rare and the frequency and magnitude of die-offs along the Panhandle raise concern for the apparent vulnerability of dolphins in this region. We report results from dolphin health assessments conducted near St. Joseph Bay, Florida, an area impacted by 3 unusual die-offs within a 7-year time span. An eosinophilia syndrome, manifested as an elevated blood eosinophil count without obvious cause, was observed in 23% of sampled dolphins. Elevated eosinophil counts were associated with decreased T-lymphocyte proliferation and increased neutrophil phagocytosis. In addition, indication of chronic low-level exposure to another algal toxin, domoic acid produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp., was determined. Previous studies of other marine mammal populations exposed recurrently to Pseudo-nitzschia blooms have suggested a possible link between the eosinophilia and domoic acid exposure. While the chronic eosinophilia syndrome could over the long-term produce organ damage and alter immunological status and thereby increase vulnerability to other challenges, the significance of the high prevalence of the syndrome to the observed mortality events in the St. Joseph Bay area is unclear. Nonetheless, the unusual immunological findings and concurrent evidence of domoic acid exposure in this sentinel marine species suggest a need for further investigation to elucidate potential links between chronic, low-level exposure to algal toxins and immune health.

Hepatic metallothionein concentrations in the golden grey mullet (Liza aurata) - Relationship with environmental metal concentrations in a metal-contaminated coastal system in Portugal	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This Held survey was designed to assess the environmental metal contamination status of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal). To achieve that goal, the concentrations of Cd, Hg, Cu and Zn in the sediments and water were assessed and Liza aurata hepatic metallothionein (MT) determined. The relationships between MT and environmental metal concentrations and hydrological factors were examined. Results revealed a wide distribution of metals both in water and sediments throughout the lagoon, mainly at Rio Novo do Principe (RIO) and Laranjo (LAR), at concentrations that may affect biota. MT concentrations were higher at the sites with high metal content (RIO and LAR). A significant positive correlation was found between MT and Cd in the sediments as well as with MT and Hg and Cu in the water. Moreover, a negative correlation between MT and salinity was found. Thus, the current data support MT use as a biomarker of metal exposure emphasizing the importance of hydrological parameters in its concentrations. Results suggest the continued monitoring of this lagoon system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Metal concentration and structural changes in Corallina elongata (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) from hydrothermal vents	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Shallow-water hydrothermal activity is widely present at Azores archipelago. Organisms in such environments present great potential as sentinels of the effects derived from chronically exposure to increased temperature, metal concentrations and reduced pH. This study aimed to evaluate metal concentration in Corallina elongata collected at locations exposed and not exposed to shallow-water hydrothermal activity and evaluate changes in its calcareous structure. Elemental concentration was determined and morphometric analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy. Thicker cell walls and a bleached appearance were observed on C. elongata specimens from the hydrothermally active location, as well as increased concentrations of elements associated to volcanic activity. This study reports on metal accumulation and morphometric changes in the calcareous structure of C. elongata from a hydrothermally active location, adding new data for further research on such habitats and communities, providing an insight on how coralline algae might be affected by ocean acidification.

Invasion of the Lyme Disease Vector Ixodes scapularis: Implications for Borrelia burgdorferi Endemicity	ECOHEALTH												Lyme disease risk is increasing in the United States due in part to the spread of blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis, the principal vector of the spirochetal pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. A 5-year study was undertaken to investigate hypothesized coinvasion of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in Lower Michigan. We tracked the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tick and spirochete using mammal, bird, and vegetation drag sampling at eight field sites along coastal and inland transects originating in a zone of recent I. scapularis establishment. We document northward invasion of these ticks along Michigan's west coast during the study period; this pattern was most evident in ticks removed from rodents. B. burgdorferi infection prevalences in I. scapularis sampled from vegetation in the invasion zone were 9.3% and 36.6% in nymphs and adults, respectively, with the majority of infection (95.1%) found at the most endemic site. There was no evidence of I. scapularis invasion along the inland transect; however, low-prevalence B. burgdorferi infection was detected in other tick species and in wildlife at inland sites, and at northern coastal sites in years before the arrival of I. scapularis. These infections suggest that cryptic B. burgdorferi transmission by other vector-competent tick species is occurring in the absence of I. scapularis. Other Borrelia spirochetes, including those that group with B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii, were present at a low prevalence within invading ticks and local wildlife. Reports of Lyme disease have increased significantly in the invasion zone in recent years. This rapid blacklegged tick invasion-measurable within 5 years-in combination with cryptic pathogen maintenance suggests a complex ecology of Lyme disease emergence in which wildlife sentinels can provide an early warning of disease emergence.																	1612-9202					MAR	2010	7	1					47	63		10.1007/s10393-010-0287-0								WOS:000280595700007	20229127

Pleuritis and suppurative pneumonia associated with a hypermucoviscosity phenotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus)	VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY												The aim of this study is to document the isolation of a hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae from 25 cases of suppurative pneumonia and pleuritis and two cases of abscesses in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) from the central California coast, representing the first report of this zoonotic pathogen from the marine environment and only the second report in non-humans. Animals died 2 h to 4 days after first being observed sick on beaches. Clinical signs varied from dyspnoea to coma. Gross post-mortem examination of 25 cases revealed fibrinous pleuritis, copious pus in the pleural cavity and suppurative bronchopneumonia. K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from lung and pleural swabs and the hepatic and subcuticular abscesses were highly mucoid on blood agar culture media and were positive to the "string test". Twenty-one of the 27 isolates were examined by PCR and all were positive for rmpA and K2wyz and negative for K1magA genes. Although pneumonia and pleuritis have previously commonly been observed in marine mammals, their association with pure cultures of a zoonotic bacteria, K. pneumoniae HMV phenotype, has not. This report provides further evidence of the role marine mammals play as sentinels of health risks to humans from coastal waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Muscular cholinesterase activities and lipid peroxidation levels as biomarkers in several Mediterranean marine fish species and their relationship with ecological variables	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Muscular cholinesterase activities, as potential markers of neurotoxic exposure, and lipid peroxidation levels, indicative of oxidative stress damage, both currently used in early-warning pollution monitoring, were characterised in eighteen fish species of ecologic and/or economic importance. These species comprise five orders and eleven families of teleosts and two species of elasmobranchs, feed using different strategies (benthic, epilhenthic, endobenthic and pelagic), belong to different trophic levels and express different swimming behaviour. Their habitat ranges from 50 to 60 m (shallow or continental shelf) and 600 to 850 m (middle continental slope). Sampling took place in front of the Barcelona coast (NW Mediterranean) during four seasonal cruises in 2007. In the summer sampling, another site potentially exposed to a different pollution load (Vilanova) was included for comparison. Species, seasonal and site differences were tested and discussed in relation to chemical analysis of the local sediment, systematic position, habitat depth. feeding strategy, trophic level and swimming activity. Greater inter species differences rather than seasonal or site trends were seen in accordance to little pollution fluctuations. Higher cholinesterase activities were recorded in suprabenthos feeders, regardless of depth habitat, whereas LP levels were similar in all species except for the shark Scyliorhinus canicula in which they were consistently elevated. This study confirms and broadens former observations carried out with a more reduced number of fish species (Sold et al., 2008a). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

E-mail: silva_rcd@yahoo.com.br Toxoplasmosis is caused by the obligate intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and affects warm-blooded vertebrates, including pets and man. Dogs are epidemiologically important since they act as sentinels for the infection in humans. The present study aimed to determine the presence of antibodies to T. gondii in 205 serum samples from dogs in Ubatuba, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, through indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IFAT), as well as the risk factors related to toxoplasmosis in the animals such as breed, age, sex, access to outdoors, homemade food ingestion, access to untreated water, and contact with rodents. Toxoplasmosis-positive samples accounted for 52/205 (25.4%), with titers ranging from 16 to 256. The serological results presented significant association (P<0.05) with homemade food ingestion (45/118; 38.1%; CI95% 29.9%-47.2%) (OR=7.0; CI95% 3.0-16.6), and with access to outdoors where those that do not have access to the street were prevalent (37/121; 30.6%; CI95% 23.1%-39.3%) (OR=0.5; CI95% 0.2-1.0). These results show that toxoplasmosis in this region is related to problems of sanitary education, mainly concerning the appropriate cooking of foods, since most positive animals did not show significant association with the presence of rodents or untreated water consumption but showed, instead association with ingestion of homemade food. Thus, toxoplasmosis is a public health problem in the studied region, and sanitary measures are needed to control the infection due to the strict relationship between man and dog and the presented risk factors.				da Silva, Aristeu/D-2365-2010; Langoni, Helio/D-2376-2010; Silva, Rodrigo/D-2406-2010	da Silva, Aristeu/0000-0003-3842-2279; Silva, Rodrigo/0000-0001-9319-7516												0100-736X					FEB	2010	30	2					161	166		10.1590/S0100-736X2010000200011								WOS:000276670900011

Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) as an indicator for restoration of Everglades Ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) attempts to restore hydrology in the Northern and Southern Estuaries of Florida. Reefs of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica are a dominant feature of the estuaries along the Southwest Florida coast. Oysters are benthic, sessile, filter-feeding organisms that provide ecosystem services by filtering the water column and providing food, shelter and habitat for associated organisms. As such, the species is an excellent sentinel organism for examining the impacts of restoration on estuarine ecosystems. The implementation of CERP attempts to improve: the hydrology and spatial and structural characteristics of oyster reefs, the recruitment and survivorship of C. virginica, and the reef-associated communities of organisms. This project links biological responses and environmental conditions relative to hydrological changes as a means of assessing positive or negative trends in oyster responses and population trends. Using oyster responses, we have developed a communication tool (i.e., Stoplight Report Card) based on CERP performance measures that can distinguish between responses to restoration and natural patterns. The Stoplight Report Card system is a communication tool that uses Monitoring and Assessment Program (MAP) performance measures to grade an estuary's response to changes brought about by anthropogenic input or restoration activities. The Stoplight Report Card consists of both a suitability index score for each organism metric as well as a trend score (- decreasing trend, +/- no change in trend, and + increasing trend). Based on these two measures, a component score (e.g., living density) is calculated by averaging the suitability index score and the trend score. The final index score is obtained by taking the geometric score of each component, which is then translated into a stoplight color for success (green), caution (yellow), or failure (red). Based on the data available for oyster populations and the responses of oysters in the Caloosahatchee Estuary, the system is currently at stage "caution." This communication tool instantly conveys the status of the indicator and the suitability, while trend curves provide information on progress towards reaching a target. Furthermore, the tool has the advantage of being able to be applied regionally, by species, and collectively, in concert with other species, system-wide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Present and future schistosomiasis control activities with support from the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative in West Africa	PARASITOLOGY												Since 2004 the West African countries of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have implemented national schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis control programmes with financial and technical support from the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI). In the first three years of the control programmes, nearly 13.5 million doses of praziquantel and albendazole have been administered against schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis with coverage rates varying between 67.0% and 93.9%. These treatments have resulted in a reduction of the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma infection in the sentinel cohorts that were set up to monitor and evaluate the national control programmes. The challenges currently faced by these national control programmes are the ability to maintain the reduction in morbidity achieved thus far due to the mass treatment campaigns and ensuring sustainability. For reinforcement Of surveillance, the establishment of a geographical information system is suggested in order to contribute towards enhanced sustainability of these programmes. Our new working hypothesis is that targeted control accompanied by periodic mass treatment campaigns (every two to three years) can contribute to maintaining the low levels of morbidity achieved thus far. The implementation of integrated neglected tropical disease control programmes in these Countries will provide means to ensure the financial sustainability of control activities for the years to come.

The biomarkers selected were cholinesterase (ChE) activities in muscle; and catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), total glutathione peroxidase (t-GPX), DT-diaphorase (DT-D), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and carboxylesterases (CbEs) in hepatopancreas tissue. Lipid peroxidation (LP) levels and total protein yield (PY) were also determined in muscle and hepatopancreas tissues. The activities and levels are discussed in relation to species and season, and differences in these two factors were observed for most biomarkers. AChEs and pseudocholinesterases were present in the muscles of both crustaceans. Catalase and GST activities were higher in N. norvegicus, whereas GR and t-GPX activities varied according to the season. Hepatic CbE activities were similar in the two crustaceans, whereas LP levels and PY were different between species. Seasonality and species particularities are factors to consider when these crustaceans are used as sentinels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Presence of Alexandrium catenella and paralytic shellfish toxins in finfish, shellfish and rock crabs in Monterey Bay, California, USA	MARINE BIOLOGY												The central California coast is a highly productive, biodiverse region that is frequently affected by the toxin-producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Despite the consistent presence of A. catenella along our coast, very little is known about the movement of its toxins through local marine food webs. In the present study, we investigated 13 species of commercial finfish and rock crabs harvested in Monterey Bay, California for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and compared them to the presence of A. catenella and PSTs in sentinel shellfish over a 3-year period. Between 2003 and 2005, A. catenella was noted in 55% of surface water samples (n = 307) and reached a maximum concentration of 17,387 cells L(-1) at our nearshore site in Monterey Bay. Peak cell densities occurred in the month of July and were associated with elevated shellfish toxicity in the summers of 2004 and 2005. When A. catenella was present, particulate PSTs were detected 71% of the time and reached a maximum concentration of 962 ng STXeq L(-1). Of the 13 species tested, we frequently detected PSTs in Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax; maximum 250 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax; maximum 23.2 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)), brown rock crabs (Cancer antennarius; maximum 49.3 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)) and red rock crabs (C. productus; 23.8 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)). PSTs were also present in one sample of Pacific herring (Clupea pallas; 13.3 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)) and one sample of English sole (Pleuronectes vetulus; 4.5 mu g STXeq 100 g(-1)), and not detected in seven other species of flatfish tested. The presence of PSTs in several of these organisms reveals that toxins produced by A. catenella are more prevalent in California food webs than previously thought and also indicates potential routes of toxin transfer to higher trophic levels.																	0025-3162					FEB	2009	156	3					493	504		10.1007/s00227-008-1103-z								WOS:000262578800024

COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												The presence of estrogenic chemicals (ECs) in the aquatic environment is a growing problem. While most attention was initially given to fresh water and estuarine ecosystems, it is now evident that coastal marine areas are also vulnerable to these pollutants. The use of vitellogenin induction in male fish, a specific biomarker of EC exposure, has been the most widely applied methodology. However, in some occasions, the high mobility and migratory behaviour of common sentinel fish species makes data interpretation difficult. Hence, there is the need to validate new sentinel marine fish species which should display, among other features, a strong homing behaviour. The shanny, Lipophrys pholis, is an intertidal fish that combines many of the required characteristics for a sentinel species: abundance and easy of catch, wide geographical distribution and restricted home range. Thus, in order to evaluate, in the field, the species sensitivity to ECs, L. pholis males were collected at two sites reflecting different degrees of anthropogenic contamination. The vitellogenin It gene (VTGII) was isolated and its liver expression evaluated by RT-PCR in the field samples. A significant induction of gene expression was observed in the specimens collected in the urban area, if compared to the reference site, which suggests exposure to ECs. Moreover, a 21-days laboratory exposure to environmental relevant concentrations of ethinylestradiol (EE2) was also performed. A significant induction of L pholis VTGII gene in EE2 exposed males was observed suggesting similar sensitivity to that of other marine/estuarine fishes. Even though further validation is currently in progress, the available data indicates that L. pholis is responsive to ECs, thus favouring its future integration in monitoring programmes designed to evaluate the presence of ECs in European marine ecosystems.

Xenobiotic metabolism markers in marine fish with different trophic strategies and their relationship to ecological variables	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Nine fish species of commercial interest from six teleost families and two species of elasmobranchs were selected for characterisation of hepatic biomarkers used in early-warning assessment of pollutant exposure. The sampling was carried out in front of the Barcelona coast (NW Mediterranean) during December 2006 at shelf (53 m) and slope (660 m) depths. The enzymes considered included the antioxidant defence catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR), phase I ethoxyresorufln O-deethylase (EROD) and phase 11 glutathione S-transferase (GST). Protein yield (PY) was used as a general marker of hepatic protein synthesis. Significant interspecies differences were evidenced, although each marker varied independently. Enzymatic activities in teleosts were higher than in elasmobranchs; they were very low in Scyliorhinus canicula (mainly a benthic feeder), but not so low in Galeus melastomus (pelagic feeder). In relation to depth, shallow water, shelf-living species had higher metabolic activities. Trophic variables were significantly related to PY and EROD activity, and were especially high in benthic/suprabenthic feeders. Trophic level (deduced from stable isotopy) and stomach fullness were associated with all hepatic markers, except GR. Swimming capacity was related to all hepatic enzymes. Our findings can be applied, not only from the perspective of conservation ecology regarding pollution, but also in fisheries, due to the economic interest of the species involved.

A shift in the dominant toxin-producing algal species in central California alters phycotoxins in food webs	HARMFUL ALGAE												In California, the toxic algal species of primary concern are the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella and members of the pennate diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia, both producers of potent neurotoxins that are capable of sickening and killing marine life and humans. During the summer of 2004 in Monterey Bay, we observed a change in the taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton community-the typically diatom-dominated community shifted to a red tide, dinoflagellate-dominated community. Here we use a 6-year time series (2000-2006) to show how the abundance of the dominant harmful algal bloom (NAB) species in the Bay up to that point, Pseudo-nitzschia, significantly declined during the dinoflagellate-dominated interval, while two genera of toxic dinoflagellates, Alexandrium and Dinophysis, became the predominant toxin producers. This change represents a shift from a genus of toxin producers that typically dominates the community during a toxic bloom, to HAB taxa that are generally only minor components of the community in a toxic event. This change in the local HAB species was also reflected in the toxins present in higher trophic levels. Despite the small contribution of A. catenella to the overall phytoplankton community, the increase in the presence of this species in Monterey Bay was associated with an increase in the presence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins in sentinel shellfish and clupeoid fish. This report provides the first evidence that PSP toxins are present in California's pelagic food web, as PSP toxins were detected in both northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax). Another interesting observation from our data is the co-occurrence of DA and PSP toxins in both planktivorous fish and sentinel shellfish. We also provide evidence, based on the statewide biotoxin monitoring program, that this increase in the frequency and abundance of PSP events related to A. catenella occurred not just in Monterey Bay, but also in other coastal regions of California. Our results demonstrate that changes in the taxonomic structure of the phytoplankton community influences the nature of the algal toxins that move through local food webs and also emphasizes the importance of monitoring for the full suite of toxic algae, rather than just one genus or species.

Effects of changing land use on the microbial water quality of tidal creeks	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Population growth along the southeastern United States coast has precipitated the conversion of forested watersheds to suburban and urban ones. This study sampled creeks representing forested, suburban, and urban watersheds along a longitudinal gradient for indicators of water quality, including traditional indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms and enterococci) and alternative viral indicators (male-specific and somatic coliphages). Tested microorganisms were generally distributed with highest concentrations in creek headwaters and in more developed watersheds. The headwaters also showed the strongest predictive relationship between indicator concentrations and urbanization as measured by impervious cover. A seasonal pattern was observed for indicator bacteria but not for indicator viruses. Coliphage typing indicated the likely source of contamination was nonhuman. Results suggest that headwater creeks can serve as sentinel habitat, signaling early warning of public health concerns from land-based anthropogenic activities. This study also implies the potential to eventually forecast indicator concentrations under land use change scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The biological response of the mussels was evaluated by their condition index and the use of a general stress biomarker (evaluation of lysosomal membrane stability: the neutral red retention time (NRRT) method), a genotoxic effects biomarker (determination of micronuclei (MN) frequency) and a neurotoxic effects biomarker (determination of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) concentration). Compared to the K reference specimens, OH and MH caged mussels presented a significant decrease of NRRT in lysosomal haemocytes (56.45 +/- 26.48 min and 67.25 +/- 22.77 min, respectively) (78 +/- 16.97 min for K mussels), an MN frequency respectively 7.3 and 9 times higher in the haemocytes and the gill cells of the OH caged mussels, and 7.2 and 6.4 times higher in the two tissues of the MH caged mussels. Significant inhibition of AChE activity was noted in the gills (16.93 +/- 3.1 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1) and the digestive gland (7.69 +/- 1.79 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1)) of the OH mussels, but only in the gills (23.21 +/- 5.94 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1)) of the MH mussels, compared to the organs of the K control specimens (35.9 +/- 6.4 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1) in the gills and 11.17 +/- 0.49 mnol min(-1) mg prot(-1) in the digestive gland). This study reflects the interest in such in situ biomonitoring assays and the utility of these biomarkers for assessing the effects of pollution in the Algerian coastal marine environment.																	0078-3234	2300-7370					2009	51	1					63	84		10.5697/oc.51-1.063								WOS:000265040000003

Arctic epishelf lakes as sentinel ecosystems: Past, present and future	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ice shelves are a prominent but diminishing feature of the northern coastline of Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic (latitude 82-83 degrees N). By blocking embayments and fiords, this thick coastal ice can create epishelf lakes, which are characterized by a perennially ice-capped water column of freshwater overlying seawater. The goal of this study was to synthesize new, archived, and published data on Arctic epishelf lakes in the context of climate change. Long-term changes along this coastline were evaluated using historical reports, cartographic analysis, RADARSAT imagery, and field measurements. These data, including salinity-temperature profiling records from Disraeli Fiord spanning 54 years, show the rapid decline and near disappearance of this lake type in the Arctic. Salinity-temperature profiling of Milne Fiord, currently blocked by the Milne Ice Shelf, confirmed that it contained an epishelf lake composed of a 16-m thick freshwater layer overlying seawater. A profiling survey along the coast showed that there was a continuum of ice-dammed lakes from shallow systems dammed by multiyear landfast sea ice to deep epishelf lakes behind ice shelves. The climate warming recently observed in this region likely contributed to the decline of epishelf lakes over the last century, and the air temperature trend predicted for the Arctic over the next several decades implies the imminent loss of this ecosystem type. Our results underscore the distinctive properties of coastal ice-dammed lakes and their value as sentinel ecosystems for the monitoring of regional and global climate change.

Evaluation of impairment of DNA integrity in marine gastropods (Cronia contracta) as a biomarker of genotoxic contaminants in coastal water around Goa, West coast of India	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The measurement of the impairment of DNA in marine gastropod (Cronia contracta) provides an insight into the genotoxic effects of contaminants on marine organisms along the Goa coast. The impact of genotoxic contaminants on Goan coastal environment was evaluated in terms of the loss of DNA integrity (expressed as the value of 'l') in marine snails with respect to those from the reference site (Palolem) over a period from April 2004 to May 2005 using the technique of alkaline unwinding assay. The DNA integrity in marine snails was found to be significantly damaged at Dona Paula (58%), Vasco (73.5%), and Velsao (48.5%) during the monsoon period (July-August 2004). Similar trend in the loss of DNA integrity in marine gastropods was also detected during the post-monsoon (November December 2004) and the pre-monsoon (April-May 2005) periods. The low integrities of DNA in marine gastropods at these sites can be attributed to exposure to genotoxic contaminants especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and toxic heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Mn) prevalent in the marine environment as evident by their accumulation in the tissues of the marine snails inhabiting different sites along the Goa coast. The contaminant-induced DNA strand breaks in marine snails increased significantly at Dona Paula, Vasco, and Velsao clearly indicating the levels of contamination of the sites by genotoxic compounds in those regions. The genotoxic effects of contaminants were further substantiated by detection of the impairment (39%) of DNA integrity in marine snails in a field experiment in which the same species of marine snails (C contracta) collected from the reference site, Palolem, were deployed at Dona Paula and caged for 25 days for exposure to ambient marine pollutants. The impairment of DNA integrity in marine gastropods along the Goa coast can thus act as a biomarker for marine pollution monitoring of genotoxic contaminants. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Florida red tide and brevetoxins: Association and exposure in live resident bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, USA	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the Gulf of Mexico are frequently exposed to blooms of the toxic alga, Karenia brevis, and brevetoxins associated with these blooms have been implicated in several dolphin mortality events. Studies on brevetoxin accumulation in dolphins have typically focused on analyses of carcasses from large-scale die-offs; however, data are scarce for brevetoxin loads in live individuals frequently exposed to K. brevis blooms. This study investigated in vivo brevetoxin exposure in free-ranging bottlenose dolphins resident to Sarasota Bay, Florida, utilizing samples collected during health assessments performed during multiple K. brevis blooms occurring from 2003 to 2005. Brevetoxins were detected by ELISA and LC-MS in 63% of bottlenose dolphins sampled (n = 30) concurrently with a K. brevis bloom. Brevetoxins were present in urine and gastric samples at concentrations ranging from 2 to 9 ng PbTx-3 eq/g, and in feces at concentrations ranging from 45 to 231 ng PbTx-3 eq/g. Samples from individuals (n= 12) sampled during nonbloom conditions (<= 1,000 cells/L) were negative for brevetoxin activity. Brevetoxin accumulation data from this study complement dolphin carcass and prey fish data from the same study area, and aid in evaluating impacts of harmful algal blooms on sentinel marine animal species along the west Florida coast.

J	Helander, B; Bignert, A; Asplund, L				Helander, Bjoern; Bignert, Anders; Asplund, Lillemor			Using raptors as environmental sentinels: Monitoring the white-tailed sea eagle Haliaeetus albicilla in Sweden	AMBIO												This paper summarizes results from the monitoring of reproduction of white-tailed sea eagle in Sweden 1965-2006. Since 1989 the eagle population on the Swedish Baltic coast has been included in the National Environment Monitoring Program as an indicator species for potentially harmful chemicals. The percentage of successfully reproducing pairs and nestling brood size decreased in synchrony with rising concentrations of contaminants in the 1950s on into the 1970s. Mean productivity was 1.3 young per pair prior to 1950 and decreased to 0.3 in 1965-1985. Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) in eagle eggs decreased from a range of annual means in 1965-1974 of 600-1200 mu g g(-1) (lipid weight) to 60-140 mu g g(-1) in 1996-2005. Total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations averaged above 1000 mu g g(-1) into the early 1980s and remained in the range of 250-500 mu g g(-1) in 1996-2005. Productivity began to improve when concentrations of DDE and PCBs dropped below approximately 300 and 800 mu g g(-1), respectively. Brood size remains below the pre-1950 level in one coastal region, indicating a possible impact from other contaminants. The power to detect significant trends under the program is presented and discussed: if white-tailed sea eagle reproduction had been monitored earlier during the 20th century, the negative impact of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT, source of DDE) would have been signaled as early as the 1950s in the Baltic Sea. The dramatic fall of white-tailed sea eagle reproduction under the influence of DDT and PCBs, and the subsequent rise following their ban, illustrates the usefulness of raptors like sea eagles as sentinels for environmental pollutants.																	0044-7447					SEP	2008	37	6					425	431		10.1579/0044-7447(2008)37[425:URAESM]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000259384100008	18833795

Additionally, a set of biochemical markers namely, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and catalase (CAT) were measured in liver subcellular fractions. Chemical analysis indicated geographical differences in pollutant loads that were further reinforced by biomarker responses. Thus, EROD activity showed a good correlation with the amount of PCBs bioaccumulated in muscle tissue of both fish species. Elevated UGT activity was observed in those individuals highly exposed to APEs and 1-naphthol. The study reinforces the need to select representative sentinel species from different habitats for biomonitoring purposes and provides further support for the use of biomarkers in assessing the health of coastal areas.

Since 1955, it has been influenced by organic pollution from fish farming. In the spring of 1954, many surface sediment samples were collected in the bay, and were then studied by Ishizaki (1968) to examine ostracode thanatocoenoses. Comparison with this earlier work allows us to investigate faunal changes over this approximately 50-year period. We collected surface sediment and seaweed samples in the bay for ostracode analysis in 2002 and 2005. A total of 124 species were obtained from 29 samples. Comparison between the results suggests that ostracodes have decreased in number in the inner part of the bay and increased greatly in the middle and outer parts of the bay. The number of species and the species diversity has also increased in the middle and outer parts of the bay. Mud dwellers have mostly disappeared from the inner bay and are now found in small inlets in the middle and outer parts of the bay. These changes are caused by the enlargement of areas of anoxic or oxygen-poor bottom waters in the inner part of the bay during the summer. This summer hypoxia is thought to have been brought on by organic pollution from fish farms and the complicated geographical features of the bay. The decrease of inflows of coarse-grained sandy sediments from the outside of the bay, resulting from the intermittent construction of artificial concrete banks in the mouth of the bay in 1946-1950, 1969-1974 and 1991-1996, induced the emergence of preferable environments for a variety of bay and phytal ostracodes in the middle and outer parts of the bay. Valves of phytal species such as xestoleberidid and paradoxostomatid ostracodes increased greatly in the muddy bottoms of the middle part of the bay, where many artificial floating rafts for fish farms are distributed. Seaweed has grown on submerged parts of the floating materials, providing new habitats for phytal ostracodes.																	1342-8144					SEP	2008	12	3					283	302		10.2517/1342-8144-12.3.283								WOS:000259982700006						
J	Boersma, PD				Boersma, P. Dee			Penguins as marine sentinels	BIOSCIENCE												From the tropics to Antarctica, penguins depend on predictable regions of high ocean productivity where their prey aggregate. Increases in precipitation and reductions in sea ice associated with climate warming are affecting penguins. The largest breeding colony of Patagonian (Magellanic) penguins, at Punta Tombo, Argentina, had approximately 200,000 breeding pairs in October-2006-a decline of 22% since 1987. In the 1980s and 1990s, petroleum pollution was a major source of Patagonian penguin mortality. In 1994, tanker lanes were moved 40 kilometers (km) farther off the coast of Chubut, and the dumping of ballast water and the oiling of penguins are now rare. However, penguins are swimming 60 km farther north from their nests during incubation than they did a decade ago, very likely reflecting shifts in prey in response to climate change and reductions in prey abundance caused by commercial fishing. These temperate penguin species, marine sentinels for southern oceans, demonstrate that new challenges are confronting their populations.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				JUL-AUG	2008	58	7					597	607		10.1641/B580707								WOS:000258014700007

A quick assessment of the status of the vital coastal ecosystems has been made using pre- and post-tsunami Advance Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data of Indian satellite RESOURCESAT with an accuracy of 87-90% and the Kappa ranging from 0.8696 to 0.9053. Among the coastal ecosystems the coral reefs have suffered the maximum with the Nicobar reefs (69% eroded and 29% degraded) bearing the brunt more than the Andaman reefs (54% eroded and 22% degraded). Significant improvement to the condition of the reef damaged due to backwash has been noted. About 41% of the Sentinel reef area has undergone significant improvement. The continuance of the erosion of the southwestern Andaman reefs is due to the impact of recurring earthquakes. The impact on mangroves of both the groups of islands has been due to uprooting as well as inundation of seawater and resulting stagnation.

Quantitative catchment profiling to apportion faecal indicator organism budgets for the Ribble system, the UK's sentinel drainage basin for Water Framework Directive research	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) 20/60/EC and the US Federal Water Pollution Control Act 2002 management of water quality within river drainage basins has shifted from traditional point-source control to a holistic approach whereby the overall contribution of point and diffuse sources of pollutants has to be considered. Consequently, there is a requirement to undertake source-apportionment studies of pollutant fluxes within catchments. The inclusion of the Bathing Water Directive (BWD), under the list of 'protected areas' in the WFD places a requirement to control sources of faecal indicator organisms within catchments in order to achieve the objectives of both the BWD (and its revision - 2006/7/EC) and the WFD. This study was therefore initiated to quantify catchment-derived fluxes of faecal indicator compliance parameters originating from both point and diffuse sources. The Ribble drainage basin is the single UK sentinel WFD research catchment and discharges to the south of the Fylde coast, which includes a number of high profile, historically non-compliant, bathing waters. Faecal indicator concentrations (faecal coliform concentrations are reported herein) were measured at 41 riverine locations, the 15 largest wastewater treatment works (WwTWs) and 15 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) across the Ribble basin over a 44-day period during the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme included targeting rainfall-induced high flow events and sample results were categorised as either base flow or high flow. At the riverine sites, geometric mean faecal coliform concentrations showed statistically significant elevation at high flow compared to base flow. The resultant faecal coliform flux estimates revealed that over 90% of the total organism load to the Ribble Estuary was discharged by sewage related sources during high flow events. These sewage sources were largely related to the urban areas to the south and east of the Ribble basin, with over half the load associated with the relatively small subcatchment of the River Douglas. The majority of this load was attributed to two WwTWs that discharge through a common outfall close to the tidal limit of this catchment. Budgets adjusted to accommodate the impact of proposed UV disinfection of these effluents showed that the load from these sources would be reduced significantly during base flow conditions. However, during high flow events loads would still remain high due to the operation of storm sewage overflows from stormwater retention tanks. The study identified untreated storm sewage spills from urban infrastructure and WwTW stormwater retention tanks as the dominant component of the high flow flux of faecal indicators to receiving waters of the Fylde coast and the associated bathing waters.

To this end, a characterisation of acethylcholin (AChE), butyrylcholin (BChE) and propionylcholin (PrChE) esterases in L. pholis muscle was performed and the results indicated that AChE was predominant. Furthermore, the use of eserine sulphate and BW284c51 (0.64-800 mu M), and iso-OMPA (0.08-16 mM), confirmed the measurement of true cholinesterases (ChEs) as well as the presence of pseudocholinesterases. The field application of these markers to L. pholis, sampled in seven locations along the Portuguese coast, revealed that fish were likely to be affected by neurotoxic compounds. This was indicated by the significant depletion of AChE (p < 0.05) in animals collected at urban and industrialised sites, compared with those from reference locations. The inclusion of a marker of effect, measured as lipid peroxidation levels in muscle tissue, also revealed the existence of site differences. Overall, the study further validates the utility of L. pholis in pollution monitoring studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Geographic specificity of Aroclor 1268 in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) frequenting the Turtle/Brunswick River Estuary, Georgia (USA)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Coastal marine resources are at risk from anthropogenic contaminants, including legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPS) with half-lives of decades or more. To determine if polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) signatures can be used to distinguish among local populations of inshore bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the southeastern U.S. coast, blubber from free-ranging and stranded animals were collected along the Georgia coast in 2004 and analyzed for PCB congeners using gas chromatography with electron capture and negative chemical ionization mass spectrometric detection (GC-ECD and GC-NCI-MS). Mean total PCB concentrations (77 +/- 34 mu g/g lipid) were more than 10 fold higher and congener distributions were highly enriched in Cl-7-Cl-10 homologs in free-ranging animals from the Turtle/Brunswick River estuary (TBRE) compared with strandings samples from Savannah area estuaries 90 km to the north. Using principal components analysis (PCA), the Aroclor 1268 signature associated with TBRE animals was distinct from that observed in Savannah area animals, and also from those in animals biopsied in other southeastern U.S estuaries. Moreover, PCB signatures in dolphin blubber closely resembled those in local preferred prey fish species, strengthening the hypothesis that inshore T. truncatus populations exhibit long-term fidelity to specific estuaries and making them excellent sentinels for assessing the impact of stressors on coastal ecosystem health.

J	Fernandes, D; Bebianno, MJ; Porte, C				Fernandes, Denise; Bebianno, Maria Joao; Porte, Cinta			Hepatic levels of metal and metallothioneins in two commercial fish species of the Northern Iberian shelf	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Metal levels (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn) together with metallothioneins (MTs) were determined in the liver of two commercial fish species collected along the Northern Iberian coast. The four-spotted megrim (Lepidorhumbos boscii) and the pouting (Trisopterus luscus) were selected as representative species of the middle/outer (200-500 m) and inner shelf (70120 in), respectively. Metal pollution in the middle/outer shelf was mostly detected in the Asturias and Basque Country areas, whereas in the inner shelf, pollution was widely spread along the coast. Significantly high levels of Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg were detected in T. luscus from different sampling sites and associated to anthropogenic pressure. MTs were induced in fish that had higher amounts of Zn, Cd, Cr and Hg in their livers, supporting the use of MT as a biomarker of metal exposure. The study supports the usefulness of the selected fish species as sentinel organisms for future biomonitoring studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A survey for parasitoids of P. viburni was conducted in the Edna Valley appellation wine grape region from 2005 to 2007, 6-8 years after classical biological control releases were discontinued. Two survey methods were used. First, field collections of obscure mealybugs from commercial vineyard blocks (2005-2007) and, second, placement of "sentinel mealybugs" on potted (1 L) grape vines (2006 only). From both survey methods, P. flavidulus was recovered, albeit levels of parasitism were low (less than 0.6%). We also placed longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus (Targioni Tozzetti), on potted plants concurrent with placement of sentinel obscure mealybugs in the vineyard in order to measure parasitoid activity on this closely-related mealybug species. No P. flavidulus were recovered from P. longispinus. Other encyrtid parasitoids reared from either P. viburni or P. longispinus were Anagyrus pseudococci (Girault), Leptomastix dactylopii Howard, Leptomastidea abnormis (Girault), Coccidoxenoides perminutus Girault, and Tetracnemoidea peregrina (Compere). A hyperparasitoid, Chaetocerus sp., was also reared. The data are discussed with respect to biological control of vineyard mealybugs and newly developed controls for the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Because Pseudaphycus species reared from mealybugs are superficially very similar a taxonomic key and discussion of host relationships for selected Pseudaphycus species are provided.																	0958-3157						2008	18	1					43	57		10.1080/09583150701729906								WOS:000252893800004

A multispecies approach for monitoring persistent toxic substances in the Gulf of Gdansk (Baltic sea)	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Bivalve mussels are usually used for biomonitoring persistent toxic substances (PTS) in coastal ecosystems. Nevertheless, these organisms, which live attached on hard substrates, can be found along the sandy coasts only on human manufactured products. In this work different species collected in the Gulf of Gdansk were compared to evaluate their suitability for monitoring PTS pollution at a local scale. The clam Mya arenaria seems to represent an excellent indicator of sediment pollution, mainly for organotin compounds which are selectively bioaccumulated. Organochlorine compounds are bioaccumulated in the different species mainly in function of their lipid body burden. Habitat conditions (salinity, substrate, pollution), however, strongly limited the occurrence of different species in the sampling sites; the most ubiquitous species, the common shrimp Crangon crangon, resulted therefore the most suitable to be used for the comparison of PTS pollution in this aquatic environment. Although the blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus) was confirmed to be a very useful sentinel species to compare pollution level inside and outside the Gulf of Gdansk, we recommend the use of other species to give a more detailed picture of the pollution situation in coastal areas.

Distribution of parasites and pathologies in sentinel bivalves: NOAA status and Trends "Mussel Watch" Program	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												The 1995-1998 histopathology data from NOAA's Mussel Watch Program were analyzed to: (1) document the occurrence of parasites and pathologies in sentinel bivalves during the 1995-1998 time period, (2) describe and compare the geographic distribution of these parasites and pathologies between different bivalve species and between different geographic regions, and (3) evaluate trends in parasite taxon richness. Parasite taxon richness was higher in oysters than in mytilids and dreissenids. Parasites having higher prevalences in a given host taxon routinely also had higher infection intensities. When different geographic locations were compared, the same trends occurred much more rarely. Oysters were more heavily infected based on total parasite body burden than mytilids, and the frequency of hosts with at least one parasite was higher. Excluding the numerically-dominant gregarines, however, removed the differential between oysters and mytilids, with the exception of East-coast mytilids that were more frequently parasitized than East-coast oysters. Dreissenids had lower prevalence and infection intensity for all parasites than the other host bivalve taxa. Though cestodes offer a discrepancy, most of the more common oyster parasites were unicellular, whereas most of the more common mytilid parasites were multicellular. On the average, parasite distributional patterns along a stretch of coastline were more often clinal in nature in mytilids, in that prevalence and infection intensity tended to change gradually over relatively large distance scales, and more bounded in nature in oysters, in that prevalence and infection intensity tended to change more sharply over shorter distance scales. Latitudinal trends were diametric opposites on the two northern coasts. More parasites occurred in mytilids from northern bays of the East coast, whereas fewer occurred in mytilids from northern bays of the West coast. Mytilids far exceeded oysters in the incidence of pathologies, including digestive gland and gonadal abnormalities and hemocytic infiltration. On the West coast, the vast majority of these pathologies occurred in mussels of the Mytilus edulis complex rather than M. californianus. All pathologies were more common in mytilids from the northeast coast than in West-coast mytilids. Indeed, discounting the gregarines, northeast coast mytilids combined the highest instances of pathologies with among the highest parasite body burdens of any bivalve taxon and coastal area combination in the Mussel Watch program.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				DEC	2007	26	4					1115	1151		10.2983/0730-8000(2007)26[1115:DOPAPI]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000252327300026

Assessment of the potential of the rock gunnel (Pholis gunnellus) along the Atlantic coast of Canada as a species for monitoring the reproductive impacts of contaminant exposures	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Evaluating the impacts of point source discharges on fish species in estuarine environments can be challenging because of a paucity of resident species. We evaluated the biology of rock gunnel (Pholis gunnellus) at three relatively uncontaminated sites in the Bay of Fundy, along the Atlantic coast of Canada. Rock gunnel are seasonally resident (April to November) in tide pools, but little was known about their life history in Atlantic Canada or their potential for use for monitoring environmental quality. Fish were collected between April and November, and ranged from 2.46 g-15.2 g in weight and 97 mm-170 mm in length, with a maximum age of 7 years. Both males and females were similar in size, and both reached sexual maturity at a size of 5.5 g. Organ weights and condition indices of fish were stable from spring when they returned from offshore (April to May) until late summer (August to September), but fall fish (October to November) had slightly larger gonads, livers and condition indices. Rock gunnel may be a useful indicator to provide insight into local impacts of point sources over a short time period. However, they do not provide adequate information on reproductive development and performance since they are not exposed to onshore contaminants during the periods of gonadal development that have most commonly found to be sensitive to anthropogenic stressors.

AChE specific activity in brain varied from 145 to 530U/g of proteins and the Michaelis-Menten constant (K-M) for acetylthiocholine varied from 104 to 291 mu M among the 20 species studied. The enzyme sensitivity to methyl paraoxon, evaluated by the inhibition kinetic constants, shows that some species (Paralonchurus brasiliensis and Genidens genidens) are more sensitive (IC50-30min = 455 and 468 nM, respectively). The less sensitive Merluccius hubbsi and Percophis brasiliensis (IC50-30 min = 3339 and 3259nM, respectively) belong to the super-order Paracanthopterygii, which includes the more ancient species. On the other hand, more susceptible species belong to the super-order Acanthopterygii, which includes more recent species. These results suggest a possible evolutionary linkage for AChE sensitivity to methyl paraoxon. The application of inhibition kinetic constants for fish brain AChE in phylogenetic studies is still being investigated. The results have shown that a fish sentinel species should have the highest brain AChE level among the more sensitive ones. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study of different systems related to oxidative stress in these organisms can give important information about their physiological status and also about environmental health. Bivalves have been proposed as good sentinel organisms in pollution monitoring studies through the analysis of biochemical biomarkers, and most of the biomarkers analyzed are those related to oxidative stress. However, it is very important to know how other environmental factors not associated to the presence of pollutants might affect these parameters. We have studied a series of mechanisms related to oxidative stress in mussels which inhabit the Brazilian coast, especially in Perna perna species, subjected to different stress conditions, such as the exposure to different contaminants in the laboratory and in the field, the exposure of mussels to air and re-submersion, simulating the tidal oscillations, and in mussels collected at different seasons. Both oxidative damage levels and antioxidant defense systems were strongly affected by the different environmental stress.

Immuno-parasitological assessment of bancroftian filariasis in a highly endemic area along the River Sabaki, in Malindi district, Kenya	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY												Lymphatic filariasis is endemic in the coastal areas of Kenya, with four major foci identified in the early 1970s. The prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti infection, together with antifilarial antibody responses, were assessed in a historically highly endemic focus along the River Sabaki, in Malindi district. The prevalences of microfilaraemia and antigenaemia (detected by Og4C3 ELISA) were > 20% and > 40%, respectively, and both increased steadily with age. The high prevalences of antifilarial IgG(1) (86%) and IgG(4) (91%) responses indicate that most people living in this setting are exposed to W. bancrofti infection. The children investigated had higher levels of antifilarial IgG(1) than the adults. The results of this study, based on a battery of currently available parasitological and immunological methods, provide an epidemiological update on lymphatic filariasis on the northern Kenyan coast. They show that the River Sabaki area is still an important focus for bancroftian filariasis and highlight the importance of implementing an elimination programme, to interrupt the transmission of W bancrofti in all areas of endemicity in Kenya. The detailed baseline data collected in the River Sabaki area make the communities studied ideal as sentinel sites for epidemiological monitoring and the evaluation of the impact of mass drug administrations to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.																	0003-4983					MAR	2007	101	2					161	172		10.1179/136485907X156933								WOS:000244923200008	17316502

Coastal areas are particularly sensitive to global change, but there is a variety of limitations to universal coverage of observations. The coastal module of the Global Terrestrial Observing System (C-GTOS) considers sentinel ecosystems to address these goals for the terrestrial, wetland and freshwater ecosystems of the coast. Sentinel ecosystems for observing systems are a limited number of well understood systems that have substantial datasets and are observed in a sustained fashion, forming an early warning and core system for broader regional and global change. A necessary step in the development of C-GTOS is the examination of current definitions of coastal areas by anticipated users and information providers, and identification of potential coastal networks and sites. We applied the sentinel system framework to the selection of C-GTOS observation sites from several international programs using various global delineations of coastal areas. Delineations were based on the most common definitions of the coast adopted by potential C-GTOS users and information providers, and included mapped areas of various distance from the coastline, coastal areas of low elevation, and a seaward boundary matching the Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ). Decreases in the number of sites within each international program occurred with each definition marking area closer to the coastline. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands demonstrates the greatest percentage of coastal sites by any definition. The process of choosing specific sentinel sites for C-GTOS continues from this initial screening, and is the next step towards the development of an in situ site network supporting the observation of global and large scale change.																	0018-8158					FEB	2007	577						55	70		10.1007/s10750-006-0417-4								WOS:000243654900006

Importance of cholinesterase kinetic parameters in environmental monitoring using estuarine fish	CHEMOSPHERE												The aim of the present study was to determine the kinetic parameters and cholinesterase (ChE) activity in two teleost fish, the white mouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Scianidae) and the Madamango sea catfish Cathorops spixii (Ariidae), to verify their suitability as sentinel species of aquatic pollution by anticholinergic compounds. Individuals of each species were captured in one reference and one polluted site in the Southern Brazilian coast. Brain tissue was used as enzyme source. Inhibition kinetic parameters indicated that ChE from C. spixii collected at the reference site showed more affinity (K-a) for eserine that from those collected at the polluted site. The opposite was observed for the carbamylation constants (K-c). Thus, similar inhibition constants (K-i) were observed. M. furnieri brain showed an extremely low sensitivity to in vitro inhibition by eserine, indicating that it is not a suitable biomarker to be employed in environmental monitoring of anticholinergic compounds. Results from the present study also point to the need for considering kinetic analysis when cholinesterase activity is employed as a biomarker. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Environmental effects of the anti-sea lice (Copepoda : Caligidae) therapeutant emamectin benzoate under commercial use conditions in the marine environment	AQUACULTURE												Sea lice infestation can pose a particular problem to intensive cage aquaculture of salmonids. It is most often treated by therapeutants added to the water or incorporated into fish feed. This study investigated the environmental effects of one such in-feed treatment, emamectin benzoate, under commercial use conditions. Atlantic salmon were fed the commercial preparation of emamectin benzoate at a production fish farm on the west coast of Scotland. Sediment dwelling fauna, large mobile fauna and sentinel organisms were monitored for potential impacts over a 1 year post-treatment period (23 September 1997 to 23 September 1998). Additionally, sediment and water samples, transplanted blue mussels and captured large fauna were analysed for accumulated emamectin benzoate and its desmethylamino metabolite to investigate the long term environmental fate of emamectin benzoate. Results from analysis of sediments suggested that limited deposition of emamectin benzoate took place during and up to I week post-treatment, and may have continued up to 4 months of post-treatment. This was consistent with the release of the active ingredient from fish excretion and defecation after treatment. Quantifiable amounts of emamectin benzoate were found 10 in from the cages 12 months after treatment. However, clear reduction in overall sediment concentrations indicated that the deposited emamectin was degrading over time. Emamectin benzoate was not detected in water samples during the field trial. Quantifiable concentrations of emamectin benzoate were found in blue mussels deployed up to 100 in from the treatment cages at 1 week post treatment, but found only at 10 in from the cages at I month post-treatment. This suggests that while mussels were actively accumulating emamectin benzoate immediately after treatment by 1 month this had largely been depurated. Macrobenthic faunal analysis indicated that there was no evidence that the occurrence of emamectin benzoate, or its desmethylamino metabolite, in sediments around fish farm cages after treatment had any toxic impacts on organisms in either water column or sediments.

Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens, and Plesiomonas shigelloides in marine and freshwater invertebrates from coastal California ecosystems	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The coastal ecosystems of California are highly utilized by humans and animals, but the ecology of fecal bacteria at the land-sea interface is not well understood. This study evaluated the distribution of potentially pathogenic bacteria in invertebrates from linked marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems in central California. A variety of filter-feeding clams, mussels, worms, and crab tissues were selectively cultured for Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli-O157, Clostridium perfringens, Plesiomonas shigelloides, and Vibrio spp. A longitudinal study assessed environmental risk factors for detecting these bacterial species in sentinel mussel batches. Putative risk factors included mussel collection near higher risk areas for livestock or human sewage exposure, adjacent human population density, season, recent precipitation, water temperature, water type, bivalve type, and freshwater outflow exposure. Bacteria detected in invertebrates included Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, P. shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio alginolyticus. Overall, 80 % of mussel batches were culture positive for at least one of the bacterial species, although the pathogens Campylobacter, E. coli-O157, and Salmonella were not detected. Many of the same bacterial species were also cultured from upstream estuarine and riverine invertebrates. Exposure to human sewage sources, recent precipitation, and water temperature were significant risk factors for bacterial detection in sentinel mussel batches. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that filter-feeding invertebrates along the coast concentrate fecal bacteria flowing from land to sea and show that the relationships between anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems and the environmental niches of fecal bacteria are complex and dynamic.

J	Kim, Y; Powell, EN				Kim, Yungkul; Powell, Eric N.			Relationships among parasites and pathologies in sentinel bivalves: Noaa Status and Trends "Mussel Watch" Program	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												NOAA's National Status and Trends "Mussel Watch" Program includes a comprehensive survey of the histopathology of sentinel bivalves from the east, west, Gulf, and Great Lakes coasts of the U.S. We analyzed the data for 1995-1998 to identify relationships between various parasites, various pathologies, and between parasite/pathology pairs with the goal of identifying consistencies and differences in these relationships between sentinel bivalves and between major geographic units of the U.S. coastline. The prevalences of parasite, pathology, and parasite-pathology pairs were significantly correlated more frequently for oysters than for mussels. The number of significant correlations within Gulf-coast oysters exceeded the number within east-coast oysters. Correlations were least frequent among east-coast mussels. The incidence of significant negative correlations in prevalence far exceeded the incidence of significant positive correlations in all species and bay regions. Significant relationships in infection intensity occurred much less frequently than for prevalence, but positive correlations occurred more frequently than they did for prevalence. Both trends reinforce the concept that environmental factors controlling transmission are likely distinct from those controlling proliferation. Only a few relationships between parasites were common to more than one sentinel bivalve or more than one coastal region. No single common relationship involved a pathology. However, though commonalities were few, consistent trends in prevalence between mussels and oysters and between coastal regions suggest potentially important large-scale trends among some important parasite groups, particularly gregarines and gut ciliates, gill gregarines and cestodes, prokaryotic inclusions and trematode metacercariae, and Perkinsus marinus (Mackin, Owen and Collier, 1950) and gregarines.																	0007-4977	1553-6955				JUL	2006	79	1					83	111										WOS:000239770400005						
J	Sarkar, A; Ray, D; Shrivastava, AN; Sarker, S				Sarkar, A.; Ray, D.; Shrivastava, Amulya N.; Sarker, Subhodeep			Molecular biomarkers: Their significance and application in marine pollution monitoring	ECOTOXICOLOGY					International Workshop on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology	FEB 25-26, 2004	Natl Inst Oceanog, Dona Paula, INDIA		Natl Inst Oceanog			This paper presents an overview of the significance of the use of molecular biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools for marine pollution monitoring. In order to assess the impact of highly persistent pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzo-furans (PCDF), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), tributyltin (TBT) and other toxic metals on the marine ecosystem a suite of biomarkers are being extensively used worldwide. Among the various types of biomarkers, the following have received special attention: cytochrome P4501A induction, DNA integrity, acetylcholinesterase activity and metallothionein induction. These biomarkers are being used to evaluate exposure of various species of sentinel marine organisms (e.g. mussels, clams, oysters, snails, fishes, etc.) to and the effect of various contaminants (organic xenobiotics and metals) using different molecular approaches [biochemical assays, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA), spectrophotometric, fluorometric measurement, differential pulsed polarography, liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrometry]. The induction of the biotransformation enzyme, cytochrome P4501A in fishes (Callionymus lyra, Limanda limanda, Serranus sp., Mullus barbatus) and mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) by various xenobiotic contaminants such as PCBs, PAHs, PCDs is used as a biomarker of exposure to such organic pollutants. The induction of cytochrome P4501A is involved in chemical carcinogenesis through catalysis of the covalent bonding of organic contaminants to a DNA strand leading to formation of DNA adduct. Measurement of the induction of cytochrome P4501A in terms of EROD (7-ethoxy resorufin O-deethylase) activity is successfully used as a potential biomarker of exposure to xenobiotic contaminants in marine pollution monitoring. In order to assess the impact of neurotoxic compounds on marine environment the evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity in marine organisms is used as a biomarker of exposure to neurotoxic agents such as organophosphorus, carbamate pesticides etc. Metallothioneins (MTs) are induced by toxic metals such as Cd, Hg, and Cu by chelation through cysteine residues and are used in both vertebrates and invertebrates as a biomarker of metal exposure. The measurement of the levels of DNA integrity in marine organisms such as Sea stars (Asterias rubens) from the North Sea and the marine snails (Planaxis sulcatus) from the Arabian Sea along the Goa coast exposed to environmental xenobiotic contaminants clearly indicated the extent and the nature of pollution at the sampling sites along coastal environment.

Gender and species differences in sentinel crabs (Macrophthalmus) feeding on an Indonesian mudflat	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												This study investigates the influence of gender on feeding and habitat niches in the ocypodid sentinel crabs Macrophthalmus convexus and M. definitus feeding on a mudflat in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia. Male M. convexus possess sub-equal chelae that are considerably larger than those of females and of those of both genders of M. definitus. Habitat location, food (Chl a) biomass index in microalgae and seagrass mats on muddy sediments, faecal material, and feeding rates were analysed in females and males of both species throughout the lunar cycle in July and August 2002. Food biomass content was significantly higher in the upper than in the lower mudflat (P = 0.008). The particle size of faecal material did not vary between species or between genders of M. definitus. but the faeces contained larger particles in males of M. convexus compared with females and both gender of M. definitus. Macrophthalmus convexus predominantly inhabited pools on the upper and mid mudflats, whereas M. definitus was found in muddy sea-grass substrates on the mid and lower mudflats. Crabs were observed to emerge for feeding only on ebb tide during daylight. Macrophthalmus convexus showed significantly higher scoop rates than M. definitus (P < 0.05) during full and new moon. Feeding rates in male M. convexus were also significantly lower than of females (P < 0.001) throughout the lunar cycle. In contrast, feeding motions in M. definitus were generally variable and not gender-specific. However, males showed significantly reduced scoop rates in this species on the lower mudflat during the first quarter moon (P < 0.001). Scoop rate is not the only process affecting potential ingestion rate, however, in that several 'pinches' of sediment may be made by the chela before it is lifted towards the mouthparts.

In this effort, we elucidate the potential of a mesogastropod, Gyrineum natator, for imposex monitoring on the central west coast of India. Observations were made with specimens collected from Mumbai (three stations), Ratnagiri (two stations), Goa (one station) and Mangalore (one station). The analyzed populations at all four sites were affected by imposex. The six different stages of imposex in this organism are illustrated through schematic and scanning electron micrographs.

Similar surveillance programs in all three areas monitored infection rates in mosquitoes, seroconversion rates in sentinel chickens, seroprevalence in wild birds, numbers of dead birds reported by the public, and the occurrence of human cases. Infection rates in Culex tarsalis Coquillett and sentinel chicken seroconversion rates were statistically similar among all three areas, indicating that highly competent mosquito hosts were capable of maintaining enzootic WNV transmission among less competent and widely distributed avian hosts, most likely house sparrows and house finches. In contrast, infection rates in Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say were statistically higher in Kern and Los Angeles counties with elevated corvid populations than in Coachella Valley with few corvids. Spatial analyses of dead corvids showed significant clusters near known American crow roosts in Los Angeles that were congruent with clusters of human cases. In this area, the incidence of human and Cx. p. quinquefasciatus infection was significantly greater within corvid clusters than without, indicating their importance in vir-us amplification and as a risk factor for human infection. In contrast the uniform dispersion by territorial western scrub-jays resulted in a high, but evenly distributed, incidence of human disease in Kern County.																	0022-2585					MAR	2006	43	2					356	367		10.1603/0022-2585(2006)043[0356:ROCIEO]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000236184600033	16619622					
J	Feldstein, T; Nelson, N; Mokady, O				Feldstein, Tamar; Nelson, Nathan; Mokady, Ofer			Cloning and expression of MDR transporters from marine bivalves, and their potential use in biomonitoring	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH					13th International Symposium on Pollutant Responses in Marine Organisms (PRIMO 13)	JUN 19-23, 2005	Alessandria, ITALY					Multidrug resistance transporters (MDRs) are excellent candidates for molecular-level biomonitoring - they function in exporting xenobiotic compounds and their expression is inducible. However, currently available MDR sequence information from aquatic invertebrates is partial and mostly biased towards the conserved ATPase domain. In the present study, two genes belonging to the MDR/TAP (ABCB) family were cloned and characterized from the bivalve Brachidontes pharaonis, which thrives in rocky environments along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. One of these is a complete sequence of a 'half' ABCB, probably belonging to the ABCB10 subfamily, while the second is a 'full' ABCB1 transporter. A quantitative RT-PCR protocol for biomonitoring was tested in laboratory experiments. Bivalves exposed to diesel showed significant increase in B1 expression levels, while the expression of B10 was suppressed. These results suggest that B. pharaonis features an MDR1 homologue that is induced by pollution and may serve as a sentinel organism for routine biomonitoring programs. However, our findings also exemplify that not all MDRs are equally suitable for this purpose and sequence information must be expanded beyond the ATPase domain for correct classification of cloned genes.

A total of 114 samples were examined and 100 bacterial isolates were identified and typified by microbiological and biochemical standard tests. Fifty four isolates corresponded to Gram positive bacteria (54%) and 46 isolates to Gram negative bacteria (46%). Fifteen bacterial genera were identified, including Micrococcus, Arcanobacterium, Corynebacteriuln, Moraxella, Neisseria, Escherichia, Kurthia, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Brevibacillus, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudonionas and Aeronionas. The most frequently isolated genera were Moraxella (24%), Micrococcus (18%), and Corynebacteritun (15%). These results show the presence in the nasal cavity of sea lions of several microorganisms. Although considered part of the normal microflora, they may also be opportunistic pathogens for their hosts and may act as a potential natural sentinel of environmental changes.

Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the slow rate of population recovery for southern sea otters in California. An updated seroprevalence analysis showed that 52% of 305 freshly dead, beachcast sea otters and 38% of 257 live sea otters sampled along the California coast from 1998 to 2004 were infected with T. gondii. Areas with high T gondii exposure were predominantly sandy bays near urban centres with freshwater runoff. Genotypic characterisation of 15 new T. gondii isolates obtained from otters in 2004 identified only X alleles at B1 and SAG1. A total of 38/50 or 72% of all otter isolates so far examined have been infected with a Type X strain. Type X isolates were also obtained from a Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). Molecular analysis using the C8 RAPD marker showed that the X isolates were more genetically heterogeneous than archetypal Type I, II and III genotypes of T gondii. The origin and transmission of the Type X T gondii genotype are not yet clear. Sea otters do not prey on known intermediate hosts for T gondii and vertical transmission appears to play a minor role in maintaining infection in the populations. Therefore, the most likely source of infection is by infectious, environmentally resistant oocysts that are shed in the feces of felids and transported via freshwater runoff into the marine ecosystem. As nearshore predators, otters serve as sentinels of protozoal pathogen flow into the marine environment since they share the same environment and consume some of the same foods as humans. Investigation into the processes promoting T gondii infections in sea otters will provide a better understanding of terrestrial parasite flow and the emergence of disease at the interface between wildlife, domestic animals and humans.

In a previous study, 138 of 141 (97.8%) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the coasts of Florida and California had antibodies to T gondii by the modified agglutination test (MAT). Although the MAT has been found to be highly sensitive and specific for T. gondii antibodies from several species of terrestrial animals, it has not yet been validated for T. gondii infections in marine mammals. Furthermore, T. gondii has yet not been isolated from dolphins. In the present study, sera from 146 (60 from the 2004 samples and 86 from the 2003 samples) T truncatus from the coastal areas of South Carolina and Florida were tested for antibodies to T. gondii. Sera from 2004 were tested by the MAT, the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), the Sabin-Feldman dye test (DT), an indirect henagglutination test (IHAT), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot. All 60 dolphins were seropositive, with MAT titers of 1:20 in 3, 1:40 in 19, 1:80 in 29, 1:160 in 2, 1:1,280 in 3, 1:2,560 in 2, and 1:5,120 or higher in 2, and these results were confirmed in another laboratory. The DT titers of these dolphins were < 1: 10 in 53, 1:800 in 3, 1:1,600 in 2, and 1:3,200 in 2. The IHAT titers were <1:64 in 52, 1:128 in 1, 1:512 in 2, and 1:2,048 in 5. The IFAT titers were <1:20 in 3, 1:20 in 11, 1:40 in 36, 1:80 in 2, 1:160 in 1, and 1:320 or higher in 7. All 7 DT-positive dolphins had high MAT titers, but 2 were negative by the IHAT. Western blot results closely followed MAT results; ELISA results matched MAT results, which were 1:40 or higher. In sera from the 2003 samples, MAT antibodies were found in 86 of 86 dolphins with titers of 1:25 in 29, 1:50 in 23, 1:100 in 27, 1:200 in 3, 1:1,600 in 1, and 1:3,200 in 3; these sera were not tested by other means. Overall, MAT antibodies were found in all 146 dolphin sera tested. Because marine mammals are considered sentinel animals indicative of contamination of the coastal and marine waters by T. gondii oocysts, serologically positive infections need to be validated by the detection of T. gondii organisms in the tissues of seropositive animals.

J	Lee, CC; Wang, T; Hsieh, CY; Tien, CJ				Lee, CC; Wang, T; Hsieh, CY; Tien, CJ			Organotin contamination in fishes with different living patterns and its implications for human health risk in Taiwan	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Contaminated levels of butyl- and phenyltin compounds, tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), monobutyltin (MBT), triphenyltin (TPT), diphenlytin (DPT), and monophenyltin (MPT), were investigated in pelagic, demersal and cultured fish species from different seasons and locations in Taiwan. Seasonal variations were found in fishes from Wuchi and Hsingta fishing harbors for their butyltin levels (winter > summer) with the opposite trend for phenyltins in fishes from Patoutzu fishing harbor and demersal fishes from four fishing harbors (summer > winter). Fish liver contained the lowest percentage of TBT and the highest percentage of TPT among six organotin compounds. Consumption of contaminated pelagic species and fishes from Hsingta fishing harbor had the highest hazard index. However, the hazard quotients and hazard indices were all less than 1, Suggesting a daily exposure at these levels of TBT, DBT and TPT may not be likely to cause any deleterious effects during lifetime in human population.

Haemolymph samples from 4680 mussels (Mytilus spp.) were tested for Cryptosporidium genotypes using PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis. Our hypotheses were that mussels collected from sites near livestock runoff or human sewage outflow would be more likely to contain the faecal pathogen Cryptosporidium than mussels collected distant to these sites, and that the prevalence would be greatest during the wet season when runoff into the nearshore marine environment was highest. To test these hypotheses, 156 batches of sentinel mussels were collected quarterly at nearshore marine sites considered at higher risk for exposure to livestock runoff, higher risk for exposure to human sewage, or lower risk for exposure to both faecal sources. Cryptosporidium genotypes detected in Haemolymph samples from individual mussels included Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium felis, Ctyptosporidium andersoni, and two novel Cryptosporidium spp. Factors significantly associated with detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in mussel batches were exposure to freshwater outflow and mussel collection within a week following a precipitation event. Detection of Cryptosporidium spp. was not associated with higher or lower risk status for exposure to livestock faeces or human sewage sources. This study showed that mussels can be used to monitor water quality in California and suggests that humans and animals ingesting faceal-contaminated water and shellfish may be exposed to both host-specific and anthropozoonotic Cryptosporidium genotypes of public health significance.

The present study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the IFAt in eastern Zambia, where the transmission of T parva is highly seasonal. The data set resulted from a sentinel herd (n = 105 animals) study carried out between 1995 and 2000 and was split into an epidemic period, during which the majority of the cattle became infected, and an endemic period with seasonal disease incidence in calves. In the epidemic period the T. parva seroprevalence followed closely the build up of the herd immunity. In the endemic period the seroprevalence fluctuates considerably although most of the animals had been infected. Overall, the diagnostic sensitivity of the IFA test was 55% at cut-off titre 1:40 and 28% at cut-off 1: 160. The specificity of the test was 86 and 95%, respectively. A logistic regression model demonstrates that the sensitivity is significantly lower when the T. parva transmission is low (p < 0.01). The analysis of receiver operator characteristic curves classifies the test as moderately accurate (area under the curve, AUC = 0.79) during the epidemic period and less accurate in the endemic period (AUC = 0.63). Neonatal serology surveys yield a better estimate of the infection prevalence. The sensitivity of the neonatal test was 73% at cut-off titre 1:40 and 24% at cut-off 1:160. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Ecological, physiological, biochemical and environmental chemistry data were collected in separate projects. When the National Marine Monitoring Programme was revised in 1992, a new strategy was introduced for assessments of long-term trends in coastal fish communities. Annual integrated monitoring of contaminants, biomarkers and population and community indicators of ecosystem health was started in selected areas using common sentinel species. Data from one monitoring area at the coast of the Baltic proper are analyzed in this paper. The results have shown a shift in fish community structure indicating changes in ecosystem productivity. Trends have been detected in growth rate (positive) and relative gonad size (negative) in perch (Perca fluviatilis), suggesting a metabolic disturbance according to the predictive response model developed for interpretations. One factor which may have contributed to the reduced GSI was a decrease in mean age of sampled fish during the period of study. Chemical exposure was indicated by a 3-fold increase of EROD activity during the monitored 15-year period. However, concentrations of most measured contaminants in perch have decreased during the same period. The experience of the integrated approach has shown that a tentative analysis of cause and environmental significance could be made, improving the assessment, but there still remain unsolved questions to be answered in follow-up studies. The analysis has also shown the importance of long-term monitoring at several levels of biological organization to distinguish between natural variation and low-level effects on ecosystems.																	1201-3080						2005	40	3					233	250										WOS:000233644500002

J	Vale, P				Vale, P			Differential dynamics of dinophysistoxins and pectenotoxins between blue mussel and common cockle: a phenomenon originating from the complex toxin profile of Dinophysis acuta	TOXICON												Different toxin profiles of dinophysistoxins and pectenotoxins have been reported before between blue mussel and other bivalve species, such as common cockle, razor clam, clams, etc. Comparison of toxins present in plankton in mussel growing areas and in cockle growing areas, respectively, showed there was no particular incidence of dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX2) in plankton from mussel growing areas that could account for the higher percentage of DTX2 in relation to okadaic acid (OA) found in mussels; or of pectenotoxin-2 in cockle growing areas that could explain the higher levels of pectenotoxin-2 seco acid (PTX2sa) found in cockles. A detoxification experiment between mussels and cockles showed the higher percentage of DTX2 in mussels was due to slower elimination of this toxin in relation to OA; while the lower levels of PTX2sa were due to quicker elimination by mussels than by cockles. The slower elimination of DTX2 explains why in late summer and autumn this toxin gradually accumulate in mussels throughout the entire coast, while other bivalves species have a lower percentage of DTX2, very close to the 3:2 OA:DTX2 ratio found in natural plankton assemblages when Dinophysis acuta predominates. In the clam Donax spp., DTX2 concentration also tends to build up in relation to OA, this being made up predominantly by free DTX2 while esterified DTX2 is found only in trace levels (similarly to what is found in mussel for DTX2). We hypothesise that the esterified forms of OA and DTX2 are more easily eliminated than the free forms, by all shellfish species. The free forms are more difficult to eliminate. This is particularly notable in these two species that present a very low conversion of DTX2 into acyl esters. The high pool of free toxins is partially responsible for these two species (mussel and Donax clams) being the sentinel species for DSP contamination throughout the Portuguese coast. Esters of OA and DTX2 were found in a plankton sample where D. acuta was the predominant toxic species found. The nature of the esters remains to be elucidated. The boiling of these DTX2 esters seems to favour the rearrangement of the parent molecule to the DTX2 isomer, DTX2i, recoverable after alkaline hydrolysis. The isomerization was also observed with DTX2 esters present in mussel, but thus not appear to occur with the same extent with free DTX2. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Silty intervals within organic sediments recovered from two proglacial lakes are bracketed by AMS C-14-dated terrestrial macrofossils and Mazama tephra to 8780-6730 and 7940-6730 C-14 yr BP [10,150-7510 and 8990-7510 cal yr BP]. Radiocarbon ages ranging from 7720 to 7380 14C yr BP [8630-8020 cal yr BP] were obtained from detrital wood in recently deglaciated forefields of Sphinx and Sentinel glaciers. These data, together with previously published data from proglacial lakes in the Canadian Rockies, imply that glaciers in western Canada advanced during the early Holocene. The advance coincides with the well-documented 8200-yr cold event identified in climate proxy data sets in the North Atlantic region and elsewhere. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

PCB MUSCLE CONTENT AND LIVER EROD ACTIVITY IN THE EUROPEAN EEL (ANGUILLA ANGUILLA) TREATED WITH AROCLOR 1254	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a euryaline fish suitable for investigating exposure, accumulation patterns and biological effects of lipophilic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Eels were collected from the Orbetello Lagoon (Tyrrhenian coast of Italy) and injected with increasing doses of Aroclor 1254 to better characterise EROD activity as biomarker in eels from Mediterranean brackish environments. Fish muscle was analysed for PCB content and EROD activity was measured in liver microsomial fraction. Significant differences of PCB levels were observed in exposed fish (p < 0.05) while EROD activity increased significantly reaching the highest values at the maximum dose of 50mg/Kg (p < 0.001). Highly positive correlation (r = 0.82; P < 0.01) was found between PCB content and EROD activity. Isomer profiles showed decreases in hexa-CBs. The European eel is confirmed to be a useful sentinel species for assessing pollution in brackish environments whereas EROD activity is characterised as a sensitive biomarker of exposure for PCB mixtures.

The mussels were collected from the Baltic Sea off Poland. The sampling programme focused on the mouths of the rivers Odra and Vistula, located respectively in the Pomeranian Bay and the Gulf of Gdansk, both known to be under anthropogenic pressure. The analyses of PCBs and DDT were performed by CC-ECD, that of PAHs by CC-MS. Mussels from both the Vistula and Odra estuaries were found to contain higher levels of organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs, DDT; 29.7 ng g(-1) w.w. (wet weight), 22.3 ng g(-1) w.w., 11.2 ng g(-1) w.w. respectively) as compared to the reference point (PAHs - 8.6 ng g(-1) w.w., PCBs - 1.9 ng g(-1) w.w., DDT - 1.3 ng g(-1) w.w.). These results confirm the direct influence of land-based pollution sources on the content of organic pollutants (PAHs, PCBs, and DDT) in the southern Baltic Sea, and point to the Gulf of Gdansk as the area most under threat. P/A and Fluo/Py ratios indicate that in all the mussels analysed, the contaminants were derived mainly from pyrolitic combustion. The mussels collected along the Polish coast of the Baltic contain mostly tetra-aromatic isomers (fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene), penta-aromatic isomers (benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(e)fluorene, benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene) and hexa-aromatics (indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and benzo(ghi)perylene) rather than di- and tri-aromatics (naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene). As regards PCBs, the Baltic mussels contain mostly the more highly chlorinated congeners (penta- and hexachlorobiphenyls). The PCB/pp'DDE and PAH/pp'DDE ratios indicate the predominance of PCBs and PAHs over agriculturally derived DDE in both the Pomeranian Bay and the Gulf of Gdansk.

These species are all important representatives of different trophic levels of the North Sea food web. All six major PBDE congeners detected (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 1,53, and 154) are most prevalent in the commercial Penta-BDE formulation. There is no evidence for the occurrence of-the Octa-BDE formulation in the North Sea food web, since its dominant congener, BDE183, was never detected. BDE209, the main congener (>97%) in the Deca-BDE formulation, was detected only in a minority of the samples and always in concentrations around the limit of detection. Since BDE209 is often the major BDE congener in sediment's from the area, the main reason for its low concentrations in biota from the North Sea seems to be a relatively low bioaccumulation potential. This can either-be due to a low uptake rate of the very large molecule or a relatively rapid excretion after biotransformation. Since all invertebrates investigated are sentinel species,they are highly representative for the area of capture. The highest lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs in the invertebrates' occurred near the mouth of the river Tees at the East coast of the U.K. The geographical distribution, of the PBDEs can be explained by the residual currents in the area. The direction of these currents differs between the summer and the winter season as a result of the presence or absence of vertical summer stratification of the deeper waters north of the Dogger Bank. Summer stratification results in the development of a density-driven bottom water current formed after the onset of vertical stratification of the water column in May leaving the UK coast near Flamborough Head toward the Dogger Bank. In winter, the residual currents run in a more southerly,direction and follow the UK coastline. The distribution pattern of the PCBs and p,p'-DDE in the invertebrates was entirely different from that of the PBDEs, which could be expected, since the use of these organochlorines in western Europe peaked in the 1960s and 1970s but has been forbidden more than two decades ago whereas the production and Use of the penta-BDE formulation is of a more recent origin. The higher trophic levels of the North Sea food web were represented by the predatory gadoid fish species whiting and cod and the marine mammal species p Seal and harbor porpoise. The lipid-normalized levels of the six major PBDE congeners in fish were similar to the levels in the invertebrates, but a biomagnification step in concentrations of generally more than an order of magnitude occurred from gadoid fish to marine mammals; Based on the limited number of samples, no differences could be observed between harbor seal and harbor porpoise. In summary, the results in three species of sentinel invertebrates from a network of stations covering a major part of the North Sea basin showed that the estuary of the river Tees at,the UK. East coast is a major source for tri- to hexa-PBDEs. Throughout the food-chain, the most marked increase in, (lipid-normalized): levels of all six PBDE congeners occurred from predatory (gadoid) fish to marine mammals, agreeing with the transition from gill-breathing to lung-breathing animals. This has serious consequences for the route of elimination of POPs, since their elimination from the blood into the ambient seawater via the gill-membrane is no longer possible.				de Boer, Jacob/L-5094-2013	de Boer, Jacob/0000-0001-6949-4828												0013-936X					OCT 1	2002	36	19					4025	4032		10.1021/es0158298								WOS:000178351800017	12380070

The red mullet (Mullus barbatus) was used as a bioindicator species for monitoring the biological impact of these discharges on a geographical and temporal scale. Organisms were sampled over three years (1998-2000) at different stations and several biomarkers, both of exposure and effect, were analyzed. Bioavailability of specific classes of pollutants was evaluated by analyzing levels of metallothioneins, the activity of cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and of glutathione S-transferases. Among biomarkers of effect, special attention was paid to the balance between prooxidant challenge and antioxidant defenses, and to the appearance of damage caused by oxidative stress. The analyses of the main components of the antioxidant system included superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, glyoxalase I and 11, and total glutathione. These data were integrated with the measurement of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) as an indication of the overall biological resistance to toxicity of different forms of oxyradicals (peroxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite). Results indicated a biological impact in organisms sampled near the disposal site; the impact was particularly evident during 1999 and mainly related to organic chemicals such as PAH. Exposure to these pollutants also caused variations in the levels and activity of several antioxidants. The analysis of TOSC, however, revealed that the overall capacity of specific tissues of organisms to absorb various oxidants was not seriously compromised when challenged with increased prooxidant pressures. Variations of single antioxidants were useful in revealing early warning "biological responses", while integration with TOSC analyses indicated if such changes also reflect a more integrated and functional "biological effect" with possible consequences at the organisms level. The red mullet appears to be a useful sentinel species for a biomarker approach to monitoring impact caused by dredged materials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The animals of the sentinel herds were closely monitored clinically and serologically together with detailed Rhipicephalus appendiculatus counts. Peaks of disease incidence occurred in the rainy season (December-February) and the dry months of May-July with nymph-to-adult tick transmission dominating the infection dynamics. A second wave of adult R. appendiculatus at the start of the dry season is essential for the occurrence of a full-blown epidemic while the size of the susceptible cattle population acts as a most important limiting factor. The majority of adult cattle of the sentinel herds became infected less than 2 years after the introduction of the disease. The median age at first contact for calves born towards the end of the study (1999) was about 6 months. The case-fatality ratio (including sub-clinical cases) is estimated at 60%. It is argued that part of the so-called 'natural mortality' is actually due to ECF and that ECF occurrence and mortality are systematically underestimated. The direct financial cost of the epidemic, based on loss of animals and cost of treatment only and calculated over 4 years running, is estimated at about US$ 6 per year per animal at risk. The value of the traditional seroprevalence survey as a tool for monitoring ECF epidemiology is put in question and the prevalence of maternal antibodies in new-born calves, reflecting the immune status of the dam population, is introduced as an alternative. It is demonstrated that an efficient immunisation campaign should concentrate its efforts in the period of low adult R. appendiculatus abundance (July-October). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

One of the current sentinel organisms, the sea mussel (Mytilus californianus), has shown minimal or undetectable toxicity during some local bloom events. As a critical step in assuring the accuracy of DA determinations in E analoga, we have developed and validated a highly efficient extraction protocol that yields toxin recoveries of 97 +/- 2.9%. We also determined by HPLC-UV and receptor binding assay, with confirmation by LC-MS/MS, that sand crabs accumulated measurable amounts of DA during toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, while the sea mussel showed no detectable toxin. In addition, a comparison of inter-animal variability in DA content revealed values ranging from ca. 0.5 to 5 mug DA g(-1) tissue and no consistent trend with size class, based on either animal weight or length. These data on the toxicity of individual animals will be useful in designing an appropriate sampling strategy for monitoring DA and, importantly, indicate that sand crabs do not appear to progressively bioaccumulate DA with age.

Mussel-Mytilus edulis-and fish-Platichthys flesus-were used as sentinel organisms. The bioaccumulation patterns of butyltin and phenyltin compounds varied substantially. Butyltins were detected in mussel tissue from all the sampled stations. Among them, organisms from the Gulf of Gdansk showed the highest residues (68 ng/g w.w. as Sn) in conjunction with elevated TBT/DBT ratios, which suggest recent inputs of TBT in the area. Additionally, flatfish were sampled in the Gulf of Gdansk, and different tissues (liver, digestive tube and gills) were analyzed separately. TPT, although undetected in mussels, was always present in fish. The highest organotin concentration was observed in the liver (369 ng/g w.w. as Sri) of fish caught near Gdansk port. Relatively high concentrations were observed in digestive tube, which points out the ingestion of organotin contaminated food as an important uptake route of those compounds in P. flesus.

J	McGraw, WS; Bshary, R				McGraw, WS; Bshary, R			Association of terrestrial mangabeys (Cercocebus atys) with arboreal monkeys: Experimental evidence for the effects of reduced ground predator pressure on habitat use	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												We examined the behavior of two arboreal monkeys-Piliocolobus badius (western red colobus) and Cercopithecus diana (Diana monkey)-in the presence and absence of a third, predominately, terrestrial monkey, Cercocebus atys (sooty mangabey) in the Ivory Coast's Tai Forest. Via experimental data, we show that sooty mangabeys are effective sentinels for ground predators. Then we compared strata use of red colobus and Diana monkeys in the presence and absence of mangabeys. Our data indicate that red colobus and Diana monkeys descend to low forest levels and to the forest floor significantly more often when mangabeys are spatially intermingled with them, i.e. in polyspecific associations. The niche extension may Provide some foraging advantage, especially for red colobus. We identified the specific causal agent-relaxed ground predator pressure-of a temporary shift in habitat use. In this instance, the presence of one species (Cercocebus atys) leads to the temporary expansion of a niche normally avoided by others Piliocolobus badius and Cercopithecus diana.																	0164-0291	1573-8604				APR	2002	23	2					311	325		10.1023/A:1013883528244								WOS:000174122300005

Additionally, PBDE congener profiles were determined using semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) deployed in the Fraser River, the river in Western Canada with the largest industrial activity. PBDE levels detected in biota were between 4 and 2300 ng/g lipid and these levels were compared with those reported in selected European biota to provide a wider perspective on PBDE contamination on Canada's West Coast. Thirteen-congener PBDE patterns in the environmental samples were examined using principal component analysis (PCA), and additionally, comparisons were made between the PBDE profiles in the sample groups and commercially used PBDE technical mixtures (e.g., Bromkals) on a percent composition basis. PCA on congener specific data revealed that PBDE patterns are remarkably similar over a wide geographical range in Western Canada, however, the general pattern in environmental samples varies significantly from those of the predominant technical mixtures. Finally, correlations between PBDE and other persistent and toxic co-occurring contaminants found in Dungeness crab were determined. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

A battery of biochemical markers-biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes-were also measured in liver subcellular fractions to assess exposure to pollutants. Among them, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, as well as 7-penthoxyresorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activity and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) content evidenced strong differences among sampling sites, and a good correlation with the amount of PCBs bioaccumulated by fish. No clear pollution-related response was observed for cytosolic glutathione S-transferase, whereas uridine-diphosphate UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) was elevated in fish from polluted sites. Antioxidant enzymes-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)-were used to assess oxidative stress. Among them, catalase activity was well related to PCB body burden.

Firstly, a sentinel-calf study was used to determine the age window for ECF immunisation by determining ages at clinical detection of infection with Theileria parva. Six groups of five naive cross-bred (Bos taurus/Bos indicus) male calves, introduced at intervals of 2 months at a mean age of 26 days, were exposed to natural tick challenge on a high ECF-risk, small-holder farm in the coastal lowland, coconut-cassava agro-ecological zone of coastal Kenya. Secondly, a challenge study evaluated the relationship between the presence of T parva antibodies and immunity. Ten indigenous adult Zebu cattle and nine Zebu young stock purchased from farmers in the same zone, and eight cross-bred calves (survivors of the sentinel-calf study) were challenged with 10 times the immunising dose of T. parva Marikebuni stock. Twenty-four of these 27 cattle had high antibody titres before challenge. Two cross-bred calves, obtained from an ECF-free area and seronegative to T. parva schizont antigen, also were challenged and used as susceptible controls. Twenty-five (83%) of the 30 sentinel calves contracted ECF over an age range of 36-116 days (mean 72 days). The remaining five calves died of other causes within 2 months of arrival on the farm. Fourteen of the 25 calves survived the infection and developed antibodies to T parva. Despite tick control, seven of these 14 calves had a second episode of ECF and two died. In total, 13 of the 25 calves that contracted ECF died. Only one of 19 indigenous Zebu animals developed clinical ECF when challenged with T parva Marikebuni (mild clinical signs with spontaneous recovery). Of the eight cross-bred survivors from the first experiment, only one succumbed to ECF when challenged and it died. Both susceptible cross-bred calves developed severe clinical signs of ECF and one died. The experimental studies show that in the high ECF-risk areas of the coconut-cassava zone of coastal Kenya, immunisation against ECF in cross-bred (B. taurus/B. indicus) cattle should be targeted at an early age (preferably within 1-2 months of birth).

J	Foley, JE; Foley, P; Madigan, JE				Foley, JE; Foley, P; Madigan, JE			Spatial distribution of seropositivity to the causative agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis in dogs in California	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH												Objective-To assess spatial and temporal patterns of seroprevalence among dogs in California to the causative agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis (GE). Sample Population-Sera of 1,082 clinically normal dogs from 54 of 59 counties in California in 1997 to 1998. Procedures-Serum-specific IgG reactivity to Ehrlichia equi was assessed by use of an immunofluorescent antibody assay, using E equi-infected horse neutrophils as substrate. Data were analyzed, using a geographic information system. Spatial analysis of seroprevalence included first order Bayesian analysis of seroprevalence and second order analysis of clustering by K-function and Cuzick-Edwards tests. Monthly seroprevalence among dogs was examined by use of regression on monthly densities of Ixodes pacificus adults and nymphs. Results-Seroprevalence among dogs to E equi was 8.68%. Data were seasonally bimodal with highest prevalence in winter (when adult ticks were abundant) and a secondary peak in late spring (corresponding to nymphal ticks). Humboldt County had the highest seroprevalence (473%), and other northern coast range counties had seroprevalence from 15 to 30%. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The patchy distribution of exposure to Ehrlichia organisms is a subset of the distribution of the tick vector. This may reflect enzootic cycles or climatic or historical factors that limited the range of the disease. Dogs, horses, and humans from north coast range counties in California are at increased risk of GE. These data provide a background for assessing risk of infection 'in horses and dogs, depending on geographic location. Dogs may be sentinels for assessing risk of GE in humans.																	0002-9645					OCT	2001	62	10					1599	1605		10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1599								WOS:000171270700014	11592326

Most species were highly differentiated from each other (Nei's genetic distance, 0.29-1.63). The least genetic distance was found between M. japonicus and M. banzai, the genetic distinctiveness of the two taxa being supported by three divergent loci with no common allele. The genetic relationships among Macrophthalmus species differed greatly from those inferred from morphological features, with a UPGMA tree suggesting that the sub-genus Macrophthalmus is polyphyletic.

J	Sparling, DW; Fellers, GM; McConnell, LL				Sparling, DW; Fellers, GM; McConnell, LL			Pesticides and amphibian population declines in California, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Several species of anuran amphibians have undergone drastic population declines in the western United States over the last 10 to 15 years. In California, the most severe declines are in the Sierra Mountains east of the: Central Valley and downwind of the intensely agricultural San Joaquin Valley. In contrast, coastal and more northern populations across from the less agrarian Sacramento Valley are stable or declining Less precipitously. In this article, we provide evidence that pesticides are instrumental in declines of these species. Using Hyla regilla as a sentinel species, we found that cholinesterase (ChE) activity in tadpoles was depressed in mountainous areas east of the Central Valley compared with sites along the coast or north of the Valley. Cholinesterase was also lower in areas where ranid population status was poor or moderate compared with areas with good ranid status. Up to 50% of the sampled population in areas with reduced ChE had detectable organophosphorus residues, with concentrations as high as 190 ppb wet weight. In addition, up to 86% of some populations had measurable endosulfan concentrations and 40% had detectable 4,4 ' -dichlorodiphrnyldichloroethylenr, 4,4 ' -DDT, and 2,4 ' -DDT residues.

A major concern relating to this approach is that, in time, it will be compromised by the selection of mosquito genotypes that are resistant at the biochemical or behavioural level. We report entomological data from a large area in Burkina Faso where insecticide-treated curtains have been in use for up to 5 years. Longitudinal indoor and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were performed in 4 sentinel villages. In addition cross-sectional surveys using indoor spray catches and outdoor CDC light-trap catches were performed each September in a larger number of villages, including 8 located outside the intervention area. We found no evidence of the selection of mosquito phenotypes that might compromise the intervention. Indoor and outdoor vector densities remained very low after 5 years of intervention, both compared with pre-intervention levels and with concurrent levels outside the intervention area. We found no evidence of a switch to outdoor rather than indoor biting. The proportion of blood meals taken on humans may have decreased but our data are inconclusive on this point. We observed higher vector densities and sporozoite rates at the periphery of the intervention zone than at the centre, which may reflect re-invasion of peripheral villages by mosquitoes from outside the intervention area. In 'real life' programmes, with perhaps patchy, less than optimal coverage, the protection against malaria transmission provided to individuals using insecticide-treated materials may be less than that achieved in the randomized controlled trials which demonstrated an impact of insecticide-treated materials on child mortality.																	0035-9203					JUL-AUG	2001	95	4					353	360		10.1016/S0035-9203(01)90179-8								WOS:000171336900003	11579872

ACTA BIOQUIMICA CLINICA LATINOAMERICANA												The study and development of bioanalytical methodologies applied to appropriated indigenous freshwater sentinels were proposed for early detection of xenobiotics exposition in natural waters. In this sense, metallic uptake was correlated with the expression of biomarkers of contamination such as metallothioneins in studies developed in the Mediterranean and Baltic seas. The results obtained from the development and optimization of biomarkers in characteristic sentinels of the Rio de la Plata coast in acute exposition assays to heavy metal were shown in the present study. Bivalves mollusk (Corbicula fluminea and Limnoperna fortunei), and aquatic plants (Schoenoplectus californicus, Sagitaria montevidensis and Pistia stratiotes) were selected as sentinels. The kinetic uptake of copper and cadmium and the expression of cytosolic proteins were particularly analyzed. Metal content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and the protein pattern modification was assessed by using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, in Tristricine system, followed by coomasie blue and silver staining.																	0325-2957					JUN	2001	35	2					261	271										WOS:000170613600007

Florida (1996, n = 39,131: 1997, n = 34,209). Bartow, Florida (1996, n = 12,000: 1997. n = 12,000), and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (1996, n = 12,257) were tested by a polymerase chain reaction and Southern hybridization-based test for the presence of third-stage larvae of the canine heartworm Dirofilaria immitis. Mosquito heads were pooled (1-200 heads) by month, locality, and species for testing. The test used was species specific for D. immitis and was capable of detecting DNA from a single larva in a pool of 200 mosquito heads. Specificity for the third larval stage was achieved by probing only mosquito heads. One or more D. immitis-infected mosquito heads were detected in each month of the year from Bartow in both 1996 and 1997. No infected mosquito heads were detected from Gainesville or Baton Rouge in December, January. February, or March. These results are in general agreement with previous sentinel dog and model prediction studies that showed heartworm transmission in the warm temperate Gulf coast region of the United States to be seasonal rather than continuous as previously believed.																	0022-3395					APR	2001	87	2					322	329		10.1645/0022-3395(2001)087[0322:SPOTSL]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000168179200013	11318562

Although, part of this ecosystem received several types of pollutants which are discharged in the seawater without any treatment. In previous studies, in which acetylcholinesterase and glutathione S-transferase activities were used as biomarkers of pollution in Agadir Bay, we demonstrated that marine organisms (Donax trunculus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Perna perna) living at the sites receiving domestic and industrial wastewater were affected (Najimi et al. 1997; Kaaya et al. 1999; Lagbouri, 1997). The study of these organism's biology showed many perturbations in the reproductive cycle and growth (Id-Halla et al. 1997; Lagbouri, 1997). In order to determinate whether metallic pollution was responsible for these perturbations, three heavy metals (zinc as essential metal, cadmium and copper known to have toxic effects) were analyzed in mussels. In fact, heavy metals were waste products of many industrial processes and were important causes of environmental pollution (Viarengo, 1985; Viarengo, 1989). Data about heavy metals in marine organisms from Moroccan coasts were rare and limited to the north Atlantic coasts (El Hraiki et al. 1994, Cheggour et al. 1999). The purpose of the present study was to assess the trace-metal content (Cd, Cu and Zn) in two species of mussels, the Mediterranean mussel M. galloprovincialis and the Africans mussel P. perna, collected in the Agadir bay (South of Morocco). The accumulation and transformation capabilities of pollutants make these sentinel organisms suitable for marine pollution monitoring (Lower and Kendall, 1990). The choice of Cd, Cu and Zn in this study, resided in the fact that they were the most heavy metals present in the wastewater in the area studied (Bari, 1994). Otherwise, this work constituted also a contribution in the assessment of the heavy metal level in the African North-West coasts which were characterized by an important upwelling. It completes the studies realized in the Mauritanian part of these coasts, by Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli (1988) and Sidoumou et al. (1992, 1999). Considering that many factors could affect the trace metals bioaccumulation in mollusks, e.g. physiological state, size and season (Romeo and Gnassia-Barelli 1988), our study investigated the metallic concentrations according to the season, animal size and distribution in organs. It was realized in two different sites of the Agadir bay.																	0007-4861					OCT	2000	65	4					478	485		10.1007/s001280000149                                                           								WOS:000089262600010	10960139

The levels of Po-210 among the tested species ranged from 65.8 to 2,668.9 Bq kg(-1). Analyses indicated that the soft tissues of the bivalves registered a higher level of Po-210 than the shells. Further, analyses also showed a non-uniformity in the distribution of Po-210 in the various internal organs. The concentration recorded in them maintained the following descending order: digestive glands > viscera > gills > foot > mantle > shell. It is evident that P. indica could be used as a sentinel organism for Po-210 in the ambient waters.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				SEP	2000	29	3					263	267										WOS:000165490700012

Between June 1996 and November 1997, in the context of a study to determine the effect of placental malaria on mother-to-child transmission of HN in western Kenya, HIV-1 antibody testing was offered to women with a singleton uncomplicated pregnancy of greater than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation attending the ANC. Women were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and had a fingerstick blood sample collected for haemoglobin (Hb), malaria smears, and HIV antibody testing. Overall HIV seroprevalence was 26.1% (743/2844) (95% confidence interval (CI): 24.5-27.7) and in bivariate evaluation was significantly associated with anaemia (Hb <11 g/dl) (risk ratio (RR) 1.8), malarial parasitaemia (RR 1.6), fever (axillary temperature greater than or equal to 37.5 degrees C at screening) (RR 1.6), a history of being treated for either vaginal discharge (RR 1.5) or tuberculosis (RR 1.6), reported alcohol consumption (RR 1.6), being an unmarried multigravida (RR 2.2) or a history of the most recent child having died (RR 2.0). Poisson regression analysis for all women identified 5 significant factors independently associated with HIV seropositivity: anaemia (adjusted RR 1.7; 95% CI 1.3-2.0), malarial parasitaemia (adjusted RR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4-2.0), a history of being treated for vaginal discharge (adjusted RR 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.0), fever (adjusted RR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-3.2) and reported alcohol consumption (adjusted RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Multigravidae women whose most recent child had died were also more Likely to be HIV seropositive (adjusted RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.7-2.8). Only 5.5% (156/2844) of the women had none of these risk factors, of whom 12% (18/156) were HIV(+). Even though the model containing the 5 identified factors fitted the data well (goodness-of-fit chi(2)=18.41, P=0.10), its collective capacity to predict HIV infection was poor; while 74% of the truly positive women were correctly predicted positive by the model, 52% of the truly negative women were misclassified. Among pregnant women attending the ANC in western Kenya, we were unable to identify a subgroup at risk of HIV infection using non-serological information, indicating that wherever possible universal access to voluntary HIV counselling and testing would be preferable to targeted screening.																	0956-4624					JUN	2000	11	6					393	+		10.1258/0956462001916119								WOS:000087597400009	10872913

Levels of metals were low in most of the sampling stations and similar to those found by other authors in uncontaminated zones. Certain locations, however, showed some degree of contamination (Cambrils, Almassora, Alacant, Mar Menor and El Portus). In Santa Pola we found high contents of metals in one sample of sediment due to the high proportion of the fine fraction (particules < 63 mu m) and organic matter, but not in the seagrass species. Mercury and zinc concentrations in the sediment are correlated to those in at least some anatomic fractions of Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa and Caulerpa prolifera, suggesting that these species reflect the levels of these metals in the environment. Lead contents in the alga Caulerpa prolifera are also correlated to those in the sediment, while no significant correlations were obtained for cadmium. Among the species studied, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa seem to be better biomonitors than Caulerpa prolifera.																	0173-9565					MAY	2000	21	1					1	16		10.1046/j.1439-0485.2000.00642.x								WOS:000087819400001

This trial started in December 1990 and ended in February 1992. It was undertaken in two adjacent ranches in the coast province of Kenya. The trial site was in an area of high apparent density (AD) of tsetse flies, and at the start of the trial no cattle were kept in this area. Cypermethrin was applied fortnightly to the 1100 steers which were kept in pour-on ranch 'A' while another 100 steers were kept in control ranch 'B' to act as control sentinels. From the main pour-on group, 100 animals were identified as the pour-on sentinels and compared to the control sentinels which received no pour-on. Pour-on application led to a significant decrease in the tsetse AD in the pour-on ranch A to 90% of the initial AD in some areas. The animals treated with pour-on had a significantly higher mean packed-cell volume (PCV). The weekly prevalence of trypanosome infections in animals treated with pour-on was <4% with only one exception when it was <10%. In the control animals, the prevalence ranged between 10 and 50% (with a few exceptions when it was <10%). The incidence of tick-borne diseases was lower in the pour-on animals. The mean monthly weights of the pour-on animals was significantly higher, and at the end of the trial the pour-on animals had a mean weight gain of 136.70 +/- 16.7 kg while the control animals had gained 97.16 +/- 22.6 kg. The financial net return of using cypermethrin pour-on was positive and the financial rate of return of 122.6% indicated that use of the pour-on was highly beneficial despite the high cost of the product.

J	Dykstra, MJ; Kane, AS				Dykstra, MJ; Kane, AS			Pfiesteria piscicida and ulcerative mycosis of Atlantic menhaden - Current status of understanding	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Ulcerative lesions in estuarine finfish are associated with a variety of parasitic, bacterial. and fungal infectious agents as well as water quality and other abiotic stress factors. Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus are a severely affected species typically exhibiting solitary. perianal. focal. deep, granulomatous lesions: containing oomycete hyphae. intense recent emphasis in the scientific literature and in the popular press has been placed on Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates and their toxins as the causative agents for ulcerative finfish lesions in cast coast estuaries of the United Stares. Dramatic descriptive terms for Pfiesteria, including "phantom," "ambush-predator" and "the cell from hell." capable of affecting humans. have appeared in scientific journals and the: news media. However, there is no scientific evidence to date that supports a single, causal relationship between the presence of toxic Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates and fish kills or the associated ulcerative lesions. This is due, at least in part, to the difficulty of maintaining toxic Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates in clonal culture and, in part, to the presence of other microorganisms in laboratory culture systems. Further, there is at present no toxin-specific probe to identify Pfiesteria toxins in estuarine environments during fish frills, nor has Pfiesteria been isolated from fish lesions. Yet, based on the limited published scientific evidence and the popular press coverage. there have been river closures. notable economic Losses, and public alarm due to Pfiesteria. Future research into agents infectious to menhaden, such as Aphanomyces (Oomycetes) and toxin-producing estuarine inhabitant like Pfiesteria, is needed. These organisms and the disease processes in which they are implicated may also serve as markers for overall estuarine condition. Control of microorganisms, including Pfiesteria, to improve finfish health in estuaries is unlikely. However, using the presence of these microorganisms and their Atlantic menhaden hosts as sentinels to help monitor water quality may be a viable approach to assist future estuarine management.																	0899-7659					MAR	2000	12	1					18	25		10.1577/1548-8667(2000)012<0018:PPAUMO>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000086271700003	28880773

Three established biomarkers, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, metallothionein concentration and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, were intercalibrated. The stability of lysosomal membranes in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.) was assessed with a cytochemical method. The four participating laboratories were able to discriminate between control animals (membrane labilization times ranging from 21 to 35 min) and Cu-exposed animals (40 mu g/l Cu for 3 days) (labilization times ranging from 4.5 to 7.4 min). The metallothionein concentration was evaluated in digestive gland homogenates of control mussels and of animals exposed to 200 mu g/l Cd for 7 days. The eight participating laboratories were able to discriminate between controls and treated samples using a spectrophotometric method. The EROD activity was evaluated by 11 laboratories. All laboratories were able to discriminate between liver microsomal preparations obtained from control and from benzo-a-pyrene exposed fisk(Dicentrarchus labrax), with values ranging from 0.5 to 15.88 pmol/min/mg protein in controls and from 5.41 to 165.13 pmol/min/mg protein in treated animals. Using S9 fractions, it was possible to correctly identify control and treated fish, with a variation similar to that found using microsomal fractions, albeit with an inevitable difference in specific activity. As a corollary, all laboratories involved produced comparable data and were able to identify pollutant-induced stress syndromes in sentinel organisms. Thus, intercalibration enables the use of biomarkers in large biomonitoring programs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE: TO determine the rate of primary resistance to antituberculosis drugs. METHODS: Consecutive new tuberculous patients with positive smear were recruited from tuberculosis centres and rural health centres. Drug susceptibility testing was performed according to the proportion method. Positive cultures were tested against streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol. All resistant strains and 10% of all randomly sampled cultures were sent to an external laboratory for quality control. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests were performed for consenting patients at the tuberculosis centres. RESULTS: Among the 430 samples, 320 were available for analysis. Primary resistance to antituberculosis drugs was observed for 13.4% of the patients (43/320); multidrug resistance (to at least isoniazid and rifampicin) was observed for 5.3% of the patients; 14.2% of HIV-negative and 16.2% of HIV-positive patients were resistant to at least one antituberculosis drug (P = 0.70). CONCLUSION: This study is representative of antituberculosis drug resistance in Gate d'Ivoire, The rate of primary resistance is high and emphasises the need for a sentinel survey of tuberculous resistance. The National Tuberculosis Control Programme needs to make improvements in its management of tuberculosis cases.																	1027-3719					SEP	1999	3	9					805	809										WOS:000082391500012	10488889

Tributyltin (TBT) was the major compound detected, ranging from 200 to 1,100 ng/g wet weight as Sn. Tributyltin metabolites and triphenyltin (TPhT) were also detected, although to a lesser extent. Virtually organotin-free mollusks were obtained in the Alfacs Bay (Ebro Delta). Aromatase activity was determined in the digestive gland of a selected number of samples by measuring the tritiated water release from [1 beta-H-3]-androstenedione, Enzyme activity was linear as a function of incubation time and protein content of the microsomal fraction. It was determined at a substrate concentration of 10 mu M, and it exhibited a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetic, with an apparent constant, K-m, of 32 +/- 3 mu M. Low aromatase activity (217-264 fmol/h/mg protein) was seen in mussels sampled in TBT-polluted environments compared with mussels from the virtually organotin-free point (345 fmol/h/mg protein). These results support the hypothesis of a TBT-mediated inhibition of cytochrome P450-aromatase activity in mussels, although no significant changes on tissue titers of testosterone/estradiol were observed.

Borrelia burgdorferi sensu late was not isolated from rodents' organs, and from 80 I. ricinus nymphs and 50 adults. Moreover, PCR for B. burgdorferi sl carried out on 110 nymphs and 12 adult ticks also gave negative results. Forest workers were at higher risk of tick bite than other Estate employees (relative risk (RR): 1.7, p = 0.02).

These experimental trials aimed for high ITBN coverage combined with high re-treatment rates. Whilst necessary to understand protective efficacy, the approaches used to deliver the inter vention provide few indications of what coverage of net re-treatment would be under operational conditions. Varied delivery and financing strategies have been proposed for the sustainable delivery of ITBNs and retreatment programmes. Following the completion of a randomized, controlled trial on the Kenyan coast, a series of suitable delivery strategies were used to continue net re-treatment in the area. The trial adopted a bi-annual, house-to-house re-treatment schedule free of charge using research project staff and resulted in over 95% coverage of nets issued to children. During the year following the trial, sentinel dipping stations were situated throughout the community and household members informed of their position and opening times. This free re-treatment service achieved between 61-67% coverage of nets used by children for three years. In 1997 a social marketing approach, that introduced cost-retrieval, was used to deliver the net retreatment services. The immediate result of this transition was that significantly fewer of the mothers who had used the previous re-treatment services adopted this revised approach and coverage declined to 7%. The future of new delivery services and their financing are discussed in the context of their likely impact upon previously defined protective efficacy and cost-effectiveness estimates.																	0268-1080					MAR	1999	14	1					18	25		10.1093/heapol/14.1.18								WOS:000079479800003	10351466

The PAH concentrations determined in the organisms were significantly negatively correlated with logK(ow) values, but to different extents; according to the species. This was explained by the greater exposure of the organisms to the lower molecular weight compounds with differences resulting from different feeding habits, habitat, and biotransformation capacities of the organisms in relation to trophic levels. The influence of these observations on the use of different sentinel species in biomonitoring programmes is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Koivula, K; Ronka, A				Koivula, K; Ronka, A			Habitat deterioration and efficiency of antipredator strategy in a meadow-breeding wader, Temminck's stint (Calidris temminckii)	OECOLOGIA												Many populations of waders breeding on open shores and shores with short vegetation especially on the Baltic coasts have recently become endangered. The declines have taken place simultaneously with human-induced loss and deterioration of habitats due to eutrophication and overgrowth. To Investigate mechanisms by which habitat changes could affect breeding success and ultimately population dynamics, we studied an endangered coastal population of Temminck's stint. We hypothesized that the rate of nest predation has become higher because the nest defence strategy (early detection of predator and early departure from the nest), which originally evolved in open habitats, is less effective on shores with reduced visibility. As predicted. nests survived better on wide than on narrow shores. Predation made a major contribution to this trend. although successful and predated nests did not differ in concealment at a microhabitat scale. The better the visibility from the nest, the longer was the flushing distance, but only in response to alarm calls or behaviour of other species, not when they were absent. Temminck's stints seem to obtain information about an approaching predator visually from sentinels. Therefore, it is essential that there is at least moderate visibility around the nest. We conclude that habitat characteristics - visibility from the nest and sentinel birds - affect the effectiveness of the nest defence strategy of Temminck's stint. These should be taken into account when seeking causes and mechanisms for declines of Temminck's stint and other waders of open and shortly vegetated shores.																	0029-8549	1432-1939				SEP	1998	116	3					348	355		10.1007/s004420050597								WOS:000076034600007	28308066

Metal concentrations in SPM (Cu: 7.4-109; Cr: 75-408; Mn: 525-1341 mu g(-1)), sediments (Cr: 16-27; Zn: 26-99; Mn: 221-489 mu g(-1)) and bivalves (Cd: 0.5-1.9; Ni: 1.36.4; Cr: 1.3-11; Mn: 15-81; Cu: 28-89; Zn: 118-316 mu g g(-1)) are comparable to those reported for other moderately polluted world rivers. Cu levels in Asiatic clams are among the highest, similar to those reported for heavily polluted sites. SPM Cu and Cr concentrations displayed a clear geographical trend with values increasing with proximity to major urban centers. Sediments showed a less clear pattern possibly due to their coarse nature (> 98% sand) and higher proportion of mineral-associated residual metals. The clams showed a complex pattern due to the variability introduced by size-related factors and the natural dynamics of SPM in the estuary. Cr and Mn showed an apparent reverse industrial trend with higher concentrations in clams collected at distant stations near the turbidity maximum zone, possibly reflecting enhanced particle retention. Cu, Cd and Ni showed no clear geographical pattern, whereas Zn increased in the clams collected in the most industrialized area. A significant relationship with clam size was observed for Cu (positive) and Zn (negative) suggesting different physiological requirements for both metals with age. A principal component analysis confirmed these geographical and size-related trends. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Overall, five patterns dominated the geographic distribution of the parasite fauna. (1) Certain parasites, such as Nematopsis, were principally associated with oysters from the southeast and Gulf coasts. (2) Discounting Nematopsis, oysters and mussels did not differ significantly in total parasite infection intensity (3) West coast mussel populations were always lower in infection intensity than East coast mussels and rarely showed anything but a sporadic pattern of infection. (4) East coast mussels typically had a focus of infection in the Boston Harbor region. (5) With the exception of Nematopsis, mussels on the West coast, Mytilus edulis and Mytilus californianus, did not differ significantly in their parasite fauna. The geographic distributions of most parasites and disease-causing organisms varied independently. Any two parasites rarely co-occurred predictably over wide areas and never on more than one coast. Certain contaminants were correlated with certain parasites on one coast but not the other or in one bivalve type but not another. Statistics that emphasized infection intensity found significant relationships between parasitism and contaminant body burden most often in East and Gulf coast oysters and West coast mussels and, in most cases, higher body burdens were associated with lower infection intensities, Statistics that emphasized prevalence also identified significant relationships most often in East and Gulf coast oysters and West coast mussels, In contrast to infection intensity, most significant results occurred because parasites were observed more often in locales characterized by higher contaminant body burdens. In no case was a parasite/contaminant pair significant for both infection intensity and prevalence. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bshary, R; Noe, R				Bshary, R; Noe, R			Red colobus and Diana monkeys provide mutual protection against predators	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												We tested the hypothesis that red colobus monkeys, Piocolobus badius, and Diana monkeys, Celcopithecus diana, in Tai National Park, Ivory Coast, associate to increase safety from predation. We recorded stratum use, exposure and vigilance of each species in the presence and in the absence of the partner species. in the presence of Diana monkeys, red colobus used lower strata more often, were more exposed to the forest floor and looked down less often while foraging. This suggests that red colobus reduce predation pressure from ground predators by associating with Diana. There are several indications that both species are less vulnerable to birds of prey when associated: red colobus looked sideways less often and were more exposed to the front, Diana monkeys used greater heights and were more exposed to the front, to the rear and from above. We also asked whether specific sentinel qualities of Diana monkeys might explain why other sympatric monkey species additionally seek their presence. When groups of various species compositions were approached by an observer, or confronted with an eagle model, Diana monkeys raised the alarm in most cases. Since neither monkey species improves its foraging success when associated, this study shows that predation can both maintain and be the ultimate cause of interspecific associations.

J	Bshary, R; Noe, R				Bshary, R; Noe, R			Anti-predation behaviour of red colobus monkeys in the presence of chimpanzees	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY												Predator-prey interactions are usually regarded as evolutionary ''arms races'', but evidence is still scarce. We examined whether the anti-predation strategies of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) are adapted to the hunting strategies of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Tdi chimpanzees search for red colobus groups, approach them silently and hunt co-operatively. Our playback experiments and observations of natural encounters revealed that red colobus hid higher up the trees in positions where exposure to the forest floor is minimal and became silent, when chimpanzees were close. They moved away silently through the canopy, when chimpanzees were still at some distance. However, if a group of diana monkeys was nearby in the latter situation, red colobus sought their presence even if they had to move towards the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees refrained from hunting associated red colobus groups, probably because diana monkeys are excellent sentinels for predators approaching over the forest floor. Thus several elements of both the predator's and the prey's strategies correspond to each other. Finally, we compared the interactions between the two species in Tai and in Gombe, Tanzania. We suggest that the difference in size ratio between the two species at the two sites and adaptation of hunting techniques and of escape modes to different forest structures can explain why Gombe red colobus attack chimpanzees while Tai red colobus try to escape. We conclude that predator-prey interactions can indeed lead to evolutionary arms races, with the specific form of co-adaptations depending on environmental factors.

Eight sentinel herds that seroconverted to bluetongue viruses between 1990 and 1994, and for which insect-trapping data were available, were selected for inclusion in the study. These herds were located at six sites along the eastern coast of Queensland, Australia, from approximately latitude 10 degrees South to 25 degrees South. C. brevitarsis was detected at all locations where sentinel herds were maintained, whereas C. wadai was detected at only two locations in northern Queensland where four sentinel herds were maintained during the study period. The mean number of C. brevitarsis and C. wadai caught per month was 230 and 21, respectively. A significant (P=0.05) positive association was found between the risk of seroconversion of sentinel cattle to bluetongue viruses and the number of C. wadai caught in the same month.

The composition of butyltin compounds was different according to the organism and sampling point, but in general elevated concentrations of TBT were noticed in molluscs. The highest organotin residue levels (5.4 mu g/g d.w. as Sn) were detected in mussels from Masnou, a recreational marina, followed by those collected in Barcelona harbor (1.2 mu g/g d.w. as Sn). In contrast, no organotin compounds were detected in fish muscle and very low levels in the other organs, being TPT the major organotin in red mullet liver.

Similar regression models were obtained between the VD of BSD and metal/shell-wt indices resulting from pooling the 7 metals (mu mol metal g(-1) dry shell weight). In conclusion, metal bioavailability can be estimated by analysing the VD of BSD in the digestive lysosomes of sentinel mussels. This index may allow workers to discard chemical analysis of biological samples when low traces of metals are present in the tissues, since the method proposed herein provides a quick and cost-effective alternative to routine chemical analyses in biomonitoring programmes. Only when values of VD of BSD reach the plateau of the function would a more accurate chemical analysis be required. This approach does not require special facilities or specialised technicians and would reduce the time and cost of routine metal determination in water pollution monitoring programmes.

Based on preliminary studies, we hypothesized that differences in CYP1A mRNA inducibility among individuals, populations, or species might lead to spurious conclusions when using this approach in environmental monitoring programs. To address this possibility, we quantitated and compared CYP1A mRNA induction levels in four species of common Atlantic Coast estuarine fish: smooth flounder, hogchoker, striped bass, and Atlantic tomcod, which were treated with model chemicals (beta naphthoflavone (beta-NF), or benzo[a]pyrene at 10 ppm) known to induce CYP1A mRNA, or were exposed to contaminated environments. Species-specific CYP1A DNA probes were generated from PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of genomic DNA using conserved oligonucleotide primers, and, along with cloned rainbow trout and Atlantic tomcod CYP1A cDNA probes were used to quantify CYP1A mRNA levels in northern blot analyses. Successful PCR amplification of CYP1A hybridizable DNA fragments was observed for all four species. Results from northern blot analyses showed large differences in CYP1A mRNA induction among species; only Atlantic tomcod exhibited significant induction of CYP1A mRNA for both chemically treated (97-fold) and environmentally exposed fish (34-fold). Significant, although lower, levels of induction were observed in beta-NF treated (14-fold) smooth flounder, but not in environmentally exposed smooth flounder. Only low levels (not significant) of CYP1A gene induction were detected in hogchokers and striped bass. We conclude that CYP1A mRNA inducibility differed significantly among fish taxa perhaps due to differences in regulation of gene expression, suggesting that careful selection of sentinel species should be exercised prior to the use of CYP1A mRNA induction in environmental monitoring programs. However, the significance of differences in CYP1A mRNA inducibility in relation to higher level biological endpoints has yet to be determined.																	0160-8347					DEC	1996	19	4					913	922		10.2307/1352307								WOS:A1996WH23300014

C brevitarsis was recorded progressively from endemic areas on the north coast, to Nowra on the south coast, and westward to Scone, in the Hunter Valley. C brevitarsis also survived through winter at Paterson, in the Hunter Valley. Its apparently focal reappearance in this marginal area had no obvious effect on the broad pattern of its progression or the dispersal of Akabane and bluetongue viruses. These viruses were first recorded from foci near Coffs Harbour, on the mid-north coast. Their first occurrences at different locations were associated with those of C brevitarsis, but not with each other. The viruses were found only within the recorded limits of the vector's distribution, Delays between the initial occurrence of C brevitarsis and first evidence of virus transmissions at locations ranged from 2 to 7 months. The delays decreased away from the points of focus and were negatively associated with the time of initial occurrence of the vector. Seroconversions to the viruses were related to the presence of C brevitarsis. However, the densities of C brevitarsis had no apparent effect on the initial numbers of cattle seroconverting to either virus. The results support the conclusion that the progressions of C brevitarsis and Akabane and bluetongue viruses were the result of gradual movements by the vector.																	0005-0423	1751-0813				MAY	1996	73	5					174	178		10.1111/j.1751-0813.1996.tb10021.x								WOS:A1996UK37200004	8660239

Methods: Data from the national surveillance system for HIV infection and AIDS based in the Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health, were reviewed. These include case reports; HIV screening of blood donors, migrant farmworkers and US visa applicants; sentinel surveillance among antenatal clinic (ANC) attenders and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders; and various serosurveys. Results: A total of 669 AIDS cases were reported in Jamaica from December 1993 representing a cumulative AIDS case rate of 28 per 100 000 population. Since 1987 the annual AIDS case rate doubled every 2 years with 69% of individuals having died with AIDS. Heterosexual transmission predominates with the cumulative adult AIDS male-to-female case ratio declining from 2.8:1 in 1988 to 1.9:1 in 1993. A total of 55 children with AIDS account for 8.2% of all cases. The HIV infection rate per 1000 in 1993 was 3.8 among blood donors, 1.4 among ANC attenders and significantly higher among STD clinic attenders (men 6%, women 2.7%), homosexuals (9.6%), female prostitutes (12%) and individuals with repeat STD infections (10%). Consistent condom use increased from 27% in 1989 to 47% in 1993. Conclusions: HIV infection was introduced into Jamaica from abroad through several different routes including the Jamaican homosexual community, migrant farmworkers, female prostitutes, and informal commercial importers. HIV transmission is well established locally and is spreading more rapidly in Western Jamaica and along the North Coast, which may reflect increased sexual activity associated with tourism. Although awareness of AIDS and HIV is high and condom use has increased considerably, there are no grounds for complacency concerning the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Jamaica.																	0269-9370					JUL	1995	9	7					761	768		10.1097/00002030-199507000-00014								WOS:A1995RF92200014	7546422

Bioaccumulation depended on the routes of uptake and bioavailability determined by compound hydrophobicity. CHLPs were mainly present in the dissolved phase, showed a positive correlation between the bivalve-water BAFs and K-ow's and reached steady-state levels before 70 days in a caging experience. These facts reflect an efficient water-gill partitioning process. In contrast, PCBs were only detected in the SPM, showed essentially K-ow independent bivalve-sediment and bivalve-SPM BAFs with the lowest values for superhydrophobic heptachlorobiphenyls 174, 180, and 170, and did not reach steady-state levels during a 140-day exposure period. This suggests that the uptake was hindered by their stronger affinity for SPM and the interference of steric factors during intestine absorption. Corbicula fluminea are reliable sentinel organisms and showed clear geographical trends along 150 km of the Rio de La Plata coast: a progressive decrease of PCB levels and more degraded patterns dominated by recalcitrant congeners, i.e., 153, were observed with increasing distance from the major La Plata-Buenos Aires urban center. A size-related trend overlapped with this spatial gradient: older clams usually showed higher levels and a more degraded PCB signature. CHLPs showed less clear geographical trends due to the presence of multiple sources. CHLP patterns showed a strong dominance of chlordane-related compounds, particularly transchlordane which was 2-5 times more abundant than the cis isomer. On a temporal scale, from 1986 to 1993, Asiatic clams presented sustained PCB levels but showed a significant decrease of chlordane and DDT, which suggests reduced inputs in recent years.																	0013-936X					APR	1995	29	4					914	927		10.1021/es00004a011								WOS:A1995QP70900021	22176398

To better describe the geographic characteristics of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic in women, we analyzed data for more than 1.6 million newborn specimens tested for maternal antibody to HIV-1 in 35 states in 1989. To provide comparable geographic units for analysis, seroprevalence rates were calculated for state-designated health districts, which are groups of counties defined for the planning and delivery of health services. Health districts with greater-than-or-equal-to 75% of the population residing in urban areas as defined by the 1990 census were considered urban. Prevalence of HIV infection ranged from 0 to 12.2 per 1,000, with the highest rates found in urban health districts, primarily those on the East coast; however, high rates were also found in some nonurban districts, particularly in the South. Rates among black women were three to 35 times higher than in white women in nine states, regardless of urbanicity. These findings should be used to focus prevention activities and direct health care planners to urban and rural areas in need of HIV-related services for women.																	1077-9450					SEP	1993	6	9					1035	1042										WOS:A1993MC82800011	8340894

Local effects driving input of TBT and influencing the overall health of the organisms are suggested as responsible for these observations. The ratio of TBT to its principal degradation product dibutyltin (DBT) in bivalve mollusk tissues appears to be species specific and constant over a wide range of butyltin concentrations in the animals. The TBT/DBT ratios (mean +/- one standard deviation) were determined for the blue mussel Mytilus edulis (2.6 +/-1.0), the California mussel Mytilus californianus (6.2 +/- 4.0), and the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica (6.2 +/- 3.4).																	0730-7268					JAN	1993	12	1					139	153		10.1897/1552-8618(1993)12[139:TLIBMF]2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1993KE02900015

In 1983, the first case of Lyme borreliosis with multisystem involvement was identified. The endemic areas in Italy are the Ligurian coast, the province of Friuli Venezia Giulia, and the region surrounding the town of Bologna. In Liguria, the incidence of Lyme disease is about 17/100,000 inhabitants per year. Serosurveys of the general population and of sentinel animals were useless in determining the diffusion of Lyme borreliosis whereas evaluation of people at risk of tick bites and patients with suggestive signs or symptoms was more effective. Among the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, cutaneous involvement is four times more frequent than neuroborreliosis and arthritis is less frequent in Italy than in the USA.																	1121-7138					OCT	1992	15	4					419	424										WOS:A1992JW15400015	1435355

Surveillance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women is essential for monitoring the spread of HIV over time and identifying specific populations and geographic areas in need of HIV counseling, testing, and prevention services. Blinded (unlinked) serologic surveys were conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico in sentinel clinics providing reproductive health services to women, including family planning, prenatal care, and abortion services. Seventy-eight of 94 clinics (83%) in 30 cities conducting surveys during 1988 and 1989 detected at least one HIV-positive woman. Clinic-specific prevalence ranged from 0-2.28% (median 0.22%), with rates over 1% occurring in clinics predominantly on the East Coast and in Puerto Rico. Seroprevalence varied by primary type of service, race-ethnicity, and age group. Median rates were higher in clinics offering prenatal services and lower in abortion and family planning clinics in the same cities. In general, women 25-29 years of age showed the highest median rate of infection (0.32%), and rates were higher among black women (median 0.34%) than among Hispanic (median 0.11%) and white women (median 0%). Our data indicate the need to educate women about recognizing and reducing their risk of HIV infection. Reproductive health clinics with high seroprevalence should implement voluntary HIV counseling and testing with appropriate follow-up clinical evaluation and referral for infected women. Clinics with low prevalence should seize the opportunity to enhance HIV education and prevention efforts.																	0029-7844					APR	1992	79	4					503	510										WOS:A1992HL51100005	1553166

Vacuolated cell lesions have been reported from a number of species in association with degraded habitats, often in the presence of hepatic neoplasms. Extensive atypical vacuolated cell lesions assuming characteristic acinar or ductular configurations have been reported previously only from the winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus. Light microscopic findings, utilizing a variety of histochemical stains, suggest the identical nature of this lesion to that of winter flounder. The discovery of this lesion in a free-swimming species, feeding throughout the water column, is in direct contrast to that of the bottom dwelling pleuronectid, feeding from and constantly in contact with potentially contaminated sediments. While the winter flounder has become the sentinel fish species for pollution monitoring on the northeast coast, increased surveillance of other species may prove atypical vacuolated cell lesions represent a common mechanism of chronic cellular injury in relation to impacted environments.																	0177-5103					OCT 17	1991	11	3					225	228		10.3354/dao011225								WOS:A1991GM17600010

Radionuclides such as Ru-103, Ru-106, Ag-110m, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ce-141 and Ce-144 were immediately detected in the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile. A survey of this species showed a selective distribution amongst its tissues and a preferential contamination of the adult leaves. The rhizomes, which are perennial parts, recorded early contamination by Ag-110m, located by sectioning the annual segments (lepidochronology). Variations in the concentrations of several radionuclides found in adult leaves reveal the rapid decay and distribution of contamination in Mediterranean waters in 1986 and 1987, although the eastern part of the French coast had higher concentrations in 1986. Since adult leaves are continuously renewed and because of their rapid accumulation of radionuclides, they may be particularly interesting immediate sentinel accumulators in the event of a nuclear accident as well as in monitoring chronic contamination. It is suggested that a 'Posidonia Watch' could be set up around the Mediterranean Sea.				charmasson, sabine/P-6360-2016	charmasson, sabine/0000-0001-6936-1929												0265-931X						1991	13	2					157	173		10.1016/0265-931X(91)90057-M								WOS:A1991EQ28300006
