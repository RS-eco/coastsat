With the enrichment of available remote sensing platforms and sensors, the volume constantly growing, and more and more complicated data processing operations on data products, remote sensing data overload has been an obvious problem for anyone who is trying to set planning policies and monitor sea area usage activities based on the valuable data products. In order to solve the problem, this paper presents a customized remote sensing data management system (RSDM) for archiving and distributing the remote sensing data products for sea area usage management. This paper has identified a set of key domain requirements by reviewing the workflow of sea area usage management. In the RSDM, a metadata interpreter tool allows data managers to classify the data products into categorical data types according to a set of domain-specific business rules, and a data model based on data lineage is developed to support tracing all relevant data products along processing chains. In addition, a unified procedure, which is used to create Quick Look images with transparent border areas from different remote sensing data sources, is developed. What is more, the system provides summary information about the available data suitable for auditing and exploratory data analysis by using a series of statistic graphs from different perspectives for data managers and users. This paper demonstrates that the RSDM improves data managers' day-to-day working arrangements, and facilitates the application of the remote sensing technology in sea area usage management.																	0964-5691	1873-524X				FEB 1	2018	152						163	174		10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.11.028								WOS:000423647300016

An airborne remote sensing case study of synthetic hydrocarbon detection using short wave infrared absorption features identified from marine-harvested macro- and microplastics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The abundance and distribution of plastic debris in natural waters is largely unknown due to limited comprehensive monitoring. Here, optical properties of dry and wet marine-harvested plastic debris were quantified to explore the feasibility of plastic debris optical remote sensing in the natural environment. We measured the spectral reflectance of microplastics (< 5 mm) from the North Atlantic Ocean, macroplastics (> 5 mm) washed ashore along the USA west coast and virgin plastic pellets over a wavelength range from 350 to 2500 nm. Compared to the spectral variability of multi-colored dry macroplastics, the measured dry marine-harvested microplastic reflectance spectra could be represented as a single bulk average spectrum with notable absorption features at similar to 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm. The wet marine-harvested microplastics had similar spectral features to the dry microplastics but the magnitude was lower over the measured spectrum. When spectrally matched to the reference library of typical dry virgin pellets, the mean dry marine-harvested microplastics reflectance had moderate similarities to low-density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polymethyl methacrylate. This composition was consistent with the subset sampled with the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and what has been reported globally. The absorption features at 1215 and 1732 nm were observable through an intervening atmosphere and used to map the distributions of synthetic hydrocarbons at a landfill and on man-made structures from airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, indicating the potential to remotely sense dry washed ashore and land-origin plastics. These same absorption features were identifiable on wet marine-harvested microplastics, but the ability to conduct remote sensing of microplastics at the ocean surface layer will require more detailed radiative transfer analysis and development of high signal-to-noise sensors. The spectral measurements presented here provide a foundation for such advances towards remote detection of plastics from various platforms.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2018	205						224	235		10.1016/j.rse.2017.11.023								WOS:000423007700018

Coastal upwelling south of Madagascar: Temporal and spatial variability	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Madagascar's southern coastal marine zone is a region of high biological productivity which supports a wide range of marine ecosystems, including fisheries. This high biological productivity is attributed to coastal up-welling. This paper provides new insights on the structure, variability and drivers of the coastal upwelling south of Madagascar. Satellite remote sensing is used to characterize the spatial extent and strength of the coastal upwelling. A front detection algorithm is applied to thirteen years of Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) and an upwelling index is calculated. The influence of winds and ocean currents as drivers of the upwelling is investigated using satellite, in-situ observations, and a numerical model. Results reveal the presence of two well-defined upwelling cells. The first cell (Core 1) is located in the southeastern corner of Madagascar, and the second cell (Core 2) is west of the southern tip of Madagascar. These two cores are characterized by different seasonal variability, different intensities, different upwelled water mass origins, and distinct forcing mechanisms. Core 1 is associated with a dynamical upwelling forced by the detachment of the East Madagascar Current (EMC), which is reinforced by upwelling favourable winds. Core 2 appears to be primarily forced by upwelling favourable winds, but is also influenced by a poleward eastern boundary flow coming from the Mozambique Channel. The intrusion of Mozambique Channel warm waters could result in an asynchronicity in seasonality between upwelling surface signature and upwelling favourables winds.

These harmful algal blooms are the most visible consequences of marine eutrophication, driven by a surplus of nutrients from anthropogenic sources and internal processes of the ecosystem. We present a novel Cyanobacterial Bloom Indicator (CyaBI) targeted for the ecosystem assessment of eutrophication in marine areas. The method measures the current cyanobacterial bloom situation (an average condition of recent 5 years) and compares this to the estimated target level for 'good environmental status' (GES). The current status is derived with an index combining indicative bloom event variables. As such we used seasonal information from the duration, volume and severity of algal blooms derived from earth observation (50) data. The target level for GES was set by using a remote sensing based data set named Fraction with Cyanobacterial Accumulations (FCA; Kahru & Elmgren, 2014) covering years 1979-2014. Here a shift-detection algorithm for time series was applied to detect time-periods in the FCA data where the level of blooms remained low several consecutive years. The average conditions from these time periods were transformed into respective CyaBI target values to represent target level for GES. The indicator is shown to pass the three critical factors set for marine indicator development, namely it measures the current status accurately, the target setting can be scientifically proven and it can be connected to the ecosystem management goal. An advantage of the CyaBI method is that it's not restricted to the data used in the development work, but can be complemented, or fully applied, by using different types of data sources providing information on cyanobacterial accumulations.																	0303-2434					FEB	2018	64						145	155		10.1016/j.jag.2017.09.007								WOS:000413880000013

Other aerosol relevant fluxes, such as isoprene and sea spray, should also be enhanced, due to the steady strong winds during the monsoon. Marine air masses dominate the area during the summer monsoon, excluding the influence of continentally derived pollutants. During the SO234-2/235 cruise in the western tropical Indian Ocean from July to August 2014, directly measured eddy covariance DMS fluxes confirm that the area is a large source of sulfur to the atmosphere (cruise average 9.1 mu mol m(-2) d(-1)). The directly measured fluxes, as well as computed isoprene and sea spray fluxes, were combined with FLEXPART backward and forward trajectories to track the emissions in space and time. The fluxes show a significant positive correlation with aerosol data from the Terra and Suomi-NPP satellites, indicating a local influence of marine emissions on atmospheric aerosol numbers. Plain Language Summary The air-sea flux trace gases and their transformation to aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei may be fundamental to cloud formation in the marine environment. Clouds and aerosol have an important influence on the radiative balance of the earth. The local coupling of air-sea fluxes and the formation of aerosols and clouds over the ocean is still highly uncertain. This study combines directly measured air-sea fluxes with satellite aerosol remote sensing. It is a novel, interdisciplinary approach where results from air-sea gas transfer are combined with atmospheric chemistry satellite remote sensing using meteorological transport models. Our results strongly support a local influence of marine-derived aerosol precursors on cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol optical depth above the tropical Indian Ocean.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				JAN 16	2018	45	1					418	426		10.1002/2017GL076410								WOS:000423431800047

This study investigates the optical properties of nonspherical and inhomogeneous sea salts using invariant imbedding T-matrix simulations. Dry sea salt aerosols are modeled based on superellipsoidal geometries with a prescribed aspect ratio and roundness parameter. Wet sea salt particles are modeled as coated superellipsoids, as spherical particles with a superellipsoidal core, and as homogeneous spheres depending on the level of relative humidity. Aspect ratio and roundness parameters are found to be critical to interpreting the linear depolarization ratios (LDRs) of NaCl crystals from laboratory measurements. The optimal morphology parameters of NaCl necessary to reproduce the measurements are found to be consistent with data gleaned from an electron micrograph. The LDRs of wet sea salts are computed based on inhomogeneous models and compared with the measured data from ground-based LiDAR. The dependence of the LDR on relative humidity is explicitly considered. The increase in the LDR with relative humidity at the initial phase of deliquescence is attributed to both the size increase and the inhomogeneity effect. For large humidity values, the LDR substantially decreases because the overall particle shape becomes more spherical and the inhomogeneity effect in a particle on the LDR is suppressed for submicron sea salts. However, the effect of inhomogeneity on optical properties is pronounced for coarse-mode sea salts. These findings have important implications for atmospheric radiative transfer and remote sensing involving sea salt aerosols.

In this paper; we focused on the application of multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique for co-locating offshore wind farms and open-water mussel cultivation. An index of co-location sustainability (SI) was developed based on the application of MCE technique constructed with physical and biological parameters on the basis of remote sensing data. The relevant physical factors considered were wind velocity, depth range, concerning the site location for energy production, and sea surface temperature anomaly. The biological variables used were Chlorofill-a (as a measurement of the productivity) and Particle Organic Carbon (POC) concentration, in order to assess their influence on the probable benefits and complete the requirements of this management framework. This SI can be easily implemented to do a first order selection of the most promising areas to be more specifically studied in a second order approach based on local field data.

For six basins in the area, detailed geomorphological maps were compiled, based on extensive field studies and remote sensing datasets. Several phases of high and low lake levels were reconstructed and dated by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence. During the marine isotope stage (MIS) 6 lakes in southern and western Mongolia mostly disappeared. In contrast, large paleolakes existed during the last interglacial (MIS 5e) and lasted probably until the beginning of the last glacial. These huge lakes were caused by a strong East Asian summer monsoon, which reached southern and even western Mongolia. During the MIS 3 the monsoon was considerably weaker and most of the lakes were relatively small or even disappeared. Higher lake levels of this period were only recorded at the Orog Nuur. However, at this time the lake was fed by glacial melt water from the Khangai Mountains. The MIS 2 was again a very dry period. The previously supposed phase of synchronous high lake levels and glaciations in southern and western Mongolia is not supported by the data presented here. During the Holocene, lakes in the western and southern part of the study area evolved differently. Early Holocene high lake levels were reconstructed for the western lakes, while most of the southern lakes had highest lake levels in the mid Holocene. These differences can be attributed to different moisture bearing atmospheric systems. In the late Holocene lake levels were generally low and in the last 50 years most lakes completely disappeared due to a strong human usage of the water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Reflectance spectra for diatoms: Cyclotella meneghiniana and Skeletonema marinoi and cyanobacteria: Dolichospermum sp., Nodularia spumigena and Synechococcus sp. were analysed in terms of assessment of their characteristic features and the differences between them. These species contain similar pigments, which results in general similarities of reflectance spectra, i.e. decrease of reflectance magnitude in the blue and red spectrum regions. However, hyper-spectral resolution of optical measurements let us find differences between optical signatures of diatoms and cyanobacteria groups and between species belonging to one group as well. These differences are reflected in location of local maxima and minima in the reflectance spectrum and changes in relative height of characteristic peaks with changes of phytoplankton concentration. Wide ranges of phytoplankton concentrations were analysed in order to show the persistence of R-rs characteristic features. The picoplankton species, Synechococcus sp. show the most distinct optical signature, which let to distinguish separate cluster in hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The results can be used to calibrate input data into radiative transfer model, e.g. phase function or to validate modelled R-rs spectra.

Evidence for ubiquitous preferential particle orientation in representative oceanic shear flows	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In situ measurements were undertaken to characterize particle fields in undisturbed oceanic environments. Simultaneous, co-located depth profiles of particle fields and flow characteristics were recorded using a submersible holographic imaging system and an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, under different flow conditions and varying particle concentration loads, typical of those found in coastal oceans and lakes. Nearly one million particles with major axis lengths ranging from similar to 14 mu m to 11.6 mm, representing diverse shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios were characterized as part of this study. The particle field consisted of marine snow, detrital matter, and phytoplankton, including colonial diatoms, which sometimes formed "thin layers" of high particle abundance. Clear evidence of preferential alignment of particles was seen at all sampling stations, where the orientation probability density function (PDF) peaked at near horizontal angles and coincided with regions of low velocity shear and weak turbulent dissipation rates. Furthermore, PDF values increased with increasing particle aspect ratios, in excellent agreement with models of spheroidal particle motion in simple shear flows. To the best of our knowledge, although preferential particle orientation in the ocean has been reported in two prior cases, our findings represent the first comprehensive field study examining this phenomenon. Evidence of nonrandom particle alignment in aquatic systems has significant consequences to aquatic optics theory and remote sensing, where perfectly random particle orientation and thus isotropic symmetry in optical parameters is assumed. Ecologically, chain-forming phytoplankton may have evolved to form large aspect ratio chains as a strategy to optimize light harvesting.

A notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed in the optical properties of aerosols on the seasonal scale over East China. Aerosol optical depth at 550nm (AOD(550)) exhibited pronounced seasonal variability over Nanjing in the YRD, with higher values during summer and spring seasons and lower in winter. angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE(470-660)) found higher in summer indicating the relative abundance of fine mode aerosols over the coarse mode. We also used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for presenting cluster trajectory analysis which revealed that the airmasses from different source regions contributed greatly to aerosol loading during the study period. In addition, we followed two techniques for studying classification of major aerosol types based on the predefined thresholds. Using the AOD-AE method (here called as Technique-I), five major aerosol types were identified via, continental clean (CC), marine (MA), biomass burning/urban-industrial (BU), desert dust (DD), and mixed (MX). In all the seasons, MX is the dominant aerosol type followed by the BU and DD type aerosols during summer and spring seasons, respectively. Further, the sub-classification of aerosol types was carried out considering into account of the characteristics of absorbing aerosol index (AAI) (here called as Technique-II). The two clustering techniques showed reasonable consistency in the obtained results. The various aerosol types (absorbing and non-absorbing) and their change over a region are highly helpful in fine tuning the models to decrease the uncertainty in the radiative and climatic effects of aerosols.

The AC process must estimate and remove the atmospheric path radiance contribution due to the Rayleigh scattering by air molecules and scattering by aerosols from the measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance, compensate for the absorption by atmospheric gases, and correct for reflection and refraction of the air-sea interface. In this work, we present and evaluate an improved AC for hyperspectral sensors developed within NASA's SeaWiFS Data Analysis System software package (SeaDAS). The improvement is based on combining the classical AC approach of multi-spectral capabilities to correct for the atmospheric path radiance, extended to hyperspectral, with a gas correction algorithm to compensate for absorbing gases in the atmosphere, including water vapor. The SeaDAS-hyperspectral version is capable of operationally processing the AC of any hyperspectral airborne or spaceborne sensor. The new algorithm development was evaluated and assessed using the Hyperspectral Imager for Coastal Ocean (HICO) scenes collected at the Marine Optical BuoY (MOBY) site, and other SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) and AERosol Robotic NETwork-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) coastal sites.

J	Barnes, BB; Garcia, R; Hu, CM; Lee, Z				Barnes, Brian B.; Garcia, Rodrigo; Hu, Chuanmin; Lee, Zhongping			Multi-band spectral matching inversion algorithm to derive water column properties in optically shallow waters: An optimization of parameterization	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) and other water quality parameters from satellite remote sensing data covering optically shallow environments has historically been problematic due to difficulties in separating the benthic signal from that of the water column. While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2018	204						424	438		10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.013								WOS:000418464400031						
J	Mogstad, AA; Johnsen, G				Mogstad, Aksel Alstad; Johnsen, Geir			Spectral characteristics of coralline algae: a multi-instrumental approach, with emphasis on underwater hyperspectral imaging	APPLIED OPTICS												Coralline algae constitute a cosmopolitan group of calcifying rhodophytes (red algae) that display characteristic optical fingerprints due to light absorption by specific light-harvesting pigments. The spectrally conspicuous nature of coralline algae makes them potential candidates for optical remote sensing surveys. Recently, underwater hyperspectral imaging (UHI), which we believe is a novel optical remote sensing technique, also has become the subject of marine research. The aim of the study was to characterize the spectral properties of different coralline algal species and to assess the potential of UHI as a coralline algal identification and mapping tool. Four species of coralline algae were investigated: Corallina officinalis, Lithothamnion glaciale, Phymatolithon lenormandii, and Phymatolithon tenue. Important coralline algal pigments were identified using spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Reflectance spectra of all species were obtained using both a spectrometer and UHI. Multivariate statistical analyses were performed on the reflectance data to identify spectral differences between the species and the instruments. Supervised classification of coralline algae in UHI transects recorded both in vivo and in situ was also carried out. R-phycoerythrin and chlorophyll a were found to be the most dominant coralline algal pigments. The analyzed species of coralline algae displayed highly similar reflectance spectra, and dips in reflectance corresponding to the absorbance peaks of R-phycoerythrin and chlorophyll a were identified in all spectra. Wavelengths corresponding to R-phycoerythrin light absorbance were the greatest contributors to interspecific spectral differences, but the investigated coralline algal species could not be spectrally distinguished with great accuracy. Optical signatures recorded using different instruments were comparable, but inter-instrumental spectral differences were found to be greater than interspecific differences. Supervised UHI classification was unable to accurately map different coralline algal species due to the similarity of the optical fingerprints; however, as a group, coralline algae could easily be identified. In the future, large-scale UHI surveys of coralline algal habitats should be carried out using platforms such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to enhance our understanding of this widespread and ecologically important organism group.

J	Widyatmanti, W; Sammut, J				Widyatmanti, Wirastuti; Sammut, Jesmond			y Hydro-geomorphic controls on the development and distribution of acid sulfate soils in Central Java, Indonesia	GEODERMA					8th International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference	JUL 17-23, 2016	Univ Maryland, College Park, MD	Int Union Soil Sci, Working Grp Acid Sulfate Soils	Univ Maryland			Coastal planning policies and regulations in Indonesia have not adequately considered acid sulfate soils (ASS) as a constraint on development. Aquaculture is often undertaken in unsuitable areas, and fish and shrimp culture systems, in particular, fail after a short period of production because of the impacts of ASS on pond water quality and, subsequently, on fish and shrimp health. This study describes a mapping approach based on an understanding of the hydro-geomorphic controls on the formation and the distribution of ASS in Central Java, Indonesia. The underlying approach was to identify associations between ASS development and distribution within estuarine hydro-geomorphological units (HGUs). This study utilized a multi-level methodology involving multi-resolution, remotely-sensed data and GIS analysis, coupled with field and laboratory-based data, to obtain hydro-geomorphic and soil information at different mapping scales. An estuary classification scheme for Central Java identified river, tide and wave-dominated estuaries as the dominant estuary types. HGUs were identified in each estuary type to define the relationships between landform development processes and pyrite concentration in soil layers. Thirty-nine HGUs were classified based on landforms, marine and fluvial hydrology, geomorphic processes, land use, and vegetation types. Field and laboratory assessment of soil properties were undertaken to identify the horizontal distribution of ASS in the HGUS and its vertical character in soil profiles. In contrast to previous studies, the results showed that estuaries located in low-energy environments on the north coast have low (< 0.1%) pyrite concentrations in 90% of their HGUs. Decades-old intensive aquaculture and dredging activities, that led to repeated oxidation and leaching, were identified as factors for low pyrite "concentrations. On the south coast, the combination of a high river and marine energy environment created scattered landforms with soils that have very high (4-9%) pyrite concentrations. These ASS-bearing HGUs mostly developed in low energy estuarine environments overlying former high river energy environments. The information generated for each HGU facilitated the development of an ASS mapping model that incorporates knowledge on the relationship between soil and landform formation in Central Java estuaries. Knowing where ASS occur is essential to minimize the risk of environment degradation. Using multi-resolution, remotely sensed data decreases cost and labour, compared to more traditional mapping approaches, especially to identify sampling sites for field surveys. The resulting maps and mapping methods will improve land capability assessment for brackishwater aquaculture and other coastal land use in Indonesia.																	0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 15	2017	308						321	332		10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.024								WOS:000413282100031

Simultaneous and synergistic profiling of cloud and drizzle properties using ground-based observations	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Despite the importance of radar reflectivity (Z) measurements in the retrieval of liquid water cloud properties, it remains nontrivial to interpret Z due to the possible presence of drizzle droplets within the clouds. So far, there has been no published work that utilizes Z to identify the presence of drizzle above the cloud base in an optimized and a physically consistent manner. In this work, we develop a retrieval technique that exploits the synergy of different remote sensing systems to carry out this task and to subsequently profile the microphysical properties of the cloud and drizzle in a unified framework. This is accomplished by using ground-based measurements of Z, lidar attenuated backscatter below as well as above the cloud base, and microwave brightness temperatures. Fast physical forward models coupled to cloud and drizzle structure parameterization are used in an optimal-estimation-type framework in order to retrieve the best estimate for the cloud and drizzle property profiles. The cloud retrieval is first evaluated using synthetic signals generated from large-eddy simulation (LES) output to verify the forward models used in the retrieval procedure and the vertical parameterization of the liquid water content (LWC). From this exercise it is found that, on average, the cloud properties can be retrieved within 5 % of the mean truth. The full cloud-drizzle retrieval method is then applied to a selected ACCEPT (Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques) campaign dataset collected in Cabauw, the Netherlands. An assessment of the retrieval products is performed using three independent methods from the literature; each was specifically developed to retrieve only the cloud properties, the drizzle properties below the cloud base, or the drizzle fraction within the cloud. One-to-one comparisons, taking into account the uncertainties or limitations of each retrieval, show that our results are consistent with what is derived using the three independent methods.																	1867-1381	1867-8548				DEC 11	2017	10	12					4777	4803		10.5194/amt-10-4777-2017								WOS:000417614700001

Thirty-Three Years of Ocean Benthic Warming Along the US Northeast Continental Shelf and Slope: Patterns, Drivers, and Ecological Consequences	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf is experiencing rapid warming, with potentially profound consequences to marine ecosystems. While satellites document multiple scales of spatial and temporal variability on the surface, our understanding of the status, trends, and drivers of the benthic environmental change remains limited. We interpolated sparse benthic temperature data along the New England Shelf and upper Slope using a seasonally dynamic, regionally specific multiple linear regression model that merged in situ and remote sensing data. The statistical model predicted nearly 90% of the variability of the data, resulting in a synoptic time series spanning over three decades from 1982 to 2014. Benthic temperatures increased throughout the domain, including in the Gulf of Maine. Rates of benthic warming ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 degrees C per decade, with fastest rates occurring in shallow, nearshore regions and on Georges Bank, the latter exceeding rates observed in the surface. Rates of benthic warming were up to 1.6 times faster in winter than the rest of the year in many regions, with important implications for disease occurrence and energetics of overwintering species. Drivers of warming varied over the domain. In southern New England and the mid-Atlantic shallow Shelf regions, benthic warming was tightly coupled to changes in SST, whereas both regional and basin-scale changes in ocean circulation affect temperatures in the Gulf of Maine, the Continental Shelf, and Georges Banks. These results highlight data gaps, the current feasibility of prediction from remotely sensed variables, and the need for improved understanding on how climate may affect seasonally specific ecological processes.

Ocean Wind and Wave Measurements Using X-Band Marine Radar: A Comprehensive Review	REMOTE SENSING												Ocean wind and wave parameters can be measured by in-situ sensors such as anemometers and buoys. Since the 1980s, X-band marine radar has evolved as one of the remote sensing instruments for such purposes since its sea surface images contain considerable wind and wave information. The maturity and accuracy of X-band marine radar wind and wave measurements have already enabled relevant commercial products to be used in real-world applications. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art algorithms for ocean wind and wave information extraction from X-band marine radar data. Wind measurements are mainly based on the dependence of radar image intensities on wind direction and speed. Wave parameters can be obtained from radar-derived wave spectra or radar image textures for non-coherent radar and from surface radial velocity for coherent radar. In this review, the principles of the methodologies are described, the performances are compared, and the pros and cons are discussed. Specifically, recent developments for wind and wave measurements are highlighted. These include the mitigation of rain effects on wind measurements and wave height estimation without external calibrations. Finally, remaining challenges and future trends are discussed.

J	Ren, L; Hartnett, M				Ren, Lei; Hartnett, Michael			Comparative Study on Assimilating Remote Sensing High Frequency Radar Surface Currents at an Atlantic Marine Renewable Energy Test Site	REMOTE SENSING												A variety of data assimilation approaches have been applied to enhance modelling capability and accuracy using observations from different sources. The algorithms have varying degrees of complexity of implementation, and they improve model results with varying degrees of success. Very little work has been carried out on comparing the implementation of different data assimilation algorithms using High Frequency radar (HFR) data into models of complex inshore waters strongly influenced by both tides and wind dynamics, such as Galway Bay. This research entailed implementing four different data assimilation algorithms: Direct Insertion (DI), Optimal Interpolation (OI), Nudging and indirect data assimilation via correcting model forcing into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and carrying out detailed comparisons of model performances. This work will allow researchers to directly compare four of the most common data assimilation algorithms being used in operational coastal hydrodynamics. The suitability of practical data assimilation algorithms for hindcasting and forecasting in shallow coastal waters subjected to alternate wetting and drying using data collected from radars was assessed. Results indicated that a forecasting system of surface currents based on the three-dimensional model EFDC (Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code) and the HFR data using a Nudging or DI algorithm was considered the most appropriate for Galway Bay. The largest averaged Data Assimilation Skill Score (DASS) over the 6 h forecasting period from the best model NDA attained 26% and 31% for east-west and north-south surface velocity components respectively. Because of its ease of implementation and its accuracy, this data assimilation system can provide timely and useful information for various practical coastal hindcast and forecast operations.																	2072-4292					DEC	2017	9	12							1331	10.3390/rs9121331								WOS:000419235700126

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.

Fit to predict? Eco-informatics for predicting the catchability of a pelagic fish in near real time	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The ocean is a dynamic environment inhabited by a diverse array of highly migratory species, many of which are under direct exploitation in targeted fisheries. The timescales of variability in the marine realm coupled with the extreme mobility of ocean-wandering species such as tuna and billfish complicates fisheries management. Developing eco-informatics solutions that allow for near real-time prediction of the distributions of highly mobile marine species is an important step towards the maturation of dynamic ocean management and ecological forecasting. Using 25 yr (1990-2014) of NOAA fisheries' observer data from the California drift gillnet fishery, we model relative probability of occurrence (presence-absence) and catchability (total catch per gillnet set) of broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius in the California Current System. Using freely available environmental data sets and open source software, we explore the physical drivers of regional swordfish distribution. Comparing models built upon remotely sensed data sets with those built upon a data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS), we explore trade-offs in model construction, and address how physical data can affect predictive performance and operational capacity. Swordfish catchability was found to be highest in deeper waters (>1,500m) with surface temperatures in the 14-20 degrees C range, isothermal layer depth (ILD) of 20-40 m, positive sea surface height (SSH) anomalies, and during the new moon (<20% lunar illumination). We observed a greater influence of mesoscale variability (SSH, wind speed, isothermal layer depth, eddy kinetic energy) in driving swordfish catchability (total catch) than was evident in predicting the relative probability of presence (presence-absence), confirming the utility of generating spatiotemporally dynamic predictions. Data-assimilative ROMS circumvent the limitations of satellite remote sensing in providing physical data fields for species distribution models (e.g., cloud cover, variable resolution, subsurface data), and facilitate broad-scale prediction of dynamic species distributions in near real time.

In the AbPM, a(ph) is used as the key predictor of phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency. Previous studies have shown that the size of phytoplankton could affect the photosynthetic efficiency. Thus, a size-fractionated AbPM was proposed by considering how phytoplankton size influenced the global quantum yield of phytoplankton photosynthesis. The sea surface temperature (SST) was also used to further improve AbPM performance in coldwaters (SST<10 degrees C). With the proposed new model, monthly averaged global ocean NPP data for the period 2003-2012 were derived, and the distributions of the global NPP differed in both space and time from previous AbPM-based estimates. The accuracy of the new estimated model was validated using in situ NPP data, which were collected from different marine monitoring sites. Compared with the original AbPM, the new model not only had an excellent performance at each marine monitoring site, but also had an improved accuracy over the Southern Ocean. Although additional studies need to be conducted for confirmation, this size-fractionated model could be a reasonable and accurate method for the estimation of global ocean NPP.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2017	10	12	2				5519	5528		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2747770								WOS:000418871200017						
J	Olsen, KG; Nettles, M				Olsen, Kira G.; Nettles, Meredith			Patterns in glacial-earthquake activity around Greenland, 2011-13	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Glacial earthquakes are caused by large iceberg calving events, which are an important mechanism for mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet. The number of glacial earthquakes in Greenland has increased sixfold over the past two decades. We use teleseismic surface waves to analyze the 145 glacial earthquakes that occurred in Greenland from 2011 through 2013, and successfully determine source parameters for 139 events at 13 marine-terminating glaciers. Our analysis increases the number of events in the glacial-earthquake catalog by nearly 50% and extends it to 21 years. The period 2011-13 was the most prolific 3-year period of glacial earthquakes on record, with most of the increase over earlier years occurring at glaciers on Greenland's west coast. We investigate changes in earthquake productivity and geometry at several individual glaciers and link patterns in glacial-earthquake production and cessation to the absence or presence of a floating ice tongue. We attribute changes in earthquake force orientations to changes in calving-front geometry, some of which occur on timescales of days to months. Our results illustrate the utility of glacial earthquakes as a remote-sensing tool to identify the type of calving event, the grounded state of a glacier, and the orientation of an active calving front.																	0022-1430	1727-5652				DEC	2017	63	242					1077	1089		10.1017/jog.2017.78								WOS:000418852500012

Ocean biota, in particular phytoplankton plays a fundamental role in regulating the Earth's energy balance. Atmospheric carbon is fixed by these organisms and further phytoplankton acts as primary producers in oceanic food webs. Space based observations using ocean colour sensors have provided unique information about the global distribution and temporal variability of oceanic phytoplankton. India has made significant progress in developing ocean colour science and have launched two ocean colour sensors namely OCM-1 and OCM-2. The data provided by these remote sensing instruments, on phytoplankton distribution around Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal has been extensively used to understand marine ecosystem, as well as for identifying productive regions for potential fishing zones.

Optical Detection of Diatom Bloom in the Coastal Waters of Bay of Bengal Using Oceansat-2 OCM	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Phytoplankton blooms are the indicators of marine ecosystem health status and their monitoring is a key component in the effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. It remained as a challenge in the coastal waters due to the presence of suspended sediments and dissolved organic matter which interferes with the phytoplankton signal. Several methods and techniques were developed to detect, map and monitor the phytoplankton blooms in the coastal waters using in situ and satellite data. To address this issue ISRO took an initiative to monitor and identify the phytoplankton blooms in the North Indian Ocean to be specific in the coastal waters. As part of this program, the blooms are monitored using Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-2) data all along the East coast of India. This paper presents a case study in the bloom dominated coastal waters along Off Godavari delta covering Kakinada and Yanam in the East coast of India. In-situ measurements collected onboard during a bloom event are optical parameters like Remote Sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), Water leaving radiance L-w(lambda) from the Hyperpro-II under water radiometer, absorption due to phytoplankton, a(ph)(lambda), from the spectrophotometer, biological parameters of phytoplankton cell counts and HPLC pigments. From the in situ biological measurements, it is confirmed that the bloom was dominated by with diatom species of Skeletonema costatum with a high concentration of Fucoxanthin as the biomarker for diatoms from the HPLC pigment analysis. Based on these results obtained, optical detection of the bloom species using spectral discrimination of R-rs for different cell enumerations was considered and further spectral derivative analysis (first to fifth order) has been carried out to identify the peaks to detect the bloom forming species. The criteria considered as the minima in the second order derivative (d lambda R-2(rs)) for identifying the peak to discriminate the spectra of the bloom forming species. From the analysis, a unique peak at 483 nm which is identified in particular to S. costatum species in the coastal waters which are identified from the chlorophyll product derived from OCM-2. From the results observed, it can ensure that diatom blooms can be detected from OCM-2 using 490 nm spectral band.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					867	878		10.1007/s40010-017-0455-5								WOS:000418819200029

Changing Landscape of Marine National Park and Sanctuary, Gulf of Kachchh: Ecological Assessment of Mangroves and Coral Reefs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												This paper assesses the ecological changes in mangroves and coral reefs of Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNP&S), Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat, India during 1972-2014. Landsat 1 Multi Spectral Scanner data were used for 1972 to map the mangroves and coral reefs whereas Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager data were used to map the coral reef extent only, in MNP&S in 2014. Published literature sources were used to record the area of mangroves and coral reefs of MNP&S for various years between 1972 and 2014, and the changes were analyzed. For the year 1972, total mangrove area mapped is 175.36 sq. km and the total reef area mapped comes out to be 402.14 sq. km. The total area of reef in MNP&S computed for 2014 is 443.49 sq. km. Our analysis shows that MNP&S witnessed severe loss of mangroves till 1992, with annual rate of mangrove degradation being 2.89%. Exploitation by local communities and careless release/spillage of oil and brine by nearby industries were found to be two major anthropogenic factors responsible for degradation of mangroves over a period of four decades. Major reasons found for degradation of reefs in MNP&S were mining and deposition of sediments. The area estimates for coral reefs reported in this paper for 2014 are the latest figures available for coral reefs in this region. It is recommended that monitoring of coastal habitats in MNP&S should be done regularly to understand the changes in the ecology of the area.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					889	900		10.1007/s40010-017-0457-3								WOS:000418819200031						
J	Hamylton, SM				Hamylton, Sarah M.			Mapping coral reef environments: A review of historical methods, recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reef environments support high levels of marine biodiversity, they are important sites for coastal habitation and they provide a range of goods and ecosystem services such as nearshore fisheries, economic revenue from tourism and breeding sites for seabirds and turtles. Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2017	41	6					803	833		10.1177/0309133317744998								WOS:000418042100006

Coastal landuse and land cover change and transformations of Kanyakumari coast, India using remote sensing and GIS	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												The coastal landuse and land cover features in the South West coast of Kanyakumari are dynamically regulated due to marine and terrestrial processes and often controlling by natural and anthropogenic activities. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the decadal changes and their transformations of landuse and land cover (LULC) features under Level II category of USGS-LULC Classification System using Landsat ETM+ and TM images using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) algorithm for the period 2000-2011. The classified LULC features are categorized as beachface land cover, cultivable lands, plantation and shrub vegetation, fallow land, barren land, settlements and built-ups, water bodies, and mining area, etc. The geo-database is prepared for LULC feature class with an attributes of name, location, area and spatial distribution, etc. It shows the larger area in beachface land cover (sandy beaches, foredunes, uplands, Teri dunes (laterite) and associated nearshore landforms), plantations, cultivable lands, fallows, and barren lands are converted into built-ups and it increases more than twice in the period of 10 years. Using GIS techniques, the analysis of change detection matrix reveals that the total area of 45.90 km(2) in different LULC features periodically shifted or transformed from one state to another one or more states, i.e. the beachface land cover area of 1.24 km(2) is encroached for built-ups and 0.63 km(2) for placer mining during the decade. Meanwhile, the area of 0.21 km(2) in this cover is transformed into wetlands and saltwater bodies. During the past decade, the expansion of area in the built-ups and settlements are directly proportional to the growth of population, which produces severe threat to the coastal resources. Accuracy assessment of classified images shows the overall accuracy is estimated as 81.16% and 77.52% and overall Kappa coeffient statistical values of 0.83 and 0.76 for the year 2000 and 2011 respectively. Ground truth verification of the extracted LULC features performed using 120 samples (10 samples per class) reveals that the accuracy of classified features is 89%. This indicates the acceptable accuracy of the classified LULC features for landuse and land cover change studies. The geodatabase of LULC features is used as primary source for sustainable land resource management in the coastal region. (C) 2017 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Influence of artefacts in marine digital terrain models on habitat maps and species distribution models: a multiscale assessment	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Remote sensing techniques are currently the main methods providing elevation data used to produce Digital Terrain Models (DTM). Terrain attributes (e.g. slope, orientation, rugosity) derived from DTMs are commonly used as surrogates of species or habitat distribution in ecological studies. While DTMs' errors are known to propagate to terrain attributes, their impact on ecological analyses is however rarely documented. This study assessed the impact of data acquisition artefacts on habitat maps and species distribution models. DTMs of German Bank (off Nova Scotia, Canada) at five different spatial scales were altered to artificially introduce different levels of common data acquisition artefacts. These data were used in 615 unsupervised classifications to map potential habitat types based on biophysical characteristics of the area, and in 615 supervised classifications (MaxEnt) to predict sea scallop distribution across the area. Differences between maps and models built from altered data and reference maps and models were assessed. Roll artefacts decreased map accuracy (up to 14% lower) and artificially increased models' performances. Impacts from other types of artefacts were not consistent, either decreasing or increasing accuracy and performance measures. The spatial distribution of habitats and spatial predictions of sea scallop distributions were always affected by data quality (i.e. artefacts), spatial scale of the data, and the selection of variables used in the classifications. This research demonstrates the importance of these three factors in building a study design, and highlights the need for error quantification protocols that can assist when maps and models are used in decision-making, for instance in conservation and management.

J	Mutiti, CM; Medley, KE; Mutiti, S				Mutiti, Christine M.; Medley, Kimberly E.; Mutiti, Samuel			Using GIS and remote sensing to explore the influence of physical environmental factors and historical land use on bushland structure	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Bushland is a vegetation type with a dense cover of woody plants of low stature and a grass understory. We explored the influence of environmental factors (precipitation, topography, geology, hydrology and waterhole density) and historical land use in the Tsavo ecosystem bushland. We mapped vegetation patterns in the region using remote sensing, GIS and field data and tested relationships with physical factors. We used regression analysis to explore the interaction of physical factors and human influence by including a protected and a nonprotected area, representing contrasting historical land use policies, as factors in the regression model. Bushland vegetation had the largest proportion in the region as a whole, but its proportion was notably greater in the nonprotected area. Precipitation, elevation, geology and historical land use were significant predictors of vegetation patterns in the regression models. Higher precipitation and elevation make woody plants superior competitors over grasses, resulting in predominance of bushland in such areas. Geologically, marine deposits result in shallow calcareous soils that favour grasses over trees, hence, absence of bushland. Wildlife management policies such as providing water for wildlife, protective boundaries and controlling wildfires influence distribution of wildlife and result in conditions that prevent regeneration and recruitment of trees.																	0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	2017	55	4					477	486		10.1111/aje.12378								WOS:000415740100010

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

However, remote observations of coral reefs are difficult especially due to the spatial and spectral complexity of the target compared to sensor specifications as well as the environmental implications of the water medium above. The development of sensors is driven by technological advances and the desired products. Currently, spaceborne systems are technologically limited to a choice between high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution, but not both. The current study explores the dilemma of whether future sensor design for marine monitoring should prioritise on improving their spatial or spectral resolution. To address this question, a spatially and spectrally resampled ground-level hyperspectral image was used to test two classification elements: (1) how the tradeoff between spatial and spectral resolutions affects classification; and (2) how a noise reduction by majority filter might improve classification accuracy. The studied reef, in the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat), Israel, is heterogeneous and complex so the local substrate patches are generally finer than currently available imagery. Therefore, the tested spatial resolution was broadly divided into four scale categories from five millimeters to one meter. Spectral resolution resampling aimed to mimic currently available and forthcoming spaceborne sensors such as (1) Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) that is characterized by 25 bands of 6.5 nm width; (2) VEN.sS with 12 narrow bands; and (3) the WorldView series with broadband multispectral resolution. Results suggest that spatial resolution should generally be prioritized for coral reef classification because the finer spatial scale tested (pixel size < 0.1 m) may compensate for some low spectral resolution drawbacks. In this regard, it is shown that the post-classification majority filtering substantially improves the accuracy of all pixel sizes up to the point where the kernel size reaches the average unit size (pixel < 0.25 m). However, careful investigation as to the effect of band distribution and choice could improve the sensor suitability for the marine environment task. This in mind, while the focus in this study was on the technologically limited spaceborne design, aerial sensors may presently provide an opportunity to implement the suggested setup.																	0303-2434					DEC	2017	63						68	77		10.1016/j.jag.2017.07.009								WOS:000411848500007						
J	Zarco-Perello, S; Simoes, N				Zarco-Perello, Salvador; Simoes, Nuno			Ordinary kriging vs inverse distance weighting: spatial interpolation of the sessile community of Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico	PEERJ												Information about the distribution and abundance of the habitat-forming sessile organisms in marine ecosystems is of great importance for conservation and natural resource managers. Spatial interpolation methodologies can be useful to generate this information from in situ sampling points, especially in circumstances where remote sensing methodologies cannot be applied due to small-scale spatial variability of the natural communities and low light penetration in the water column. Interpolation methods are widely used in environmental sciences; however, published studies using these methodologies in coral reef science are scarce. We compared the accuracy of the two most commonly used interpolation methods in all disciplines, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK), to predict the distribution and abundance of hard corals, octocorals, macroalgae, sponges and zoantharians and identify hotspots of these habitat-forming organisms using data sampled at three different spatial scales (5, 10 and 20 m) in Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico. The deeper sandy environments of the leeward and windward regions of Madagascar reef were dominated by macroalgae and seconded by octocorals. However, the shallow rocky environments of the reef crest had the highest richness of habitat-forming groups of organisms; here, we registered high abundances of octocorals and macroalgae, with sponges, Millepora alcicornis and zoantharians dominating in some patches, creating high levels of habitat heterogeneity. IDW and OK generated similar maps of distribution for all the taxa; however, cross-validation tests showed that IDW outperformed OK in the prediction of their abundances. When the sampling distance was at 20 m, both interpolation techniques performed poorly, but as the sampling was done at shorter distances prediction accuracies increased, especially for IDW. OK had higher mean prediction errors and failed to correctly interpolate the highest abundance values measured in situ, except for macroalgae, whereas IDW had lower mean prediction errors and high correlations between predicted and measured values in all cases when sampling was every 5 m. The accurate spatial interpolations created using IDW allowed us to see the spatial variability of each taxa at a biological and spatial resolution that remote sensing would not have been able to produce. Our study sets the basis for further research projects and conservation management in Madagascar reef and encourages similar studies in the region and other parts of the world where remote sensing technologies are not suitable for use.																	2167-8359					NOV 30	2017	5								e4078	10.7717/peerj.4078								WOS:000417096100005	29204321

Profiles of biogeochemical (chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter) and optical (single-wavelength particulate optical backscattering, downward irradiance at three wavelengths, and photosynthetically available radiation) variables are collected in the upper 1000 m every 1 to 10 days. The database of 9837 vertical profiles collected up to January 2016 is presented and its spatial and temporal coverage is discussed. Each variable is quality controlled with specifically developed procedures and its time series is quality-assessed to identify issues related to biofouling and/or instrument drift. A second database of 5748 profile-derived products within the first optical depth (i.e., the layer of interest for satellite remote sensing) is also presented and its spatiotemporal distribution discussed. This database, devoted to field and remote ocean color applications, includes diffuse attenuation coefficients for downward irradiance at three narrow wavebands and one broad waveband (photosynthetically available radiation), calibrated chlorophyll and fluorescent dissolved organic matter concentrations, and single-wavelength particulate optical backscattering. To demonstrate the applicability of these databases, data within the first optical depth are compared with previously established bio-optical models and used to validate remotely derived bio-optical products. The quality-controlled databases are publicly available from the SEANOE (SEA scieNtific Open data Edition) publisher at https://doi.org/10.17882/49388 and https://doi.org/10.17882/47142 for vertical profiles and products within the first optical depth, respectively.

Remote sensing through laser is an effective tool for monitoring sea fogs, but still challengeable for large distance. We demonstrated a Long-distance Lidar for sea fog with superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD), which extended the ranging area to a 180-km diameter area. The system, which was verified by using a benchmark distance measurement of a known island, is applied to the Mie scattering weather prediction Lidar system. The fog echo signal distribution in the range of 42.3 similar to 63.5 km and 53.2 similar to 74.2 km was obtained by the Lidar system. Then the fog concentration and the velocity of the fog were deduced from the distribution, which is consistent with the weather prediction. The height of the sea fog is about two hundred meter while the visibility at this height is about 90 km due to the Earth's radius of curvature. Therefore, the capability of this SNSPD-based Lidar was close to the theoretical limit for sea fog measurements for extremely high signal-to-noise ratio of SNSPD.																	2045-2322					NOV 8	2017	7								15113	10.1038/s41598-017-15429-y								WOS:000414648700080	29118415

W.; Cain, Terry			Micro-phytoplankton photosynthesis, primary production and potential export production in the Atlantic Ocean	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Micro-phytoplankton is the >20 mu m component of the phytoplankton community and plays a major role in the global ocean carbon pump, through the sequestering of anthropogenic CO2 and export of organic carbon to the deep ocean. To evaluate the global impact of the marine carbon cycle, quantification of micro-phytoplankton primary production is paramount. In this paper we use both in situ data and a satellite model to estimate the contribution of micro-phytoplankton to total primary production (PP) in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1995 to 2013, 940 measurements of primary production were made at 258 sites on 23 Atlantic Meridional Transect Cruises from the United Kingdom to the South African or Patagonian Shelf. Micro-phytoplankton primary production was highest in the South Subtropical Convergence (SSTC similar to 409 +/- 720 mg C m(-2)d(-1)), where it contributed between 38 % of the total PP, and was lowest in the North Atlantic Gyre province (NATL similar to 37 +/- 27 mg C m(-2)d(-1)), where it represented 18 % of the total PP. Size-fractionated photosynthesis-irradiance (PE) parameters measured on AMT22 and 23 showed that micro-phytoplankton had the highest maximum photosynthetic rate (PmB) (similar to 5 mg C (mg Chl a)(-1)h(-1)) followed by nano- (similar to 4 mg C (mg Chl a)(-1)h(-1)) and pico- (similar to 2 mg C (mg Chl a)(-1)h(-1)). The highest PmB was recorded in the NATL and lowest in the North Atlantic Drift Region (NADR) and South Atlantic Gyre (SATL). The PE parameters were used to parameterise a remote sensing model of size-fractionated PP, which explained 84 % of the micro-phytoplankton in situ PP variability with a regression slope close to 1. The model was applied to the SeaWiFS time series from 1998-2010, which illustrated that micro-phytoplankton PP remained constant in the NADR, NATL, Canary Current Coastal upwelling (CNRY), Eastern Tropical Atlantic (ETRA), Western Tropical Atlantic (WTRA) and SATL, but showed a gradual increase in the Benguela Upwelling zone (BENG) and South Subtropical Convergence (SSTC). The mean annual carbon fixation of micro-phytoplankton was highest in the CNRY (similar to 140 g C m(-2)yr(-1)), and lowest in the SATL (27 g C m(-2)yr(-1)). A Thorium-234 based export production (ThExP) algorithm was applied to estimates of total PP in each province. There was a strong coupling between micro-phytoplankton PP and ThExP in the NADR and SSTC where between 23 and 39 % of micro-phytoplankton PP contributed to ThExP. The lowest contribution by micro-phytoplankton to ThExP was in the ETRA and WTRA which were 15 and 21 % respectively. The results suggest that micro-phytoplankton PP in the SSTC is the most efficient export system and the ETRA is the least efficient in the Atlantic Ocean.

Modelling size-fractionated primary production in the Atlantic Ocean from remote sensing	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Marine primary production influences the transfer of carbon dioxide between the ocean and atmosphere, and the availability of energy for the pelagic food web. Both the rate and the fate of organic carbon from primary production are dependent on phytoplankton size. A key aim of the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) programme has been to quantify biological carbon cycling in the Atlantic Ocean and measurements of total primary production have been routinely made on AMT cruises, as well as additional measurements of size-fractionated primary production on some cruises. Measurements of total primary production collected on the AMT have been used to evaluate remote-sensing techniques capable of producing basin-scale estimates of primary production. Though models exist to estimate size-fractionated primary production from satellite data, these have not been well validated in the Atlantic Ocean, and have been parameterised using measurements of phytoplankton pigments rather than direct measurements of phytoplankton size structure. Here, we re-tune a remote-sensing primary production model to estimate production in three size fractions of phytoplankton (<2 mu m, 2-10 mu m and >10 mu m) in the Atlantic Ocean, using measurements of size-fractionated chlorophyll and size-fractionated photosynthesis-irradiance experiments conducted on AMT 22 and 23 using sequential filtration-based methods. The performance of the remote-sensing technique was evaluated using: (i) independent estimates of size-fractionated primary production collected on a number of AMT cruises using C-14 on-deck incubation experiments and (ii) Monte Carlo simulations. Considering uncertainty in the satellite inputs and model parameters, we estimate an average model error of between 0.27 and 0.63 for log(10)-transformed size-fractionated production, with lower errors for the small size class (<2 mu m), higher errors for the larger size classes (2-10 mu m and >10 mu m), and errors generally higher in oligotrophic waters. Application to satellite data in 2007 suggests the contribution of cells <2 mu m and >2 mu m to total primary production is approximately equal in the Atlantic Ocean. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Globally, the transmittance of solar radiation in the visible domain (approximate to 400-700 nm) (TRVIS) through the water column, which determines the vertical distribution of visible light, has to be based on remote sensing products. There are models centered on chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration or Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) as both can be derived from ocean color measurements. We present evaluations of both schemes with field data from clear oceanic and from coastal waters. Here five models were evaluated: (1) Morel and Antoine (1994) (MA94), (2) Ohlmann and Siegel (2000) (OS00), (3) Murtugudde et al. (2002) (MU02), (4) Manizza et al. (2005) (MA05), and (5) Lee et al. () (IOPs05), where the first four are Chl-based and the last one is IOPs-based, with all inputs derived from remote sensing reflectance. It is found that the best performing model is the IOPs05, with Unbiased Absolute Percent Difference (UAPD) approximate to 23%, while Chl-based models show higher uncertainties (UAPD for MA94: approximate to 54%, OS00: approximate to 133%, MU02: approximate to 56%, and MA05: approximate to 39%). The IOPs-based model was insensitive to the type of water, allowing it to be applied in most marine environments; whereas some of the Chl-based models (MU02 and MA05) show much higher sensitivities in coastal turbid waters (higher Chl waters). These results highlight the applicablity of using IOPs products for such applications.

Specifically, high-resolution satellite-based imaging systems, as WorldView-2 (WV-2), can generate information at spatial scales needed to implement conservation actions for protected littoral zones. However, coastal water-leaving radiance arriving at the space-based sensor is often small as compared to reflected radiance. In this work, complex approaches, which usually use an accurate radiative transfer code to correct the atmospheric effects, such as FLAASH, ATCOR and 6S, have been implemented for high-resolution imagery. They have been assessed in real scenarios using field spectroradiometer data. In this context, the three approaches have achieved excellent results and a slightly superior performance of 6S model-based algorithm has been observed. Finally, for the mapping of benthic habitats in shallow-waters marine protected environments, a relevant application of the proposed atmospheric correction combined with an automatic deglinting procedure is presented. This approach is based on the integration of a linear mixing model of benthic classes within the radiative transfer model of the water. The complete methodology has been applied to selected ecosystems in the Canary Islands (Spain) but the obtained results allow the robust mapping of the spatial distribution and density of seagrass in coastal waters and the analysis of multitemporal variations related to the human activity and climate change in littoral zones.

Reduced Methane Emissions from Santa Barbara Marine Seeps	REMOTE SENSING												Airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements of methane were performed over the marine seeps in the Santa Barbara Channel close to the Coal Oil Point in California on two days in June and August 2014 with the aim to re-assess their methane emissions. During this period, methane column averaged dry air mole fractions derived from airborne remote sensing measurements in the short-wave infrared and airborne in situ measurements of methane indicate that emissions are 2-6 kt CHignificantly lower than expected from previous publications. This is also confirmed by the on ground in situ measurement time series recorded at the onshore West Campus Monitoring Station in Santa Barbara. Using a time series of methane data, a decline in methane concentrations between 2008 and 2015 of more than a factor of two was derived for air masses originating from the seep field direction.

This is especially true for the Russian Arctic where recently increased optical and SAR satellite imagery (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 1/2) and digital elevation models (TanDEM-X, ArcticDEM) are becoming available. These datasets offer new possibilities to create high-quality glacier inventories. Here, we present a new glacier inventory derived from a fusion of multi-source satellite data for Novaya Zemlya in the Russian Arctic. We mainly used Landsat 8 OLI data to automatically map glaciers with the band ratio method. Missing debris-covered glacier parts and misclassified lakes were manually corrected. Whereas perennial snow fields were a major obstacle in glacier identification, seasonal snow was identified and removed using Landsat 5 TM scenes from the year 1998. Drainage basins were derived semi-automatically using the ArcticDEM (gap-filled by the ASTER GDEM V2) and manually corrected using fringes from ALOS PALSAR. The new glacier inventory gives a glacierized area of 22,379 +/- 246.2 km(2) with 1474 glacier entities >0.05 km(2). The region is dominated by large glaciers, as 909 glaciers <0.5 km(2) (62% by number) cover only 156 +/- 1.7 km(2) or 0.7% of the area, whereas 49 glaciers >100 km(2) (3.3% by number) cover 18,724 +/- 205.9 km(2) or 84%. In total, 41 glaciers are marine terminating covering an area of 16,063.7 +/- 118.8 km(2). The mean elevation is 596 m for all glaciers in the study region (528 m in the northern part, 641 in the southern part). South-east (north-west) facing glaciers cover >35% (20%) of the area. For the smaller glaciers in the southern part we calculated an area loss of 3.4% (-52.5 +/- 3.1 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.

Ocean color remote sensing retrieval of CDOM absorption coefficient (a(g)()) can be used as an indicator to trace the distribution and variation characteristics of the Changjiang diluted water, and further to help understand estuarine and coastal biogeochemical processes in large spatial and temporal scales. The quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) has been widely applied to remote sensing inversions of optical and biogeochemical parameters in water bodies such as oceanic and coastal waters, however, whether the algorithm can be applicable to highly turbid waters (i.e., Changjiang estuarine and coastal waters) is still unknown. In this study, large amounts of in situ data accumulated in the Changjiang estuarine and coastal waters from 9 cruise campaigns during 2011 and 2015 are used to verify and calibrate the QAA. Furthermore, the QAA is remodified for CDOM retrieval by employing a CDOM algorithm (QAA_CDOM). Consequently, based on the QAA and the QAA_CDOM, we developed a new version of algorithm, named QAA_cj, which is more suitable for highly turbid waters, e.g., Changjiang estuarine and coastal waters, to decompose a(g) from a(dg) (CDOM and non-pigmented particles absorption coefficient). By comparison of matchups between Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) retrievals and in situ data, it reveals that the accuracy of retrievals from calibrated QAA is significantly improved. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute relative error (MARE) and bias of total absorption coefficients (a()) are lower than 1.17, 0.52 and 0.66 m(-1), and a(g)() at 443 nm are lower than 0.07, 0.42 and 0.018 m(-1). These results indicate that the calibrated algorithm has a better applicability and prospect for highly turbid coastal waters with extremely complicated optical properties. Thus, reliable CDOM products from the improved QAA_cj can advance our understanding of the land-ocean interaction process by earth observations in monitoring spatial-temporal distribution of the river plume into sea.

Mangroves provide vital protection to Caribbean island coastline, substantial economic benefit, and crucial habitat for surrounding reef ecosystems. However, Caribbean island mangroves are shrinking as urban areas expand. Such deforestation is of considerable global environmental concern. This study applies a random forest classifier to thirteen Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes from 1985 to 2015 covering Roatan, Honduras, the largest of the Bay Islands. Results indicate that urban area increased by 982.8 ha (227.7%), with 224.1 ha (-19.1%) of mangroves converted to urban areas. Island -wide and outside of protected areas, a significant relationship was found between urban expansion and mangrove loss. Designated protected reserves have stemmed cutting of mangroves and allowed mangroves to fully recover following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. However, despite being illegal under national and international laws, mangrove loss is accelerating outside of protected areas to accommodate growing urban area and tourism infrastructure. This research suggests that rapid urbanization and tourism development in the Caribbean may decrease island ecosystem resiliency to environmental stressors and impair the sustainability of tourism development.

We use in situ radar measurements from the ship-based Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) campaign in the Northeastern subtropical Pacific, which sampled a diverse set of shallow marine cloud regimes, to evaluate the evaporation-sedimentation model near the surface. We suggest an empirical bias correction, which can be applied to the 2C-RAIN-PROFILE retrieval. Before this correction, the evaporation-sedimentation model produced a mean surface rain rate bias along the MAGIC transect of 57%; after correction, this bias was effectively eliminated. We also present the evidence of the validity of this bias correction across regimes in the MAGIC region, and also in the southeast subtropical Pacific, where the magnitude of the mean bias for surface rain due to the evaporation-sedimentation model is reduced by a factor of 4.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				NOV	2017	55	11					6207	6217		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2722469								WOS:000413656900015

It is connected to global climate change, marine environment forecasting, marine navigation, engineering security, and so on. The observation and prediction of ocean surface current have attracted more and more concern. Doppler Scatterometer (DopScat) is a new type of radar for ocean surface wind and current field remote sensing. The ocean surface current inversion method of DopScat impacts the measurement accuracy directly. In this paper, we establish the simulation model of a DopScat and provide the radial velocity error model. The numerical ocean surface Doppler spectrum model is also introduced and validated with the empirical geophysical model function in C-band (CDOP). The suitable ocean wave elevation spectrum and directional distribution function are selected. What is more, this paper establishes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to retrieve the ocean surface current and wind simultaneously. The retrieval accuracy for different positions in cross track, different wind speeds, and different current speeds are analyzed. At last, the global ocean current field is observed by DopScat and the ocean current is retrieved. In our simulation, the orbit parameters and observation geometry of DopScat are the same as that of HY-2A scatterometer. The retrieval results show that global current speed standard deviation can be smaller than 0.18 m/s for five days and 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid average.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				NOV	2017	55	11					6505	6516		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2728824								WOS:000413656900039

Resource partitioning facilitates coexistence in sympatric cetaceans in the California Current	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Resource partitioning is an important process driving habitat use and foraging strategies in sympatric species that potentially compete. Differences in foraging behavior are hypothesized to contribute to species coexistence by facilitating resource partitioning, but little is known on the multiple mechanisms for partitioning that may occur simultaneously. Studies are further limited in the marine environment, where the spatial and temporal distribution of resources is highly dynamic and subsequently difficult to quantify. We investigated potential pathways by which foraging behavior may facilitate resource partitioning in two of the largest co-occurring and closely related species on Earth, blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales. We integrated multiple long-term datasets (line-transect surveys, whale-watching records, net sampling, stable isotope analysis, and remote-sensing of oceanographic parameters) to compare the diet, phenology, and distribution of the two species during their foraging periods in the highly productive waters of Monterey Bay, California, USA within the California Current Ecosystem. Our long-term study reveals that blue and humpback whales likely facilitate sympatry by partitioning their foraging along three axes: trophic, temporal, and spatial. Blue whales were specialists foraging on krill, predictably targeting a seasonal peak in krill abundance, were present in the bay for an average of 4.7months, and were spatially restricted at the continental shelf break. In contrast, humpback whales were generalists apparently feeding on a mixed diet of krill and fishes depending on relative abundances, were present in the bay for a more extended period (average of 6.6months), and had a broader spatial distribution at the shelf break and inshore. Ultimately, competition for common resources can lead to behavioral, morphological, and physiological character displacement between sympatric species. Understanding the mechanisms for species coexistence is both fundamental to maintaining biodiverse ecosystems, and provides insight into the evolutionary drivers of morphological differences in closely related species.

In order to address these declines, decision-makers need accurate assessments of the status of and pressures on biodiversity. However, these are heavily constrained by incomplete and uneven spatial, temporal and taxonomic coverage. For instance, data from regions such as Europe and North America are currently used overwhelmingly for large-scale biodiversity assessments due to lesser availability of suitable data from other, more biodiversity-rich, regions. These data-poor regions are often those experiencing the strongest threats to biodiversity, however. There is therefore an urgent need to fill the existing gaps in global biodiversity monitoring. Here, we review current knowledge on best practice in capacity building for biodiversity monitoring and provide an overview of existing means to improve biodiversity data collection considering the different types of biodiversity monitoring data. Our review comprises insights from work in Africa, South America, Polar Regions and Europe; in government-funded, volunteer and citizen-based monitoring in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The key steps to effectively building capacity in biodiversity monitoring are: identifying monitoring questions and aims; identifying the key components, functions, and processes to monitor; identifying the most suitable monitoring methods for these elements, carrying out monitoring activities; managing the resultant data; and interpreting monitoring data. Additionally, biodiversity monitoring should use multiple approaches including extensive and intensive monitoring through volunteers and professional scientists but also harnessing new technologies. Finally, we call on the scientific community to share biodiversity monitoring data, knowledge and tools to ensure the accessibility, interoperability, and reporting of biodiversity data at a global scale.

Movement, distribution and marine reserve use by an endangered migratory giant	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												AimUnderstanding the spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of migratory species is critical for management and conservation efforts. However, challenges in observing mobile marine species throughout their migratory pathways can impede the identification of critical habitat, linkages between these habitats and threat-mitigation strategies. This study aimed to gain insight into the long-term residency and movement patterns of the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and to reveal important habitat in the context of R.typus usage of existing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). LocationSouth-eastern Indian Ocean. MethodsSatellite telemetry was used to remotely track the long-term movements of 29 R.typus, and to quantify shark usage of the existing MPA network. From the tracking data and environmental predictors, nonlinear models were developed to predict suitable R.typus habitat throughout the south-eastern Indian Ocean. ResultsThis study includes the first documented complete return migrations by R.typus to Ningaloo Marine Park, which was found to be an important area for R.typus all year-round. We found that while existing MPAs along Australia's west coast do afford some protection to R.typus, telemetry-based habitat models revealed large areas of suitable habitat not currently protected, particularly along the Western Australian coast, in the Timor Sea, and in Indonesian and international waters. Main conclusionsAnimal-borne telemetric devices allowed the gathering of long-term spatial information from the elusive and highly mobile R.typus, revealing the spatial scale of their migration in the south-eastern Indian Ocean. Suitable habitat was predicted to occur inside conservation areas, but our findings indicate that the current MPA network may not sufficiently protect R.typus throughout the year. We suggest that telemetry-based habitat models can be an important tool to inform conservation planning and spatial management efforts for migratory species.																	1366-9516	1472-4642				NOV	2017	23	11					1268	1279		10.1111/ddi.12618								WOS:000413545900005

Pelagic bioregionalisation using open-access data for better planning of marine protected area networks	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Systematic conservation planning (SCP) to design marine protected areas (MPAs) has traditionally focused on species distributions or benthic habitat features that drive the determination of conservation priorities. Pelagic ecosystem protection is usually incidental because these ecosystems are often data poor and are difficult to visualize in a planning context. Pelagic ecosystems, however, face increasing and cumulative impacts from threats such as overfishing and climate change, and a precautionary approach is required to protect both known and unknown biodiversity patterns and ecosystem processes. Data-driven pelagic habitat classifications are important when planning for habitat protection in the absence of sufficient in-situ data. In this study, we describe a method for creating a bioregional map of the upper-mixed layer of South Africa's pelagic realm. We selected relevant variables and parameters that best reflect key ecosystem properties at broad, meso, and local scales. We conducted a hierarchal cluster analysis using open-access sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), net primary productivity (NPP), mean sea level anomalies (MSLA), and seabed slope and depth data. The resulting map delineates three bioregions subdivided into seven biozones and sixteen pelagic habitats within South Africa's continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This habitat map was incorporated into SCP of a proposed expanded MPA network that includes offshore protected areas and meets National objectives. The proposed network will increase protection of the pelagic realm (>30 m depth) of the EEZ from 0.002% to 6.0%. We contend that bioregional analyses based on publicly available remote-sensing data are useful for identification of offshore habitats, especially when robust biological data are unavailable, as a framework for ecosystem reporting, and for inclusion in a systematic design for a representative offshore MPA network. Further research should focus on modelling and mapping the permanence of pelagic habitats and different spatio-temporal scales of variability, validating habitat boundaries with biological data, and understanding the threats and efficacy of achieving pelagic protection through management mechanisms like MPAs.

J	Veitch, SA; Nettles, M				Veitch, Stephen A.; Nettles, Meredith			Assessment of glacial-earthquake source parameters	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Glacial earthquakes are slow earthquakes of magnitude M similar to 5 associated with major calving events at near-grounded marine-terminating glaciers. These globally detectable earthquakes provide information on the grounding state of outlet glaciers and the timing of large calving events. Seismic source modeling of glacial earthquakes provides information on the size and orientation of forces associated with calving events. We compare force orientations estimated using a centroid-single-force technique with the calving-front orientations of the source glaciers at or near the time of earthquake occurrence. We consider earthquakes recorded at four glaciers in Greenland - Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, Helheim Glacier, Kong Oscar Glacier, and Jakobshavn Isbrae - between 1999 and 2010. We find that the estimated earthquake force orientations accurately represent the orientation of the calving front at the time of the earthquake, and that seismogenic calving events are produced by a preferred section of the calving front, which may change with time. We also find that estimated earthquake locations vary in a manner consistent with changes in calving-front position, though with large scatter. We conclude that changes in glacial-earthquake source parameters reflect true changes in the geometry of the source glaciers, providing a means for identifying changes in glacier geometry and dynamics that complements traditional remote-sensing techniques.																	0022-1430	1727-5652				OCT	2017	63	241					867	876		10.1017/jog.2017.52								WOS:000418851100010

Particle characterization and composition in the NE Aegean Sea: Combining optical methods and biogeochemical parameters	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The NE Aegean Sea constitutes a challenging sector of the world's ocean in studying optical and biogeochemical properties and processes due to a dynamic frontal regime resulting from the continuous mixing of Black Sea waters (BSW) and waters of Levantine origin (LW), which are characterized by substantially different physical, chemical and biological properties. In the framework of the Perseus and AegeanMarTech projects, inherent optical properties (IOPs; beam attenuation, optical backscattering, chlorophyll-alpha fluorescence), particle size, and discrete bottle data (particulate matter, particulate organic carbon, and chlorophyll-alpha concentrations) were measured during October 2013, March 2014, and July 2014. Black Sea water enters into the Aegean Sea through the Dardanelles Straits and disperses to the west-northwest, as traced by characteristic salinity minima. The core of the BSW to the east of Lemnos Island was occasionally particle-enriched, showing maxima in c(p), b(bp), D-50, PMC, POC, and TChl-alpha, the latter, however, detected primarily at sub-surface layers. Particle composition was chiefly organic, associated with phytoplanktonic communities (BSW and LW), heterotrophic planktonic organisms and detrital organic matter primarily originating in the BSW and forming aggregates often > 100 mu m in diameter. A discrepancy between particle and TChl-alpha abundance was observed, with c(p) local maxima occurring in surface waters (BSW) and TChl-alpha maxima in mid -waters (LW). This pattern was attributed to phytoplankton photo- acclimation with depth leading to increased cell- chlorophyll content deeper, not necessarily matched by a similar biomass increase, thus, using TChI-alpha as an absolute proxy for phytoplankton biomass may not be appropriate, when considering water bodies encompassing the entire euphotic zone. Primarily in surface waters, the in situ optically measured median particle diameter corresponds to large particles/aggregates, contrary to findings obtained by laboratory analysis of cell counts in discrete water samples; this inconsistency was attributed to the fragile nature of aggregates that usually break up during sample processing and other methodological issues. The particulate backscattering ratio, as well as the estimated bulk particulate index of refraction, revealed a 2-layer structure, with biogenic particles and organic detritus occupying the upper similar to 65 m of the water column, whereas deeper waters were enriched in lithogenic/organic particles resuspended from the seabed. Overall, the NE Aegean Sea is characterized by low particulate matter concentrations and low chlorophyll biomass during the sampling periods, exhibiting rather open-sea characteristics, reflected in all optical properties studied, as evidenced by their very low values and also by the POC:c(p) regression parameters. The present work contributes to a better understanding of bio-optical properties of the Aegean Sea, which by extension may improve regional satellite algorithms applied to retrieve chlorophyll a concentration from space.

However, the process is not straightforward, the main limitation being the need for field data. The Self-calibrated Spectral Supervised Shallow-water Modeler (4SM) method was tested to obtain coastal bathymetry without the use of any field data. Using Landsat-8 multispectral images from 2013 to 2016, a bathymetric time series was produced. Groundtruthed depths and an alternative method, Stumpf's Band Ratio Algorithm, were used to verify the results. Retrieved (4SM) vs groundtruthed depths scored an average r(2) (0.90), and a low error (RMSE = 1.47 m). 4SM also showed, over the whole time series, the same average accuracy of the control method (40%). Advantages, limitations and operability under complex atmosphere and water column conditions, and high and low-albedo bottom processing capabilities of 4SM are discussed. In conclusion, the findings suggest that 4SM is as accurate as the commonly used Stumpf's method, the only difference being the independence of 4SM from previous field data, and the potential to deliver bottom spectral characteristics for further modeling. 4SM thus represents a significant advance in coastal remote sensing potential to obtain bathymetry and optical properties of the marine bottom.

An economic loss of 0.5 billion CNY (about U.S. $73 million) was estimated due to the damaged seaweed aquaculture in the Jiangsu Shoal, China. In this letter, images from the new Chinese satellite of Gaofen (GF) with high-resolution optical cameras are used to retrieve the drifting path of floating Sargassum and its origin. A southward drifting path of floating Sargassum in the western Yellow Sea is identified for the first time, and the initial site of bloom occurrence is near the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, China, implying the origin of this hazard of floating Sargassum. The scale of this Sargassum bloom event in the Jiangsu Shoal is also evaluated using a linear-mixing model suitable for high-resolution images. The result shows that the total area of Sargassum-containing pixels in the GF-1 wide-field-of-view images on December 31, 2016 was more than 46 km(2), and according to the estimation by the linear-mixing model, the total area of sea surface completely covered by Sargassum was above 8.8 km(2). The approach and the results presented in this letter should contribute to the future study and management of golden tides in Chinese coastal waters.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				OCT	2017	14	10					1815	1819		10.1109/LGRS.2017.2737079								WOS:000413961200034

In turbid waters where optical properties may be influenced by terrigenous discharge and nonphytoplankton water constituents, remote estimation of PSC is still a challenging task. Here based on measurements of phytoplankton diagnostic pigments, total chlorophyll a, and spectral reflectance in turbid waters of Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea during summer 2015, a customized model is developed and validated to estimate PSC in the two semienclosed seas. Five diagnostic pigments determined through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements are first used to produce weighting factors to model phytoplankton biomass (using total chlorophyll a as a surrogate) with relatively high accuracies. Then, a common method used to calculate contributions of microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton to the phytoplankton assemblage (i.e., F-m, F-n, and F-p) is customized using local HPLC and other data. Exponential functions are tuned to model the size-specific chlorophyll a concentrations (C-m, C-n, and C-p for microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton, respectively) with remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) and total chlorophyll a as the model inputs. Such a PSC model shows two improvements over previous models: (1) a practical strategy (i.e., model C-p and C-n first, and then derive C-m as C-C-p-C-n) with an optimized spectral band (680 nm) for R-rs as the model input; (2) local parameterization, including a local chlorophyll a algorithm. The performance of the PSC model is validated using in situ data that were not used in the model development. Application of the PSC model to GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) data leads to spatial and temporal distribution patterns of phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) that are consistent with results reported from field measurements by other researchers. While the applicability of the PSC model together with its parameterization to other optically complex regions and to other seasons is unknown, the findings of this study suggest that the approach to develop such a model may be extendable to other cases as long as local data are used to select the optimal band and to determine the model coefficients.

There are three case studies through imagery analysis on SPOT 5: short wave infrared (SWIR) imagery, SPOT 1 multi spectral (abbreviated as XS) and near infrared (NIR). The results from these studies indicate that using SWIR imagery for coastline mapping and islet area estimation is better than using the XS or the NIR. In addition to processing updated information quickly, remote sensing of land resources can also control and manage land resources effectively. Also, the results of this study highlight the traffic of reefs and encourages safe navigation through them.

The dataset used has 143 oil spills and 124 look-alikes from 198 RADARSAT images covering the east and west coasts of Canada from 2004 to 2013. Six uncertainty-based active sample selecting (ACS) methods are designed to choose the most informative samples. A method for reducing information redundancy amongst the selected samples and a method with varying sample preference are considered. Four classifiers (k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and decision tree (DT)) are coupled with ACS methods to explore the interaction and possible preference between classifiers and ACS methods. Three kinds of measures are adopted to highlight different aspect of classification performance of these AL-boosted classifiers. Overall, AL proves its strong potential with 4% to 78% reduction on training samples in different settings. The SVM classifier shows to be the best one for using in the AL frame, with perfect performance evolving curves in different kinds of measures. The exploration and exploitation criterion can further improve the performance of the AL-boosted SVM classifier but not of the other classifiers.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1041	10.3390/rs9101041								WOS:000414650600071

Sub-decadal variations in outlet glacier terminus positions in Victoria Land, Oates Land and George V Land, East Antarctica (1972-2013)	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Recent work has highlighted the sensitivity of marine-terminating glaciers to decadal-scale changes in the ocean-climate system in parts of East Antarctica. However, compared to Greenland, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, little is known about recent glacier change and potential cause(s), with several regions yet to be studied in detail. In this paper, we map the terminus positions of 135 glaciers along the coastline of Victoria Land, Oates Land and George V Land from 1972-2013 at a higher temporal resolution (sub-decadal intervals) than in previous research. These three regions span a range of climatic and oceanic conditions and contain a variety of glacier types. Overall, from 1972-2013, 36% of glaciers advanced, 25% retreated and the remainder showed no discernible change. On sub-decadal timescales, there were no clear trends in glacier terminus position change. However, marine-terminating glaciers experienced larger terminus position changes compared with terrestrial glaciers, and those with an unconstrained floating tongue exhibited the largest variations. We conclude that, unlike in Greenland, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, there is no clear glacier retreat in the study area and that most of the variations are more closely linked to glacier size and terminus type.

A Study on the Delineation of Coral Reefs in Andaman and Lakshadweep Islands Using RISAT-1 Data	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Coral reefs are one of the most diverse of all marine ecosystems and are often referred to as the "rain-forests of the sea''. Though they cover less than one per cent of Earth's surface, they are home to one quarter of all ocean species by providing food and shelter to them. Optical remote sensing has been widely employed for mapping and monitoring coral reefs. But the application of microwave remote sensing has been an alternate domain in this area. This study explores the possibility of utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of Radar Imaging Satellite-I, India's first indigenous microwave satellite to delineate the coral reefs in Andaman and Lakshadweep Islands in the Indian Ocean. The dual polarized data, after reducing the speckle has been classified to delineate the coral reefs in the vicinity of both islands. SAR has a performance comparable with passive optical sensors under favourable conditions of imaging, viz. optimum tidal current and surface winds. The study results are compared with the international coral reef reference map and are found to be highly promising, with an overall accuracy of 98.3% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.944 for fringing reefs in Andaman region. For the atolls in Lakshadweep region, the overall accuracy is found to be 92.99% and the Kappa coefficient is estimated at 0.7377. This study tries to explore a different horizon for microwave remote sensing in coral reef studies. It is seen that, optical and microwave remote sensing can provide a mutually supporting platform in coral reef delineation, in terms of imaging depth as well as climatic conditions.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2017	45	5					873	885		10.1007/s12524-016-0634-x								WOS:000413689600014

Integrating remote sensing and species distribution modelling to predict benthic communities in a Great Lakes connecting channel	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Species distribution models have become widespread in benthic ecology; however, they have mostly been applied to marine and lentic systems. In this study, we applied a maximum entropy model by using remote sensing-derived environmental variables to predict the distribution of 4 major benthic communities dominated by Tubificidae, Naididae, Echinogammarus ischnus, and Dreissena spp, respectively, in the lower Niagara River, NY, USA. The model showed very good accuracy for benthic communities with a narrow distribution range (Tubificidae and Naididae) indicated by the area under the curve test values of 0.906 and 0.987, respectively. In contrast, the model showed poor performance for E.ischnus and Dreissena indicated by the low area under the curve values of 0.615 and 0.618, respectively. Both communities are known to cope with a wide variety of environmental factors and habitats, making their accurate predictions difficult using presence-only data. Our results can further be used to locate important feeding grounds for higher trophic levels, to assess the potential spread of exotic species, and to identify areas for restoration.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2017	33	8					1336	1344		10.1002/rra.3169								WOS:000412518100011

Whereas petrophysical rock types are typically used to identify and distribute rock bodies within a reservoir with similar flow characteristics, depositional rock types ignore pore types and capture sedimentary structures, lithology and fossils. Both classification systems are extensively used to describe reservoir rocks, but the degree of plurality between them remains poorly understood and is the motivation for this study. To examine the degree of congruency between the two classification schemes, a field assessment was conducted for a 175km(2) area situated offshore Al Ruwais, northern Qatar, encompassing depositional environments spanning supratidal, intertidal, shallow subtidal and open marine conditions. A total of 350 surficial sediment samples were collected along 24 shore-normal transects. Each sample was assigned a petrophysical rock type' class based on analysis of sedimentary texture (grain size and sorting). Depositional rock type' classes, by contrast, were defined with reference to faunal content and, in turn, classes of mineralogy were delimited by weighting this content against the mineralogy of each faunal category. Of course, the samples studied correspond to unconsolidated sediments and not to indurated rocks. However, considering only primary porosity and permeability preservation, it is reasonable to assume that the classified sediments would become petrophysical rock types and depositional rock types when consolidated, following their primary grain size, sorting and grain type distribution. Therefore, the term rock type' is retained here for ease of terminology but, for clarity, these are sediment samples. The discrete samples were interpolated into continuous surfaces describing the distribution of depositional rock types, petrophysical rock types and mineralogy, and spatial correspondence between those surfaces was statistically evaluated. In order to link these parameters with environment of deposition, their correlation with water depth (as audited from airborne light detection and ranging) and ecological habitat (mapped from DigitalGlobe satellite imagery) was also assessed. The data reveal that spatial distributions of sedimentary faunal, petrographic and mineralogical properties do not show exactly congruent patterns. Other meaningful trends do exist, however. For example, the occurrence of certain depositional rock types is indicative of particular petrophysical rock types, and vice versa. Further, connections between petrophysical rock types and mineralogy are emphasized and offer insight as to how the evolution of matrix porosity might be predicted via diagenetic models tuned to specific sediment textures. Useful relationships are also identified between the occurrence of petrophysical rock types and depositional rock types, and both ecological habitat and water depth. The potential of such dualities is two-fold. Firstly, they can be applied to more realistically distribute petrophysical rock types and depositional rock types by environment of deposition in reservoir models and, secondly, the use of modern carbonate systems as subsurface analogues might be enhanced.																	0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2017	64	6					1646	1675		10.1111/sed.12368								WOS:000408921900008

Impacts of ocean climate variability on biodiversity of pelagic forage species in an upwelling ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Monitoring essential marine biodiversity variables is an effective means for assessing impacts of climate change and human-related stressors such as pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction. Yet little is known about the natural variability of biodiversity in pelagic upwelling marine ecosystems, which are often subject to substantial interannual and decadal variability of ocean climate conditions. Using data from a pelagic midwater trawl survey, we quantified diversity indices of epipelagic forage species collected over 26 yr (1990 to 2015) to determine the natural variability and environmental determinants of biodiversity within the California Current upwelling ecosystem. Biodiversity time series indicate there are 2 alternate forage species assemblages that relate to differences in cool/strong and warm/weak upwelling years that vary in 3 to 5 yr cycles. Cooler years are associated with increased biodiversity of juvenile groundfish, whereas warm years coincide with increased biodiversity of coastal and mesopelagic fishes and species originating from southern and subtropical waters. During 2015, a year of anomalous warm surface ocean conditions, we observed unprecedented high levels of biodiversity and attribute it to high abundance of juvenile groundfish combined with an unusually high transport of subtropical and offshore species into neritic waters. Using a combination of remote sensing and in situ hydrographic data, we compare 2015 to previous anomalous ocean climate conditions and discuss how biodiversity of forage species may impact trophodynamics of upwelling ecosystems and predator-prey interactions. Attributing changes in marine biodiversity to productivity cycles and anomalous climate events, and detecting long-term biodiversity trends, provides a critical index toward understanding climate forcing on upwelling ecosystems.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				SEP 29	2017	580						205	220		10.3354/meps12278								WOS:000419091500013

Abrupt increases in aerosol volume concentration and shifts of size distributions towards larger sizes, which are associated with increase in wind speed and atmospheric water content, were systematically recorded during the summertime at a distance of at least 80 km from the coast. Chemical imaging of aerosol samples showed an increased contribution of highly hygroscopic particles during the intrusion of the sea breeze. Besides a significant fraction of marine aerosols, the amount of internally mixed marine and mineral dust particles was also increased during the sea breeze period. The number fraction of marine and internally mixed particles during the sea breeze reached up to 88% in the PM1-2.5 and up to 62% in the PM2.5-10 size range. Additionally, numerous particles with residuals of liquid coating were observed by SEM/EDX analysis. Ca-rich dust particles that had reacted with anthropogenic nitrates were evidenced by Raman microspectroscopy. The resulting hygroscopic particles can deliquesce at very low relative humidity. Our observations suggest that aerosol hygroscopic growth in the Negev Desert is induced by the daily sea breeze arrival. The varying aerosol microphysical and optical characteristics perturb the solar and thermal infrared radiations. The changes in aerosol properties induced by the sea breeze, relative to the background situation, doubled the shortwave radiative cooling at the surface (from -10 to -20.5Wm(-2)) and increased by almost 3 times the warming of the atmosphere (from 5 to 14Wm(-2)), as evaluated for a case study. Given the important value of observed liquid coating of particles, we also examined the possible influence of the particle homogeneity assumption on the retrieval of aerosol microphysical characteristics. The tests suggest that sensitivity to the coating appears if backward scattering and polarimetric measurements are available for the inversion algorithm. This may have an important implication for retrievals of aerosol microphysical properties in remote sensing applications.

Optical and biochemical properties of a southwest Florida whiting event	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												"Whiting" in oceanography is a term used to describe a sharply defined patch of water that contains high levels of suspended, fine-grained calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Whitings have been reported in many oceanic and lake environments, and recently have been reported in southwest Florida coastal waters. Here, field and laboratory measurements were used to study optical, biological, and chemical properties of whiting waters off southwest Florida. No significant difference was found in chlorophyll a concentrations between whiting and outside waters (non-whiting water), but average particle backscattering coefficients in whiting waters were double those in outside waters, and remote sensing reflectance in whiting waters was higher at all wavelengths (400-700 nm). While other potential causes cannot be completely ruled out, particle composition and biochemical differences between sampled whiting water, contiguous water, and outside water indicate a biologically precipitated mode of whiting formation. Taxonomic examination of marine phytoplanlcton samples collected during a whiting event revealed a community dominated by autotrophic picoplankton and a small (<10 gm), centric diatom species, identified as Thalassiosira sp. through the use of scanning electron microscopy. Amorphous to fully formed crystals of CaCO3 were observed along the girdle bands of Thalassiosira sp. cells and autotrophic picoplankton cells. Although carbonate parameters differed from whiting and contiguous to outside water, more sampling is needed to determine if these results are statistically significant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the automatic extraction of endmembers from hyperspectral imagery remains a challenge. This paper proposes a data field-spectral preprocessing (DSPP) algorithm for endmember extraction. The method first derives a set of extreme points from the data field of an image. At the same time, it identifies a set of spectrally pure points in the spectral space. Finally, the preprocessing algorithm fuses the data field with the spectral calculation to generate a new subset of endmember candidates for the following endmember extraction. The processing time is greatly shortened by directly using endmember extraction algorithms. The proposed algorithm provides accurate endmember detection, including the detection of anomalous endmembers. Therefore, it has a greater accuracy, stronger noise resistance, and is less time-consuming. Using both synthetic hyperspectral images and real airborne hyperspectral images, we utilized the proposed preprocessing algorithm in combination with several endmember extraction algorithms to compare the proposed algorithm with the existing endmember extraction preprocessing algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively extract marine oil spill data.

Use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for Extraction of Ocean Surface Wave Fields from X-Band Radar Measurements of the Sea Surface	REMOTE SENSING												Radar remote sensing of the sea surface for the extraction of ocean surface wave fields requires separating wave and non-wave contributions to the sea surface measurement. Conventional methods of extracting wave information from radar measurements of the sea surface rely on filtering the wavenumber-frequency spectrum using the linear dispersion relationship for ocean surface waves. However, this technique has limitations, e.g., it isn't suited for the inclusion of non-linear wave features. This study evaluates an alternative method called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for the extraction of ocean surface wave fields remotely sensed by marine radar. POD is an empirical and optimal linear method for representing non-linear processes. The method was applied to Doppler velocity data of the sea surface collected using two different radar systems during two different experiments that spanned a variety of environmental conditions. During both experiments, GPS mini-buoys simultaneously collected wave data. The POD method was used to generate phase-resolved wave orbital velocity maps that are statistically evaluated by comparing wave statistics computed from the buoy data to those obtained from these maps. The results show that leading POD modes contain energy associated with the peak wavelength(s) of the measured wave field, and consequently, wave contributions to the radar measurement of the sea surface can be separated based on modes. Wave statistics calculated from optimized POD reconstructions are comparable to those calculated from GPS wave buoys. The accuracy of the wave statistics generated from POD-reconstructed orbital velocity maps was not sensitive to the radar configuration or environmental conditions examined. Further research is needed to determine a rigorous method for selecting modes a priori.																	2072-4292					SEP	2017	9	9							881	10.3390/rs9090881								WOS:000414138700011

First assessment of MODIS satellite ocean color products (OC3 and nFLH) in the Inner Sea of Chiloe, northern Patagonia	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH					4th Congress of Physical, Meteorological and Clinical Oceanography	NOV 18-20, 2015	Valparaiso, CHILE					The use of remote sensing has allowed enormous progress in our understanding of biophysical processes worldwide. Despite their importance, the use of satellite bio-optical products is still limited due to optical complexity. In this study we assess the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer algorithm for chlorophyll-a (MODIS-OC3) and of normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH), in inner waters of northern Chilean Patagonia (41 degrees-45 degrees S). Satellite data were evaluated using a compilation of in situ chlorophyll-a data collected by the CIMAR-FIORDOS program during 2003-2012. During austral spring MODIS-OC3 showed a significant relationship with in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.2, P = 0.03, F = 5.33) in comparison with winter when the relationship was non-significant. In contrast, nFLH explained a significant fraction of observed variance of Chl-a during austral winter (R2 = 0.54, P = < 0.01, F = 10.68) and this relationship was not significant in spring. Our preliminary results offer an excellent chance to understand patterns of variability of the autotrophic biomass and physiological status in optically complex interior marine ecosystems.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				SEP	2017	45	4					822	827		10.3856/vol45-issue4-fulltext-18								WOS:000410546100018

The bloom onset provides a warning bell for possible changes in trophic interactions and biogeochemical processes. However, depicting the phenology of phytoplankton blooms at high latitudes, where long-term observations are sparse or unavailable, is not a straightforward task. A data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function algorithm was applied to daily satellite-retrieved chlorophyll-a images to produce a long-term (1998-2014) and cloud-free data set over the North Water (NOW) polynya. The seasonal bloom was modeled using a multi-Gaussian approach from which a baseline of phenological characteristics was extracted. The correlation analysis highlights the influence of environmental factors, such as sea surface temperature, cloud fraction, wind stress, and sea-ice concentration, in modulating the bloom start date, its duration, and amplitude. The year-to-year variability in bloom onset appears to be controlled by a delicate balance between oceanographic and meteorological conditions. Blooms last longer during years characterized by a longer open-water period and are shorter during those characterized by greater sea-ice coverage. Noteworthy is the decrease in phytoplankton bloom amplitude over the 17 years examined. Collectively, these outcomes depict the NOW as a climate-sensitive region in which the pelagic marine ecosystem seems to be going toward a decline in chlorophyll-a concentrations. Satellite time series are still too short to differentiate between inter-annual variability, inter-decadal variability, and climate change signal. Should these changes persist; however, the NOW may no longer act as a productive regional oasis supporting thriving populations of zooplankton and top predators.

J	Niu, MX; Wang, J				Niu Mingxiang; Wang Jun			Variation in the distribution of wintering anchovy Engraulis japonicus and its relationship with water temperature in the central and southern Yellow Sea	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												In the present study, we investigated a shift in the spatial distribution of wintering anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and its relationship with water temperature, using data collected by bottom trawl surveys and remote sensing in the central and southern Yellow Sea, during 2000-2015. Our results indicate that the latitudinal distribution of wintering anchovy varied between years, but there was no consistent pattern in the direction of change (north or south). Wintering anchovy did not move northward with increasing water temperature. However, the latitudinal distribution of wintering anchovy correlated well with 10A degrees C and 11A degrees C isotherms. The results of both a one-step and a two-step generalized additive model indicated that water temperature was associated with both presence and biomass of wintering anchovy. This paper is the first to systematically examine the relationship between anchovy distribution and water temperature using a variety of techniques. All the findings confirm the impact of water temperature on wintering anchovy distribution, which has important implications for the continued management of the anchovy resource and the enhancement of marine fishery resources in the Yellow Sea, especially as the climate changes. However water temperature only partly explains the species distribution of anchovy, and stock characteristics also affect fishery distribution. Therefore, other factors should be considered in future research.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				SEP	2017	35	5					1134	1143		10.1007/s00343-017-6134-1								WOS:000410093300015

Interannual and Decadal Variability in Tropical Pacific Chlorophyll from a Statistical Reconstruction: 1958-2008	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Historical understanding of marine biological dynamics has been limited by sparse in situ observations and the fact that dedicated ocean color satellite remote sensing only began in 1997. From these observations, it has become clear that physical oceanography controls biological variability over seasonal to interannual time scales. To quantify how multidecadal, climate-scale patterns impact biological productivity, the strong correlation with sea surface temperature and sea surface height is utilized to reconstruct a retrospective 51-yr time series of surface chlorophyll, the pigment measured by ocean color satellites. The canonical correlation analysis statistical reconstruction demonstrates greatest skill away from land and within about 10 degrees of the equator where chlorophyll variance is greatest and predominantly associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation dynamics. Differences in chlorophyll patterns between east or central Pacific El Nino events are observed, with larger declines east of 180 degrees for east Pacific events and west of 180 degrees for central Pacific events. Additionally, small but significant decadal variations in chlorophyll patterns are observed corresponding to the Pacific decadal oscillation. Decadal changes in chlorophyll west of 180 degrees are consistent with increased stratification, whereas changes between 110 degrees-140 degrees W may be related to long-term shoaling of the nutrient-bearing equatorial undercurrent.

To improve the temporal resolution and the inspection flexibility, we propose a novel aerial image-based system that can find oil spills timely from images captured using onboard optical cameras installed in unmanned aerial vehicle or airplanes. In particular, a subcategory-aware feature selection (FS) and support vector machine (SVM) joint optimization technique is proposed to learn a discriminative model that can tell the existence of oil spills within an optical image of the marine surface. A set of color-based features is first extracted and concatenated together to characterize the oil spill incidence in an image, where a new color autocorrelogram is designed, which can better describe each color's spatial distribution in an image. Furthermore, subcategory-aware joint FS and SVM optimization technique is designed, which is capable of generating the optimal feature subset and SVM component models. Experiments on a set of real-world marine surface images show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques and achieves promising results for aerial image-based oil spill inspection.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				SEP	2017	55	9					5264	5273		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2704107								WOS:000408346600034

Within this paper, a robust method is introduced for retrieving significant wave heights from Doppler speed measurements acquired with a coherent-on-receive marine radar. The Doppler velocity is caused by the surface scattering in the line of site of the radar. To a huge extent its periodic component is induced by the orbital motions associated with surface waves. The proposed methodology is based on linear wave theory, accounts for projection effects caused by the fixed antenna look direction, and was applied to a coherent-on-receive radar operating at X-band with vertical polarization in transmit and receive. To show the overall performance of the method, a data set consisting of approximately 100 days of radar measurements was analyzed and used to retrieve significant wave heights. Comparisons to wave measurements collected by a wave rider buoy resulted in a root-mean-square (rms) error of 0.21 m and a bias of 0 m without any calibration parameters needed. To further improve the accuracy of significant wave height, a calibration factor needs to be accounted for, which improves the rms error to 0.15 m with a negligible bias of -0.01 m.

Lastly, the main technical specifications of the payload were defined and radiometric calculations carried out to evaluate the performances of both the payload and the proposed discrimination method.

It can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, primarily through raw oyster consumption. Water temperatures, and potentially other environmental factors, play an important role in the growth and proliferation of Vp in the environment. Quantifying the relationships between environmental variables and indicators or incidence of Vp illness is valuable for public health surveillance to inform and enable suitable preventative measures. This study aimed to assess the relationship between environmental parameters and Vp in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods: The study used Vp counts in oyster meat from 2002-2015 and laboratory confirmed Vp illnesses from 2011-2015 for the province of BC. The data were matched to environmental parameters from publicly available sources, including remote sensing measurements of nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from satellite readings at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Using three separate models, this paper assessed the relationship between (1) daily SST and Vp counts in oyster meat, (2) weekly mean Vp counts in oysters and weekly Vp illnesses, and (3) weekly mean SST and weekly Vp illnesses. The effects of salinity and chlorophyll a were also evaluated. Linear regression was used to quantify the relationship between SST and Vp, and piecewise regression was used to identify SST thresholds of concern. Results: A total of 2327 oyster samples and 293 laboratory confirmed illnesses were included. In model 1, both SST and salinity were significant predictors of log(Vp) counts in oyster meat. In model 2, the mean log(Vp) count in oyster meat was a significant predictor of Vp illnesses. In model 3, weekly mean SST was a significant predictor of weekly Vp illnesses. The piecewise regression models identified a SST threshold of approximately 14 degrees C for both model 1 and 3, indicating increased risk of Vp in oyster meat and Vp illnesses at higher temperatures. Conclusion: Monitoring of SST, particularly through readily accessible remote sensing data, could serve as a warning signal for Vp and help inform the introduction and cessation of preventative or control measures.																	1476-069X					AUG 31	2017	16								92	10.1186/s12940-017-0301-x								WOS:000409137000001	28859689

Re-examining the effect of particle phase functions on the remote-sensing reflectance	APPLIED OPTICS												Even though it is well known that both the magnitude and detailed angular shape of scattering (phase function, PF), particularly in the backward angles, affect the color of the ocean, the current remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) models typically account for the effect of its magnitude only through the backscattering coefficient (b(b)). Using 116 volume scattering function (VSF) measurements previously collected in three coastal waters around the U.S. and in the water of the North Atlantic Ocean, we re-examined the effect of particle PF on R-rs in four scenarios. In each scenario, the magnitude of particle backscattering (i.e., b(bp)) is known, but the knowledge on the angular shape of particle backscattering is assumed to increase from knowing nothing about the shape of particle PFs to partially knowing the particle backscattering ratio (B-p), the exact backscattering shape as defined by (beta) over tilde (p)(gamma >= 90 degrees) (particle VSF normalized by the particle total scattering coefficient), and the exact backscattering shape as defined by the chi(p) factor (particle VSF normalized by the particle backscattering coefficient). At sun zenith angle = 30 degrees, the nadir-viewed R-rs would vary up to 65%, 35%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, as the constraints on the shape of particle backscattering become increasingly stringent from scenarios 1 to 4. In all four scenarios, the R-rs variations increase with both viewing and sun angles and are most prominent in the direction opposite the sun. Our results show a greater impact of the measured particle PFs on R-rs than previously found, mainly because our VSF data show a much greater variability in B-p, (beta) over tilde (p)(gamma >= 90 degrees) , and chi(p) than previously known. Among the uncertainties in R-rs due to the particle PFs, about 97% can be explained by chi(p), 90% by (beta) over tilde (p)(gamma >= 90 degrees) , and 27% by B-p. The results indicate that the uncertainty in ocean color remote sensing can be significantly constrained by accounting for chi(p) of the VSFs.

Cloud droplets to drizzle: Contribution of transition drops to microphysical and optical properties of marine stratocumulus clouds	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Aircraft measurements of the ubiquitous marine stratocumulus cloud type, with over 3000 km of in situ data from the Pacific during the Cloud System Evolution in the Trades experiment, show the ability of the Holographic Detector for Clouds (HOLODEC) instrument to smoothly interpolate the small and large droplet data collected with Cloud Droplet Probe and 2DC instruments. The combined, comprehensive instrument suite reveals a surprisingly large contribution in the predrizzle size range of 40-80 mu m (transition droplets, or drizzlets), a range typically not measured and assumed to reside in a condensation-to-collision minimum between cloud droplet and drizzle modes. Besides shedding light on the onset of collision coalescence, drizzlets are essential contributors to optical and chemical properties because of a substantial contribution to the total surface area. When adjusted to match spatial resolution of spaceborne remote sensing, the missing drizzlets bring in situ measurements to closer agreement with satellite observations.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 16	2017	44	15					8002	8010		10.1002/2017GL074430								WOS:000408379000050

Correlations of oriented ice and precipitation in marine midlatitude low clouds using collocated CloudSat, CALIOP, and MODIS observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In April 2006, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) launched aboard the CALIPSO satellite and into the A-Train constellation of satellites with its transmitter pointed near nadir. This proved problematic due to specular reflection from horizontally oriented ice crystals occurring more frequently than expected. Because the specular backscatter from oriented ice crystals has large attenuated backscatter and almost no depolarization, the standard lidar inversions cannot be applied. To mitigate this issue, the CALIOP transmitter was moved to 3 degrees off nadir in November 2007. Though problematic for global CALIOP retrievals, the sensitivity to oriented ice during the first year of observations provides a unique data set to investigate scenes of this ice crystal signature. This study focuses on the CALIOP-oriented signature that occurs in midlatitude ocean regions whose cloud tops are relatively warm and low, existing below 6km. A significant seasonal dependence is found in the Northern Hemisphere with up to 19% of clouds below 6km yielding specular reflection by CALIOP during the colder months. In contrast, the Southern Hemisphere lacks such seasonal dependence and sees fewer oriented ice crystals. Using collocated CloudSat observations with both CALIOP and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we investigate the correlations of the oriented signature with MODIS cloud properties. Comparing with CloudSat precipitation retrievals, we find that the oriented signature is strongly correlated with surface precipitation with 64% of CALIOP-oriented ice crystal cases precipitating compared to 40% for nonoriented cases.

A diver-operated hyperspectral imaging and topographic surveying system for automated mapping of benthic habitats	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												We developed a novel integrated technology for diver-operated surveying of shallow marine ecosystems. The HyperDiver system captures rich multifaceted data in each transect: hyperspectral and color imagery, topographic profiles, incident irradiance and water chemistry at a rate of 15-30 m(2) per minute. From surveys in a coral reef following standard diver protocols, we show how the rich optical detail can be leveraged to generate photopigment abundance and benthic composition maps. We applied machine learning techniques, with a minor annotation effort (<2% of pixels), to automatically generate cm-scale benthic habitat maps of high taxonomic resolution and accuracy (93-97%). The ability to efficiently map benthic composition, photopigment densities and rugosity at reef scales is a compelling contribution to modernize reef monitoring. Seafloor-level hyperspectral images can be used for automated mapping, avoiding operator bias in the analysis and deliver the degree of detail necessary for standardized environmental monitoring. The technique can deliver fast, objective and economic reef survey results, making it a valuable tool for coastal managers and reef ecologists. Underwater hyperspectral surveying shares the vantage point of the high spatial and taxonomic resolution restricted to field surveys, with analytical techniques of remote sensing and provides targeted validation for aerial monitoring.

On the imprint of surfactant-driven stabilization of laboratory breaking wave foam with comparison to oceanic whitecaps	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Surfactants are ubiquitous in the global oceans: they help form the materially-distinct sea surface microlayer (SML) across which global ocean-atmosphere exchanges take place, and they reside on the surfaces of bubbles and whitecap foam cells prolonging their lifetime thus altering ocean albedo. Despite their importance, the occurrence, spatial distribution, and composition of surfactants within the upper ocean and the SML remains under-characterized during conditions of vigorous wave breaking when in-situ sampling methods are difficult to implement. Additionally, no quantitative framework exists to evaluate the importance of surfactant activity on ocean whitecap foam coverage estimates. Here we use individual laboratory breaking waves generated in filtered seawater and seawater with added soluble surfactant to identify the imprint of surfactant activity in whitecap foam evolution. The data show a distinct surfactant imprint in the decay phase of foam evolution. The area-time-integral of foam evolution is used to develop a time-varying stabilization function, phi(t) and a stabilization factor, circle dot, which can be used to identify and quantify the extent of this surfactant imprint for individual breaking waves. The approach is then applied to wind-driven oceanic whitecaps, and the laboratory and ocean H distributions overlap. It is proposed that whitecap foam evolution may be used to determine the occurrence and extent of oceanic surfactant activity to complement traditional in-situ techniques and extend measurement capabilities to more severe sea states occurring at wind speeds in excess of about 10m/s. The analysis procedure also provides a framework to assess surfactant-driven variability within and between whitecap coverage data sets. Plain Language Summary The foam patches made by breaking waves, also known as "whitecaps'', are an important source of marine sea spray, which impacts weather and climate through the formation of cloud drops and ice. Sea spray chemistry depends on the chemistry of the whitecap that makes it. This chemistry is poorly understood, especially during storms when whitecaps are most prevalent but chemistry measurements are also the most difficult. In this article, we show that foam chemistry affects the persistence of laboratory whitecaps: the more surfactant a whitecap contains, the longer it persists. This effect has enabled us to develop a remote sensing tool to detect the presence of chemistry in whitecaps by analyzing a time-series of photographs of the foam. We have applied the technique to an existing set of whitecap images, and get reasonable values for implied surfactant concentrations in the ocean but validation of the technique in the field will have to await simultaneous measurement of whitecaps and sea surface chemistry. If validated, the new remote sensing tool will provide the first large-scale observations of ocean surface chemistry and its variation in space and time on wind-driven seas.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				AUG	2017	122	8					6110	6128		10.1002/2017JC012809								WOS:000410790600004

The results show: (1) Qinzhou Bay coastal morphology change degree was strong in 2006 -2012 and the coastline changed greatly. Originally part of the natural shore segments which had twists and turns were gradually filled into artificial coast, the coast constantly advanced to the sea, coastline became regular and straight; (2) The change degree of coastline was relatively small in 2006-2008, the average artificial coastline increased 8.86 km/a, the average artificial reclamation area was 20.79 km(2) /a; in 2008-2012, the change range of coastline was the greatest, coastline changed most severely, the average artificial coastline increased 16.07 km/a, the average artificial reclamation area was 58.52 km(2) /a; however, in 2012-2014, coastline change degree relatively slowed, the average artificial coastline increased 4.04 km per year, the average artificial reclamation area was 3.464 km(2) /a. (3) Compared to the studies of predecessors, the innovation of this paper is that it is the first to carry out the detailed research on coastline evolution caused by reclamation engineerings of the Qinzhou Bay, then formed the change results on coastline that caused by intense human activities in the Qinzhou Bay, provided the area of the marine environment protection with full and accurate data.																	1233-2585					AUG	2017	24				2		188	194		10.1515/pomr-2017-0082								WOS:000411490000025

Recurring Emergence of the Mud Islands on Shelf of the Arabian Sea along the Makran Coast of Pakistan - Historical Perspective using Remote Sensing Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Recurring emergences of mud islands on shelf of the Arabian Sea, along the Makran coast of Pakistan are now known to be submarine mud volcanoes. They are expressions of enhanced extrusions of fluidized mud and gases coupled with compressional tectonics in convergent margin settings. Since 1945 the Malan island has emerged four times, and some other mud islands have also been emerging repeatedly, at their own positions. The first known emergence, during November 1945, was concurrent with an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 (M8.0), the 2nd and 3rd emergences, in March 1999 and November 2010 respectively, were not related apparently with earthquakes. The 4th emergence concurred with the Awaran earthquake (M7.7) of 24th September 2013. Landsat images of March 1999 and November 2010 emergences indicate appearance of round-shaped island of 4.4 and 5.2 hectare area, followed by erosion and disappearance. The island was composed of mud breccias and circular vents spewing mud slurry and methane gas. The emergence of Malan island, in March 1999 and November 2010 was compared with earthquake data before and after the emergences. The earthquakes data, two years before March 1999 and November 2010 emergences and two years afterwards, shows correlation with both small and large earthquakes, prior to the emergence, in the radius of over 400 km. It is proposed that mud islands develop in response to the episodes of enhanced mud extrusion, which inturn are related with the enhanced compressional and/or seismic events. These events are followed by periods of relative quiescence characterized by normal activity of mud extrusion and marine erosion.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				AUG	2017	90	2					201	208		10.1007/s12594-017-0700-1								WOS:000408991300011

This spatial resolution should be at least decametric. Aquatic color data processing associated with these environments requires specific atmospheric corrections (AC) suitable for the spectral characteristics of high spatial resolution sensors (HRS) as well as the high range of atmospheric and marine optical properties. The objective of the present study is to develop and demonstrate the potential of a ground-based AC approach adaptable to any HRS for regional monitoring and security of littoral systems. The in Situ-based Atmospheric CORrection (SACOR) algorithm is based on simulations provided by a Successive Order of Scattering code (SOS), which is constrained by a simple regional aerosol particle model (RAM). This RAM is defined from the mixture of a standard tropospheric and maritime aerosol type. The RAM is derived from the following two processes. The first process involved the analysis of a 6-year data set composed of aerosol optical and microphysical properties acquired through the ground-based PHOTONS/AERONET network located at Arcachon (France). The second process was related to aerosol climatology using the NOAA hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that aerosols have a bimodal particle size distribution regardless of the season and are mainly represented by a mixed coastal continental type. Furthermore, the results indicate that aerosols originate from both the Atlantic Ocean (53.6%) and Continental Europe (46.4%). Based on these results, absorbing biomass burning, urban-industrial and desert dust particles have not been considered although they represent on average 19% of the occurrences. This represents the main current limitation of the RAM. An assessment of the performances of SACOR is then performed by inter-comparing the water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) retrievals with three different AC methods (ACOLITE, MACCS and 6SV using three different standard aerosol types) using match-ups (N = 8) composed of Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes and field radiometric measurements. Results indicate consistency with the SWIR-based ACOLITE method, which shows the best performance, except in the green channel where SACOR matches well with the in-situ data (relative error of 7%). In conclusion, the study demonstrates the high potential of the SACOR approach for the retrieval of rho(w). In the future, the method could be improved by using an adaptive aerosol model, which may select the most relevant local aerosol model following the origin of the atmospheric air mass, and could be applied to the latest HRS (Sentinel-2/MSI, SPOT6-7, Pleiades 1A-1B).

To monitor such spill events from space, fully polarimetric (Pol-SAR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been greatly used in improving oil spill observation. Aiming to promote ocean oil spill classification accuracy, we developed a new oil spill identification method by combining multiple fully polarimetric SAR features data with an optimized wavelet neural network classifier (WNN). Two sets of RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR data are applied to test the validity of the developed method. The experimental results show that: (1) the convergence ability of optimized WNN can be enhanced, improving overall classification accuracy of ocean oil spill, in comparison to the classification results based on a common un-optimized WNN classifier; and (2) the joint use of the multiple fully Pol-SAR features as the inputs of the classifier can achieve better classification result than that only with single fully Pol-SAR feature. The developed method can improve classification accuracy by 4.96% and 7.75%, compared with the classification results with un-optimized WNN and only with one single fully polarimetric SAR feature. The classification overall accuracy based on the proposed approach can reach 97.67%. Experimental results have proven that the proposed approach is effective and applicable to classify the ocean oil spill.

J	Zhang, MW; Leifer, I; Hu, CM				Zhang, Minwei; Leifer, Ira; Hu, Chuanmin			Challenges in Methane Column Retrievals from AVIRIS-NG Imagery over Spectrally Cluttered Surfaces: A Sensitivity Analysis	REMOTE SENSING												A comparison between efforts to detect methane anomalies by a simple band ratio approach from the Airborne Visual Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Classic (AVIRIS-C) data for the Kern Front oil field, Central California, and the Coal Oil Point marine hydrocarbon seep field, offshore southern California, was conducted. The detection succeeded for the marine source and failed for the terrestrial source, despite these sources being of comparable strength. Scene differences were investigated in higher spectral and spatial resolution collected by the AVIRIS-C successor instrument, AVIRIS Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG), by a sensitivity study. Sensitivity to factors including water vapor, aerosol, planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure, illumination and viewing angle, and surface albedo clutter were explored. The study used the residual radiance method, with sensitivity derived from MODTRAN (MODerate resolution atmospheric correction TRANsmission) simulations of column methane (XCH4). Simulations used the spectral specifications and geometries of AVIRIS-NG and were based on a uniform or an in situ vertical CH4 profile, which was measured concurrent with the AVIRIS-NG data. Small but significant sensitivity was found for PBL structure and water vapor; however, highly non-linear, extremely strong sensitivity was found for surface albedo error. For example, a 10% decrease in the surface albedo corresponded to a 300% XCH4 increase over background XCH4 to compensate for the total signal, less so for stronger plumes. This strong non-linear sensitivity resulted from the high percentage of surface-reflected radiance in the airborne at-sensor total radiance. Coarse spectral resolution and feedback from interferents like water vapor underlay this sensitivity. Imaging spectrometry like AVIRIS and the Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI) candidate satellite mission, have the advantages of contextual spatial information and greater at-sensor total radiance. However, they also face challenges due to their relatively broad spectral resolution compared to trace gas specific orbital sensors, e.g., the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), which is especially applicable to trace gas retrievals over scenes with high spectral albedo variability. Results of the sensitivity analysis are applicable for the residual radiance method and CH4 profiles used in the analysis, but they illustrate potential significant challenges in CH4 retrievals using other approaches.																	2072-4292					AUG	2017	9	8							835	10.3390/rs9080835								WOS:000408605600073

Google Haul Out: Earth Observation Imagery and Digital Aerial Surveys in Coastal Wildlife Management and Abundance Estimation	BIOSCIENCE												As the sampling frequency and resolution of Earth observation imagery increase, there are growing opportunities for novel applications in population monitoring. New methods are required to apply established analytical approaches to data collected from new observation platforms (e.g., satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles). Here, we present a method that estimates regional seasonal abundances for an understudied and growing population of gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) in southeastern Massachusetts, using opportunistic observations in Google Earth imagery. Abundance estimates are derived from digital aerial survey counts by adapting established correction-based analyses with telemetry behavioral observation to quantify survey biases. The result is a first regional understanding of gray seal abundance in the northeast US through opportunistic Earth observation imagery and repurposed animal telemetry data. As species observation data from Earth observation imagery become more ubiquitous, such methods provide a robust, adaptable, and cost-effective solution to monitoring animal colonies and understanding species abundances.																	0006-3568	1525-3244				AUG	2017	67	8					760	768		10.1093/biosci/bix059								WOS:000406967600012						
J	Hou, BH; Keeling, J; Li, ZY				Hou, Baohong; Keeling, John; Li, Ziying			Paleovalley-related uranium deposits in Australia and China: A review of geological and exploration models and methods	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												The features and similarities in the geology of paleovalley-related uranium mineralizing systems in Australia and China can be used to refine strategies for exploration. Paleovalley-related uranium resources include sandstone-, lignite-and calcrete-style deposits that are developed within the host sediments deposited in paleovalleys. The paleovalleys incise either crystalline bedrock or older sedimentary rocks, and uranium was deposited and concentrated by the influx of oxidized reduced groundwaters flowing in aquifers within the paleovalley fill. The critical features of paleovalley-related uranium deposits include sediment and uranium sources, geological setting, depositional environment, age and relative timing of mineralization, aquifer characteristics, availability and distribution of reductants, and preservation potential of the uranium mineral system. This set of information provides a basis to establish the uranium mineralization model, which can then be used to assist with generating targets for uranium exploration and prospectivity analysis of a region. With respect to Sino-Australian examples, paleovalley-related uranium deposits form mostly around the margins of sedimentary basins and the mineralization is commonly hosted within channel fills contained within paleovalleys developed upon, or proximal to, Precambrian crystalline rocks that contain primary uranium sources. The deposits that have been well studied show remarkably similar factors that controlled the formation of paleovalley-related uranium deposits. Basement/bedrocks with above-background (2.8 ppm U) levels of uranium (10-100 ppm) that are linked to, and/or, incised by paleovalleys are associated with these deposits and are the inferred source of the uranium. In these regions, extensive fluvial systems developed particularly during Mesozoic and Cenozoic times, uranium from the bedrock was first dispersed into the sediments, and then concentrated to form deposits through successive chemical remobilization, precipitation and concentration. The deposits formed in continental or marginal marine environments, and commonly are associated with reduced lithologies, containing pyrite and dispersed organic matter and/or seams of lignite, or show evidence of infiltrated hydrocarbons. The mineralization is developed where oxidizing fluids (carrying dissolved U) reacted with reductants in the sediments. Geological, geophysical and geochemical features of the paleovalleys and related uranium deposits are used to construct models to understand host sediment distribution, fluid flow and ore genesis that can assist exploration for paleovalley-hosted uranium deposits. Precise geometric definition of the basin margin and paleovalley architecture is important in identifying exploration targets and improving the effectiveness of drilling. Refinements in remote sensing, geophysical and data processing techniques, in combination with sedimentological and depositional interpretations, provide an efficient approach for outlining the principal drainage patterns and channel dimensions. To help reduce risk, an exploration strategy should combine these technologies with a detailed understanding of the physicochemical parameters controlling uranium mobilization, precipitation and preservation.

A global geography of synchrony for marine phytoplankton	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: Spatial synchrony in plankton is imperfectly understood yet may have far-reaching implications, for example for carbon export to the deep ocean. Several techniques have been used to describe patterns of spatial synchrony, from correlation coefficients to spectral methods. Some studies have used temporally extensive data sets to identify causes of synchrony. This study instead uses the exceptional spatial extent provided by remotely sensed data to describe, for the first time as far as we know, geographical patterns of synchrony in marine phytoplankton. We use these patterns to illuminate drivers of synchrony and of its geography. Location: The oceans. Time period: 2003-2015. Major taxon: Chlorophyll a-containing phytoplankton. Methods: Synchrony in chlorophyll a concentrations is mapped globally. Spatial statistics and model selection are used to illuminate main statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in synchrony. Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and previously unmapped geography of synchrony for phytoplankton. For instance, synchrony was highest in the open ocean, specifically in gyres, and lowest in coastal regions. Spatial modelling provided the second main result that synchrony in sea surface temperature (SST) was a major statistical determinant of chlorophyll synchrony in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, indicating a strong Moran effect, although possibly an indirect and/or complex one. In the Pacific Ocean, this effect depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed, providing our third result, which is that synchrony of phytoplankton and its geography can be time-scale specific. Synchrony of surface solar irradiance was not associated with synchrony of chlorophyll. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to map geography of synchrony in marine plankton. We showed that this geography is pronounced. Geographical patterns illuminated determinants of synchrony. The geography of synchrony is a major phenomenon that has been little explored.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				AUG	2017	26	8					867	877		10.1111/geb.12594								WOS:000405190600002						
J	Defriez, EJ; Reuman, DC				Defriez, Emma J.; Reuman, Daniel C.			A global geography of synchrony for terrestrial vegetation	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: Previous work demonstrated a pronounced geography of synchrony for marine phytoplankton and used that geography to infer statistical environmental determinants of synchrony. Here, we determine whether terrestrial vegetation (measured by the enhanced vegetation index, EVI) also shows a geography of synchrony and we infer determinants of EVI synchrony. As vegetation is the basis of the terrestrial food web, changes in spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics may have major consequences. Location: The land. Time period: 2001-2014. Major taxa: Plants. Methods: Synchrony in terrestrial vegetation is mapped globally. Spatial statistics and model selection are used to identify main statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in synchrony. Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and previously unrecognized geography of synchrony for terrestrial vegetation. Some areas, such as the Sahara and Southern Africa, exhibited nearly perfect synchrony, whereas other areas, such as the Pacific coast of South America, showed very little synchrony. Spatial modelling provided the second main result, namely that synchrony in temperature and precipitation were major determinants of synchrony in EVI, supporting the presence of dual global Moran effects. These effects depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed, providing our third main result, namely that synchrony of EVI and its geography are time-scale specific. Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to document the geography of synchrony in terrestrial vegetation. We showed that geographical variation in synchrony is pronounced. We used geographical patterns to identify determinants of synchrony. This study is one of very few studies to demonstrate two separate synchronous environmental variables driving synchrony simultaneously. The geography of synchrony is apparently a major phenomenon that has been little explored.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				AUG	2017	26	8					878	888		10.1111/geb.12595								WOS:000405190600003

Satellite Remote Sensing for Coastal Management: A Review of Successful Applications	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Management of coastal and marine natural resources presents a number of challenges as a growing global population and a changing climate require us to find better strategies to conserve the resources on which our health, economy, and overall well-being depend. To evaluate the status and trends in changing coastal resources over larger areas, managers in government agencies and private stakeholders around the world have increasingly turned to remote sensing technologies. A surge in collaborative and innovative efforts between resource managers, academic researchers, and industry partners is becoming increasingly vital to keep pace with evolving changes of our natural resources. Synoptic capabilities of remote sensing techniques allow assessments that are impossible to do with traditional methods. Sixty years of remote sensing research have paved the way for resource management applications, but uncertainties regarding the use of this technology have hampered its use in management fields. Here we review examples of remote sensing applications in the sectors of coral reefs, wetlands, water quality, public health, and fisheries and aquaculture that have successfully contributed to management and decision-making goals.

Hyperspectral remote sensing imagery combined with field validation were used to map and characterise the 300-km coast including shore type, land cover and vehicle track footprint. Adjacent to Ningaloo Marine Park, only sparse coastal vegetation cover was present. However, there exists an extensive (1256 km) vehicle track network with the highest densities near accommodation nodes and sandy beaches (over 65% of tracks). Areas managed for conservation had fewer tracks and the lowest track density (0.3 km/km(2)) compared to pastoral stations (similar to 1.9 km/km(2)). The cumulative lengths of tracks were highest on pastoral stations used for livestock grazing, coastal access and camping (945 km out of the total of 1256 km of tracks). The fragility of the arid landscape and this assessment of off-road vehicle impact obtained through detailed mapping of tracks indicate the need for management measures to mitigate the damage and cope with the increasing numbers of visitors.

Discriminating the biophysical impacts of coastal upwelling and mud banks along the southwest coast of India	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Coastal upwelling and mud banks are two oceanographic processes concurrently operating along certain stretches of the southwest (Kerala) coast of India during the Southwest Monsoon period (June-September), facilitating significant enhancement in plankton biomass. Mud banks have scientific and societal attention from time immemorial, predominantly due to the large fisheries associated with them. In this paper, for the first time, the specific biophysical roles of these oceanographic processes have been discriminated, based on a focused 18 weeldy/fortnightly time-series study (April to September 2014) in a mud bank-upwelling area (off Alappuzha, southwest coast of India). In conjunction with standard hydrographical and satellite remote sensing data, we utilised a FlowCAM to track the biophysical linkage in terms of plankton composition abundance and size structure at three locations (Ml, M2 and M3) in the study area. During the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (April-May), the entire study area was warmer with low nitrate concentration in the surface waters, which caused lower biomass of autotrophs compared to the Southwest Monsoon (June-September). By the onset of the Southwest Monsoon (June), drastic hydrographical transformations took place in the study domain due to the Coastal upwelling, reflected as the surfacing of significantly cool, high nutrient and hypoxic waters. Concurrently, mud bank formed at location M2 due to the presence of relatively high-suspended sediments in the region, creating a localised calm environment conducive for fishing activities. In response to the hydrographical transformations in the entire study area during the Southwest Monsoon, the autotrophic plankton biomass and size structure experienced significant change. The micro-autotrophs biomass that was low during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (av. 0.33 +/- 02 mgCL(-1) at surface and av. 0.07 +/- 0.04 mgC L-1 at subsurface) noticeably increased during the Southwest Monsoon (av. 1.6 +/- 0.4 mgC L-1 at surface and av. 13 +/- 02 mgC L-1 at subsurface). The seasonal mean bio-volume of micro-autotrophs followed the same pattern in all three locations with the dominance of smaller individuals during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (av. 55 +/- 4.4 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at surface and av. 67.1 +/- 38.4 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at subsurface). Relatively large phytoplankton dominated during the Southwest Monsoon (av. 77.3 +/- 5.5 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at surface and av. 903 +/- 4.9 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at subsurface). Similar spatial change in the plankton composition, biomass and size structure in all three locations suggested the dominant role of coastal upwelling, and not the mud bank, in shaping the dominant autotrophic plankton in the study domain. The nutrient enrichment in the region associated with the coastal upwelling facilitated the predominance of a classical short food chain capable of supporting large fish stocks. In addition to relatively calm mud bank, the hypoxic, cool upwelled waters that existed in the subsurface induce the fish stock to concentrate in the surface waters, making the relatively calm mud bank and adjoining areas a rich fishing ground for the native fishers.

Both branches eventually contribute to the greater Agulhas Current system and thus play a part in the global ocean circulation. In addition, these currents have important effects on the local conditions for marine life. In this study, the NEMC and the SEMC are investigated based on a comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey of the east coast of Madagascar in 2008. Results from conductivity-temperature-depth stations, underway measurements with thermosalinograph and fluorometer, and ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler are discussed along with concomitant remotely sensed data. Maximum core velocities of > 150 cm s(-1) were observed in both the NEMC and the SEMC. The SEMC appeared as a nearshore southward jet, which extended at its widest nearly 200 km offshore. Near the southern tip of Madagascar, the SEMC was flanked by reverse velocities: a northeastward current about 30 km wide along the coast and a northeastward offshore current greater than 140 km wide suggesting the presence of the South Indian Ocean Countercurrent. The NEMC had the structure of a narrow nearshore jet, with weak currents beyond 100 km offshore. Volume transport for the upper 1,100 m was estimated to be 22 Sverdrup (Sv) for the SEMC and 48 Sv for the NEMC. The high NEMC transport compared with earlier estimates might be because of anomalously high influx of the SEC during the measurement period. Off the south coast, an undercurrent below 900 m carried an equatorward transport of 3.1 Sv. No undercurrent was observed in the north, but a geostrophic velocity minimum and a similar vertical velocity shear between surface and subsurface currents were found at the level where such a countercurrent has been previously observed from direct measurements.

Observations and tracking of killer whales (Orcinus orca) with shore-based X-band marine radar at a marine energy test site	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												The Atlantic killer whale (Orcinus orca) is a top-level marine predator with a global range, being found in all of Earth's oceans. The potential interaction between killer whales and marine renewable energy projects requires surveillance and monitoring efforts that call for new technologies, with marine radar showing promise in the field. Marine radar images recorded at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) were used to track a pair of male killer whales undertaking Surface Active Behavior (SAB) with visual observations used as validation. Using a tidal prediction model, the tide-adjusted, radar-derived target speeds between SAB events provide estimates of swim speeds averaging 4 m/s and time between SAB events of 30 s. The similarities between the radar signatures of the animals and sea clutter, combined with their low occurrence compared to other imaged phenomena renders automatic detection with this system difficult. However, the combination of opportunistic radar imagery and independent visual observation has allowed the radar signature of one form of killer whale SAB to be documented. It is hoped that with a greater number of validated observations such as these that automated, radar-based identification and the benefits it will bring to long-term observations at MRE sites will be possible.

J	Yu, FJ; Sun, WZ; Li, JJ; Zhao, Y; Zhang, YM; Chen, G				Yu, Fangjie; Sun, Wuzi; Li, Jiaojiao; Zhao, Yang; Zhang, Yanmin; Chen, Ge			An improved Otsu method for oil spill detection from SAR images	OCEANOLOGIA												In recent years, oil spill accidents have become increasingly frequent due to the development of marine transportation and massive oil exploitation. At present, satellite remote sensing is the principal method used to monitor oil spills. Extracting the locations and extent of oil spill spots accurately in remote sensing images reaps significant benefits in terms of risk assessment and clean-up work. Nowadays the method of edge detection combined with threshold segmentation (EDCTS) to extract oil information is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current method has some limitations in terms of accurately extracting oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, where heterogeneous background noise exists. In this study, we propose an adaptive mechanism based on Otsu method, which applies region growing combined with both edge detection and threshold segmentation (RGEDOM) to extract oil spills. Remote sensing images from the Bohai Sea on June 11, 2011 and the Gulf of Dalian on July 17, 2010 are utilized to validate the accuracy of our algorithm and the reliability of extraction results. In addition, results according to EDCTS are used as a comparator to further explore validity. The comparison with results according to EDCTS using the same dataset demonstrates that the proposed self-adapting algorithm is more robust and boasts high-accuracy. The accuracy computing by the adaptive algorithm is significantly improved compared with EDCTS and threshold method. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This study presented a new bottom-up and top-down visual saliency model. We used Landsat 8, GF-1, MAMS, HJ-1 oil spill imagery as dataset. A simplified, graph-based visual saliency model was used to extract bottom-up saliency. It could identify the regions with high visual saliency object in the ocean. A spectral similarity match model was used to obtain top-down saliency. It could distinguish oil regions and exclude the other salient interference by spectrums. The regions of interest containing oil spills were integrated using these complementary saliency detection steps. Then, the genetic neural network was used to complete the image classification. These steps increased the speed of analysis. For the test dataset, the average running time of the entire process to detect regions of interest was 204.56 s. During image segmentation, the oil spill was extracted using a genetic neural network. The classification results showed that the method had a low false-alarm rate (high accuracy of 91.42%) and was able to increase the speed of the detection process (fast runtime of 19.88 s). The test image dataset was composed of different types of features over large areas in complicated imaging conditions. The proposed model was proved to be robust in complex sea conditions.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				JUL	2017	73	1			SI		154	169		10.1007/s00244-016-0358-5								WOS:000405592600015	28695250					
J	Xu, WD; Yang, JT; Xu, ZZ				Xu Weidong; Yang Juntang; Xu Zhongze			The detection algorithm of irregular dynamic objects	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS												Using remote sensing data for marine monitoring, marine rescue, marine pollution monitoring which has a broad monitoring area and fast response time, so in the last 10 years, satellite borne or airborne optical and SAR sensor data have been increasingly used in the field of ocean monitoring. However, based on the dynamic video to carry out the study of the detection of irregular debris blocks from the wrecked ship, aircraft is less. To a great extent, it affects the efficiency of maritime rescue. This paper, based on the dynamic objects detection, Color Space Quantization and property of Human Vision System, takes the irregular wreckage patches as research. And a detection algorithm for dynamic objects is developed with the foundation of Lab channels. To verify that, the calculation of the Euclidean distance between the characteristic parameters of irregular wreckage patches and regular floating ones, and the average Euclidean distance is 0.8245 between the irregular1 and the regular while that between irregular2 and the regular is 4.3645. At the same time, the Hausdorff distance was calculated and verified, and the average distance between the irregular block 1 and the regular block was 2.5975. The average distance between the block 2 and the rule block was 13.8962. Experimental results show that the method is consistent with the results of the second methods, which proves that the first method is scientific and operational. Therefore, it can be found that some parameters including divergence, elongation and eccentricity fluctuate dramatically from those in irregular ones to the regular one, which could be extracted to recognize or distinguish the patches. That is why this paper is of importance in marine rescue and detection of objects on the sea surface.																	1380-7501	1573-7721				JUL	2017	76	13					14599	14615		10.1007/s11042-016-3810-7								WOS:000403039400004

However, many factors, such as the oil type, slick thickness, sensor capability, and the background environment, can together have an impact on the remotely sensed thermal imagery. These cross-coupling effects can usually be clarified by ground-based experiments. In this letter, four different types of oil slicks on water bodies were prepared and their brightness temperatures (BTs) measured periodically in an outdoor experiment. The results indicated that there are obvious differences in the BTs between the different types of oil, especially between crude and refined oil. Defined BT time-changing contrast coefficient of different type of oil slicks numerically displays these significant difference in different observed periods. These results imply that thermal sensors may be used to discern the type of oil slick and that time series of thermal observations will be able to help with oil-type detection in the future. Moreover, the optimal strategy is to make a series of observations covering the cooling period from noon (the optimal detection time) to around sunset.

Should management and conservation efforts fail to improve the quality of coastal ecosystems and the services they provide, they may be irrevocably damaged. A significant limitation to conservation efforts is often the ability to track change in seagrass meadows due to the significant time and cost of monitoring efforts in underwater habitats. Remote sensing is often a tool used to improve our knowledge of habitat status, however, ground-truthing remote sensing results is difficult when historical data is required. We apply an innovative and resourceful approach to the attainment of data to check the status of seagrass meadows from resources that are available in many areas due to the collection of other data sets. We employ the use of underwater digital photographs originally taken for monitoring sediment movement patterns. We were successfully able to develop a method to critically and easily evaluate these photographs for habitat status, enabling the generation of a data set unable to be obtained in other ways. This method can further be utilised in a citizen science project, for other underwater digital photographs, to support the assessment of coastal submerged ecosystem habitat status.																	0304-3770	1879-1522				JUL	2017	141						17	21		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.04.006								WOS:000404320800003

However, advanced three-dimensional (3D) ecosystem models, such as the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM), are computationally expensive, especially when implemented within an ensemble data assimilation system requiring several parallel integrations. As an alternative to 3D ecological forecasting systems, we propose to implement a set of regional one-dimensional (1D) water-column ecological models that run at a fraction of the computational cost. The 1D model domains are determined using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based clustering method and satellite chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data. Regionally averaged Chl-a data is assimilated into the 1D models using the singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter. To laterally exchange information between subregions and improve the forecasting skills, we introduce a new correction step to the assimilation scheme, in which we assimilate a statistical forecast of future Chl-a observations based on information from neighbouring regions. We apply this approach to the Red Sea and show that the assimilative 1D ecological models can forecast surface Chl-a concentration with high accuracy. The statistical assimilation step further improves the forecasting skill by as much as 50%. This general approach of clustering large marine areas and running several interacting 1D ecological models is very flexible. It allows many combinations of clustering, filtering and regression technics to be used and can be applied to build efficient forecasting systems in other large marine ecosystems.																	1616-7341	1616-7228				JUL	2017	67	7					935	947		10.1007/s10236-017-1065-0								WOS:000403461600007

Linkages between benthic assemblages and physical environmental factors: The role of geodiversity in Eastern Gulf of Finland ecosystems	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												We analyzed hydrology, geology and benthic species composition to determine benthic habitat distribution patterns in a geologically complex area of the Gulf of Finland, Northern Baltic Sea. The analysis included several datasets describing coastal influence and geodiversity at multiple spatial scales. Geodiversity in this context refers to variation and/or patchiness of benthic substrates and seabed features. Multivariate statistical methods including BEST and LINKTREE routines were used to identify correlative relationships between different ecological variables. Environmental variables (e.g. water depth, Secchi depth, salinity) were either measured by sampling and remote sensing methods or parameterized from geographic and oceanographic data. Benthic assemblages were assayed by both video recordings and zoobenthic sampling (benthic grabs). Statistical analyses identified correlations between benthic datasets and environmental variables, but correlation parameters were not consistent especially with respect to differing zoobenthic and video-based estimates of benthic diversity. The ratio of Secchi depth to water depth showed strong correlation with species distributions observed in video recordings (rho = 0.56) whereas variables describing broad-scale geodiversity and archipelago gradient (the abundance of islands, ratio of land and sea area) correlated with zoobenthic sample data (generally rho > 0.30). A model that included independent variables of Secchi depth and terrain roughness within a 20 km radius explained the greatest proportion of spatial variation in zoobenthic sample data (rho = 0.69). Secchi depth and roughness values were positively correlated with species richness. We designated nine benthic marine landscapes on the basis of these two variables. Linkage tree statistical analysis (LINKTREE) routine utilized zoobenthic sample data as these offered better regional coverage and therefore effectively tracked relationships with other environmental variables. The benthic marine landscapes found in topographically complex seabed areas possessed higher species diversity than flatter areas with fewer seabed features. Our results indicate that on broad spatial scales, geodiversity and archipelago gradient directly influence benthic assemblages by providing a range of different habitats. These factors also indirectly influence benthic assemblages by channeling water movement and thereby distributing hydrologic conditions. This study demonstrates that broad-scale geodiversity should be considered in regional and mesoscale habitat mapping, maritime spatial planning and conservation policies.

J	Herkul, K; Peterson, A; Paekivi, S				Herkul, Kristjan; Peterson, Anneliis; Paekivi, Sander			Applying multibeam sonar and mathematical modeling for mapping seabed substrate and biota of offshore shallows	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												6 Both basic science and marine spatial planning are in a need of high resolution spatially continuous data on seabed habitats and biota. As conventional point-wise sampling is unable to cover large spatial extents in high detail, it must be supplemented with remote sensing and modeling in order to fulfill the scientific and management needs. The combined use of in situ sampling, sonar scanning, and mathematical modeling is becoming the main method for mapping both abiotic and biotic seabed features. Further development and testing of the methods in varying locations and environmental settings is essential for moving towards unified and generally accepted methodology. To fill the relevant research gap in the Baltic Sea, we used multibeam sonar and mathematical modeling methods generalized additive models (GAM) and random forest (RF) together with underwater video to map seabed substrate and epibenthos of offshore shallows. In addition to testing the general applicability of the proposed complex of techniques, the predictive power of different sonar-based variables and modeling algorithms were tested. Mean depth, followed by mean backscatter, were the most influential variables in most of the models. Generally, mean values of sonar-based variables had higher predictive power than their standard deviations. The predictive accuracy of RF was higher than that of GAM. To conclude, we found the method to be feasible and with predictive accuracy similar to previous studies of sonar-based mapping. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ocean surface partitioning strategies using ocean colour remote Sensing: A review	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The ocean surface is organized into regions with distinct properties reflecting the complexity of interactions between environmental forcing and biological responses. The delineation of these functional units, each with unique, homogeneous properties and underlying ecosystem structure and dynamics, can be defined as ocean surface partitioning. The main purposes and applications of ocean partitioning include the evaluation of particular marine environments; generation of more accurate satellite ocean colour products; assimilation of data into biogeochemical and climate models; and establishment of ecosystem-based management practices. This paper reviews the diverse approaches implemented for ocean surface partition into functional units, using ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) data, including their purposes, criteria, methods and scales. OCRS offers a synoptic, high spatial-temporal resolution, multi-decadal coverage of bio-optical properties, relevant to the applications and value of ocean surface partitioning. In combination with other biotic and/or abiotic data, OCRS-derived data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, optical properties) provide a broad and varied source of information that can be analysed using different delineation methods derived from subjective, expert-based to unsupervised learning approaches (e.g., cluster, fuzzy and empirical orthogonal function analyses). Partition schemes are applied at global to mesoscale spatial coverage, with static (time-invariant) or dynamic (time-varying) representations. A case study, the highly heterogeneous area off SW Iberian Peninsula (NE Atlantic), illustrates how the selection of spatial coverage and temporal representation affects the discrimination of distinct environmental drivers of phytoplankton variability. Advances in operational oceanography and in the subject area of satellite ocean colour, including development of new sensors, algorithms and products, are among the potential benefits from extended use, scope and applications of ocean surface partitioning using OCRS.

J	Alikas, K; Kratzer, S				Alikas, Krista; Kratzer, Susanne			Improved retrieval of Secchi depth for optically-complex waters using remote sensing data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (Z(SD)) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution).The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CNOM)(442) ranging 1.7-4.0 m(-1)), Chl a concentration (0.5-73 mg m(-3)) and total suspended matter (0.7-37.5 g m(-3)) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < Z(SD) < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R-2). The accuracy increased (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when Z(SD) was retrieved via an empirical relationship between Z(SD) and K-d (490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when Z(SD) was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived Z(SD) product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The site is affected by local emissions and long-range transport, as portrayed by the aerosol size, hygroscopicity and mixing state. Application of a state-of-the-art droplet parameterization is used to link the observed size distribution measurements, bulk composition, and modeled boundary layer dynamics with potential supersaturation, droplet number, and sensitivity of these parameters for clouds forming above the site. The sensitivity is then used to understand the source of potential droplet number variability. We find that the importance of aerosol particle concentration levels associated with the background increases as vertical velocities increase. The updraft velocity variability was found to contribute 58-90% (68.6% on average) to the variance of the cloud droplet number, followed by the variance in aerosol number (6-32%, average 23.2%). Therefore, although local sources may strongly modulate CCN concentrations, their impact on droplet number is limited by the atmospheric dynamics expressed by the updraft velocity regime.

Ship navigation benefits from up-to-date sea ice analyses at both regional and local scales. This study presents a satellite-based sea ice navigation system (SatSINS) that integrates observations and scientific output from remote sensing and meteorological data to develop optimum marine navigational routes in sea ice-covered waters, especially in areas where operational ice information is usually scarce. The system and its applications are presented in the context of a decision-making process to optimize the routing of the RV Xuelong during her passage through Prydz Bay, East Antarctica during three trips in the austral spring of 2011-2013. The study assesses scientifically-generated remote sensing ice parameters for their operational use in marine navigation. Evaluation criteria involve identification of priority parameters, their spatio-temporal requirements in relation to navigational needs, and their level of accuracy in conjunction with the severity of ice conditions. Coarse-resolution ice concentration maps are sufficient to delineate ice edge and develop a safe route when ice concentration is less than 70%, provided that ice dynamics, estimated from examining the cyclonic pattern, is not severe. Otherwise, fine-resolution radar data should be used to identify and avoid deformed ice. Satellite data lagging one day behind the actual location of the ship was sufficient in most cases although the proposed route may have to be adjusted. To evaluate the utility of SatSINS, deviation of the actual route from the proposed route was calculated and found to range between 165 m to about 16.0 km with standard deviations of 2.8-6.1 km. Growth of land-fast ice has proven to be an essential component of the system as it was estimated using a thermodynamic model with input from a meteorological station.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							518	10.3390/rs9060518								WOS:000404623900009						
J	Mo, Y; Kearney, MS; Riter, JCA				Mo, Yu; Kearney, Michael S.; Riter, J. C. Alexis			Post-Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Monitoring of Louisiana Salt Marshes Using Landsat Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the second largest marine oil spill in history, contaminated over a thousand kilometers of coastline in the Louisiana salt marshes and seriously threatened this valuable ecosystem. Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							547	10.3390/rs9060547								WOS:000404623900038

This study researched the change in coastline and sea area of the Bohai Sea, China, over a 30-year period using Landsat TM and OLI remote sensing data. The total change in coastline length, sea area, and the centroid of the sea surface were quantified. Variations in the coastline morphology were measured using four shape indexes: fractal dimension, compact ratio, circularity, and square degree. Equations describing fit of the shape index, coastline length, and marine area were built. Then the marine area 10 years later was predicted using the model that had the highest prediction accuracy. The results showed that the highest prediction accuracy for the coastline length was obtained using a compound function. When a cubic function was used to predict the compact ratio, then the highest prediction accuracy was obtained using this compact ratio and a quadratic function to predict sea area. This study can provide theoretical support for the coastal development planning and ecological environment protection around the Bohai Sea.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							900	10.3390/su9060900								WOS:000404133200031

One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993-2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.

Coastal zones that are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic development have experienced substantial declines in seagrass abundance around the world. Australia, which has some of the world's largest seagrass meadows and is home to over half of the known species, is not immune to these losses. In 1999 a review of seagrass ecosystems knowledge was conducted in Australia and strategic research priorities were developed to provide research direction for future studies and management. Subsequent rapid evolution of seagrass research and scientific methods has led to more than 70% of peer reviewed seagrass literature being produced since that time. A workshop was held as part of the Australian Marine Sciences Association conference in July 2015 in Geelong, Victoria, to update and redefine strategic priorities in seagrass research. Participants identified 40 research questions from 10 research fields (taxonomy and systematics, physiology, population biology, sediment biogeochemistry and microbiology, ecosystem function, faunal habitats, threats, rehabilitation and restoration, mapping and monitoring, management tools) as priorities for future research on Australian seagrasses. Progress in research will rely on advances in areas such as remote sensing, genomic tools, microsensors, computer modeling, and statistical analyses. A more interdisciplinary approach will be needed to facilitate greater understanding of the complex interactions among seagrasses and their environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tao, Z; Ma, S; Yang, XF; Wang, Y				Tao, Zui; Ma, Sheng; Yang, Xiaofeng; Wang, Yan			Assessing the uncertainties of phytoplankton absorption-based model estimates of marine net primary productivity	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Satellite-derived phytoplankton pigment absorption (a (ph)) has been used as a key predictor of phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency to estimate global ocean net primary production (NPP). In this study, an a (ph)-based NPP model (AbPM) with four input parameters including the photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), diffuse attenuation at 490 nm (K (d)(490)), euphotic zone depth (Z (eu)) and the phytoplankton pigment absorption coefficient (a (ph)) is compared with the chlorophyll-based model and carbon-based model. It is found that the AbPM has significant advantages on the ocean NPP estimation compared with the chlorophyll-based model and carbonbased model. For example, AbPM greatly outperformed the other two models at most monitoring sites and had the best accuracy, including the smallest values of RMSD and bias for the NPP estimate, and the best correlation between the observations and the modeled NPPs. In order to ensure the robustness of the model, the uncertainty in NPP estimates of the AbPM was assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation. At first, the frequency histograms of simple difference (delta), and logarithmic difference (delta (LOG)) between model estimates and in situ data confirm that the two input parameters (Z (eu) and PAR) approximate the Normal Distribution, and another two input parameters (a (ph) and K (d)(490)) approximate the logarithmic Normal Distribution. Second, the uncertainty in NPP estimates in the AbPM was assessed by using the Monte Carlo simulation. Here both the PB (percentage bias), defined as the ratio of Delta NPP to the retrieved NPP, and the CV (coefficient of variation), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean are used to indicate the uncertainty in the NPP brought by input parameter to AbPM model. The uncertainty related to magnitude is denoted by PB and the uncertainty related to scatter range is denoted by CV. Our investigations demonstrate that PB of NPP uncertainty brought by all parameters with an annual mean of 5.5% covered a range of-5%-15% for the global ocean. The PB uncertainty of AbPM model was mainly caused by a (ph); the PB of NPP uncertainty brought by a (ph) had an annual mean of 4.1% for the global ocean. The CV brought by all the parameters with an annual mean of 105% covered a range of 98%-134% for global ocean. For the coastal zone of Antarctica with higher productivity, the PB and CV of NPP uncertainty brought by all parameters had annual means of 7.1% and 121%, respectively, which are significantly larger than those obtained in the global ocean. This study suggests that the NPPs estimated by AbPM model are more accurate than others, but the magnitude and scatter range of NPP errors brought by input parameter to AbPM model could not be neglected, especially in the coastal area with high productivity. So the improving accuracy of satellite retrieval of input parameters should be necessary. The investigation also confirmed that the SST related correction is effective for improving the model accuracy in low temperature condition.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUN	2017	36	6					112	121		10.1007/s13131-017-1047-8								WOS:000401505800013						
J	Liao, XH; Xue, CJ; Su, FZ				Liao, Xiaohan; Xue, Cunjin; Su, Fenzhen			Tree-based approach for exploring marine spatial patterns with raster datasets	PLOS ONE												From multiple raster datasets to spatial association patterns, the data-mining technique is divided into three subtasks, i.e., raster dataset pretreatment, mining algorithm design, and spatial pattern exploration from the mining results. Comparison with the former two subtasks reveals that the latter remains unresolved. Confronted with the interrelated marine environmental parameters, we propose a Tree-based Approach for eXploring Marine Spatial Patterns with multiple raster datasets called TAXMarSP, which includes two models. One is the Tree-based Cascading Organization Model (TCOM), and the other is the Spatial Neighborhood-based CAlculation Model (SNCAM). TCOM designs the "Spatial node -> Pattern node" from top to bottom layers to store the table-formatted frequent patterns. Together with TCOM, SNCAM considers the spatial neighborhood contributions to calculate the pattern-matching degree between the specified marine parameters and the table-formatted frequent patterns and then explores the marine spatial patterns. Using the prevalent quantification Apriori algorithm and a real remote sensing dataset from January 1998 to December 2014, a successful application of TAXMarSP to marine spatial patterns in the Pacific Ocean is described, and the obtained marine spatial patterns present not only the well-known but also new patterns to Earth scientists.																	1932-6203					MAY 16	2017	12	5							e0177438	10.1371/journal.pone.0177438								WOS:000401485500030	28510602

Application of marine radar to monitoring seasonal and event-based changes in intertidal morphology	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper demonstrates the application of marine radar and a newly developed waterline mapping technique to the continued surveillance and monitoring of inter- and intra-annual intertidal morphological change, thus capturing new detail on coastal system behaviours. Marine radar data from 2006 to 2009 are used to create a sequence of waterline elevation surveys that show clear morphological evolution of two different sites in the Dee estuary, UK. An estimate of volumetric change was made at two locations: West Hoyle sandbank and the NW Wirral beach. Both sites exhibited a similar cyclic pattern of volumetric change, with lowest volumes in autumn and winter, respectively. The average beach elevations above Admiralty Chart Datum clearly reflect the observed change in sediment volume, with reduced elevations in winter and increased elevations in summer, suggesting a trend of high-energy storm waves in autumn and winter that remove sediment and simultaneously moderate the vertical dimension of bedforms in the intertidal area. Data at this temporal and spatial scale are not easily obtainable by other current remote sensing techniques. The use of marine radar as a tool for quantifying coastal change over seasonal and event timescales in complex hydrodynamic settings is illustrated. Specifically, its unique application to monitoring areas with dynamic morphology or that is vulnerable to erosion and/or degradation by storm events is exemplified. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Large-scale coastal land reclamation can have adverse effects on the coastal environment, including loss of marine habitats and deterioration of coastal water quality. In recent decades, coastal land reclamation has occurred extensively to meet the increasing needs of rapid economic development and urbanization in China. The overall objective of this study is to understand the coastal reclamation status of China from 1979 to 2014 and analyzed its driving factors for mitigating negative ecological effects. The data of coastal reclamation were done with the ERDAS Imagine V9.2 platform and ArcGIS software based on remote images including Landsat, SPOT, ZY-2 and ZY-3. Potential driving factors for sea reclamation were selected based on statistics bulletins and the knowledge of experts in coastal management. In order to understand the relationships among possible impact factors and coastal reclamation, the Partial Least-Squares Regression models was constructed. The analysis results indicated that the total area of reclamation was 11162.89 km(2) based on remote sensing images between 1979 and 2014. Shandong Province is the largest reclamation area, reaching 2736.54 km(2), and the reclamation is mainly concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning, where the reclamation areas were all more than 1000 km(2). According to the remote sensing images, there are three coastal reclamation hotspot regions including Bohai bay (in which is located Liaoning, Tianjin and Hebei), Jiangsu province coastal area and Hangzhou bay (in Zhejiang province). A large scale land reclamation plan of more than 5880 km(2) has been made by local government and 2469 km(2) has approved by the State Council. From the analyzed results, there is a significant collinearity between these indicators, and no significant correlation between the area of reclamation and selected indicators. Economic development and employees in marine industries have weak positive correlation and correspondingly, the area of cultivated land (ACL) had a negative correlation. Because of the weak correlation, there is an assumption that economic development, outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth were not only was the direct driving factor, but also the outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth was not the direct driving indicator. Construction land quota and huge economic returns to local government may be the direct driving factors according to our field investigation. To resolve the contradiction between the need for land and coastal wetland conservation, it is recommended that China should establish a special management agency and coordination mechanisms, reconsidered the implementation of the reclamation plans and projects that have been approved, enhance law enforcement and increase penalties and strengthen public participation in reclamation management.

Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Southern California Bight (SCB), resulting from untreated runoff and pollutants from urban watersheds entering the coastal waters after rainstorms. We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery. A conceptual satellite stormwater runoff monitoring approach is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results showed that spectral absorption signatures of multiple species can be extracted from mixed assemblages, even at low relative contributions. Errors in retrieved pigment abundances are, however, influenced by the co-occurrence of species with similar spectral features. Plasticity of absorption spectra due to changes in light conditions weakly affects interspecific differences, with errors <21% for retrievals of pigment concentrations from mixed assemblages.

Variability in the mechanisms controlling Southern Ocean phytoplankton bloom phenology in an ocean model and satellite observations	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												A coupled global numerical simulation (conducted with the Community Earth System Model) is used in conjunction with satellite remote sensing observations to examine the role of top-down (grazing pressure) and bottom-up (light, nutrients) controls on marine phytoplankton bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean. Phytoplankton seasonal phenology is evaluated in the context of the recently proposed "disturbance-recovery" hypothesis relative to more traditional, exclusively "bottom-up" frameworks. All blooms occur when phytoplankton division rates exceed loss rates to permit sustained net population growth; however, the nature of this decoupling period varies regionally in Community Earth System Model. Regional case studies illustrate how unique pathways allow blooms to emerge despite very poor division rates or very strong grazing rates. In the Subantarctic, southeast Pacific small spring blooms initiate early cooccurring with deep mixing and low division rates, consistent with the disturbance-recovery hypothesis. Similar systematics are present in the Subantarctic, southwest Atlantic during the spring but are eclipsed by a subsequent, larger summer bloom that is coincident with shallow mixing and the annual maximum in division rates, consistent with a bottom-up, light limited framework. In the model simulation, increased iron stress prevents a similar summer bloom in the southeast Pacific. In the simulated Antarctic zone (70 degrees S-65 degrees S) seasonal sea ice acts as a dominant phytoplankton-zooplankton decoupling agent, triggering a delayed but substantial bloom as ice recedes. Satellite ocean color remote sensing and ocean physical reanalysis products do not precisely match model-predicted phenology, but observed patterns do indicate regional variability in mechanism across the Atlantic and Pacific.

As traditional methods face great challenges in analyzing which, how and where marine parameters change when ENSO events occur, we propose an ENSO-oriented marine spatial association pattern (EOMSAP) mining algorithm for dealing with multiple long-term raster-formatted datasets. EOMSAP consists of four key steps. The first quantifies the abnormal variations of marine parameters into three levels using the mean-standard deviation criteria of time series; the second categorizes La Nina events, neutral conditions, or El Nino events using an ENSO index; then, the EOMSAP designs a linking-pruning-generating recursive loop to generate (m + 1)-candidate association patterns from an m-dimensional one by combining a user-specified support with a conditional support; and the fourth generates strong association patterns according to the user-specified evaluation indicators. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of EOMSAP, we present two case studies with real remote sensing datasets from January 1998 to December 2012: one considers performance analysis relative to the ENSO-Apriori and Apriori methods; and the other identifies marine spatial association patterns within the Pacific Ocean.																	2220-9964					MAY	2017	6	5							139	10.3390/ijgi6050139								WOS:000404525500014

Predictions from species distribution models are available to parameterize the environmental characteristics that influence the biology, range, and habitats of the species of interest. This study used generalized additive models (GAMs) fitted to two spatiotemporal fishery data sources, namely 1 degrees spatial grid and observer record longline fishery data from 2006 to 2010, to investigate the relationship between catch rates of yellowfin tuna and oceanographic conditions by using multispectral satellite images and to develop a habitat preference model. The results revealed that the cumulative deviances obtained using the selected GAMs were 33.6% and 16.5% in the 1 degrees spatial grid and observer record data, respectively. The environmental factors in the study were significant in the selected GAMs, and sea surface temperature explained the highest deviance. The results suggest that areas with a higher sea surface temperature, a sea surface height anomaly of approximately 10.0 to 20 cm, and a chlorophyll-a concentration of approximately 0.05-0.25 mg/m(3) yield higher catch rates of yellowfin tuna. The 1 degrees spatial grid data had higher cumulative deviances, and the predicted relative catch rates also exhibited a high correlation with observed catch rates. However, the maps of observer record data showed the high-quality spatial resolutions of the predicted relative catch rates in the close-view maps. Thus, these results suggest that models of catch rates of the 1 degrees spatial grid data that incorporate relevant environmental variables can be used to infer possible responses in the distribution of highly migratory species, and the observer record data can be used to detect subtle changes in the target fishing grounds.

Based on these data, we tested whether patterns in macroalgal diversity and distribution along European intertidal rocky shores could be explained by a set of meteo-oceanographic variables. The variables considered were salinity, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, significant wave height and tidal range and were compiled from three different sources: remote sensing, reanalysis technique and in situ measurement. These variables were parameterized to represent average conditions (mean values), variability (standard deviation) and extreme events (minimum and maximum values). The results obtained in this study contribute to reinforce the EMBOS network approach and highlight the necessity of considering meteo-oceanographic variables in long-term assessments. The broad spatial distribution of pilot sites has allowed identification of latitudinal and longitudinal gradients manifested through species composition, diversity and dominance structure of intertidal macroalgae. These patterns follow a latitudinal gradient mainly explained by sea surface temperature, but also by photosynthetically active radiation, salinity and tidal range. Additionally, a longitudinal gradient was also detected and could be linked to wave height.

Fertilization and connectivity in the Garrucha Canyon (SE-Spain) implications for Marine Spatial Planning	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Marine Spatial Planning is usually based on benthic georeferenced information or GPS tracked human activities, whereas the pelagic ecosystem is often ignored because of scarce and limited surface information. However, the 3-D pelagic ecosystem plays a key role connecting all the other ecosystems by physical (currents) and biological (migration) processes. According to remote sensing the Garrucha Canyon is oligotrophic, but 3-D sampling reveals subsurface upwelling, and converts it into the richest area around the Cape of Gata. Vertical connectivity by means of zooplankton migration, measured at two sampling stations, is 40 and 220 times faster than microphytoplankton settling and vertical water velocities respectively. Thus coupled physical-biological connectivity models are necessary to estimate the ecosystem connection and the fate of carbon, but also other substances (e.g. radioactivity), that might accumulate throughout the food-web. This is especially important in the Garrucha Canyon and the Coastal Areas Management Programme Levante de Almeria where natural heritage and extractive fishery are important for the local economy.

J	Pufahl, PK; Groat, LA				Pufahl, Peir K.; Groat, Lee A.			Sedimentary and Igneous Phosphate Deposits: Formation and Exploration: An Invited Paper	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												Phosphorus is the central ingredient in fertilizer that allows modern agriculture to feed the world's population. This element, also critical in a host of industrial applications, is a nonrenewable resource that is sourced primarily from the phosphatic mineral apatite, hosted in sedimentary and igneous ores. World phosphate resources are estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey at ca. 300,000 Mt, of which 95% are sedimentary and 5% are igneous. Current known USGS reserve estimates are sufficient for a maximum of 200 to 300 years; the exploration and discovery of new resources, enhanced mining technologies, and new technologies aimed at the recovery and recycling of P from sewage and agricultural runoff will all contribute to extending P production. Igneous ores are generally associated with Phanerozoic carbonatites and silica-deficient alkalic intrusions that typically average 5 to 15 wt % P2O5, which can be beneficiated to high-grade concentrates of at least 30 wt % P2O5 with few contaminants. Carbonatites are typically the smallest and youngest parts of a carbonatite-alkaline rock complex that formed during fractional crystallization of a calcic parental alkaline silicate melt, or from liquid immiscibility of a carbonate-rich nephelinite that underwent magmatic fractionation and differentiation during ascent from the mantle source. Fluorapatite generally crystallizes early, near the liquidus, and over a small temperature interval below the apatite saturation temperature that varies strongly with temperature, SiO2 and CaO concentrations, and the aluminosity of the melt. Carbonatite-alkaline rock complexes commonly possess a concentric, zonal structure thought to reflect caldera volcanism. Pathfinder elements in soils, sediments, tills, and vegetation include Nb, rare earth elements (REEs), P, Ba, Sr, F, U, and Th, and in water, F, Th, and U are indicators. Remote sensing techniques with the ability to identify minerals rich in CO3, REEs, and Fe2+ that are characteristic of carbonatites are also important exploration tools that may provide vectors to ore. Sedimentary phosphorite is a marine bioelemental sedimentary rock that contains > 18 wt % P2O5. While small peritidal phosphorites formed in Precambrian coastal environments, economically significant upwelling-related phosphorite did not accumulate until the late Neoproterozoic and continued through the Phanerozoic. Coastal upwelling delivered deep, P-rich waters to continental shelves and in epeiric seas to drive phospho-genesis and form the largest phosphorites on Earth. High-grade deposits formed as a result of hydraulic concentration of phosphate grains to form granular beds with minimal gangue. The amalgamation of these beds into decameter-thick, stratiform ore zones is generally focused along the maximum flooding surface, which is a primary exploration target in upwelling-related phosphorite. In addition to P, other elements concentrated in igneous and sedimentary phosphorites are Se, Mo, Zn, Cu, and Cr, which are important agricultural micronutrients. Other saleable by-products include U and REEs. The U concentration in sedimentary phosphorite is generally between 50 and 200 ppm, but can be as high as 3,000 ppm, making it an increasingly important source of U for the nuclear industry. The concentration of REEs in some sedimentary phosphorites is comparable to the world's richest igneous and Chinese clay-type REE deposits. The source of the dissolved P in upwelling ocean water is ultimately derived from the chemical weathering of continental rocks, the process that links igneous and sedimentary phosphorites through time and space. The covarying temporal relationship of igneous and sedimentary deposits suggests that plate tectonics and the concentration of apatite in a progressively more felsic crust underpins the feedback processes regulating the biogeochemical cycling of P. Critical to the generation of greenfield exploration targets is the recognition that large P deposits emerged in the late Neoproterozoic. The geological environments conducive for exploration can be constrained from an understanding of ore-forming processes by the use of complementary petrological techniques, including fieldwork, petrography, sedimentology, sequence stratigraphy, and geochemistry.																	0361-0128	1554-0774				MAY	2017	112	3					483	516										WOS:000396747100001

Hansbreen is a grounded tidewater glacier in southern Spitsbergen, Svalbard, with a rich history of field and remote sensing observations. The available data make this glacier suitable for evaluating mechanisms and controls on calving, some of which are considered in this paper. We use a full-Stokes thermomechanical 2D flow model (Elmer/Ice), paired with a crevasse-depth calving criterion, to estimate Hansbreen's front position at a weekly time resolution. The basal sliding coefficient is re-calibrated every 4 weeks by solving an inverse model. We investigate the possible role of backpressure at the front (a function of ice melange concentration) and the depth of water filling crevasses by examining the model's ability to reproduce the observed seasonal cycles of terminus advance and retreat. Our results suggest that the ice-melange pressure plays an important role in the seasonal advance and retreat of the ice front, and that the crevasse-depth calving criterion, when driven by modeled surface meltwater, closely replicates observed variations in terminus position. These results suggest that tidewater glacier behavior is influenced by both oceanic and atmospheric processes, and that neither of them should be ignored.																	2296-6463					APR 25	2017	5								UNSP 29	10.3389/feart.2017.00029								WOS:000419324600001						
J	Uslu, FS				Uslu, Faruk Sukru			Kernel parameter variation-based selective ensemble support vector data description for oil spill detection on the ocean via hyperspectral imaging	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Oil spills on the ocean surface cause serious environmental, political, and economic problems. Therefore, these catastrophic threats to marine ecosystems require detection and monitoring. Hyperspectral sensors are powerful optical sensors used for oil spill detection with the help of detailed spectral information of materials. However, huge amounts of data in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) require fast and accurate computation methods for detection problems. Support vector data description (SVDD) is one of the most suitable methods for detection, especially for large data sets. Nevertheless, the selection of kernel parameters is one of the main problems in SVDD. This paper presents a method, inspired by ensemble learning, for improving performance of SVDD without tuning its kernel parameters. Additionally, a classifier selection technique is proposed to get more gain. The proposed approach also aims to solve the small sample size problem, which is very important for processing high-dimensional data in HSI. The algorithm is applied to two HSI data sets for detection problems. In the first HSI data set, various targets are detected; in the second HSI data set, oil spill detection in situ is realized. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and performance improvement of the proposed algorithm for oil spill detection problems.

This system exhibits strong seasonality in phytoplankton community composition and wide gradients of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), properties which are poorly handled by existing remote sensing algorithms. Absorption and scattering properties of particulate matter reflected the seasonality in biological (phytoplankton succession) and physical (thermal stratification) processes. Inherent optical properties showed much wider variability when normalized to the chlorophyll-a concentration compared to normalization to either total suspended matter dry weight or particulate organic carbon. The particle population had the largest optical variability in summer and was dominated by organic matter in both seasons. The geographic variability of CDOM and relationships with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are also presented. CDOM dominated light absorption at blue wavelengths, contributing 81% (median) of the absorption by all water constituents at 400 nm and 63% at 442 nm. Consequentially, 90% of water-leaving radiance at 412 nm originated from a layer (z(90)) no deeper than approximately 1.0 m. With water increasingly attenuating light at longer wavelengths, a green peak in light penetration and reflectance is always present in these waters, with z(90) up to 3.0-3.5 m depth, whereas z(90) only exceeds < 5 m at biomass < 5 mg Chla m(-3). High absorption combined with a weakly scattering particle population (despite median phytoplankton biomass of 14.1 and 4.3 mg Chla m(-3) in spring and summer samples, respectively), characterize this sea as a dark water body for which dedicated or exceptionally robust remote sensing techniques are required. Seasonal and regional optical-biogeochemical models, data distributions, and an extensive set of simulated remote-sensing reflectance spectra for testing of remote sensing algorithms are provided as supplementary data.

J	Zhao, Y; Cai, L; Li, XG; Lu, RQ				Zhao Yong; Cai Lu; Li Xue-Gang; Lu Ri-Qing			A modal interferometer based on single mode fiber-hollow core fiber-single mode fiber structure filled with alcohol and magnetic fluid for simultaneously measuring magnetic field and temperature	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA												In many fields, such as aerospace and marine environmental monitoring, magnetic field measurement is an important link. In recent years, optical fiber magnetic field sensor has received much attention because of its advantages such as small size, electromagnetic immunity, resistance to erosion and capability of remote sensing. In that case, magnetic fluid as a kind of medium between photons and magnetic field is widely used in optical fiber magnetic field sensors. Moreover, in the process of magnetic field measurement, disturbance introduced by temperature fluctuation always happens and brings uncertainty to the sensor. Temperature is also an important parameter in production process and needs to be measured. Therefore, designing a high-sensitive optical fiber sensor for simultaneously measuring magnetic field and temperature is a valuable work. In this paper, we present a high-sensitive hollow core fiber (HCF) interferometer for simultaneously measuring magnetic field and temperature. A segment of HCF filled with alcohol is inserted into single mode fiber (SMF) with 50 mu m offset at two splicing joints to guide light into the wall of HCF. And then this SMF-HCF-SMF structure is packaged by a capillary tube with full magnetic fluid (MF) inside it. Since the modal field area is large enough, the silica wall can support a series of guiding modes among which modal interference occurs and the interference spectrum can be recorded by an optical spectrum analyzer. Besides thermo-optic effect and thermal expansion effect of silica itself, the RI variations caused by thermo-optic effect of alcohol and MF as well as the magneto-optic effect of MF can also cause the phase difference of the guiding modes to change, thereby rendering interference dips movable. Thus, the sensitivity of temperature or magnetic field is higher than those given in some other previous studies. In addition, it is calculated that the effective RI sensitivities of guiding modes for inside and outside liquid are different because of the peculiar non-circular symmetry structure of HCF. So there is a possibility to find two dips in interference spectrum, which are formed with different modes and have various sensitivities to the variations of temperature and magnetic field. Finally, a sensitivity matrix can be built to demodulate those two parameters simultaneously. Experimental results show that within 20-58 degrees C, the temperature sensitivities are 112 pm/degrees C and 468 pm/degrees C for dip1 and dip 2 whose magnetic field sensitivities are 37 pm/Oe and 82 pm/Oe within 0-169 Oe, respectively. The proposed sensor possesses high sensitivity and good mechanical strength, and can effectively eliminate the cross disturbances between temperature and magnetic field.																	1000-3290					APR 5	2017	66	7							070601	10.7498/aps.66.070601								WOS:000412898500001

Standard techniques to study the ocean temperature in situ are, however, particularly limited by their time and spatial coverage, problems which might be partially mitigated by using marine top predators as biological platforms for oceanographic sampling. We used small archival tags deployed on 33 Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), and obtained 21,070 geo-localized profiles of water temperature, during late spring of 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013; in a region of the North Patagonian Sea with limited oceanographic records in situ. We compared our in situ data of sea surface temperature (SST) with those available from satellite remote sensing; to describe the three-dimensional temperature fields around the area of influence of two important tidal frontal systems; and to study the inter-annual variation in the three-dimensional temperature fields. There was a strong positive relationship between satellite- and animal-derived SST data although there was an overestimation by remote-sensing by a maximum difference of +2 degrees C. Little inter-annual variability in the 3-dimensional temperature fields was found, with the exception of 2012 (and to a lesser extent in 2013) where the SST was significantly higher. In 2013, we found weak stratification in a region which was unexpected. In addition, during the same year, a warm small-scale vortex is indicated by the animal-derived temperature data. This allowed us to describe and better understand the dynamics of the water masses, which, so far, have been mainly studied by remote sensors and numerical models. Our results highlight again the potential of using marine top predators as biological platforms to collect oceanographic data, which will enhance and accelerate studies on the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. In a changing world, threatened by climate change, it is urgent to fill information gaps on the coupled ocean-atmosphere system allowing to link the hydrothermal process to the at-sea distribution of top predators.

The area-to-mass ratio and fractal dimension of marine flocs	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Optical instruments have proved invaluable in the study of suspended matter in the sea but the measurements they provide are more closely related to the cross-sectional area of the particles in suspension than the mass measured by filtration or predicted by theory. In this paper, we examine the factors controlling the relationship between particle area and mass, using the fractal model of particle structure as a theoretical framework. Both theory and observation agree that the area-to-mass ratio of particles (symbol A*) decreases with increasing fractal dimension (symbol Nf) as particles hide behind each other in compact flocs. The equation A* = 0.253-0.081Nf, in which A* is in m(2) g(-1) explains 81% of the variance in the area:mass ratio at 151 stations in coastal waters. In contrast, the effect of floc size on A* is small. Three optical parameters beam attenuation, diffuse attenuation and remote sensing reflectance, expressed per unit mass of suspended material, all decrease with increasing Nf. As our understanding of the flocculation process grows and it becomes possible to predict the fractal dimension of particles as a function of the environmental conditions in which the flocs form, these results will lead to improved calibration of optical instruments in terms of the mass concentration of suspended materials and to better models of sediment suspension and transport.

On the use of optical remote sensing to assess phytoplankton biomass dynamics in the Pelagos Sanctuary (Ligurian-Provencal Sea)	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												If Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are to aid in protecting and conserving marine ecosystems in the face of extensive and severe impacts of human activities, underpinning scientific knowledge and understanding of MPAs are imperative. This study aims to describe and evaluate phytoplankton dynamics in a pelagic Mediterranean MPA (The Pelagos International Marine Mammals Sanctuary) in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea as a means to understand better the spatial and temporal distribution of basal ecosystem resources. Ocean colour data collected by orbital remote sensing (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor [SeaWiFS] data) were analysed to elucidate spatial and temporal variations in the concentration of chlorophyll-like pigments (chl). Mean chl images were generated for consecutive 10-day periods, to provide quasi-continuous coverage of the study area, combined with a Principal Component Analysis and analysis of a time series (1998-2004). The chl surface patterns traced seasonal upwelling events recurring annually, demonstrating the critical role of physical oceanography in sustaining the food web of the PelagosSanctuary. Phytoplankton blooms, however, differ in terms of peak timing, spatial distribution and chl concentration, due in part to the influence of broad-scale environmental factors that are beyond direct and regional control. Further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between the biomass of primary and secondary producers to understand better the implications of phytoplankton biomass distribution in space and time for charismatic and protected biota such as cetaceans.

J	Carr, JR; Stokes, CR; Vieli, A				Carr, J. Rachel; Stokes, Chris. R.; Vieli, Andreas			Threefold increase in marine-terminating outlet glacier retreat rates across the Atlantic Arctic: 1992-2010	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY					IGS Symposium	JUL 10-15, 2016	Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA	IGS	Scripps Inst Oceanog			Accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has been a key component of the rapid mass loss from Arctic glaciers since the 1990s. However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (-30.5 m a(-1)) and 2000-10 (-105.8 m a(-1)), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales.																	0260-3055	1727-5644				APR	2017	58	74					72	91		10.1017/aog.2017.3								WOS:000416835100009

Annual net community production in the subtropical Pacific Ocean from in situ oxygen measurements on profiling floats	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Annual net community production (ANCP) in the subtropical Pacific Ocean was determined by using annual oxygen measurements from Argo profiling floats with an upper water column oxygen mass balance model. ANCP was determined to be from 2.0 to 2.4 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in the western subtropical North Pacific, 2.4 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in the eastern subtropical North Pacific, and near zero in the subtropical South Pacific. Error analysis with the main sources of uncertainty being the accuracy of oxygen measurements and the parameterization of bubble fluxes in winter suggested an uncertainty of similar to 0.3 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) in subtropical Pacific. The results are in good agreement with previous observations in locations where ANCP has been determined before. These are the first results from the western subtropical North Pacific and subtropical South Pacific where ANCP have not been evaluated before. ANCP for the subtropical South Pacific is significantly lower than in all other open ocean locations where it has been determined by mass balance. Comparison of our observations with net biological carbon export estimated from remote sensing algorithms indicates that observations from the subtropical North Pacific are higher than the satellite estimates, but those in the subtropical South Pacific are lower than satellite-determined carbon export.

To the south, the neighbouring Browse Basin has proven lateral migration of generated hydrocarbons to the basin bounding highs, as evidenced by seeps located on the Yampi Shelf. This paper describes the findings of a natural seeps study carried out to establish if migrating subsurface hydrocarbons reach the southern flanks of the Ashmore Platform basement high. The integrated study combined remote sensing, geophysical, acoustic, photographic and geochemical techniques and has identified three areas of seepage; one area characteristic of persistent seepage and two areas of interpreted episodic leakage. Geochemical data collected from samples at one of these sites demonstrates the presence of thermogenic liquid hydrocarbons, with isotopic compositions falling within the range of values exhibited by oils sourced by the Lower Cretaceous Echuca Shoals Formation. The identification of active natural seepage along the southern flank of the Ashmore Platform provides evidence that hydrocarbons generated within the Caswell Sub-basin are able to laterally migrate onto the flanks of the Ashmore Platform structural high. As such, these findings reduce charge risk for the Ashmore Platform and regional exploration risks in the northern Browse Basin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Community review of Southern Ocean satellite data needs	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												This review represents the Southern Ocean community's satellite data needs for the coming decade. Developed through widespread engagement and incorporating perspectives from a range of stakeholders (both research and operational), it is designed as an important community-driven strategy paper that provides the rationale and information required for future planning and investment. The Southern Ocean is vast but globally connected, and the communities that require satellite-derived data in the region are diverse. This review includes many observable variables, including sea ice properties, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, atmospheric parameters, marine biology (both micro and macro) and related activities, terrestrial cryospheric connections, sea surface salinity, and a discussion of coincident and in situ data collection. Recommendations include commitment to data continuity, increases in particular capabilities (sensor types, spatial, temporal), improvements in dissemination of data/products/uncertainties, and innovation in calibration/validation capabilities. Full recommendations are detailed by variable as well as summarized. This review provides a starting point for scientists to understand more about Southern Ocean processes and their global roles, for funders to understand the desires of the community, for commercial operators to safely conduct their activities in the Southern Ocean, and for space agencies to gain greater impact from Southern Ocean-related acquisitions and missions.

Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				MAR 24	2017	568						203	215		10.3354/meps12082								WOS:000398911600015						
J	Wu, SY; Hou, S				Wu, Shuang-Ye; Hou, Shugui			Impact of icebergs on net primary productivity in the Southern Ocean	CRYOSPHERE												Productivity in the Southern Ocean (SO) is ironlimited, and supply of iron dissolved from aeolian dust is believed to be the main source from outside the marine environment. However, recent studies show that icebergs could provide a comparable amount of bioavailable iron to the SO as aeolian dust. In addition, small-scale areal studies suggest increased concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding icebergs. Based on previous research, this study aims to examine whether iceberg occurrence has a significant impact on marine productivity at the scale of the SO, using remote sensing data of iceberg occurrences and ocean net primary productivity (NPP) covering the period 2002-2014. The impacts of both large and small icebergs are examined in four major ecological zones of the SO: the continental shelf zone (CSZ), the seasonal ice zone (SIZ), the permanent open ocean zone (POOZ), and the polar front zone (PFZ). We found that the presence of icebergs is associated with elevated levels of NPP, but the differences vary in different zones. Grid cells with small icebergs on average have higher NPP than other cells in most iron-deficient zones: 21% higher for the SIZ, 16% for the POOZ, and 12% for the PFZ. The difference is relatively small in the CSZ where iron is supplied from meltwater and sediment input from the continent. In addition, NPP of grid cells adjacent to large icebergs on average is 10% higher than that of control cells in the vicinity. The difference is larger at higher latitudes, where most large icebergs are concentrated. From 1992 to 2014, there is a significant increasing trend for both small and large icebergs. The increase was most rapid in the early 2000s and has leveled off since then. As the climate continues to warm, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is expected to experience increased mass loss as a whole, which could lead to more icebergs in the region. Based on our study, this could result in a higher level of NPP in the SO as a whole, providing a possible negative feedback for global warming in near future.																	1994-0416	1994-0424				MAR 17	2017	11	2					707	722		10.5194/tc-11-707-2017								WOS:000398590200002						
J	Strong, JA; Elliott, M				Strong, James Asa; Elliott, Michael			The value of remote sensing techniques in supporting effective extrapolation across multiple marine spatial scales	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The reporting of ecological phenomena and environmental status routinely required point observations, collected with traditional sampling approaches to be extrapolated to larger reporting scales. This process encompasses difficulties that can quickly entrain significant errors. Remote sensing techniques offer insights and exceptional spatial coverage for observing the marine environment. This review provides guidance on (i) the structures and discontinuities inherent within the extrapolative process, (ii) how to extrapolate effectively across multiple spatial scales, and (iii) remote sensing techniques and data sets that can facilitate this process. This evaluation illustrates that remote sensing techniques are a critical component in extrapolation and likely to underpin the production of high-quality assessments of ecological phenomena and the regional reporting of environmental status. Ultimately, is it hoped that this guidance will aid the production of robust and consistent extrapolations that also make full use of the techniques and data sets that expedite this process.

J	Jatiault, R; Dhont, D; Loncke, L; Dubucq, D				Jatiault, Romain; Dhont, Damien; Loncke, Lies; Dubucq, Dominique			Monitoring of natural oil seepage in the Lower Congo Basin using SAR observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a spaceborne tool allowing near real-time imagery over large ground footprints of areas hundreds of kilometres wide. SAR also allows persistent observations of the process of oil discharges, benefiting from (1) day and night observations, (2) independence of cloud cover and (3) high revisiting frequencies. The interpretation of 82 SAR scenes over the Lower Congo Basin for the 1994-2012 period allowed the recognition of 1400 natural seepage slicks associated with 102 individual seep sites. We acquired an additional SAR data set with a short revisit time over a selected prolific area. The data set consisted of 22 SAR scenes acquired over a 10-day period, meaning a maximum revisiting period of 12 h between subsequent SAR acquisitions. The short-term approach shows that seepage slicks were detected with wind speeds between 1.5 and 6.5 m/s (2.91 to 12.63 knots). Both long-term and short-term monitoring evidences that seepage events are intermittent, with the occurrence rate of oil release ranging from 5 to 80%. Short-term monitoring shows that the seepage pace is independent between seep sites, suggesting contrasted controlling factors. It also shows that the residence time of seepage slicks is systematically shorter than 12 h, which is far below reported values. Understanding the seepage slick residence time is essential to provide an accurate estimation of the fluid flow and to compute the volumetric outflow. The integration of in-situ mooring points measuring the current velocity 10 m below the sea surface, in addition to local wind field and slick length, allowed us to more accurately estimate the residence time of oil slicks at the sea surface before vanishing. The results show that the sea surface residence time of oil slicks is limited to a few hours, with a median value of 3 h 15 min. These new residence time estimations allowed us to propose a quantification of the regional oil output in the Lower Congo Basin, estimated at 4380 m(3)/year. This area may therefore be considered as the world's third biggest oil-supplying province from natural leakages. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In situ measured Rrs at Operational Land Imager (OLI) bands 1-4 were involved in the algorithm development. Comparisons between estimated and in situ measured SSS produced Res reaching 0.74 and RMSEs <2%. The proposed algorithm was applied to OLI scenes collected in November 2013 and March 2016 to demonstrate SSS changes from normal conditions when extreme events were encountered. The good agreement between satellite derived and in situ Rrs suggested that the algorithm uncertainties were primarily attributed to the algorithm parameterization and more measurements were required for performance improving. Compared with OLI-derived products, numerical simulations overestimated SSS by 3.4%. Our findings demonstrate the potential of high resolution satellite products to study short-lasting events and capture fine-scale features in the marine environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

With the proliferation of marine leisure activities and the maritime conditions such as tides, rocks, typhoons, tsunamis, there are various types of marine accidents that have not been experienced before. Therefore, it is imperative to establish an information based system (like digital map or 3D distribution map) that can be utilized in marine safety fields such as accident and disaster prevention. In this investigation, it will be discussed the safety mapping for tidal channel connected directly with human life. A tidal channel is a waterway where occurs by the process of ebb tide and flood tide in the tidal flats. Since the shape (included exact depth) of tidal channel cannot be identified when a tide comes in, it must be considered as the main causes of the summer drowning fatalities. A map for tidal channel has been proposed by a 3D distribution map that can be identified the shape and location of tidal channel, and also, this map should be offered to marine tourist and maritime safety authority. A cartography based on image collected by manned aerial Photogrammetry or satellite has the insoluble limitations in terms of economy, time constraint and periodic for measurement. Due to temporary erratic overflow through the tidal amplitude, the information for tidal channel cannot be monitored in real time. Therefore, in the present investigation, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) recently been actively used in the field of spatial information is considered in analyzing the status of tidal channel. First of all, the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) of tidal flats generates through UAV based auto-image, the distribution map for tidal channel expresses different colors by the height of topographic. A tidal channel encoding specific color (normally red) can be provided dangerous signal to the user. It can be identified the sea leveling at the certain time that can be measured whole shape of tidal channels, and also, provided a more realistic and readable information on tidal flats. The information provided through the tidal channel map was verified by comparison with the VRS GPS positioning solution. Since information such as the exact distribution location and shape should be considered as the first priority, the coordinates of the tidal channel was compared with the previously proven method, VRS GPS. As a result, it is determined that the location of attribute information and the 3D shape analysis value analyzed by UAV image can fully provide information within the convergence range. In this investigation, UAV image can be estimated on the location and shape of tidal channel by observing exactly at the time zone for flood tide. It can be fully expected that the UAV is contributed to preventing the marine accident in advance by maximizing the latent properties with regards to periodicity, accuracy, operation convenience and economy.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		199	203		10.2112/SI79-041.1								WOS:000403856800041

Optical response associated with changing summer biogeochemical conditions in a turbid lake	LIMNOLOGICA												Water quality degradation in inland water bodies during summer periods due to phytoplankton growth is a global problem. Lake Burley Griffin (LBG) in Canberra, Australia is an artificial, turbid, urban lake which is prone to water quality degradation in summer due to phytoplankton blooms. In Australia only limited (spatial, spectral and temporal) datasets are available that detail the full bio-optical condition of the water body during summer transformation processes. In this study, we conducted field campaigns in LBG to measure biogeochemical as well as inherent optical properties (IOP) during summer 2010 to understand the variability in the optical response. Optically active biogeochemical components such as total suspended solids (TSS), Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) varied over a wide range in response to changing environmental conditions during summer. The underwater optical environment was dominated by light scattering properties and the light absorption budget varied in response to changing CDOM and phytoplankton distributions. Specific inherent optical properties and spectral slopes of ICP observed here were different to other regional datasets, thus indicated the limitation in the extrapolation of optical models from other regions. Optical response as described by the scattering to absorption ratio and backscattering albedo showed that absorption due to CDOM and non-algal particulate matter (NAP) masked phytoplankton absorption features limiting the application of standard optical algorithms. A through description of bio-optical properties, relationships and their variability in response to changing summer biogeochemical conditions in a turbid optically complex lake is presented here.

J	DeVries, T; Weber, T				DeVries, Tim; Weber, Thomas			The export and fate of organicmatter in the ocean: New constraints from combining satellite and oceanographic tracer observations	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The ocean's biological pump transfers carbon from the surface euphotic zone into the deep ocean, reducing the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Despite its climatic importance, there are large uncertainties in basic metrics of the biological pump. Previous estimates of the strength of the biological pump, as measured by the amount of organic carbon exported from the euphotic zone, range from about 4 to 12 Pg C yr(-1). The fate of exported carbon, in terms of how efficiently it is transferred into the deep ocean, is even more uncertain. Here we present a new model of the biological pump that assimilates satellite and oceanographic tracer observations to constrain rates and patterns of organic matter production, export, and remineralization in the ocean. The data-assimilated model predicts a global particulate organic carbon (POC) flux out of the euphotic zone of similar to 9 Pg C yr(-1). The particle export ratio (the ratio of POC export to net primary production) is highest at high latitudes and lowest at low latitudes, but low-latitude export is greater than predicted by previous models, in better agreement with observed patterns of long-term carbon export. Particle transfer efficiency (T-eff) through the mesopelagic zone is controlled by temperature and oxygen, with highest T-eff for high-latitude regions and oxygen minimum zones. In contrast, T-eff in the deep ocean (below 1000 m) is controlled by particle sinking speed, with highest deep ocean T-eff below the subtropical gyres. These results emphasize the utility of both remote sensing and oceanographic tracer observations for constraining the operation of the biological pump. Plain Language Summary Tiny marine plants known as phytoplankton absorb vast amounts of carbon, a portion of which settles into the deep ocean as the remains of dead organisms, where it is ultimately decomposed. This "biological carbon pump" is a key component of the global carbon cycle, bringing almost as much CO2 into the subsurface ocean on an annual basis as humans emit through fossil fuel burning. In this work, we present a new way to estimate how efficiently the biological pump is moving carbon from the surface to deep ocean and what factors determine the efficiency of the biological pump. By combining observations from Earth-orbiting satellites and from seagoing research cruises in a global carbon cycle model, we show that the low-latitude ocean exports more carbon out of the surface ocean than previously thought. We also show that temperature and oxygen concentrations are the most important controls on how efficiently carbon is transferred into the deep ocean. This has important implications for how the biological pump will respond to climate change, which is expected to lead to a warmer and less oxygenated ocean.

J	Kotilainen, AT; Kaskela, AM				Kotilainen, Aarno Tapio; Kaskela, Anu Marii			Comparison of airborne LiDAR and shipboard acoustic data in complex shallow water environments: Filling in the white ribbon zone	MARINE GEOLOGY												Shallow coastal areas of oceans, seas and lakes pose significant remote sensing and navigational challenges due to the transient nature of bathymetric features that characterize these areas (e.g., shoals and shoaling). Seabed data/ maps often represent these areas as "white ribbon" zones, where sparse data coverage presents a particular challenge to defining and enforcing sustainable use of marine resources. Given the lengthy perimeter of coastlines, there is a need for cost-efficient methods for producing high resolution maps of shallow areas. The research described here compares airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with shipboard acoustic surveys around the Kvarken Archipelago of the northern Baltic Sea. The Kvarken Archipelago includes a unique, brackish shallow water marine environment with a number of moraines. The landscape of the area is characterised by fields of ridged, washboard-like De Geer moraines. The moraines combined with an ongoing glacio-isostatic uplift typical of the area, lead into succession of the elevated structures from the seafloor to land, where present seabed structures will rise on land in future. The ongoing modification of the environment by both climatic and geologic forces contributes to complex geomorphic and ecological feedback systems operating on a range of spatial and temporal scales. Airborne LiDAR can provide high resolution remote sensing data on shallow coastal areas. The technology is especially effective in areas with very shoal waters, like those found along the Finnish coast. LiDAR enables continuous detection of topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) data and can thus generate continuous maps of transition zones between continental and marine areas. Environmental conditions such as water clarity and ice cover can affect LiDAR depth detection capabilities: these conditions require complementary accuracy assessment strategies. As LiDAR cannot determine detailed information on seafloor surface substrate, and anything on subsurface substrate type, geological conditions are determined through the application of acoustic-seismic. methods, sediment sampling and underwater video. Data from LiDAR surveys provide a detailed topographic and bathymetric map of the study area up to water depths of 14 m. The seabed bathymetry model shows a series of elevated, narrow, elongate features that appear throughout the study area. These parallel ridges represent the uppermost geomorphic features of the seafloor. Interpretation of acoustic bathymetric surveys indicates that these ridges are De Geer moraines. The general orientation of these moraines differs from that associated with older features of the northern Kvarken Archipelago. Eroded remnants of older De Geer moraines are overprinted at a high angle by the younger landforms. De Geer moraines in the study area thus represent two phases of deglaciation and finally the eastward ice-sheet/ice edge retreat.

The velocity of sea surface temperature (SST) has been used to predict species migration and persistence as an expectation of how species track their thermal niches; however, several studies have found that evidence for species shifts has deviated from the velocity of SST. This study investigated whether estimation of the velocity of shifts in phytoplankton size structure using remote sensing data could contribute to better prediction of species shifts. A chlorophyll-a (Chla) size distribution (CSD) model was developed by quantifying the relationships between the size structure of the phytoplankton community and the spectral features of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(ph)()), based on the principal component analysis approach. Model validation demonstrated that the exponent of CSD (hereafter, CSD slope), which can describe the synoptic size structure of a phytoplankton community, was derived successfully with a relative root mean square error of 18.5%. The median velocity of CSD slope across the ocean was 485.2 kmdecade(-1), broadly similar to Chla (531.5 kmdecade(-1)). These values were twice the velocity of SST, and the directions of shifts in CSD slope and Chla were quite different from that of SST. Because Chla is generally covariant with the size structure of a phytoplankton community, we believe that spatiotemporal changes in Chla can explain the variations of phytoplankton size structure. Obvious differences in both rate and direction of shifts were found between the phytoplankton size structure and SST, implying that shifts of phytoplankton size structure could be a powerful tool for assessing the distributional shifts of marine species. Our results will contribute to generate global and regional maps of expected species shifts in response to environmental forcing.

Their monitorization plays a key role in their preservation, which is most commonly done through the use of environmental sensing buoy networks. These devices transmit data by means of satellite communications or close-range base stations, which present several limitations and elevated infrastructure costs. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are another alternative for remote environmental monitoring which provide new types of data and ease of use. These aircraft are mainly used in video capture related applications, in its various light spectrums, and do not provide the same data as sensing buoys, nor can they be used for such extended periods of time. The aim of this research is to provide a flexible, easy to deploy and cost-effective Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for monitoring marine environments. This proposal uses a UAV as a mobile data collector, low-power long-range communications and sensing buoys as part of a single WSN. A complete description of the design, development, and implementation of the various parts of this system is presented, as well as its validation in a real-world scenario.																	1424-8220					MAR	2017	17	3							460	10.3390/s17030460								WOS:000398818700033

Characterizations of calcite particles and evaluations of their light scattering effects in lacustrine systems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Characterization of autochthonously produced calcite particles, along with the associated heteronuclei, and evaluation of their effects on light scattering, are advanced for lacustrine waters. This is supported by ( 1) direct measurement of minerogenic particle populations from 12 northeastern U.S. lakes with scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses (SAX), and (2) application of the previously tested SAX-Mie-theory approach to resolve the contributions of calcite vs. allochthonous minerogenic particles to particulate scattering and backscattering coefficients (b(p) and b(bp)), and (3) comparison with organic contributions estimated through empirical bio-optics models. Intervals of substantial contributions of calcite to b(p) and b(bp), described as "whiting events," are demonstrated for these study lakes. Organic particles, apparently from two size ranges, likely corresponding to pico- and nanocyanobacteria, are found to serve as the primary heteronuclei for the calcite precipitation. The coating of these particles with calcite within the upper waters of the study lakes remained thin. The calculated relative increases in b(bp) were substantially more than for b(p) because of the greater effect of the higher refractive index (i.e., n) of calcite for the former. Differences in n values for calcite reported in the literature are a source of noteworthy uncertainty in associated b(bp) estimates. Nine years of spring-fall monitoring in Cayuga Lake, New York, documented major interannual variations in the whiting events with respect to timing, magnitude of the scattering signatures, and the sizes of heteronuclei. Whiting events can have major effects on commonly monitored optical features, including Secchi depth and remote sensing reflectance.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2017	62	2					645	664		10.1002/lno.10451								WOS:000397875700017

The SSA and SPF were calculated as the weighted averages of the scattering properties of the CALIOP aerosol subtypes. The weights were set to the occurrence frequencies of the subtypes. The single scattering properties of each subtype were extrapolated from the volume based size distribution and complex refractive indexes based on Mie calculations. For the high -loading episodes (aerosol optical depth >= 0.6), the exponential ECP structures were most frequently observed over the farmland and desert areas, along with the uplifted ECP structures over the marine and coastal areas. Besides the desert areas, high-loading episodes also occurred over areas with frequent agricultural and industry activities. Unlike the conventional half-3D aerosol climatology (vertically constant SSA and SPF), this newly generated climatology specified SSA and SPF in the full-3D space (full-3D aerosol climatology). Errors on the shortwave radiative heating rate (SW RHR) due to the half-3D aerosol climatology approximation were quantified. The SW RHR errors were around +/- 1 K/day, implying that the half-3D aerosol climatology should be used with caution in climate modeling. This study is among the first to generate a full-3D aerosol climatology from the CALIOP data. This full-3D aerosol climatology is potentially useful for aerosol remote sensing and climate modeling.

In situ spectral particulate backscattering data acquired from several field campaigns on the turbid and pro-ductive coastal regions of southern India are used to develop a partitioning method and establish robust relationships between the partitioned bbph(lambda) and bbNAP(lambda) versus chlorophyll and turbidity. The performance of this method is assessed using independent data sets from marine and inland productive waters. The bbph(lambda) and bbNAP(lambda) products derived from this method are found in good agreement with in situ data, with the overall percentile error of a few percent which is well within the benchmark for a validated uncertainty of +/- 35% endorsed for the chlorophyll-a retrieval in oceanic waters. Further comparison with other inversion methods demonstrated the relative performance of the new model, especially in productive and algal bloom-dominated waters. To illustrate the use of the new model for remote sensing applications, it was applied to both multispectral Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua and hyperspectral ( Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean) images from the algal bloom-dominated waters of the Arabian Sea and turbid productive lagoon waters on the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal. The results were interesting, i. e., the existence of strong spectral features and inflections in the phytoplankton backscattering spectra in bloom-dominated waters and the nearly featureless NAP backscattering spectra varying approximately according to a power law in sedimentladen waters. Corroborating the previous experimental and theoretical studies, our results for algal bloom waters show a steep slope in the blue region and enhanced backscattering in the green and near-infrared regions due to the influence of phytoplankton absorption and backscattering. These results further suggest that living algal matter in productive waters may be a source of significant backscattering. Under typical nonbloom conditions in turbid coastal waters, our analyses confirm that the minerogenic and detrital particles are likely the most important because of their high abundance relative to living organic particles and their spectral dependences have profound implications for our understanding of the relationship between the backscattering to scattering ratio and particle size distribution and related properties. The new model clearly represents as an important tool permitting the analysis of the spectral backscattering coefficients associated with phytoplankton and nonliving components in sediment-laden and algal-bloom-dominated productive waters within coastal environments.

Trade-offs between data resolution, accuracy, and cost when choosing information to plan reserves for coral reef ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conservation planners must reconcile trade-offs associated with using biodiversity data of differing qualities to make decisions. Coarse habitat classifications are commonly used as surrogates to design marine reserve networks when fine-scale biodiversity data are incomplete or unavailable. Although finely-classified habitat maps provide more detail, they may have more misclassification errors, a common problem when remotely-sensed imagery is used. Despite these issues, planners rarely consider the effects of errors when choosing data for spatially explicit conservation prioritizations. Here we evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and resolution of hierarchical coral reef habitat data (geomorphology and benthic substrate) derived from remote sensing, in spatial planning for Kubulau District, Fiji. For both, we use accuracy information describing the probability that a mapped habitat classification is correct to design marine reserve networks that achieve habitat conservation targets, and demonstrate inadequacies of using habitat maps without accuracy data. We show that using more detailed habitat information ensures better representation of biogenic habitats (i.e. coral and seagrass), but leads to larger and more costly reserves, because these data have more misclassification errors, and are also more expensive to obtain. Reduced impacts on fishers are possible using coarsely-classified data, which are also more cost-effective for planning reserves if we account for data collection costs, but using these data may under-represent reef habitats that are important for fisheries and biodiversity, due to the maps low thematic resolution. Finally, we show that explicitly accounting for accuracy information in decisions maximizes the chance of successful conservation outcomes by reducing the risk of missing conservation representation targets, particularly when using finely classified data.

Ship-based retrievals of cloud optical depth (tau) from a Sun photometer and liquid water path (LWP) from a microwave radiometer were combined to derive cloud droplet number concentration N-d and compute a cloud-aerosol interaction (ACI) metric defined as ACI(CCN) = partial derivative ln(N-d)/partial derivative ln(CCN), with CCN denoting the cloud condensation nuclei concentration measured at 0.4% (CCN0.4) and 0.3% (CCN0.3) supersaturation. Analysis of CCN0.4, accumulation mode aerosol concentration (N-a), and extinction coefficient (sigma(ext)) indicates that N-a and sigma(ext) can be used as CCN0.4 proxies for estimating ACI. ACI(CCN) derived from 10 min averaged N-d and CCN0.4 and CCN0.3, and CCN0.4 regressions using N-a and sigma(ext), produce high ACI(CCN): near 1.0, that is, a fractional change in aerosols is associated with an equivalent fractional change in N-d. ACI(CCN) computed in deep boundary layers was small (ACI(CCN) = 0.60), indicating that surface aerosol measurements inadequately represent the aerosol variability below clouds. Satellite cloud retrievals from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and GOES-15 data were compared against ship-based retrievals and further analyzed to compute a satellite-based ACI(CCN). Satellite data correlated well with their ship-based counterparts with linear correlation coefficients equal to or greater than 0.78. Combined satellite N-d and ship-based CCN0.4 and N-a yielded a maximum ACI(CCN) = 0.88-0.92, a value slightly less than the ship-based ACI(CCN), but still consistent with aircraft-based studies in the eastern Pacific.

Predictions from machine learning ensembles: marine bird distribution and density on Canada's Pacific coast	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Increasingly disrupted and altered, the world's oceans are subject to immense and intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Of the biota inhabiting these ecosystems, marine birds are among the most threatened. For conservation efforts targeting marine birds to be effective, quantitative information relating to their at-sea density and distribution is typically a crucial knowledge component. In this study, we generated predictive machine learning ensemble models for 13 marine bird species and 7 groups (representing 24 additional species) in Canada's Pacific coast waters, including several species listed under Canada's Species at Risk Act. Predictive models were based on systematic marine bird line transect survey information collected in spring, summer, and fall on Canada's Pacific coast (2005-2008). Multiple Covariate Distance Sampling (MCDS) was used to estimate marine bird density along transect segments. Spatial and temporal environmental predictors, including remote sensing information, were used in model ensembles, which were constructed using 4 machine learning algorithms in Salford Systems Predictive Modeler v7.0 (SPM7): Random Forests, TreeNet, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Classification and Regression Trees. Predictive models were subsequently combined to generate seasonal and overall predictions of areas important to marine birds based on normalized marine bird species or group richness and densities. Our results employ open access data sharing and are intended to better inform marine bird conservation efforts and management planning on Canada's Pacific coast and for broader-scale geographic initiatives across North America and elsewhere.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 27	2017	566						199	216		10.3354/meps12030								WOS:000396051300015

The CALIOP products are validated using the ground-based lidar measurements at the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL). The Taklamakan Desert and Tibetan Plateau regions exhibit the highest depolarization and color ratios because of the natural dust origin, whereas the North China Plain, Sichuan Basin and Yangtze River Delta show the lowest depolarization and color ratios because of aerosols from secondary formation of the anthropogenic origin. Certain regions, such as the North China Plain in spring and the Loess Plateau in winter, show intermediate depolarization and color ratios because of mixed dust and anthropogenic aerosols. In the Pearl River Delta region, the depolarization and color ratios are similar to but higher than those of the other polluted regions because of combined anthropogenic and marine aerosols. Long-range transport of dust in the middle and upper troposphere in spring is well captured by the CALIOP observations. The seasonal variations in the aerosol vertical distributions reveal efficient transport of aerosols from the atmospheric boundary layer to the free troposphere because of summertime convective mixing. The aerosol extinction lapse rates in autumn and winter are more positive than those in spring and summer, indicating trapped aerosols within the boundary layer because of stabler meteorological conditions. More than 80% of the column aerosols are distributed within 1.5 km above the ground in winter, when the aerosol extinction lapse rate exhibits a maximum seasonal average in all study regions except for the Tibetan Plateau. The aerosol extinction lapse rates in the polluted regions are higher than those of the less polluted regions, indicating a stabilized atmosphere due to absorptive aerosols in the polluted regions. Our results reveal that the satellite and ground-based remote-sensing measurements provide the key information on the long-term seasonal and spatial variations in the aerosol vertical distribution and optical properties, regional aerosol types, long-range transport and atmospheric stability, which can be utilized to more precisely assess the direct and indirect aerosol effects on weather and climate.

The global aerosol-cloud first indirect effect estimated using MODIS, MERRA, and AeroCom	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) represent a significant source of forcing uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs). Estimates of radiative forcing due to ACI in Fifth Assessment Report range from -0.5 to -2.5 W m(-2). A portion of this uncertainty is related to the first indirect, or Twomey, effect whereby aerosols act as nuclei for cloud droplets to condense upon. At constant liquid water content this increases the number of cloud droplets (Nd) and thus increases the cloud albedo. In this study we use remote-sensing estimates of Nd within stratocumulus regions in combination with state-of-the-art aerosol reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) to diagnose how aerosols affect Nd. As in previous studies, Nd is related to sulfate mass through a power law relationship. The slope of the log-log relationship between Nd and SO4 in maritime stratocumulus is found to be 0.31, which is similar to the range of 0.2-0.8 from previous in situ studies and remote-sensing studies in the pristine Southern Ocean. Using preindustrial emissions models, the change in Nd between preindustrial and present day is estimated. Nd is inferred to have more than tripled in some regions. Cloud properties from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate the radiative forcing due to this change in Nd. The Twomey effect operating in isolation is estimated to create a radiative forcing of -0.97 +/- 0.23 W m(-2) relative to the preindustrial era.

J	Jo, YH; Bi, H; Lee, J				Jo, Young-Heon; Bi, Hongsheng; Lee, Jongsuk			Potential Applications of Low Altitude Remote Sensing for Monitoring Jellyfish	KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Jellyfish (cnidarian) are conspicuous in many marine ecosystems when in bloom. Despite their importance for the ecosystem structure and function, very few sampling programs are dedicated to sample jellyfish because they are patchily distributed and easily clogged plankton net. Although satellite remote sensing is an excellent observing tool for many phenomena in the ocean, their uses for monitoring jellyfish are not possible due to the coarse spatial resolutions. Hence, we developed the low altitude remote sensing platform to detect jellyfish in high resolutions, which allow us to monitor not only horizontal, but also vertical migration of them. Using low altitude remote sensing platform, we measured the jellyfish from the pier at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory in Chesapeake Bay. The patterns observed included discrete patches, in rows that were aligned with waves that propagated from deeper regions, and aggregation around physical objects. The corresponding areas of exposed jellyfish on the sea surface were 0.1x10(4) pixel(2), 0.3x10(4) pixel(2), and 2.75x10(4) pixel(2), respectively. Thus, the research result suggested that the migration of the jellyfish was related to the physical forcing in the sea surface.																	1225-6161	2287-9307				FEB	2017	33	1					15	24		10.7780/kjrs.2017.33.1.2								WOS:000408873800002

Satellite remote sensing can be a useful tool for the management of such types of marine hazards, namely oil spills, mainly owing to the synoptic view and the good trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, depending on the specific platform/sensor system used. In this paper, an innovative satellite-based technique for oil spill detection, based on the general robust satellite technique (RST) approach, is presented. It exploits the multi-temporal analysis of data acquired in the visible channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite in order to automatically and quickly detect the presence of oil spills on the sea surface, with an attempt to minimize "false detections" caused by spurious effects associated with, for instance, cloud edges, sun/satellite geometries, sea currents, etc. The oil spill event that occurred in June 2007 off the south coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea has been considered as a test case. The resulting data, the reliability of which has been evaluated by both carrying out a confutation analysis and comparing them with those provided by the application of another independent MODIS-based method, showcase the potential of RST in identifying the presence of oil with a high level of accuracy.

Tagged turtles were incidentally captured by recreational fishermen and rehabilitated at the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi. The average size of the core habitat areas (50% KDE (kernel density estimation)) was 1660.2km(2)3438.2 SD. Turtles displayed strong intra- and inter-annual site fidelity to the Mississippi Sound during the spring, summer, and autumn months. During the winter months, most turtles, probably influenced by water temperatures, migrated to nearshore waters of Louisiana on either side of the Mississippi River Delta. However, other migration strategies were also observed. Overall, these data indicate that the Mississippi Sound is an important developmental habitat for this critically endangered species. In addition, their wintering grounds in Louisiana are utilized by adult Kemp's ridleys and other sea turtle species as foraging grounds and migratory corridors. The high use of these areas by sea turtle populations increases the potential for negative impacts from anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. shrimp trawling, oil production, hypoxia) that occur there.

Removing sun glint from optical remote sensing images of shallow rivers	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Sun glint is the specular reflection of light from the water surface, which often causes unusually bright pixel values that can dominate fluvial remote sensing imagery and obscure the water-leaving radiance signal of interest for mapping bathymetry, bottom type, or water column optical characteristics. Although sun glint is ubiquitous in fluvial remote sensing imagery, river-specific methods for removing sun glint are not yet available. We show that existing sun glint-removal methods developed for multispectral images of marine shallow water environments over-correct shallow portions of fluvial remote sensing imagery resulting in regions of unreliable data along channel margins. We build on existing marine glint-removal methods to develop a river-specific technique that removes sun glint from shallow areas of the channel without over-correction by accounting for non-negligible water-leaving near-infrared radiance. This new sun glint-removal method can improve the accuracy of spectrally-based depth retrieval in cases where sun glint dominates the at-sensor radiance. For an example image of the gravel-bed Snake River, Wyoming, USA, observed-versus-predicted R-2 values for depth retrieval improved from 0.66 to 0.76 following sun glint removal. The methodology presented here is straightforward to implement and could be incorporated into image processing workflows for multispectral images that include a near-infrared band.

Middle to Late Devensian glaciation of north-east Scotland: implications for the north-eastern quadrant of the last British-Irish ice sheet	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We present a review of over 175 years of research into the Middle to Late Devensian (Weichselian) glaciation of NE Scotland based crucially on both its lithostratigraphic and geomorphic records. The location of the region, and surrounding seabed, makes this unusually detailed record significant for deciphering the former interactions and dynamics of Scottish and Scandinavian ice within the North Sea Basin (NSB), which continue to be controversial. A 12-stage event stratigraphy is proposed based on a parsimonious interpretation of stratigraphic relationships, till lithology and regional clast fabrics, striae, subglacial bedforms, ice-marginal features and published geochronometry at critical sites. The record of regional glaciation supports converging evidence that the north-eastern quadrant of the last British and Irish Ice Sheet reached its maximum spatial extent in the late Middle to early Late Devensian and later re-expanded following widespread internal glacial reorganizations, marine transgression and partial retreat from the central NSB. Retreat was interrupted by several glacial readvances of limited extent. Field-captured data help to identify important events that are not clearly resolved from remote sensing alone, particularly regarding growth phases of the last glaciation.																	0267-8179	1099-1417				FEB	2017	32	2			SI		276	294		10.1002/jqs.2878								WOS:000394906600010						
J	Varunan, T; Shanmugam, P				Varunan, Theenathayalan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			An optical tool for quantitative assessment of phycocyanin pigment concentration in cyanobacterial blooms within inland and marine environments	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Quantitative assessment of the pigment phycocyanin (PC) in cyanobacterial blooms is essential to assess their abundance and distribution and consequently aid their management in many recreational waters within inland and coastal environments. In contrast to the open-ocean waters, these water bodies are very complex with a pronounced heterogeneity of their optical properties, and hence accurate retrieval of the water-leaving radiances and PC concentration from satellite observations is notoriously difficult with existing algorithms. In the present study, a new inversion algorithm is developed as a rapid cyanobacteria bloom assessment method and its retrievals of PC are compared with in-situ and satellite observations and those from a previously reported inversion algorithm. The new algorithm estimates PC concentration on the basis of the unique absorption feature of phycocyanin at 620 nm which is isolated from the total pigment absorption by taking advantage of the well recognized absorption and reflectance features in the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (less impacted by the influences of the overlapping absorption signatures of the mixture constituents and pigment packaging). The by-products of this work include chl-a concentration and predictions from reflectance data to monitor the cyanobacterial component and non-cyanobacterial component of the phytoplankton assemblage and to evaluate PC:Chl-a pigment weight ratios for specific water types. Initial validation of the algorithm was performed using in-situ field data in turbid productive waters dominated by phycocyanin and other pigments, yielding coefficients of determination and slope close to unity and mean errors less than a few percent. These results suggest that the algorithm could be used as a rapid assessment tool for the remote-sensing assessment of the spatial distribution and relative abundance of cyanobacterial blooms in many regional water bodies.

With recorded wave frequency Omega and wavenumber k (and hence wave phase speed c = Omega/k), bed elevation z(b) can be derived using a model that relates Omega and k to water depth. However, the accuracy of z(b) as a function of the sensor and the method of Omega - k retrieval is not well known, especially not under low-period waves. Here, we assess the accuracy of z(b), based on two sensors with their own method of phase speed retrieval, in a dynamic, kilometer-scale environment (Sand Engine, The Netherlands). Bias in z(b) is systematic. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) method on X-band radar imagery produced z(b) too shallow by 1.0 m for -15 m <= z(b) <= -9 m, and too deep by 2.3 m for z(b) >= -6 m. A cross-spectral method on optical video imagery produced z(b) too shallow by 0.59 m for -10 m <= z(b) <= -5 m, and too deep by 0.92 m for z(b) >= -1 m. Intermediate depths had negligible bias, -0.02 m for the radar-FFT approach and -0.01 m for the video-CS approach. The collapse of the FFT method in shallow water may be explained by the inhomogeneity of the wave field in the 960 m x 960 m analysis windows. A shoreward limit of the FFT method is proposed that depends on z(b) in the analysis windows.

J	Pu, R; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lang, HT; Zhang, XY; Xi, YY; Zhang, X; Li, W				Lang, Haitao; Zhang, Xingyao; Xi, Yuyang; Zhang, Xi; Li, Wei			Dark-spot segmentation for oil spill detection based on multifeature fusion classification in single-pol synthetic aperture radar imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												In recent years, oil spill surveillance with space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has received unprecedented attention and has been gradually developed into a common technique for maritime environment protection. A typical SAR-based oil spill detection process consists of three steps: (1) dark-spot segmentation, (2) feature extraction, and (3) oil spill and look-alike discrimination. As a preliminary task in the oil spill detection process chain, dark-spot segmentation is a critical and fundamental step prior to feature extraction and classification, since its output has a direct impact on the two subsequent stages. The balance between the detection probability and false alarm probability has a vital impact on the performance of the entire detection system. Unfortunately, this problem has not drawn as much attention as the other two stages. A specific effort has been placed on dark-spot segmentation in single-pol SAR imagery. A combination of fine designed features, including gray features, geometric features, and textural features, is proposed to characterize the oil spill and seawater for improving the performance of dark-spot segmentation. In the proposed process chain, a histogram stretching transform is incorporated before the gray feature extraction to enhance the contrast between possible oil spills and water. A simple but effective multiple-level thresholding algorithm is developed to conduct a binary classification before the geometric feature extraction to obtain more accurate area features. A local binary pattern code is computed and assigned as the textural feature for a pixel to characterize the physical difference between oil spills and water. The experimental result confirms that the proposed fine designed feature combination outperforms existing approaches in both aspects of overall segmentation accuracy and the capability to balance detection probability and false alarm probability. It is a promising alternative that can be incorporated into existing oil spill detection systems to further improve system performance.

Here we apply the algorithm on data collected from the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 research aircraft during the ACEMED campaign in the Eastern Mediterranean. Vertical profiles of aerosol microphysical properties have been derived successfully for an aged smoke plume near the city of Thessaloniki with aerosol optical depth of similar to 0.4 at 532 nm, single scattering albedos of similar to 0.9-0.95 at 550 nm and typical lidar ratios for smoke of similar to 60-80 sr at 532 nm. IRRA retrieves highly hydrated particles above land, with 55 and 80% water volume content for ambient relative humidity of 80 and 90 %, respectively. The proposed methodology is highly advantageous for aerosol characterization in humid conditions and can find valuable applications in aerosol-cloud interaction schemes. Moreover, it can be used for the validation of active space-borne sensors, as is demonstrated here for the case of CALIPSO.

However, the algorithms have been established and validated based on in situ data mainly measured under low to moderate solar zenith angle (SZA) (<70 deg). Currently, with the development of geostationary satellite ocean color remote sensing, enabling observations from early morning to late afternoon, it has become necessary to know whether the empirical Chla algorithms can be applied to high SZA. The performances of seven widely used Chla algorithms (i.e., OC2, OC3M, OC3V, OC4V4, Clark, ocean-color index, and Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Ocean Color Work Group) under high SZAs were evaluated using the global in situ ocean color dataset (NASA bio-optical marine algorithm dataset). The results show that the performances of all seven algorithms decreased significantly under high SZAs compared with those under low to moderate SZAs. For instance, for the OC4V4 algorithm, the relative percent difference (RPD) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 13.78% and 1.66 mu g/L for the whole dataset and 3.95% and 1.49 mu g/L for SZAs ranging from 30 deg to 40 deg, respectively. However, RPD and RMSE values increased to 30.45% and 6.10 mu g/L for SZAs larger than 70 deg. Adjusting the coefficients of the algorithms using the in situ dataset with high SZA can only slightly improve the performance. The bidirectional remote sensing reflectance can explain the underestimation of the retrieved Chla under high SZA, and the low sensitivity of the blue-green ratio is responsible for the relatively larger scatter between the retrieved and the in situ Chla under high SZA.

Both problems present spatiotemporal changes due to weather and anthropogenic factors. Traditionally spatiotemporal changes in coastal environments are monitored using highresolution satellite images and manned surveys. The last years, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are used as additional tool for monitoring environmental phenomena in sensitive coastal areas. In this study, two different case studies for mapping emerging coastal phenomena i.e. coastline changes and marine litter in Lesvos island, are presented. Both phenomena have increasing interest among scientists monitoring sensitive coastal areas. This paper outlines the integration of UAS for data acquisition and Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline for the visualization of selected coastal areas in the Aegean Sea. The followed UAS-SfM methodology produces very detailed orthophoto maps. This high resolution spatial information is used for mapping and detecting primarily, marine litter on coastal and underwater zones and secondly, coastline changes and coastal erosion. More specific the produced orthophoto maps analyzed through GIS and with the use of the appropriate cartographic techniques the objective environmental parameters were mapped. Results showed that UAS-SfM pipeline produces geoinformation with high accuracy and spatial resolution that helps scientists to map with confidence environmental changes that take place in shoreline zones.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1353-9; 978-1-5106-1352-2				2017	10444								UNSP 1044418	10.1117/12.2278988								WOS:000422619600043

One of the options is the use of sensor networks based on fixed installations and moving platforms (coastal boats, supply-, cargo-, and passenger vessels). Such network allows to gather environmental data in time and space with direct links to operational activities in the controlled area for further environmental risk assessment. Among many remote sensing techniques the LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) based on Light Induced Fluorescence (LIF) is the tool of direct assessment of water quality variations caused by chemical pollution, colored dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton composition. The Hyperspectral LIF (HLIF) LiDAR acquires comprehensive LIF spectra and analyses them by spectral pattern recognition technique to detect and classify the substances in water remotely. Combined use of HLIF LiDARs with Real-Time Data Management System (RTDMS) provides the economically effective solution for the regular monitoring in the controlled area. OCEAN VISUALS in cooperation with LDI INNOVATION has developed Oil in Water Locator (OWL (TM)) with RTDMS (OWL MAP (TM)) based on HLIF LiDAR technique. This is a novel technical solution for monitoring of marine environment providing continuous unattended operations. OWLTM has been extensively tested on board of various vessels in the North Sea, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Baltic Sea and Caribbean Sea. This paper describes the technology features, the results of its operational use in 2014-2017, and outlook for the technology development.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042202	10.1117/12.2278355								WOS:000418795400001

It is noted that the satellite-retrieved ocean color products, such as the chlorophyll, have some missing data on large area where the clouds and heavy aerosols covered or other reasons. In order to monitor their changes and assess their influence on the marine ecosystems or climate, the long-term synchronous and full covered data are needed. The Geostationary Ocean Color Image (GOCI), which is one of sensors onboard COMS Geostationary satellite, observes the East China Sea hourly during the daytime (8 times observation in daytime) and provides nice opportunity to show the diurnal variation of the marine environment which different from the multi-satellite observations during a day. In this study, the hourly remote sensing data of Chlorophyll-a from July 19 to September 30, 2016 in the East China Sea is reconstructed and reanalyzed using the Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF). The missing Chlorophyll-a data has been filled and the good and optimal reanalyzed image can be obtained, when considering the hourly continuous GOCI observations. Some detailed features can be found and the diurnal change of Chlorophyll-a can be shown from the reanalyzed images. In the future, the re-analyzed chlorophyll-a products could reveal its tempo-spatial variation features basically and can describe or reappear the Chlorophyll-a distribution characteristics in multi-scale processes.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042213	10.1117/12.2278005								WOS:000418795400027

Oil Spill Detection from TerraSAR-X Dual-polarized Images using Artificial Neural Network	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 11-12, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE				Marine pollution from oil spills destroys ecosystems. In order to minimize the damage, it is important to fast cleanup it after predicting how the oil will spread. In order to predict the spread of oil spill, remote sensing technique, especially radar satellite image is widely used. In previous studies, only the back-scattering value is generally used for the detection of oil spill. However, in this study, oil spill was detected by applying ANN (Artificial Neural Network) as input data from the back-scattering value of the radar image as well as the phase information extracted from the dual polarization. In order to maximize the efficiency of oil spill detection using a back-scattering value, the speckle noise acting as an error factor should be removed first. NL-means filter was applied to multi-look image to remove it without smoothing of spatial resolution. In the coherence image, the sea has a high value and the oil spill area has a low value due to the scattering characteristics of the pulse. In order to using the characteristics of radar image, training sample was set up from NL-means filtered images(HH, VV) and coherence image, and ANN was applied to produce probability map of oil spill. In general, the value was 0.4 or less in the case of the sea, and the value was mainly in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 in the oil spill area. Using coherence images generated from different polarizations showed better detection results for relatively thin oil spill areas such as oil slick or oil sheen than using back-scattering information alone. It is expected that if the information about the look-alike of oil spill such as algae, internal wave and rainfall area is provided, the probability map can be produced with higher accuracy.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042205	10.1117/12.2278715								WOS:000418795400004

According to previous researches, primary production (NPP) and the structure of phytoplankton community are important in regulate the efficiency of biological carbon pump. This study examined the spatiotemporal variability of satellite remote sensing derived chlorophyll a concentration (Chla), phytoplankton carbon biomass (Carbon), composition ratio of micro-, nano-and pico-phytoplankton, NPP and integrated particulate organic carbon (IPOC) during 1998-2007 in the South China Sea (SCS). Micro-, nano-phytoplankton and NPP showed similar seasonal variation with highest values in winter (January) (especially in the western ocean of Luzon Strait) and lowest values in summer (July) in SCS. Chla, phytoplankton carbon biomass, and IPOC showed different seasonal trends with one peak values occurred in winter and lowest in spring. Two sampling areas (A, N: 17-21 degrees, E: 117.5-120 degrees and B, N: 12.5-15 degrees, E: 112-119 degrees) in SCS were selected based on spatial distribution of the standard deviation of research parameters mentioned above. Compared to Chla, phytoplankton carbon biomass, NPP and IPOC, the interannual changes of phytoplankton community structure were remarkable in the two areas. The fraction of micro-and nano-phytoplankton in SCS tend to rise when La Nina events occur. Our results contribute to an understanding of the response of phytoplankton to climate change in the marginal sea. To quantify the efficiency of biological carbon pump in this area, more attention should be paid to the development of remote sensing algorithms of export NPP (or POC export flux) as well as the regulate mechanism of export NPP.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042216	10.1117/12.2278038								WOS:000418795400030

To acquire three-dimensional angular scattering distribution of submicron particles, we design a two-dimension angular scattering pattern measurement system with a parabolic reflector and a CCD. VSFs of multiple scattering planes between angular range 20 degrees to 160 degrees are achieved simultaneously. We tested the setup with polystyrene spheres of 5 different sizes (diameter 57,193,362,528 and 809nm). One dimensional VSF was extracted from the two-dimensional angular scattering pattern detected by the CCD, and compared with theoretical VSF simulated by Mie theory. Preliminary experiment data show overall agreement with simulated VSFs, although considerable error still exists. Reasons for those error were analyzed and improving measures was given.																			978-1-5090-6290-4				2017																		WOS:000417416900389

The influences of orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode and beam width of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam on the performance on the remote sensing for aerosol particles in marine atmosphere are analyzed numerically. The scattering properties of aerosol particles by LG beam are more sensitive to the change of relative humidity, compared to that of plane wave and Gaussian beam (GB). Remote sensing systems based on LG beam with OAM modes show superiority over traditional plane wave and Gaussian beam cases in detecting the changes in relative humidity of marine atmosphere aerosol. Results also indicate that, when the number of OAM modes p (l) increase, the Radar CrossSection (RCS) of aerosol particles alternating appear extreme values in the forward and backward scattering, because of the special ring-shaped distribution of LG beam. The forward and backward scattering of aerosol particles decrease with the increase in beam waist. As beam waist is less than the radius of aerosol particle, there exists a minimum value in the forward direction.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1325-6; 978-1-5106-1324-9				2017	10430								UNSP 104300M	10.1117/12.2279428								WOS:000417338700015

Marine Fog: Challenges and Advancements in Observations, Modeling, and Forecasting Introduction	MARINE FOG: CHALLENGES AND ADVANCEMENTS IN OBSERVATIONS, MODELING, AND FORECASTING	Springer Atmospheric Sciences											Marine fog has a significant impact on human activities and the environment. A substantial portions of all accidents at sea worldwide occur in the presence of dense fog. Fog's disruption of marine transport, harbor activities, coastal road traffic, and life threatening situations are often in the news. Fog transports droplets and their ions, aerosols, and microorganisms that alter the hydrologic, thermodynamic, nutrient, and toxicological properties of ecosystems in coastal regions. Fog also controls temperature and moisture conditions in coastal areas and consequently affects vegetation and especially forest evolution. Some of the highest degradations of air quality occur during fog under stable and stagnant anticyclonic conditions. In principle, fog forecast models should resolve a huge span of physical processes ranging from the characteristic 10(-7) m scales of aerosols to synoptic processes with scales of 10(6) m, which means the range of the smallest to the largest scales is on an order of 10(13) m. The main variables and processes relevant to fog include aerosols and fog condensation nuclei; microphysics and precipitation; advection; synoptic conditions; air-sea interaction through surface fluxes of heat, latent heat, moisture, and momentum; air and sea surface temperature; ocean currents and upwelling; land-sea interactions and local circulations; characteristics of low marine inversion and entrainment; and coastal topography. The main goal of this book is to provide comprehensive understanding of the major processes leading to formation, evolution, and dissipation of fog by using observations, modeling, and forecasting. Discussed topics include fog observational in situ and remote sensing techniques, worldwide fog climatology, radiation and turbulence properties, microphysics and visibility parameterizations, effects of precipitation on fog, and deterministic and probabilistic fog modeling and forecasting.																	2194-5217		978-3-319-45229-6; 978-3-319-45227-2				2017							1	6		10.1007/978-3-319-45229-6_1	10.1007/978-3-319-45229-6							WOS:000417220400001

Early and Recent Observational Techniques for Fog	MARINE FOG: CHALLENGES AND ADVANCEMENTS IN OBSERVATIONS, MODELING, AND FORECASTING	Springer Atmospheric Sciences											This is a review of ground based instruments and techniques for fog detection and characterization. A review of light transmission and object perception is given as a background for visibility which is central to the definition, detection and intensity of fog. The weather reporting code characterization of fog and related aspects are discussed. The primary detection of fog has been by eye and a key variable is the horizontal visibility distance. Measurement instruments useful for fog are light transmission systems (transmissometers), light scattering visibility sensors, and present weather stations. Nearly universally and widely employed are conventional surface-based temperature and moisture sensors that are useful in identifying fog situations and closely related conditions. Solar radiation and downward longwave radiation instrument measurements are closely related to fog conditions although infrequently used in operational situations. Widely deployed automated meteorological stations have great flexibility to record data using a wide variety of instruments to detect and track meteorological changes related to fog. Automated meteorological stations and instruments are becoming more widely adapted to marine platforms including ships and buoys. Ground based, remote sensing systems at land stations measure structures in the boundary layer closely related to fog and its occurrence. Upward looking, fixed beam microwave systems detect details of the boundary layer including air temperature and moisture. Ceilometers, widely deployed at established airports are mostly used to measure the elevations of cloud bases although are capable of detecting other aspects of the boundary layer. SODAR profilers a capable of resolving small details in the winds from the surface to above 200 m. Radar wind profilers with RASS in low mode generate wind vectors and virtual temperature in approximately 60-100 m bins below about 1.5 km. Ground based scanning radar and lidar, useful for investigating three-dimensional aspects of the boundary layer related to fog conditions are largely restricted to research efforts.																	2194-5217		978-3-319-45229-6; 978-3-319-45227-2				2017							153	244		10.1007/978-3-319-45229-6_3	10.1007/978-3-319-45229-6							WOS:000417220400003

One remote sensing technique, Synthetic Aperture Radar, has shown significant benefits over traditional remote sensing techniques but comes at the price of additional complexities. To adequately cope with these, researchers have begun to employ advanced machine learning techniques known as deep learning to Synthetic Aperture Radar data. Deep learning represents the next stage in the evolution of machine intelligence which places the onus of identifying salient features on the network rather than researcher. This paper will outline machine learning techniques as it has been used previously on SAR; what is deep learning and where it fits in compared to traditional machine learning; what benefits can be derived by applying it to Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery; and finally describe some obstacles that still need to be overcome in order to provide constient and long term results from deep learning in SAR.																			978-1-5386-1990-2				2017																		WOS:000414285000012

Therefore, society and governments require maritime surveillance for early oil spill detection. The fast response in the detection process helps to identify the offenders in the vast majority of cases. Nowadays, it is a human operator whom is trained for carrying out oil spill detection. Operators usually use image processing techniques and data analysis from optical, thermal or radar acquired from aerial vehicles or spatial satellites. The current trend is to automate the oil spill detection process so that this can filter candidate oil spill from an aircraft as a decision support system for human operators. In this work, a robust and automated system for candidate oil spill based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is presented. The aim is to provide a faster identification of candidate oil spills from SLAR scanned sequences. So far, the majority of the research works about oil spill detection are focused on the classification between real oil spills and look-alikes, and they use SAR or optical images but not SLAR data. Moreover, the overall decision is usually taken by an operator, mainly due to the wide variety of types of look-alikes which cause false positives in the detection process using traditional NN. This work provides a RRN-based approach for candidate oil spill detection using SLAR data in contrast with the traditional Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP). The system is tested with time series data acquired from a SLAR sensor mounted on an aircraft. It achieves a success rate in detecting of 97%.																			978-989-758-222-6				2017							372	377		10.5220/0006187103720377								WOS:000413240500043

Quantifying suspended sediment concentration in subglacial sediment plumes discharging from two Svalbard tidewater glaciers using Landsat-8 and in situ measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Marine-terminating outlet glaciers discharge mass through iceberg calving, submarine melting, and meltwater run-off. While calving can be quantified by in situ and remote-sensing observations, meltwater run-off, the subglacial transport of meltwater, and submarine melting are not well constrained due to inherent difficulties observing the subglacial and proglacial environments at tidewater glaciers. Remote-sensing and in situ measurements of surface sediment plumes, and their suspended sediment concentration (SSC), have been used as a proxy for glacier meltwater run-off. However, this relationship between satellite reflectance and SSC has predominantly been established using land-terminating glaciers. Here, we use two Svalbard tidewater glaciers to establish a well-constrained relationship between Landsat-8 surface reflecance and SSC and argue that it can be used to measure relative meltwater runoff at tidewater glaciers throughout a summer melt season. We find the highest correlation between SSCs and Landsat-8 surface reflectance by using the red + NIR band combination (r(2) = 0.76). The highest correlation between SSCs and in situ field spectrometer measurements is in the 740-800 nm wavelength range (r(2) = 0.85), a spectral range not currently measured by Landsat. Additionally, we find that in situ and Landsat-8 measurements for surface reflectance of SSCs are not interchangeable and therefore establish a relationship for each detection method. We then use the Landsat-8 relationship to calculate total surface sediment load, finding a strong correlation between total surface sediment load and a proxy for meltwater run-off (r(2) = 0.89). Our results establish a new metric to calculate SSCs from Landsat-8 surface reflectance and demonstrate how the SSC of subglacial sediment plumes can be used to monitor relative seasonal meltwater discharge at tidewater glaciers.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	23					6865	6881		10.1080/01431161.2017.1365388								WOS:000412545900021

Having a reliable retrieval model is essential to providing frequent and accurate sea surface salinity (SSS) data for marine research. Remote-sensing techniques provide alternatives for SSS data retrieval with its advantages of wide area surveys and real-time monitoring. In the present study, inverse relationship between SSS and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration in the Chinese Bohai Sea was verified. Thus, four simple band ratios of the original remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) used to retrieve the CDOM concentration were compared and tested during SSS retrieval. R-rs (531)/R-rs (551) performed best among the four given band ratios. The model employed here can be applied to derive SSS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.26 practical salinity units (psu) (R-2 = 0.76). A calibration model was verified using a discrete dataset of the measured SSS and was tested further during mapping of SSS in the Chinese Bohai Sea during 2010-2014. The yielded spatial patterns of SSS were satisfactory and an inverse relationship between SSS and the Yellow River discharge was confirmed.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	23					7357	7373		10.1080/01431161.2017.1375570								WOS:000412545900045						
J	Nayak, S				Nayak, Shailesh			Coastal zone management in India - present status and future needs	GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												The coastal zone is a region where land, ocean and atmosphere interact and hence it is dynamic in nature. India has a long coastline which was not adequately monitored until the advent of the satellite remote sensing era in the 70s. India has a very robust remote sensing program that the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) series of satellites were effectively used to monitor coastal habitats, landforms, shoreline, water quality, etc., and changes were identified during the last 40 years. The classification system for coastal habitats and the classification and geometric accuracies of products were standardized. Detailed information for mangroves communities and characteristics of coral reefs were generated. The high and low tide lines were delineated seamlessly for the entire coastline using satellite data. All these data were organized in a GIS and the coastal database for the entire country was created. Impacts of various hazards on such as cyclones, tsunami and sea level changes on coastal habitats were documented. Based on topography, shoreline changes and tides, coastal multi-hazard vulnerability maps were characterized by employing the elevation data derived from satellite data and were prepared for the coastline of India. The information on ocean color and sea surface temperature was used to generate potential fishery advisories, which are provided daily to fishermen. The coastal database was utilized effectively to identify coastal regulation zones, marine protected areas, vulnerable zones, etc. Various services for tsunami, fishery and coral reef bleaching were generated for societal benefits. It is planned to develop models for the coastal zone, so that impeding dangers and likely changes in the coastal zone can be predicted and suitable actions can be undertaken. It is necessary to integrate socio-economic data with the knowledge database of coastal zone to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities and the changing climate on the coastal zone.																	1009-5020	1993-5153					2017	20	2			SI		174	183		10.1080/10095020.2017.1333715								WOS:000409348200011

There are uniqueness problems associated with radiometric remote sensing measurements (like MERIS/MODIS) that ignore polarization effects, and rely on measuring only the radiance. Use of polarization measurements is particularly important for absorbing aerosols over coastal waters as well as over bright targets such as snow-covered and bare sea ice, where it has proved difficult to retrieve aerosol single-scattering albedo from radiance-only spectrometers such as MERIS and MODIS. We use a vector radiative transfer model for the coupled atmosphere-surface system (C-VRTM) in conjunction with an Optimal Estimation/Levenberg-Marquardt (OE/LM) method to quantify how polarization measurements can be used to overcome the uniqueness problems associated with radianceonly retrieval of aerosol parameters. However, this study also indicates that even for existing radiance-only instruments like MERIS and MODIS and future instrument like OLCI, use of a C-VRTM as a forward model in the inversion can lead to significant enhancement of retrieval capabilities, and facilitate simultaneous retrieval of absorbing aerosols and marine parameters in turbid coastal environments.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1478-5				2017	1810								UNSP 120008	10.1063/1.4975582								WOS:000405218500086

It is considered a useful reconnaissance tool to save time and cost to be used in preliminary survey. This paper aims to assess the performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in estimating the bathymetry of the Eastern harbor of Alexandria Egypt as a case study. This area of the case study represents a low turbid, mud bottom and shallow water area. The estimation of shallow water depth is based on ANN fitting algorithms using the logarithms of multispectral bands reflectance value. The estimation of water depths using optical bands of Landsat-8 multispectral images is extracted directly without regard to other environmental factors (bottom type and sea sediments).The images are first corrected for the effects caused by atmospheric conditions and sun specular. The bands are then calibrated using reference measurements obtained using GPS and single beam echo sounder in the study area. The estimated depths using ANN based on bands 1&3, 3 only and 2&3 show higher correlations and lower root mean square error compared the estimation made by previously developed statistically equations which were updated using the same data sets used in developing the ANNs. The ANN has a better capability to estimate the bathymetry using remotely -sensed data extracted from Landsat-8 images. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The dynamic nature of the coast makes it difficult to clearly define the borders of coastal zones. Sometimes these zones are referred to as tidewater areas, extending from the coast to approximately 10 miles inland. Ketchum defined a coastal zone as the band of dry land and adjacent ocean space (water and submerged land) in which terrestrial processes and land uses directly affect oceanic processes and uses and vice versa (Ketchum BH, The water's edge: critical problems of the Coastal zone. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1972). Coastal zones are one of the most ecologically valuable and biodiverse regions in the world. They provide food, freshwater and other marine products for human beings, as well as play an important role in the local environment. However, human activities and global climate change have given rise to natural disasters that threaten coastal zones environmental security. In particular, the effect of industrial projects on coastal zones is worsening. Thus, it is important to study these areas to provide guidance for coastal resource management and environmental protection. Numerous researchers have attempted to monitor coastal zone dynamics based on remote sensing data. In this chapter, we summarize various topics concerning the application of remote sensing in coastal zones. We focus on describing several new methods, including coastline automatic extraction, intertidal zone identification, coastal wetland classification and coastal invasive plant detection, using remote sensing.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9				2017	18						169	203		10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_8	10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2							WOS:000399043100009

Satellite-derived CO2 flux in the surface seawater of the Austral Ocean south of Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A step by step algorithm for air-sea CO2 flux (F(CO2)) calculation from satellite parameters is presented in this study. Parameters used for F(CO2) calculation are: (1) sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS Aqua), (2) sea surface salinity (SSS) estimated from MODIS Aqua SST using multiple linear regression, (3) seawater CO2 fugacity (f(CO2sw)) estimated by MODIS Aqua SST and chl-a using feedforward neural networks, (4) atmospheric CO2 fugacity (f(CO2atm)) from the Cape Grim station, and (5) wind speed from the Quick and Advanced Scatterometer (QSCAT and ASCAT). In situ data provided by (1) the Surveillance de l'Ocean Austral - Monitoring the Southern Ocean (SURVOSTRAL) project, (2) the Integrated Marine Observed System (IMOS) project, and (3) Mesures a l'INterface Eau-aiR de la Variabilite des echanges de CO2 (MINERVE) project collected on the research vessel L'Astrolabe, are used to establish and validate the models. These models are then tested using remote sensing data. This work focus on the southern ocean from the south of Australia to the Antarctica coasts (between 43.5 degrees S and 67 degrees S), on the period of spring and Austral summer (from October to March, between 2002/2003 and 2014/2015). In each step, the result's precision of experiments was determined by the root mean square error (RMSE). Results show (1) an improvement of satellite SSS estimation with a precision of +/- 0.16 using SST and latitude, (2) an estimation of f(CO2sw) by satellite data with a good accuracy of +/- 9.45 mu atm (0.96 Pa), and (3) a calculation of F(CO2) using satellite data with a global RMSE of about +/- 3 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1). The interpolated F(CO2) shows that, in the period of austral spring and summer, this region absorbs the atmospheric CO2, and becomes a stronger sink of CO2 throughout the years (from an overall average absorption of about 2 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2002/2003 to about 7 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2014/2015).																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	6					1600	1625		10.1080/01431161.2017.1286054								WOS:000394651500007

Turbidity is related to the concentration of SPM which usually is measured gravimetrically, a rather time-consuming method. Measuring turbidity is quick and easy, and therefore also more cost-effective. When derived from remote sensing data the method becomes even more cost-effective because of the good spatial resolution of satellite data and the synoptic capability of the method. Turbidity is also listed in the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive as a supporting monitoring parameter, especially in the coastal zone. In this study, we aim to provide a new Baltic Sea algorithm to retrieve SPM concentration from in situ turbidity and investigate how this can be applied to satellite data. An in situ dataset was collected in Swedish coastal waters to develop a new SPM model. The model was then tested against independent datasets from both Swedish and Lithuanian coastal waters. Despite the optical variability in the datasets, SPM and turbidity were strongly correlated (r = 0.97). The developed model predicts SPM reliably from in situ turbidity (R-2 = 0.93) with a mean normalized bias (MNB) of 2.4% for the Swedish and 14.0% for the Lithuanian datasets, and a relative error (RMS) of 25.3% and 37.3%, respectively. In the validation dataset, turbidity ranged from 0.3 to 49.8 FNU (Formazin Nephelometric Unit) and correspondingly, SPM concentration ranged from 0.3 to 34.0 g m(-3) which covers the ranges typical for Baltic Sea waters. Next, the medium-resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) standard SPM product MERIS Ground Segment (MEGS) was tested on all available match-up data (n = 67). The correlation between SPM retrieved from MERIS and in situ SPM was strong for the Swedish dataset with r = 0.74 (RMS = 47.4 and MNB = 11.3%; n = 32) and very strong for the Lithuanian dataset with r = 0.94 (RMS = 29.5% and MNB = -1.5%; n = 35). Then, the turbidity was derived from the MERIS standard SPM product using the new in situ SPM model, but retrieving turbidity from SPM instead. The derived image was then compared to existing in situ data and showed to be in the right range of values for each sub-area. The new SPM model provides a robust and cost-efficient method to determine SPM from in situ turbidity measurements (or vice versa). The developed SPM model predicts SPM concentration with high quality despite the high coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) range in the Baltic Sea. By applying the developed SPM model to already existing remote sensing data (MERIS/Envisat) and most importantly to a new generation of satellite sensors (in particular OLCI on board the Sentinel-3), it is possible to derive turbidity for the Baltic Sea.

In such scenarios, remote sensing data may be available a priori, and can help to build a semantic model of the environment and plan future autonomous missions. In this paper, we introduce two multimodal learning algorithms to model the relationship between visual images taken by an autonomous underwater vehicle during a survey and remotely sensed acoustic bathymetry (ocean depth) data that is available prior to the survey. We present a multi-layer architecture to capture the joint distribution between the bathymetry and visual modalities. We then propose an extension based on gated feature learning models, which allows the model to cluster the input data in an unsupervised fashion and predict visual image features using just the ocean depth information. Our experiments demonstrate that multimodal learning improves semantic classification accuracy regardless of which modalities are available at classification time, allows for unsupervised clustering of either or both modalities, and can facilitate mission planning by enabling class-based or image-based queries.																	0278-3649	1741-3176				JAN	2017	36	1					24	43		10.1177/0278364916679892								WOS:000394774300003

Geoform and Landform Classification of Continental Shelves using Geospatially Integrated IKONOS Satellite Imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Geomorphological characterization of coastal environments along continental shelves depends on accurate interpretation of mesoscale lithic and elastic benthic geoforms and landforms. Using the Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS), cognitive visual interpretations of seafloor geoforms and their associated landforms were conducted along a diverse segment of the southeast (SE) Florida continental shelf. GeoEye IKONOS-2 satellite imagery provided the remotely sensed visual medium on which interpretations were based. With ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software, classification maps were created from the cognitive interpretations to show spatial distribution results of geoform and landform features throughout the study area. Additionally, smaller-scale "call-out figures" documented specific geomorphological associations among the classified units. Analysis attribute tables compared and contrasted the abundance (i.e. number of classifying vector polygons) and calculated areas for each geoform and landform classified. It was determined that classification of geoform and landform benthic features along continental shelves can be achieved where water clarity conditions allow for the cognitive visual interpretation of such seafloor formations. Future studies may build upon the classification of continental shelf geoforms and landforms to integrate more transient biogeomorphological features of the marine environment (e.g., sediment distribution, biological species identification, density of flora and fauna present), thus creating a more detailed and inclusive classification of a selected coastal region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					1	22		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16A-00003.1								WOS:000394926100001

Genetic Description and Remote Sensing Techniques as Management Tools for Zostera noltii Seagrass Populations along the Atlantic Moroccan Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Seagrass meadows provide an essential ecological service in coastal ecosystems worldwide, although they are sensitive to many human factors, as a serious global regression has been documented. During sampling along the Atlantic Moroccan coast, five coastal lagoons were found characterized by the presence of intertidal monospecific seagrass Zostera noltii meadows (from south to north, Nayla, Oualidia, Sidi Moussa, Moulay Bousselham, and Larache). Two descriptive methods used to characterize Z. noltii populations could be used as management tools for future monitoring implementations: (1) the estimation of surface area covered by Z. noltii meadows using remote sensing techniques and in situ field surveys, and (2) the genetic characterisation of Z. noltii populations using simple sequence repeats (microsatellites) as molecular markers. Results revealed that the Nayla lagoon showed the largest area covered by Z. noltii (26,9,868 m(2)) and the highest coverage rate (5.19%), while presenting the lowest genetic/genotypic diversity values (T = 36, (A) over cap =3.58, G=50; R=0.544; H-e=0.43). On the other hand, northern populations displayed lower rates of seagrass coverage (similar to 1%) and higher values of genetic/genotypic diversity. Further genetic characterization also revealed that Z. noltii populations seem to be highly isolated in three geographically independent regions: northern Morocco (R1, Larache and Moulay Bousselham), central Morocco (R2, Oualidia and Sidi Moussa), and southern Morocco (R3, Nayla), which should be considered independent management units. Both seagrass coverage rate and the genetic description of seagrass populations along the Atlantic Moroccan coast seem to be useful management tools that could be used to evaluate changes in seagrass meadows over time to further establish appropriate conservation strategies.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					78	87		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00111.1								WOS:000394926100006

Quantitative reconstruction of Holocene sea ice and sea surface temperature off West Greenland from the first regional diatom data set	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Holocene oceanographic conditions in Disko Bay, West Greenland, were reconstructed from high-resolution diatom records derived from two marine sediment cores. A modern data set composed of 35 dated surface sediment samples collected along the West Greenland coast accompanied by remote sensing data was used to develop a diatom transfer function to reconstruct April sea ice concentration (SIC) supported by July sea surface temperature (SST) in the area. Our quantitative reconstruction shows that oceanographic changes recorded throughout the last similar to 11,000 years reflect seasonal interplay between spring (April SIC) and summer (July SST) conditions. Our records show clear correlation with climate patterns identified from ice core data from GISP2 and Agassiz-Renland for the early to middle Holocene. The early Holocene deglaciation of western Greenland Ice Sheet was characterized in Disko Bay by initial strong centennial-scale fluctuations in April SIC with amplitude of over 40%, followed by high April SIC and July SST. These conditions correspond to a general warming of the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. A decrease in April SIC and July SST was recorded during the Holocene Thermal Optimum reflecting more stable spring-summer conditions in Disko Bay. During the late Holocene, high April SIC characterized the Medieval Climate Anomaly, while high July SST prevailed during the Little Ice Age, supporting previously identified antiphase relationship between surface waters in West Greenland and climate in NW Europe. This antiphase pattern might reflect seasonal variations in regional oceanographic conditions and large-scale fluctuations within the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

J	Malik, A; Mertz, O; Fensholt, R				Malik, Abdul; Mertz, Ole; Fensholt, Rasmus			Mangrove forest decline: consequences for livelihoods and environment in South Sulawesi	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Mangrove forests in the tropics and subtropics grow in saline sediments in coastal and estuarine environments. Preservation of mangrove forests is important for many reasons, including the prevention of coastal erosion and seawater intrusion; the provision of spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds of diverse marine biota; and for direct use (such as firewood, charcoal, and construction material)-all of which benefit the sustainability of local communities. However, for many mangrove areas of the world, unsustainable resource utilization and the profit orientation of communities have often led to rapid and severe mangrove loss with serious consequences. The mangrove forests of the Takalar District, South Sulawesi, are studied here as a case area that has suffered from degradation and declining spatial extent during recent decades. On the basis of a post-classification comparison of change detection from satellite imagery and a survey of households, we provide an estimate of the mangrove change in the Takalar District during 1979-2011 and the consequences of those changes. Mangrove forest areas were reduced by 66.05 % (3344 hectares) during the 33-year period of analysis, and the biggest annual negative change in dense mangrove forest cover (8.37 %) occurred during the period 2006-2011. The changes were caused mainly by the mangrove clearing and conversion to aquaculture, and consequences have been increasing forest degradation, coastal abrasion, seawater intrusion, a decline in fish capture, a reduction in juvenile shrimp and milkfish, and outbreaks of shrimp disease. On the other hand, the clearing and impoundment of mangrove forests for shrimp and seaweed culture have provided a source of foreign exchange and new opportunities for employment in the study area.

Currently, optical and radar satellite images are used to monitor oil spills; however, remote sensing generally needs a long revisit period. Global Navigation Satellite System reflected signals (GNSS-R) can provide all-weather and all-day ocean monitoring and is therefore more suitable for oil spill monitoring. To assess the feasibility of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System reflected signals (BeiDou-R) in detecting oil slicks, a BeiDou-R coastal simulated experiment is performed in this study on the oil slick distribution of an oil pipeline explosion accident. We set up an observation point and selected observation satellites, and a delay-Doppler map (DDM) of an oil-slicked sea surface under coastal scenarios was created by combining the mean-square slope (MSS) model for oil-slicked/clean surfaces and the Zavorotny- Voronovich (Z-V) scattering model. DDM simulation of the coastal scenarios effectively represents the scattering coefficient distribution of the presence of an oil slick. Theoretical analysis revealed that oil slicks can be detected within a radius of less than 5 km around the specular reflection point (SP) for BeiDou-R coastal simulation.

Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression-based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.

Conventional measurements of light attenuation in the PAR domain (K-d(PAR)) is representative for only small areas of water body. Remotely sensed optical imagery can be utilized to monitor K-d(PAR) in large areas of water bodies, based on the relationship between water leaving radiance and K-d(PAR). In this study, six field surveys were conducted over 20 lakes (or reservoirs) across Northeast China from April to September 2015. In order to derive the K-d(PAR) at regional scale, the Landsat/TM/ETM+/OLI and the MODIS daily surface reflectance data (MOD09GA similar to 500 m, Bands 17) were used to establish empirical inversion models. Through multiple stepwise regression analysis, the band difference (Red-Blue) and band ratio (NIR/Red) were used in Landsat imagery modeling, and the band difference (Red-Blue) and ratio (Red/Blue) were used in MODIS imagery modeling. The accuracy of the two models was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation in ten times. The results indicate that the models performed well for both Landsat (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.95, and MRE = 0.33), and MODIS (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.91, and MRE = 0.19) imagery. However, the K-d(PAR) derived by MODIS is slightly higher than that estimated by Landsat (slope = 1.203 and R-2 = 0.972). Consistency of model performance between the MODIS daily (MYDO9G A) and the 8-Day composite reflectance (MYDO9A1) data was verified by K-d(PAR) estimations and regression analysis (slope = 1.044 and R-2 = 0.966). Finally, the spatial and temporal distribution of K-d(PAR) in Northeast China indicated that specific geographical characteristics as well as meteorological alterations can influence K-d(PAR) calibrations. Specifically, we have revealed that the wind speed and algal bloom are the major determinants of K-d(PAR) in Lake Hulun (2050 km(2)) and Xingkai (4412 km(2)).

Traditional spatiotemporal techniques face great challenges in dealing with which, how, and where the marine environmental parameters in different zones help to drive, and respond to, ENSO events. Remote sensing products covering a 15-year period from 1998 to 2012 were used to quantitatively explore these patterns in the Pacific Ocean (PO) by a prevail quantitative association rule mining algorithm, that is, a priori, within a mining framework. The marine environmental parameters considered were monthly anomaly of sea surface chlorophyll-a (CHLA), monthly anomaly of sea surface temperature (SSTA), monthly anomaly of sea level anomaly (SLAA), monthly anomaly of sea surface precipitation (SSPA), and monthly anomaly of sea surface wind speed (WSA). Four significant discoveries are found, namely: (1) Association patterns among marine environmental parameters and ENSO events were found primarily in five sub-regions of the PO: the western PO, the central and eastern tropical PO, the middle of the northern subtropical PO, offshore of the California coast, and the southern PO; (2) In the western and the middle and east of the equatorial PO, the association patterns are more complicated than other regions; (3) The following factors were found to be predicators of and responses to La Nina events: abnormal decrease of SLAA and WSA in the east of the equatorial PO, abnormal decrease of SSPA and WSA in the middle of the equatorial PO, abnormal decrease of SSTA in the eastern and central tropical PO, and abnormal increase of SLAA in the western PO; (4) Only abnormal decrease of CHLA in the middle of the equatorial PO was found to be a predicator of and response to El Nino events. These findings will help to improve our abilities to identify the marine association patterns in factors relating to ENSO events.																	2220-9964					JAN	2017	6	1							32	10.3390/ijgi6010032								WOS:000392983900031

Best performing algorithms are different in the different regions of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, there is indication that the algorithms have to be seasonal as the optical properties of phytoplankton assemblages dominating in spring and summer are different. We modelled 15,600 reflectance spectra using HydroLight radiative transfer model to test 58 previously published empirical algorithms. 7200 of the spectra were modelled using specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) of the open parts of the Baltic Sea in summer and 8400 with SIOPs of spring season. Concentration range of chlorophyll-a, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and suspended matter used in the model simulations were based on the actually measured values available in literature. For each optically active constituent we added one concentration below actually measured minimum and one concentration above the actually measured maximum value in order to test the performance of the algorithms in wider range. 77 in situ reflectance spectra from rocky (Sweden) and sandy (Estonia, Latvia) coastal areas were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms also in coastal waters. Seasonal differences in the algorithm performance were confirmed but we found also algorithms that can be used in both spring and summer conditions. The algorithms that use bands available on OLCI, launched in February 2016, are highlighted as this sensor will be available for Baltic Sea monitoring for coming decades.

Strange lights in the night: using abnormal peaks of light in geolocator data to infer interaction of seabirds with nocturnal fishing vessels	POLAR BIOLOGY												Many seabird species forage at night and potentially interact with nocturnal fishing activities. Jigging fisheries use powerful lights to attract squid, and such high intensity lights can be recorded using global location-sensing loggers (geolocators) attached to seabirds. We use this potential source of information as evidence for interaction of southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus with night fisheries during the non-breeding season. We compared the number of light spikes at night between sexes and evaluated whether the intensity of the light on those geolocator records matched periods of water immersion (wet-dry) of geolocators, as a measure of foraging activity. Females had more night light spikes than males, and although the activity on water was higher during nights with light spikes than nights without light spikes for both sexes, females had a higher probability to be resting on the water when peaks of light were higher. Females moved further north than males and used areas of higher squid fishery activities within Patagonian waters. This type of information is useful to record potential interactions with night fisheries and proposes that future studies should relate the accurate distribution of individuals (from GPS loggers) with light information (geolocators data) to highlight this undocumented interaction. Southern giant petrels are recognized as interacting intensively with fisheries off Patagonia waters with consequences for population dynamics (e.g. mortality through bycatch events).

Uncovering the hidden part of a large ice stream of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, northern Ontario, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This investigation was prompted by an enigmatic ice-flow anomaly (Area A) on the Glacial Map of Canada which covers about 10 000 km(2) in the Hearst/Kapuskasing area of northeastern Ontario. It consists of streamlined landforms and striations indicative of a major ice flow toward 130 degrees oriented at right angle to another toward 220 degrees. Both are late glacial flows but long-lasting disagreement exists regarding their relative age. The analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images in conjunction with a detailed survey of bedrock cross-striated surfaces over an area of about 30 000 km(2) within and around Area A clearly indicate that the 130 flow preceded the 220 degrees flow. The earlier conflicting interpretations within Area A are attributed mainly to the sporadic occurrence of relict striated surfaces formed by older southwestward (220 degrees-240 degrees) Wisconsinan ice flows that have locally escaped destruction by late glacial flows, with the result that the southwestward flows are older (Wisconsinan) at some sites and younger (late glacial 220 degrees) at others relative to the 130 degrees flow. When considered with other factors such as the maximum elevation reached by the youngest late glacial flow, these ice-flow relationships indicate that Area A is the outcropping southern part of a much larger ESE ice-flow system, which is probably related to a large fluted belt located to the north and that was identified as the Winisk Ice Stream. The distal part of the ice stream, except for Area A, escaped detection by remote sensing mapping methods because depositional and erosional features associated with it are masked by deposits laid down by the younger (220 degrees, Cochrane) ice flow and/or by postglacial marine and organic deposits (or were destroyed by the younger ice flow). The only reliable indicators of the passage of the ice stream in this "buried" section are ESE relict striations crossed by SW striations. The advancing ice stream toward the ESE not only preceded the late Cochrane 220 degrees flow but probably outlasted it, as suggested by the mapping of several thousand iceberg furrows in Quebec and Ontario, also directed toward the ESE and overprinted on flutes formed by the last glacial flow. If this interpretation is correct, this makes the Winisk Ice stream the largest terrestrial ice stream in the Hudson Bay basin. An alternative interpretation associates this fluted belt to the exposed western fringe of streamlined bedforms from a late Hudson lobe buried by younger sediments.

J	Cheng, HY; Chien, H				Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Chien, Hwa			Implementation of S-band marine radar for surface wave measurement under precipitation	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Civil marine radar, which operates at a low grazing-incidence angle and with horizontal polarization in transmitting and receiving, can be modified and used as a primary tool for surface wave monitoring. The high spatial resolutions of sea-clutter image sequences from X-band radar offer a means of deriving individual waves and wave field at low-cost. However, the performance of X-band radar is impaired under rainy conditions, which are usually accompanied by the severe weather at sea. In the present study, we examine the effectiveness of S-band radar for wave measurements under precipitation. The results of comprehensive comparative studies with sea-truth data show that S-band radar is capable of carrying out wave measurements in rainy conditions. Although the longer wavelength of the S-band leads to a coarser resolution of radar imagery, the S-band radar features at least the equivalent performance of the X-band system in non-rainy conditions, in terms of wave height measurement. The results suggest that the S-band and X-band could be complementary systems. In rainy conditions the S-band is more efficient but in the non-rainy periods the X-band gives more confident results. The relationship of significant wave height with radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the modulation transfer function (MTF) between radar spectrum and wave spectrum for the used X-band and S-band radars are established and discussed in this paper.

Ba/Ca ratios in shells of Arctica islandica - Potential environmental proxy and crossdating tool	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Ba/Ca-shell time-series of marine bivalves typically show flat background levels which are interrupted by erratic sharp peaks. Evidence from the literature indicates that background Ba/Ca-shell ratios broadly reflect salinity conditions. However, the causes for the Ba/Ca-shell peaks are still controversial and widely debated although many researchers link these changes to primary productivity, freshwater input or spawning events. The most striking feature is that the Ba/Ca-shell peaks are highly synchronous in contemporaneous specimens from the same population. For the first time, we studied Ba/Ca-shell in mature and ontogenetically old (up to 251 year-old) specimens of the long-lived Arctica islandica. Also, we analyzed specimens from surface water and deeper water. The typical pattern of low background and erratic peaks persisted throughout ontogeny. However, due to decreasing sampling resolution and greater time-averaging in older, slower growing shell portions, the background Ba/Ca-shell values appeared to gradually increase with ontogenetic age, whereas the peaks became attenuated and broader. Despite that, Ba/Ca-shell maxima were still highly synchronous among contemporaneous specimens from the same locality and habitat confirming previous reports from short-lived species. Computing of annual Ba/Cashen averages largely eliminated any bias introduced by time-averaging and sampling resolution. Strongly elevated annual Ba/Cashell peaks in specimens from surface waters (Iceland, Faroe Islands, Isle of Man) during the 1980s appear to coincide with an extreme primary productivity pulse recorded by remote sensing. However, due to the lack of in vivo experiments, we cannot ultimately test a causal link between annual Ba/Ca-shell excursions and primary productivity. We propose that Ba/Ca-shell time-series, specifically the highly synchronous Ba/Ca-shell peaks and annual Ba/Ca-shell values in contemporaneous specimens from the same locality can serve as a tool to verify crossdating and facilitate the construction of statistically robust growth increment width master chronologies. Long-term environmental reconstructions based on bivalve shell growth chronologies can likely greatly benefit from this new technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Geological and Exploration Models of Beach Placer Deposits, Integrated from Case-Studies of Southern Australia	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												The processes leading to the formation of beach placer deposits generally begin inland and terminate at the coast, including source rocks being weathered, eroded and then transported by streams and rivers to the coast, where the sediments are deposited in a variety of coastal environments. The coastal sediments are reworked by the action of waves, tides, longshore currents and wind, which are effective processes for sorting the mineral grains based on differences in their size and density, resulting in laminated or lens-shaped packages of sediments up to tens of meters thick that are rich in heavy minerals. Detailed studies of sedimentary basins, as well as peripheral (paleo-)valleys that drained sediment source areas, are important tools in the exploration for heavy mineral resources. Knowledge of the ( paleo-)basin, associated valley architecture and the source of heavy minerals concentrated in the shorelines and valleys are useful guides to the potential for, and location of, economic deposits. Evidence from sedimentology can be combined with that from other geological and geophysical characteristics to arrive at a general reconstruction of basin and paleovalley architecture and depositional environments. Complex paleogeography of the shorelines can influence or determine the sites of heavy mineral concentration. Heavy mineral sands tend to concentrate in certain shoreline settings during storm activity. Repeated storm erosion and reworking over centuries (e.g., the southeastern coast of Australia) or millennia (e.g., the Eucla and Murray Basins of Australia) can progressively enrich heavy mineral sand deposits. Preservation of these deposits over a geological timeframe of millions of years can ensue through subsidence of coastal sediments, and during sea level change that results in either shorelines migrating inland (marine transgression) or seaward (marine regression), potentially burying or stranding earlier deposits or reworking them to form younger deposits. Refinements in remote sensing and geophysical techniques, data processing, sedimentology and computer-aided interpretations provide effective, economic and efficient methods for modeling coastal reconstructions and for exploring provinces and terrains prospective for heavy mineral sand deposits. Landscape topography analysis, combined with geophysical methods that can resolve physical property contrasts between the shoreline sediments and underlying sequences, are increasingly used in mineral exploration to locate and to reconstruct paleoshorelines and paleovalleys. Australia has modern and ancient beach-placer deposits, both of which show many similar geologic features. The formation of these heavy mineral deposits provides one of the best examples of applying knowledge of modern systems (e.g., the west and east coasts of Australia) as an analogue to interpret and understand the geology and form of ancient deposits (e.g., the Eucla and Murray Basins of southern Australia). This study provides descriptive and exploration models of Australia's heavy mineral sand deposits formed in coastal environments, which can be applied to similar settings worldwide.

J	Costantino, D; Angelini, MG				Costantino, Domenica; Angelini, Maria Giuseppa			Thermal monitoring using an ASTER image	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												The research is focused on the study of the applicability of remote sensing techniques (specifically using ASTER data) for marine environmental analysis, relative to the determination of the surface temperatures. Using a multitemporal approach, two images (classified as level1B), acquired in August 2000 and in 2005, were considered. The thermal maps were realized by means of the emissivity spectral normalization method, defining the thermal gradients in the area under investigation. The spatial and temporal anomalies related to the temperature distribution were highlighted; these anomalies represent an important parameter for the identification of probable groundwater pollution and soil contamination. To define the map of the surface temperature using thermal infrared ASTER channels, a numerical model dedicated to ASTER data was implemented during the experimentation. This model is based on the principle of interpolation of the type "least square interpolation (linear)," and it implies a reduction in the number of unknowns to obtain an acceptable solution to the problem. This experimental model has provided good results in the phase of implementation and in the tests on a synthetic image that were simulated in the laboratory. However, further verifications and modifications are necessary for the processing of real ASTER images.

In this study, based on in situ measurements of the backscattering coefficient (b(bp)(lambda)), particle biogeochemical variables and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) in two typical shallow and semi-enclosed seas, namely the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS) during the late spring, late summer and late autumn, we examined particulate pseudo-backscattering efficiency variability at 640 nm (P_Q(bbe)(640)) and related optical effects. The results show that the P_Q(bbe)(640) levels varied by nearly two orders for all of the samples examined. This high degree of P_Q(bbe)(640) variability significantly affected bbp(640) and the mass-specific backscattering coefficient (b(bp)*(640)), showing that approximately 63.7% and 20.8% of the variability in the b(bp)*(640) and b(bp)(640) was attributed to the P_Q(bbe)(640), respectively. More importantly, consistent with the observations of Wang et al. [J. Geophys. Res.: Oceans 121, 3955 (2016)], the P_Q(bbe)(640) results clearly showed two clusters and this clustering changed the relationships between b(bp)*(640), b(bp)(640) and R-rs(640) with the biogeochemical variables. However, we confirm that P_Q(bbe)(640) clustering generally remained intact across seasons. Therefore, a simple scheme based on a threshold of the P_Q(bbe)(640) data is proposed for the classification of particle types. With this classification, impacts of P_Q(bbe)(640) on b(bp)*(640) and b(bp)(640) were clearly reduced, and co-variation trends of b(bp)*(640), b(bp)(640) and R-rs(640) with biogeochemical variables can be in turn more accurately described. Overall, this study provides general information on P_Q(bbe)(640) variability in the BS and the YS and consequent effects on optical properties. The scheme for particle type classification may also provide a useful basis for better modeling marine biogeochemical processes related to particulate backscattering and for the development of ocean color algorithms.

The study adopted an integrated approach, using in situ and remote sensing data, as well as the output of current models. The data reveal variability in the area's hydrography induced by local freshwater sources, the Western Adriatic Current (WAC) flowing from the north along the Italian coast, and the current patterns under different wind regimes. Specifically, exchange with offshore waters in the gulf induces variability in salinity and biogeochemical content, even within the same season, i.e. winter, in our case. This strong dependence on physical and biogeochemical factors makes the Manfredonia-Gargano ecosystem vulnerable to climate change, which could compromise its important role as a nursery area for the Adriatic Sea.

Spatial and temporal variability of ground and satellite column measurements of NO2 and O-3 over the Atlantic Ocean during the Deposition of Atmospheric Nitrogen to Coastal Ecosystems Experiment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In situ measurements of O-3 and nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx) and remote sensing measurements of total column NO2 and O-3 were collected on a ship in the North Atlantic Ocean as part of the Deposition of Atmospheric Nitrogen to Coastal Ecosystems (DANCE) campaign in July- August 2014, similar to 100 km east of the mid-Atlantic United States. Relatively clean conditions for both surface in situ mixing ratio and total column O-3 and NO2 measurements were observed throughout the campaign. Increased surface and column NO2 and O-3 amounts were observed when a terrestrial air mass was advected over the study region. Relative to ship-based total column measurements using a Pandora over the entire study, satellite measurements overestimated total column NO2 under these relatively clean atmospheric conditions over offshore waters by an average of 16%. Differences are most likely due to proximity, or lack thereof, to surface emissions; spatial averaging due to the field of view of the satellite instrument; and the lack of sensitivity of satellite measurements to the surface concentrations of pollutants. Total column O-3 measurements from the shipboard Pandora showed good correlation with the satellite measurements (r = 0.96), but satellite measurements were 3% systematically higher than the ship measurements, in agreement with previous studies. Derived values of boundary layer height using the surface in situ and total column measurements of NO2 are much lower than modeled and satellite-retrieved boundary layer heights, which highlight the differences in the vertical distribution between terrestrial and marine environments.

J	Bi, JR; Huang, JP; Holben, B; Zhang, GL				Bi, Jianrong; Huang, Jianping; Holben, Brent; Zhang, Guolong			Comparison of key absorption and optical properties between pure and transported anthropogenic dust over East and Central Asia	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Asian dust particulate is one of the primary aerosol constituents in the Earth-atmosphere system that exerts profound influences on environmental quality, human health, the marine biogeochemical cycle, and Earth's climate. To date, the absorptive capacity of dust aerosol generated from the Asian desert region is still an open question. In this article, we compile columnar key absorption and optical properties of mineral dust over East and Central Asian areas by utilizing the multiyear quality-assured datasets observed at 13 sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). We identify two types of Asian dust according to threshold criteria from previously published literature. (1) The particles with high aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD(440) >= 0.4) and a low Angstrom wavelength exponent at 440-870 nm (alpha < 0.2) are defined as Pure Dust (PDU), which decreases disturbance of other non-dust aerosols and keeps high accuracy of pure Asian dust. (2) The particles with AOD(440) >= 0.4 and 0.2 < alpha < 0.6 are designated as Transported Anthropogenic Dust (TDU), which is mainly dominated by dust aerosol and might mix with other anthropogenic aerosol types. Our results reveal that the primary components of high AOD days are predominantly dust over East and Central Asian regions, even if their variations rely on different sources, distance from the source, emission mechanisms, and meteorological characteristics. The overall mean and standard deviation of single-scattering albedo, asymmetry factor, real part and imaginary part of complex refractive index at 550 nm for Asian PDU are 0.935 +/- 0.014, 0.742 +/- 0.008, 1.526 +/- 0.029, and 0.00226 +/- 0.00056, respectively, while corresponding values are 0.921 +/- 0.021, 0.723 +/- 0.009, 1.521 +/- 0.025, and 0.00364 +/- 0.0014 for Asian TDU. Aerosol shortwave direct radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), at the surface (SFC), and in the atmospheric layer (ATM) for Asian PDU (alpha < 0.2) and TDU (0.2 < alpha < 0.6) computed in this study, are a factor of 2 smaller than the results of Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) mineral-accumulated (mineral-acc.) and mineral-transported (mineral-tran.) modes. Therefore, we are convinced that our results hold promise for updating and improving accuracies of Asian dust characteristics in present-day remote sensing applications and regional or global climate models.																	1680-7316	1680-7324				DEC 15	2016	16	24					15501	15516		10.5194/acp-16-15501-2016								WOS:000391486900005						
J	Freeman, LA; Freeman, SE				Freeman, Lauren A.; Freeman, Simon E.			Rapidly obtained ecosystem indicators from coral reef soundscapes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Present-day coral reef ecosystem monitoring techniques can be costly, labor-intensive point measurements that can potentially introduce intractable sampling bias and error. Here we report correlations between visually obtained ecological assessment metrics and concurrently recorded aspects of the underwater biological soundscape over coral reefs at 23 sites spanning the Hawaiian Islands archipelago. Sites from the 'cool tropics' oceanographic habitat grouped along a principal component defined by an acoustic sliding scale: from protected or more remote sites at which lower frequencies were more dominant, to degraded sites which produced soundscapes dominated by higher frequency sound. Positive correlations between ambient biological sounds below 2 kHz and the density of benthic invertebrates (Pearson's rho = 0.61-0.76), their predators (rho = 0.65-0.8), organism-scale bathymetric complexity (rho = 0.6-0.62) and the quantity of crustose coralline algae (rho = 0.6-0.62) suggest a connection between this part of the spectrum, habitat complexity and the density of benthic fauna. A positive correlation was also observed between the daytime soundscape in the 2 to 20 kHz band and the proportion of benthic fleshy macroalgal cover (rho = 0.63-0.7), an indicator of reef degradation. This study indicates the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and spatially integrative remote sensing of the ecological state of coral reefs. Such quantitative methods could be used to ecologically assess vast areas of reef habitat autonomously in near real-time and could be important for remote in situ detection and characterization of subtle but significant ecological changes brought about by climate change and other more localized anthropogenic impacts.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC 15	2016	561						69	82		10.3354/meps11938								WOS:000391695800005						
J	Michibata, T; Suzuki, K; Sato, Y; Takemura, T				Michibata, Takuro; Suzuki, Kentaroh; Sato, Yousuke; Takemura, Toshihiko			The source of discrepancies in aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions between GCM and A-Train retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosol-cloud interactions are one of the most uncertain processes in climate models due to their nonlinear complexity. A key complexity arises from the possibility that clouds can respond to perturbed aerosols in two opposite ways, as characterized by the traditional "cloud lifetime" hypothesis and more recent "buffered system" hypothesis. Their importance in climate simulations remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the response of the liquid water path (LWP) to aerosol perturbations for warm clouds from the perspective of general circulation model (GCM) and A-Train remote sensing, through process-oriented model evaluations. A systematic difference is found in the LWP response between the model results and observations. The model results indicate a near-global uniform increase of LWP with increasing aerosol loading, while the sign of the response of the LWP from the A-Train varies from region to region. The satellite-observed response of the LWP is closely related to meteorological and/or macrophysical factors, in addition to the microphysics. The model does not reproduce this variability of cloud susceptibility (i.e., sensitivity of LWP to perturbed aerosols) because the parameterization of the autoconversion process assumes only suppression of rain formation in response to increased cloud droplet number, and does not consider macrophysical aspects that serve as a mechanism for the negative responses of the LWP via enhancements of evaporation and precipitation. Model biases are also found in the precipitation microphysics, which suggests that the model generates rainwater readily even when little cloud water is present. This essentially causes projections of unrealistically frequent and light rain, with high cloud susceptibilities to aerosol perturbations.

The refinement of BGC models through the assimilation of variables calculated from observed in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs), such as phytoplankton absorption, is problematic. Empirically derived relationships between IOPs and variables such as chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl a), total suspended solids (TSS) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been shown to have errors that can exceed 100% of the observed quantity. These errors are greatest in shallow coastal regions, such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), due to the additional signal from bottom reflectance. Rather than assimilate quantities calculated using IOP algorithms, this study demonstrates the advantages of assimilating quantities calculated directly from the less error-prone satellite remote-sensing reflectance (RSR). To assimilate the observed RSR, we use an in-water optical model to produce an equivalent simulated RSR and calculate the mismatch between the observed and simulated quantities to constrain the BGC model with a deterministic ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF). The traditional assumption that simulated surface Chl a is equivalent to the remotely sensed OC3M estimate of Chl a resulted in a forecast error of approximately 75 %. We show this error can be halved by instead using simulated RSR to constrain the model via the assimilation system. When the analysis and forecast fields from the RSR-based assimilation system are compared with the non-assimilating model, a comparison against independent in situ observations of Chl a, TSS and dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO3, NH4 and DIP) showed that errors are reduced by up to 90 %. In all cases, the assimilation system improves the simulation compared to the non-assimilating model. Our approach allows for the incorporation of vast quantities of remote-sensing observations that have in the past been discarded due to shallow water and/or artefacts introduced by terrestrially derived TSS and CDOM or the lack of a calibrated regional IOP algorithm.				skerratt, Jennifer/F-2010-2015; Robson, Barbara/B-8296-2008; Baird, Mark/D-7172-2015; Jones, Emlyn/D-4525-2011; matear, richard/C-5133-2011	skerratt, Jennifer/0000-0001-9023-4692; Robson, Barbara/0000-0002-1811-3527; Baird, Mark/0000-0003-4955-2298; Jones, Emlyn/0000-0002-7636-288X; Margvelashvili, Nugzar/0000-0003-2045-9946												1726-4170	1726-4189				DEC 7	2016	13	23					6441	6469		10.5194/bg-13-6441-2016								WOS:000391123700001						
J	Ibrahim, A; Gilerson, A; Chowdhary, J; Ahmed, S				Ibrahim, Amir; Gilerson, Alexander; Chowdhary, Jacek; Ahmed, Samir			Retrieval of macro- and micro-physical properties of oceanic hydrosols from polarimetric observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing has mainly relied on measurements of scalar radiance and its spectral and angular features to retrieve micro- and macro-physical properties of aerosols/hydrosols. However, it is recognized that measurements that include the polarimetric characteristics of light provide more intrinsic information about particulate scattering. To take advantage of this, we used vector radiative transfer (VRT) simulations and developed an analytical relationship to retrieve the macro and micro-physical properties of the oceanic hydrosols. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between the observed degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and the ratio of attenuation to-absorption coefficients (c/a) in water, from which the scattering coefficient can be readily computed (b = c - a), after retrieving a. This relationship was parameterized for various scattering geometries, including sensor zenith/azimuth angles relative to the Sun's principal plane, and for varying Sun zenith angles. An inversion method was also developed for the retrieval of the microphysical properties of hydrosols, such as the bulk refractive index and the particle size distribution. The DoLP vs c/a relationship was tested and validated against in-situ measurements of underwater light polarization obtained by a custom-built polarimeter and measurements of the coefficients a and c, obtained using an in-water WET Labs ac-s instrument package. These measurements confirmed the validity of the approach, with retrievals of attenuation coefficients showing a high coefficient of determination depending on the wavelength.

Experimental studies of thermal radiation intensity dependence on near-water wind speed for rough sea surface	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												The results of in situ measurements of the characteristics of intrinsic microwave radiation from the sea surface are presented. The studies were carried out on the oceanographic platform of the Experimental Department of Marine Hydrophysical Institute during the summer-fall periods for 3 years, which made it possible to accumulate a significant amount of information on the change in the radiation intensity of under different meteorological conditions. Attention is primarily focused on the construction of wind-radiation dependences and their steepness analysis based on the measurement data obtained by a radiometer-polarimeter with a central frequency of received radiation equal to 37.7 GHz. The results are compared with the previous experimental studies and the model estimates of this effect.																	0001-4338	1555-628X				DEC	2016	52	9					911	919		10.1134/S0001433816090218								WOS:000394270700004

Polarimetric radars and polarimetric SAR data in tasks of detection and identification of marine oil pollution	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Detecting and distinguishing different kinds of oil pollution, including spills of crude oil on the sea surface, is one important problem of modern remote sensing. The wide use of imaging radars is not always effective. In this review paper, the main principles and methods of polarization radar imaging and radar data processing are discussed based on present theoretical and experimental approaches and ideas. The efficiency of polarimetric methods for oil-spill detection and accurate identification on the sea surface is demonstrated as well.

Navigating the currents of seascape genomics: how spatial analyses can augment population genomic studies	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												Population genomic approaches are making rapid inroads in the study of non-model organisms, including marine taxa. To date, these marine studies have predominantly focused on rudimentary metrics describing the spatial and environmental context of their study region (e.g., geographical distance, average sea surface temperature, average salinity). We contend that a more nuanced and considered approach to quantifying seascape dynamics and patterns can strengthen population genomic investigations and help identify spatial, temporal, and environmental factors associated with differing selective regimes or demographic histories. Nevertheless, approaches for quantifying marine landscapes are complicated. Characteristic features of the marine environment, including pelagic living in flowing water (experienced by most marine taxa at some point in their life cycle), require a well-designed spatial-temporal sampling strategy and analysis. Many genetic summary statistics used to describe populations may be inappropriate for marine species with large population sizes, large species ranges, stochastic recruitment, and asymmetrical gene flow. Finally, statistical approaches for testing associations between seascapes and population genomic patterns are still maturing with no single approach able to capture all relevant considerations. None of these issues are completely unique to marine systems and therefore similar issues and solutions will be shared for many organisms regardless of habitat. Here, we outline goals and spatial approaches for landscape genomics with an emphasis on marine systems and review the growing empirical literature on seascape genomics. We review established tools and approaches and highlight promising new strategies to overcome select issues including a strategy to spatially optimize sampling. Despite the many challenges, we argue that marine systems may be especially well suited for identifying candidate genomic regions under environmentally mediated selection and that seascape genomic approaches are especially useful for identifying robust locus-by-environment associations.

Theories for water vapor isotopic composition have been developed by extending the theories that have been used for the isotopic composition of precipitation to include a more nuanced understanding of evaporation, large-scale mixing, deep convection, and kinetic fractionation. The technologies for in situ and remote sensing measurements of water vapor isotopic composition have developed especially rapidly over the last decade, with discrete water vapor sampling methods, based on mass spectroscopy, giving way to laser spectroscopic methods and satellite-and ground-based infrared absorption techniques. The simulation of water vapor isotopic composition has evolved from General Circulation Model (GCM) methods for simulating precipitation isotopic composition to sophisticated isotope-enabled microphysics schemes using higher-order moments for water and ice size distributions. The incorporation of isotopes into GCMs has enabled more detailed diagnostics of the water cycle and has led to improvements in its simulation. The combination of improved measurement and modeling of water vapor isotopic composition opens the door to new advances in our understanding of the atmospheric water cycle, in processes ranging from the marine boundary layer, through deep convection and tropospheric mixing, and into the water cycle of the stratosphere. Finally, studies of the processes governing modern water vapor isotopic composition provide an improved framework for the interpretation of paleoclimate proxy records of the hydrological cycle.

Geomorphology and late Holocene accretion history of Adele Reef: a northwest Australian mid-shelf platform reef	GEO-MARINE LETTERS												The mid-shelf reefs of the Kimberley Bioregion are one of Australia's more remote tropical reef provinces and such have received little attention from reef researchers. This study describes the geomorphology and late Holocene accretion history of Adele Reef, a mid-shelf platform reef, through remote sensing of contemporary reef habitats, shallow seismic profiling, shallow percussion coring and radiocarbon dating. Seismic profiling indicates that the Holocene reef sequence is 25 to 35 m thick and overlies at least three earlier stages of reef build-up, interpreted as deposited during marine isotope stages 5, 7 and 9 respectively. The cored shallow subsurface facies of Adele Reef are predominantly detrital, comprising small coral colonies and fragments in a sandy matrix. Reef cores indicate a 'catch-up' growth pattern, with the reef flat being approximately 5-10 m deep when sea level stabilised at its present elevation 6,500 years BP. The reef flat is rimmed by a broad low-relief reef crest only 10-20 cm high, characterised by anastomosing ridges of rhodoliths and coralliths. The depth of the Holocene/last interglacial contact (25-30 m) suggests a subsidence rate of 0.2 mm/year for Adele Reef since the last interglacial. This value, incorporated with subsidence rates from Cockatoo Island (inshore) and Scott Reefs (offshore), provides the first quantitative estimate of hinge subsidence for the Kimberley coast and adjacent shelf, with progressively greater subsidence across the shelf.

Microphysical and optical characteristics of these clouds were studied as well as the impact of aerosols on these properties. Microphysical and optical cloud properties were derived using the algorithm SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Clouds). Ground-based in situ measurements of aerosol concentrations and the transport path of air masses at cloud level were investigated as well. The cloud properties were studied in dependence of the prevailing air mass at cloud level and season. We found higher cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) and smaller effective radii (r(eff)) with greater pollution. Median CDNC ranged from 60 cm(-3) in marine air masses to 160 cm(-3) in continental air. Median reff ranged from 8 mu m in polluted conditions to 10 mu m in marine air. Effective droplet size distributions were broader in marine than in continental cases. Cloud optical thickness (COT) and albedo were lower in cleaner air masses and higher in more polluted conditions, with medians ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 and 0.22 to 0.39, respectively. However, calculation of COT and albedo was strongly affected by liquid water path (LWP) and departure from adiabatic conditions. A comparison of SYRSOC results with MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations showed large differences for LWP and COT but good agreement for reff with a linear fit with slope near 1 and offset of -1 mu m.

We aggregated data according to different granularities and estimated climatologies and anomalies. We also studied the phenology of phytoplankton blooms determining bloom starting date and date of maximum concentration. Finally, we estimated and described statistical indexes such as bloom occurrence frequency. The results obtained provide an overview of the evolution and the spatio-temporal variability of chl-a that, in general, and despite its limitations, was complementary and consistent with previous studies based on both satellite and in situ data. This study intended to set the baseline to study algal blooms and their variability in the Argentinian sea, which is valuable information to be included in predictive models related to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms, dynamics of marine system and the effects of global changes over climatic and biogeochemical cycles. In addition, this study also contributes with more up-to-date science data for the future Argentinian and Brazilian SABIA-Mar ocean color mission, which will provide high resolution data (200 m) over the Argentinian coastal zones and continental shelf. Besides the results per se, the relevance of this study is also related to the use of an novel free and open source tool.

Skipjack tuna play a vital role in the marine ecosystem, particularly in tropical waters of the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). However, climate change may affect the characteristics of fishery resources, leading to substantial reallocation and reduction of the biomass of this species in the WCPO. In this study, catch and effort data for skipjack tuna were collected from a purse seine fishery and subsequently analyzed in combination with remote-sensing environmental variables and simulation data from climate models under various scenarios. Generalized additive models were developed to examine the relationships between environmental variations and the species' catch per unit effort and thus evaluate the potential effects of climate change. The catch potential of this stock was estimated under various greenhouse gas emission scenarios (2015-2050) currently under consideration by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The highest catch potential was associated with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, whereas the catch potential remained relatively stable under the scenario with lower emissions. To sustainably utilize skipjack tuna as a resource, the impact of climate change on the stock under various global warming scenarios should be considered in the assessment and management of fisheries for this species.																	1023-2796					DEC	2016	24	6					1053	1062		10.6119/JMST-016-0713-1								WOS:000391418600002

Unlike previous studies that focused on the extraction of topographic changes from intertidal digital elevation models (DEMs), information on landform change is assessed in the present study by considering both topography and surface sediment characteristics. DEMs in 2000 and 2010 were first generated using waterlines extracted from 16 Landsat images. Mean grain size distribution maps were also generated by interpolating sample data acquired in the field in 2002 and 2012. The non-spatial and spatial characteristics of the landform change in the study area were then analyzed using contingency table plots and difference maps, respectively. Overall sedimentation and coarsening of surface sediments caused by different local marine energy environments were dominant in the study area during the 10-year period. The combined analysis also revealed a close relationship between the changes in topography and grain size. Sedimentation was dominant mainly in areas with fine-grained sediments, while a coarsening trend in the sediments increased with elevation. Moreover, it was possible to locate specific areas in which erosion and a fining trend of surface sediments were observed, which differed from the overall trend of change in the study area. These case study results indicate that the combined analysis of both topography and surface sediment characteristics is very useful in the exploration and monitoring of landform changes in tidal flats.																	1023-2796					DEC	2016	24	6					1070	1080		10.6119/JMST-016-0729-1								WOS:000391418600004

A flexural bulge related to the weight of the Makran has migrated at 4 cm/a through the previously uplifted Hajar Mountains of Oman as this active convergence and collision between Arabia and Eurasia progresses, adding approximately another 500 meters of relief, and forming a series of uplifted marine terraces, alluvial terraces, and planation surfaces that record the passage of the bulge. We use a combination of field studies, remote sensing and GIS to map and better-understand these terraces, and elucidate how the tectonics of bulge migration, down-to-trench normal faulting, and eustatic sea level changes have interacted to produce the extant geomorphic features on the inner slope of the flexural bulge as it sinks into the foredeep of the Gulf of Oman. We speculate those terraces that were uplifted on the outer slope of the forebulge as it initially migrated through the passive margin (affected by ophiolite obduction in the Cretaceous) 3.75-7.5 Ma ago are now sinking on the inner slope of the forebulge (corresponding to the outer trench slope in the foredeep), and have been partly covered by Quaternary marine terraces related to a Weichselian sea level high stand. Both the Tertiary and Quaternary terraces are cut by faults related to the active collision, confirming that there is a significant risk of moderate earthquakes in the region.

Year-round spatial movements and trophic ecology of Trindade Petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana)	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Trindade Petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana) are vulnerable gadfly petrels that breed on the remote Trindade Island, located similar to 1100 km off the Brazilian coast. Little is known about their spatial ecology, and their trophic ecology has only been described for the breeding season. We tagged four Trindade Petrels with global location sensing loggers (GLS) from October 2013 to November 2014 and sampled the blood and feathers (innermost primary and the eighth secondary) of 14 individuals to evaluate their year-round spatial and isotopic ecology. We examined individual distributions, habitat use and suitability, activity, and isotopic values during the breeding, migration, and non-breeding periods. Trindade Petrels used areas in the southwest Atlantic Ocean (between 10 degrees N and 50 degrees S in latitude) during the breeding season. They migrated through pelagic waters of the tropical Atlantic to the northwest Atlantic, where they spent the non-breeding season. Trindade Petrels used mostly tropical to subtropical waters in areas of intermediate to high wind speeds and low marine productivity. Individuals spent more time foraging at night than during the day. During the breeding season, birds in northerly areas had higher carbon-13 values, and birds that used more pelagic areas foraged on prey at a higher trophic level (higher nitrogen-15 values) than those in more southern and coastal areas. Isotopic values during the breeding, migration, and non-breeding periods differed, possibly due to differences among individuals in their at-sea distribution throughout the year. We confirmed the non-breeding distribution of Trindade Petrels, which was previously known only from vessel sightings and stranded birds. Our results also suggest a strong temporal segregation in the at-sea distribution and trophic ecology between two groups of individuals, which might indicate the existence of two separate breeding populations.

Quantifying the human influence on fire ignition across the western USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Humans have a profound effect on fire regimes by increasing the frequency of ignitions. Although ignition is an integral component of understanding and predicting fire, to date fire models have not been able to isolate the ignition location, leading to inconsistent use of anthropogenic ignition proxies. Here, we identified fire ignitions from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area Product (2000-2012) to create the first remotely sensed, consistently derived, and regionally comprehensive fire ignition data set for the western United States. We quantified the spatial relationships between several anthropogenic land-use/disturbance features and ignition for ecoregions within the study area and used hierarchical partitioning to test how the anthropogenic predictors of fire ignition vary among ecoregions. The degree to which anthropogenic features predicted ignition varied considerably by ecoregion, with the strongest relationships found in the Marine West Coast Forest and North American Desert ecoregions. Similarly, the contribution of individual anthropogenic predictors varied greatly among ecoregions. Railroad corridors and agricultural presence tended to be the most important predictors of anthropogenic ignition, while population density and roads were generally poor predictors. Although human population has often been used as a proxy for ignitions at global scales, it is less important at regional scales when more specific land uses (e.g., agriculture) can be identified. The variability of ignition predictors among ecoregions suggests that human activities have heterogeneous impacts in altering fire regimes within different vegetation types and geographies.

J	Yuan, Y; Lin, JZ; Wang, Q				Yuan, Yuan; Lin, Jianzhe; Wang, Qi			Hyperspectral Image Classification via Multitask Joint Sparse Representation and Stepwise MRF Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS												Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a crucial issue in remote sensing. Accurate classification benefits a large number of applications such as land use analysis and marine resource utilization. But high data correlation brings difficulty to reliable classification, especially for HSI with abundant spectral information. Furthermore, the traditional methods often fail to well consider the spatial coherency of HSI that also limits the classification performance. To address these inherent obstacles, a novel spectral-spatial classification scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed method mainly focuses on multitask joint sparse representation (MJSR) and a stepwise Markov random filed framework, which are claimed to be two main contributions in this procedure. First, the MJSR not only reduces the spectral redundancy, but also retains necessary correlation in spectral field during classification. Second, the stepwise optimization further explores the spatial correlation that significantly enhances the classification accuracy and robustness. As far as several universal quality evaluation indexes are concerned, the experimental results on Indian Pines and Pavia University demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with the state-of-the-art competitors.																	2168-2267	2168-2275				DEC	2016	46	12					2966	2977		10.1109/TCYB.2015.2484324								WOS:000388923100023	26485729

Diving physiology of seabirds and marine mammals: Relevance, challenges and some solutions for field studies	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												To fully understand how diving seabirds and marine mammals balance the potentially conflicting demands of holding their breath while living their lives underwater (and maintaining physiological homeostasis during exercise, feeding, growth, and reproduction), physiological studies must be conducted with animals in their natural environments. The purpose of this article is to review the importance of making physiological measurements on diving animals in field settings, while acknowledging the challenges and highlighting some solutions. The most extreme divers are great candidates for study, especially in a comparative and mechanistic context. However, physiological data are also required of a wide range of species for problems relating to other disciplines, in particular ecology and conservation biology. Physiological data help with understanding and predicting the outcomes of environmental change, and the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities. Methodological approaches that have facilitated the development of field-based diving physiology include the isolated diving hole protocol and the translocation paradigm, and while there are many techniques for remote observation, animal-borne biotelemetry, or "biologging", has been critical. We discuss issues related to the attachment of instruments, the retrieval of data and sensing of physiological variables, while also considering negative impacts of tagging. This is illustrated with examples from a variety of species, and an in-depth look at one of the best studied and most extreme divers, the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). With a variety of approaches and high demand for data on the physiology of diving seabirds and marine mammals, the future of field studies is bright. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A perspective on the importance of oceanic fronts in promoting aggregation of visitors to seamounts	FISH AND FISHERIES												Recent evidence has demonstrated that not all seamounts are areas where productivity, biomass and biodiversity of marine life thrive. Therefore, understanding the drivers and mechanisms underlying seamount productivity is a major challenge in today's seamount research. Incorporating oceanographic data in future analyses has been suggested to be of paramount importance to unveil many of the seamount ecology paradigms. Persistent hydrographic features, such as oceanic fronts, have been recognized to enhance biological activity and to drive marine animal distributions and migration patterns. However, the importance of oceanic fronts in driving aggregations of visiting animals on seamounts has not been understood yet. Here, we analysed a data set of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean alongside satellite-derived maps of strong, persistent and frequently occurring oceanographic features, to evaluate if oceanic fronts promote aggregation of visitors on seamounts. Our analyses suggest that seamounts with a higher front frequency were more likely to aggregate tuna catch than average seamounts. However, it appears that fronts may be driving factors for aggregation only if present above a certain threshold. These results highlight the importance of environmental conditions in general, and oceanic fronts in particular, in promoting seamount productivity. We therefore argue that a thorough examination of the oceanographic conditions promoting seamount productivity at various temporal and spatial scales is warranted in future seamount research agendas.

Radiation and atmospheric circulation controls on carbonyl sulfide concentrations in the marine boundary layer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A potential closure of the global carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS) budget has recently been attained through a combination of remote sensing, modeling, and extended surface measurements. However, significant uncertainties in the spatial and temporal dynamics of the marine flux still persist. In order to isolate the terrestrial photosynthetic component of the global atmospheric OCS budget, tighter constraints on the marine flux are needed. We present 6 months of nearly continuous in situ OCS concentrations from the North Atlantic during the fall and winter of 2014-2015 using a combination of research vessel and fixed tower measurements. The data are characterized by synoptic-scale similar to 100 pmol mol(-1) variations in marine boundary layer air during transitions from subtropical to midlatitude source regions. The synoptic OCS variability is shown here to be a linear function of the radiation history along an air parcel's trajectory with no apparent sensitivity to the chlorophyll concentration of the surface waters that the air mass interacted with. This latter observation contradicts expectations and suggests a simple radiation limitation for the combined direct and indirect marine OCS emissions. Because the concentration of OCS in the marine boundary layer is so strongly influenced by an air parcel's history, marine and atmospheric concentrations would rarely be near equilibrium and thus even if marine production rates are held constant at a given location, the ocean-atmosphere flux would be sensitive to changes in atmospheric circulation alone. We hypothesize that changes in atmospheric circulation including latitudinal shifts in the storm tracks could affect the marine flux through this effect.

On montane (cold subhumid and humid) Mediterranean landscapes, harsh thermal conditions on north-facing hillslopes favour intense bedrock weathering by freezing and impose serious constraints on plant colonization. The above are the customary arguments to explain the high abundance of montane badlands on north-exposed shady aspects. We studied the distribution and morphological diversity of badlands in the upper Llobregat basin (Catalan Pyrenees, NE Spain), using remote sensing information (high resolution orthophotos and complementary Landsat 8 imagery), digital elevation data, and regional information on lithology. Badlands extend over about 200 ha in the upper Llobregat basin and occur on two different parent materials, swelling (smectite-rich) continental Garumnian lutites of late Cretaceous age, and nonswelling (illitic) marine Eocene marls. Vegetation, assessed by remote-sensed vegetation greenness, is less developed on north facing badland slopes. However, badland slope-aspect distribution varies considerably with lithology. While badlands on Eocene marls show preferential distribution on north-facing shady slopes, badland occurrence on Garumnian lutites does not reveal clear slope-aspect anisotropy patterns. Lithology also affects slope gradient, with badlands on Eocene marls showing rougher topography (30-40 degrees average slope angle) than on Garumnian lutites (20-30 degrees). Badland morphological differences induced by lithology are discussed in terms of the greater weathering susceptibility and slope instability of the swelling, smectite-rich Garumnian lutites than of the nonswelling Eocene marls. Elevation, which broadly controls annual precipitation and winter air temperature within the region, shows no clear influence on badland distribution. Overall, our results reveal lithology as the main factor controlling badland distribution and morphological diversity under the montane Mediterranean conditions of the upper Llobregat basin.

J	Diesing, M; Mitchell, P; Stephens, D				Diesing, Markus; Mitchell, Peter; Stephens, David			Image-based seabed classification: what can we learn from terrestrial remote sensing?	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Maps that depict the distribution of substrate, habitat or biotope types on the seabed are in increasing demand by marine ecologists and spatial planners, underpinning decision making in relation to marine spatial planning and marine protected area network design. Yet, the science discipline of image-based seabed mapping has not fully matured and rapid progress is needed to improve the reliability and accuracy of maps. To speed up the process we have conducted a literature review of common practices in terrestrial image classification based on remote sensing data, a related discipline, albeit with a larger scientific community and longer history. We identified the following key elements of a mapping workflow: (i) Data pre-processing, (ii) Feature extraction, (iii) Feature selection, (iv) Classification, (v) Post-classification enhancements, and (vi) Evaluation of classification performance. Insights gained from the review served as a baseline against which recent seabed mapping studies were compared. In this way we identified knowledge gaps and propose modifications to the mapping workflow. A main concern in current seabed mapping practice is that a large amount of often correlated predictor features is extracted, creating a multidimensional feature space. To effectively fill this space with an appropriate amount of training samples is likely to be impossible. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space via data transformation [e.g. principal component analysis (PCA)] or feature selection and remove correlated features. We propose to make dimensionality reduction an integral part of any mapping workflow. We also suggest to adopt recommendations for accuracy assessment originally drawn up for terrestrial land cover mapping. These include the publication of two or more measures of accuracy including overall and class-specific metrics, publication of associated confidence limits and the provision of the error matrix.

Although spatially limited, ground-based remote sensing observations are generally free of the surface contamination and signal attenuation effects that often hinder space-borne measurements of these low-level cloud systems. Such observations permit detailed measurements of structures and lifecycles of these clouds as part of a broader effort to study potential impacts of these coupled aerosol-cloud systems on local and regional weather and air quality. Introductory analyses of the W-band radar data show these Sc systems generally follow a diurnal cycle, with peak occurrences during the nighttime and early morning hours, often accompanied by light precipitation. Preliminary results from idealized simulations of Sc development over land based on the observations reveal the familiar response of increased numbers and smaller sizes of cloud droplets, along with suppressed drizzle formation, as aerosol concentrations increase. Slight reductions in simulated W-band reflectivity values also are seen with increasing aerosol concentrations and result primarily from decreased droplet sizes. As precipitation can play a large role in removing aerosol from the atmosphere, and thereby improving air quality locally, quantifying feedbacks between aerosols and cloud systems over this region are essential, particularly given the negative impacts of biomass burning on human health in SEA. Such an endeavor should involve improved modeling capabilities along with comprehensive measurements of time-dependent aerosol and cloud profiles.

Laboratory air-entraining breaking waves: Imaging visible foam signatures to estimate energy dissipation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Oceanic air-entraining breaking waves fundamentally influence weather and climate through bubble-mediated ocean-atmosphere exchanges, and influence marine engineering design by impacting statistics of wave heights, crest heights, and wave loading. However, estimating individual breaking wave energy dissipation in the field remains a fundamental problem. Using laboratory experiments, we introduce a new method to estimate energy dissipation by individual breaking waves using above-water images of evolving foam. The data show the volume of the breaking wave two-phase flow integrated in time during active breaking scales linearly with wave energy dissipated. To determine the volume time-integral, above-water images of surface foam provide the breaking wave timescale and horizontal extent of the submerged bubble plume, and the foam decay time provides an estimate of the bubble plume penetration depth. We anticipate that this novel remote sensing method will improve predictions of air-sea exchanges, validate models of wave energy dissipation, and inform ocean engineering design.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV	2016	43	21					11320	11328		10.1002/2016GL071226								WOS:000389305000032

The updrafts at cloud base (W-b) govern the supersaturation and therefore the activation of cloud condensation nuclei, which modifies the cloud and precipitation properties. A statistically significant relationship between W-b and cloud top radiative cooling rate (CTRC) is found from the measurements of the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Mobile Facility on board a ship sailing between Honolulu and Los Angeles. A similar relation was found on Graciosa Island but with greater scatter and weaker correlation presumably due to the island effect. Based on the relation, we are able to estimate the cloud base updrafts using a simple formula: W-b = -0.44 x CTRC + 22.30 +/- 13, where the W-b and CTRC have units of cm/s and W/m(2), respectively. This quantification can be utilized in satellite remote sensing and parameterizations of W-b in general circulation models.

Current methods for delineating tidal flats have low accuracy because of the limited precision of available imagery, and they cannot identify zones within tidal flats. Three zones within tidal flats are ecologically distinct due to their varied inundation. These include the supratidal, intertidal, and subtidal zones. In this study, we present a more precise method for mapping tidal flats. We used Chinese HJ-1A/B satellite images with a semiautomatic extraction method to generate a sufficient number of waterline estimates taken at various tide heights to delineate the full extent of tidal flats. Then, the full set of waterline estimates is analyzed with the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) using Jenks Natural Breaks to identify three zones within tidal flats. We demonstrated the utility of this approach by mapping tidal flats of the Bohai Rim, China. In 2014, the estimate of available tidal flats in the region was 3093 km(2), among which the area of supratidal, intertidal, and subtidal zones accounted for 5.0%, 84.3%, and 10.7%, respectively. A confusion matrix for accuracy assessment revealed a 93.8% overall accuracy for the resulting tidal flat map. Our method enables tidal flats to be mapped and monitored precisely and comprehensively, providing baseline data on the extent of this disappearing ecosystem that can be used to inform coastal planning and sustainable development.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				NOV	2016	9	11			SI		5123	5129		10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2616514								WOS:000388871500023						
J	Tang, SL; Chen, CQ				Tang, Shilin; Chen, Chuqun			Novel Maximum Carbon Fixation Rate Algorithms for Remote Sensing of Oceanic Primary Productivity	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Ocean remote sensing is the only technique capable of quantitatively detecting long-term and global variability of marine primary production. However, because the spectral curves of light derived from satellite sensors have a limited capability to identify the physiological state of phytoplankton, the direct estimation of photoadaptive variables, such as daily maximum carbon fixation in a water column (P-opt(b)), from the spectra of satellite sensors is difficult. This difficulty results in most of the errors in ocean color-based primary productivity models. In this paper, algorithms were developed to estimate P-opt(b) using statistical models known as support vector machines (SVM). The algorithms were run using three different inputs: sea surface temperature (SST); both SST and sea surface chlorophyll a concentration; and SST, sea surface chlorophyll a concentration and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) together. The results indicate that the algorithm using the three inputs (SST, sea surface chlorophyll a concentration, and PAR) had the best performance. The algorithms based on the SVM had better results than the general statistical regression method. Using the new P-opt(b) algorithm, the performances of the previous primary production models, including the vertically generalized production model and the statistical model developed in our earlier research, were improved. In contrast to the previous algorithm, the global primary productivity estimated using the new P-opt(b) algorithm showed regional changes, with higher primary productivity in most open ocean areas and lower primary productivity in coastal waters.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				NOV	2016	9	11			SI		5202	5208		10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2574898								WOS:000388871500031

In this study, an extensive set of experimental and space-borne measurements is analyzed for describing the operating characteristics of a global multidisciplinary ocean color sensor. Essential requirements for a successful mission include sensor characterization, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic range, sensor stability, minimal polarization sensitivity, on-orbit calibration, vicarious calibration, atmospheric and in-water algorithms, product validation, and widely distributed regional and global products. To achieve high-quality products, an in-depth analysis of some key design aspects is provided which include spectral band sets, radiance levels, SNR, and dynamic range. These are essential characteristics of satellite sensors for measuring atmospheric signal in both ocean color and aerosol bands without saturation yet allowing high sensitivity measurements of water-leaving radiances and enabling ocean color measurements in aerosol and sun-glint contaminated regions of the ocean. Provisions to meet other requirements for improving retrievals of chlorophyll and phycocyanin fluorescence, partitioning algal and nonalgal color signals, and for implementing new approaches in atmospheric correction are further discussed. With these new capabilities and key design features, it will become feasible to resolve ocean color signals under most environmental circumstances and answer science questions related to changing conditions in the coastal and marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles due to climate change.

This effort includes comparing quantities estimated from float and satellite data at nominal wavelengths of 412, 443, 488, and 555 nm, and examining sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in the float estimates. This study had 65 occurrences of coincident high-quality observations from floats and MODIS Aqua and 15 occurrences of coincident high-quality observations floats and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The float estimates of remote sensing reflectance are similar to the satellite estimates, with disagreement of a few percent in most wavelengths. The variability of the float-satellite comparisons is similar to the variability of in situ-satellite comparisons using a validation dataset from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY). This, combined with the agreement of float-based and satellite-based quantities, suggests that floats are likely a good platform for validation of satellite-based estimates of remote sensing reflectance.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.				van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013; Simon, Carine/L-1219-2014	van der Woerd, Hans/0000-0002-8901-7567; Simon, Carine/0000-0001-9951-5132; Bardaji, Raul/0000-0002-0803-3427; Piera, Jaume/0000-0001-5818-9836; Wernand, Marcel R./0000-0002-1331-9569												2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							879	10.3390/rs8110879								WOS:000388798400001

However, only a handful of studies have documented the PSD variability in different regions. Here, we investigate the PSD properties and variability in two shallow and semi-enclosed seas (the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS)), using in situ laser diffraction measurements (LISST-100X Type C) and other measurements at 79 stations in November 2013. The results show large variability in particle concentrations (in both volume and number concentrations), with volume concentrations varying by 57-fold. The median particle diameter (D-v(50)) from each of the water samples also covers a large range (22.4-307.0 mu m) and has an irregular statistical distribution, indicating complexity in the PSD. The PSD slopes (2.7-4.5), estimated from a power-law model, cover nearly the entire range reported previously for natural waters. Small mineral particles (with large PSD slopes) are characteristic of near-shore waters prone to sediment resuspension by winds and tides, while large biological particles (with small PSD slopes) dominate the total suspended particulates for waters away from the coast. For the BS and YS, this study provides the first report on the properties and spatial variability of the PSD, which may influence the optical properties of the ocean surface and remote sensing algorithms that are based on estimations of particle concentrations and sizes.

The vocalizations were received on a large-aperture densely-sampled coherent hydrophone array system useful for monitoring marine mammals over instantaneous wide areas via the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing technique. For each baleen whale species, between 125 and over 1400 measured vocalizations with significantly high Signal-to-Noise Ratios ( SNR > 10 dB) after coherent beamforming and localized with high accuracies (<10% localization errors) over ranges spanning roughly 1 km-30 km are included in the analysis. The whale vocalization received pressure levels are corrected for broadband transmission losses modeled using a calibrated parabolic equation-based acoustic propagation model for a random range-dependent ocean waveguide. The whale vocalization source level distributions are characterized by the following means and standard deviations, in units of dB re 1 mu Pa at 1 m: 181.9 +/- 5.2 for fin whale 20-Hz pulses, 173.5 +/- 3.2 for sei whale downsweep chirps, 177.7 +/- 5.4 for minke whale pulse trains and 169.6 +/- 3.5 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls. The broadband vocalization equivalent pulse-compression gains are found to be 2.5 +/- 1.1 for fin whale 20-Hz pulses, 24 +/- 10 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls and 69 +/- 23 for sei whale downsweep chirps. These pulse compression gains are found to be roughly proportional to the inter-pulse intervals of the vocalizations, which are 11 +/- 5 s for fin whale 20-Hz pulses, 29 +/- 18 for the unidentified baleen whale species downsweep calls and 52 +/- 33 for sei whale downsweep chirps. The source level distributions and pulse compression gains are essential for determining signal-to-noise ratios and hence detection regions for baleen whale vocalizations received passively on underwater acoustic sensing systems, as well as for assessing communication ranges in baleen whales.																	2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							881	10.3390/rs8110881								WOS:000388798400002

These sensors capture electromagnetic energy that comes to them from the reflection or emission of the objects on the Earth's surface, and convert it into an electronic signal that once conditioned, is recorded in some kind of support for further processing and analysis. On the other hand, the field of remotely piloted Aircraft systems, also called drones, has undergone tremendous growth in recent years. There is a possibility to integrate these remote sensing cameras on-board of them. The result is a remote sensing system applicable in the atmospheric, terrestrial and marine environment allowing a systematic analysis of many geophysical parameters of high interest to researchers, businesses, Government and the public community. The present document explains the integration process of remote hyperspectral sensors on-board of an unmanned aircraft system as an investigation aerial platform. Once sensor is fully integrated in the Aircraft, next step is the qualification of the system, military or civilian. The integration ends obtaining the airworthiness certificate. Lastly, to conclude, future lines of research are exposed.

Remote-Sensed Mapping of Sargassum spp. Distribution around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, Using High-Spatial Resolution WorldView-2 Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient techniques for marine habitat studies in shallow coastal waters, especially in clear waters where field observations can be easily carried out. However, such in situ observations have certain limitations: they are time consuming, have a limited ability to capture spatial variability, and require an interdisciplinary approach between marine biologists and remote-sensing specialists. The main objective of this study was to survey and map Sargassum beds around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, through a combination of high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery, using a validated depth invariant index model for water-column correction, and in-field observations. The combination of field survey data and four classification methods resulted in highly accurate classification outcomes that showed the distribution patterns of Sargassum spp. around Rottnest Island during the austral spring season (October 2013). Overall, the minimum distance and Mahalanobis classifiers yielded the highest overall accuracy rates of 98.32% (kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 98.30% (kappa = 0.96), respectively. The K-means classification method gave the lowest accuracy percentage of 42.50% (kappa = 0.22). Thus, the primary results of this study provide useful baseline information that is necessary for marine-conservation strategic planning and the sustainable utilization of brown macroalgae resources around the Western Australian coast.

An oceanographic survey for oil spill monitoring and model forecasting validation using remote sensing and in situ data in the Mediterranean Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A research cruise was organized on board the Italian National Research Council (CNR) RN Urania to test the oil spill monitoring system developed during the PRogetto pilota Inquinamento Marino da Idrocarburi project (PRIMI, pilot project for marine oil pollution). For the first time, this system integrated in a modular way satellite oil spill detection (Observation Module) and oil spill displacement forecasting (Forecast Module) after detection. The Observation Module was based on both Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) and optical satellite detection, namely SAR and Optical Modules, while the Forecast Module on Lagrangian numerical circulation models. The cruise (Aug. 6-Sep. 7, 2009) took place in the Mediterranean Sea, around Sicily, an area affected by heavy oil tanker traffic with frequent occurrence of oil spills resulting from illegal tank washing. The cruise plan was organized in order to have the ship within the SAR image frames selected for the cruise, at acquisition time. In this way, the ship could rapidly reach oil slicks detected in the images by the SAR Module, and/or eventually by the Optical Module, in order to carry out visual and instrumental inspection of the slicks. During the cruise, several oil spills were detected by the two Observation Modules and verified in situ, with the essential aid of the Forecasting Module which provided the slick position by the time the ship reached the area after the alert given by the SAR and/or optical imagery. Results confirm the good capability of oil spill SAR detection and indicate that also optical sensors are able to detect oil spills, ranging from thin films to slicks containing heavily polluted water. Also, results confirm the useful potential of oil spill forecasting models, but, on the other hand, that further work combining satellite, model and in situ data is necessary to refine the PRIM! system.

Those data are used for different applications, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, etc. The applications are data driven and mostly interdisciplinary. Based on this it can truly be stated that we are now living in the age of big remote sensing data. Furthermore, these data are becoming an economic asset and a new important resource in many applications. In this paper, we specifically analyze the challenges and opportunities that big data bring in the context of remote sensing applications. Our focus is to analyze what exactly does big data mean in remote sensing applications and how can big data provide added value in this context. Furthermore, this paper describes the most challenging issues in managing, processing, and efficient exploitation of big data for remote sensing problems. In order to illustrate the aforementioned aspects, two case studies discussing the use of big data in remote sensing are demonstrated. In the first test case, big data are used to automatically detect marine oil spills using a large archive of remote sensing data. In the second test case, content-based information retrieval is performed using high-performance computing (HPC) to extract information from a large database of remote sensing images, collected after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center in New York City. Both cases are used to illustrate the significant challenges and opportunities brought by the use of big data in remote sensing applications.

Marine conditions dominated by the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and nonalgal particles are considered. The applied OC inversion schemes are based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural nets for data classification and regression. Simulated data for MLP training are generated with a forward OC model. Results show that a disproportion of samples representing different marine optical cases influences the MLP learning and hence also the data product retrieval, mostly in mixed case-1 and CDOM-dominated environments. A postclassification correction is then employed for performance improvements. Methodological developments are presented, acknowledging the coastal water monitoring prioritized by the Copernicus Earth Observation program.

High ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels by the shoaling of upper mixed layers and increasing atmospheric dust deposition from arid regions may unpredictably alter the metabolic state of marine oligotrophic ecosystems. We performed an observational study across the south-western (SW) Mediterranean Sea to assess the planktonic metabolic balance and a microcosm experiment in two contrasting areas, heterotrophic nearshore and autotrophic open sea, to test whether a combined UVR x dust impact could alter their metabolic balance at mid-term scales. We show that the metabolic state of oligotrophic areas geographically varies and that the joint impact of UVR and dust inputs prompted a strong change towards autotrophic metabolism. We propose that this metabolic response could be accentuated with the global change as remote-sensing evidence shows increasing intensities, frequencies and number of dust events together with variations in the surface UVR fluxes on SW Mediterranean Sea. Overall, these findings suggest that the enhancement of the net carbon budget under a combined UVR and dust inputs impact could contribute to boost the biological pump, reinforcing the role of the oligotrophic marine ecosystems as CO2 sinks.

J	Furnas, MJ; Carpenter, EJ				Furnas, Miles J.; Carpenter, Edward J.			Primary production in the tropical continental shelf seas bordering northern Australia	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Pelagic primary production (C-14 uptake) was measured 81 times between 1990 and 2013 at sites spanning the broad, shallow Northern Australian Shelf (NAS; 120-145 degrees E) which borders the Australian continent. The mean of all areal production measurements was 1048 +/- 109 mg C m(-2) d(-1) (mean +/- 95% CI). Estimates of areal primary production were correlated with integral upper-euphotic zone chlorophyll stocks (above the 50% and 20% light penetration depths) accessible to ocean color remote sensing and total water column chlorophyll standing crop, but not surface (0-2 m) chlorophyll concentrations. While the NAS is subject to a well characterized monsoonal climate regime (austral summer- NW monsoon- wet: austral winter- SE monsoon -dry), most seasonal differences in means of regional-scale chlorophyll standing crop (11-33 mg Chl m(-2) for 12 of 15 season-region combinations) and areal primary production (700-1850 mg C m(-) day(-1) for 12 of 15 season-region combinations) fell within a 3-fold range. Apart from the shallow waters of the Torres Strait and northern Great Barrier Reef, picoplankton (< 2 mu m size fraction) dominated chlorophyll standing crop and primary production with regional means of picoplankton contributions ranging from 45 to > 80%. While the range of our post-1990 areal production estimates overlaps the range of production estimates made in NAS waters during 1960-62, the mean of post-1990 estimates is over 2-fold greater. We regard the difference to be due to improvements in production measurement techniques, particularly regarding the reduction of potential metal toxicity and incubations in more realistic light regimes.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				OCT 15	2016	129						33	48		10.1016/j.csr.2016.06.006								WOS:000388781300004

This is partly due to the lack of understanding of relevant processes and mechanisms responsible for organic-matter transport throughout a landscape. Here we present a new approach to identify terrestrial plant organic matter source areas, quantify contributions and ascertain the role of ecologic, climatic, and geomorphic controls on plant wax export in the Arun River catchment spanning the world's largest elevation gradient from 205 to 8848 m asl, in eastern Nepal. Our approach takes advantage of the distinct stable hydrogen isotopic composition (expressed as delta D values) of plant wax n-alkanes produced along this gradient, transported in river waters and deposited in flood deposits alongside the Arun River and its tributaries. In mainstem-flood deposits, we found that plant wax n-alkanes were mostly derived from the lower elevations constituting only a small fraction (15%) of the catchment. Informed by remote sensing data, we tested four differently weighted isotopic mixing models that quantify sourcing of tributary plant-derived organic matter along the Arun and compare it to our field observations. The weighting parameters included catchment area, net primary productivity (NPP) and annual rainfall amount as well as catchment relief as erosion proxy. When weighted by catchment area the isotopic mixing model could not explain field observations on plant wax delta D values along the Arun, which is not surprising because the large arid Tibetan Plateau is not expected to be a major source. Weighting areal contributions by annual rainfall and NPP captured field observations within model prediction errors suggesting that plant productivity may influence source strength. However weighting by a combination of rainfall and catchment relief also captured the observed delta D value pattern suggesting dominantly erosive control. We conclude that tributaries at the southern Himalayan front with high rainfall, high productivity, high relief and high erosion rates dominate plant wax exports from the catchment.

Recent research has investigated a challenge of dealing with cascading patterns, namely, the exponential time dependence of database scanning with respect to the number of items involved. We propose a normalized-mutual-information-based mining method for cascading patterns (M(3)Cap) to address this challenge. M(3)Cap embeds mutual information to reduce database-scanning time. First, M(3)Cap calculates the asymmetrical mutual information between items with one database scan and extracts pair-wise related items according to a user-specified information threshold. Second, a one-level cascading pattern is generated by scanning the database once for each pair-wise related item at the quantitative level. Third, a recursive linking-pruning-generating loop generates an (m + 1)-level-candidate cascading pattern from m-dimensional patterns on the basis of antimonotonicity and non-additivity, repeating this step until no further candidate cascading patterns are generated. Fourth, meaningful cascading patterns are generated according to user-specified minimum evaluation indicators. Finally, experiments with remote sensing image datasets covering the Pacific Ocean demonstrate that the computation time of recursive linking and pruning is significantly less than that of database scanning; thus, M(3)Cap improves performance by reducing database scanning while increasing intensive computing.																	2220-9964					OCT	2016	5	10							174	10.3390/ijgi5100174								WOS:000387885900009

However, when applied to offshore areas such as the Bohai Sea, the trajectories and fate of oil slicks would be affected by time-varying factors in a regional scale, which are assumed to be constant in most of the present models. In fact, these factors in offshore regions show much more variation over time than in the deep sea, due to offshore bathymetric and climatic characteristics. In this paper, the challenge of parameterizing these offshore factors is tackled. The remote sensing data of the region are used to analyze the modification of wind-induced drift factors, and a well-suited solution is established in parameter correction mechanism for oil spill models. The novelty of the algorithm is the self-adaptive modification mechanism of the drift factors derived from the remote sensing data for the targeted sea region, in respect to empirical constants in the present models. Considering this situation, a new regional oil spill model (i4OilSpill) for the Bohai Sea is developed, which can simulate oil transformation and fate processes by Eulerian-Lagrangian methodology. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed model is proven by the validation results in the comparison between model simulation and subsequent satellite observations on the Penglai 19-3 oil spill accident. The performance of the model parameter correction mechanism is evaluated by comparing with the real spilled oil position extracted from ASAR images.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				OCT	2016	15	5					799	808		10.1007/s11802-016-3025-6								WOS:000387574800007

The validity and adaptability of aerosol type model is one of key factors affecting polarimetric remote sensing of aerosol properties. For an aerosol retrieval algorithm, either neglecting coarse mode aerosols (one of common assumption of aerosol retrieval from satellite polarimetric sensors) or employing incorrect aerosol types can bring errors to the retrieval results. In this paper, the influence of aerosol modes and choice of aerosol types (six typical types: desert dust, biomass burning, background/rural, polluted continental, polluted marine, and dirty pollution) on the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were investigated based on near-infrared polarized satellite channel at 865 nm. Based on the vector radiative transfer simulation results, the atmospheric bidirectional polarized reflection distribution functions (BPDF) of the above six aerosol types at 865 nm were analyzed. The results demonstrate that atmospheric BPDF depends greatly on aerosol particle's size, while influence of coarse mode on atmospheric BPDF is much smaller than that of fine mode. Compared with the atmospheric BPDF associated with only one fine mode, the BPDF associated with both fine and coarse modes shows smaller BPDF. With these simulation results, AOD retrieval errors were analyzed under two circumstances, neglecting coarse mode aerosols and employing an incorrect aerosol type. The results show that: (1) Neglecting coarse mode can lead to underestimation of the retrieved fine mode AOD (AOD,). The AODf errors are in the range of -12.3% to -35.7% for different aerosol types. The maximum AODf error associates with desert dust aerosol type while the minimum with polluted continental type. (2) The use of an incorrect aerosol type can bring large AOD retrieval error, which depends on bias of atmospheric BPDF related to the incorrect aerosol type. Among all six aerosol types, the maximum BPDF difference occurs between desert dust and dirty pollution aerosol types, which yields the maximum AOD retrieval errors of -60.6% and 220.3%, given mischoosing one versus another. The minimum AOD retrieval errors can be -3.0% and 7.1 % occurring between background/rural and polluted continental types, which have the smallest BPDF difference. The results of this study can help to develop the next generation spaceborne polarimetric sensors and corresponding aerosol retrieval algorithms.

Marine ecosystems are indeed largely composed by microbial planktonic communities whose niches are affected by highly dynamical physico-chemical conditions, and whose observation requires advanced methods for morphological and molecular classification. Optical remote sensing offers an appealing complement to these in-situ techniques. Global scale coverage at high spatiotemporal resolution is however achieved at the cost of restrained information on the local assemblage. Here, we use a coupled physical and ecological model ocean simulation to explore one possible metrics for comparing measures performed on such different scales. We show that a large part of the local diversity of the virtual plankton ecosystem - corresponding to what accessible by genomic methods - can be inferred from crude, but spatially extended, information - as conveyed by remote sensing. Shannon diversity of the local community is indeed highly correlated to a 'seascape' index, which quantifies the surrounding spatial heterogeneity of the most abundant functional group. The error implied in drastically reducing the resolution of the plankton community is shown to be smaller in frontal regions as well as in regions of intermediate turbulent energy. On the spatial scale of hundreds of kms, patterns of virtual plankton diversity are thus largely sustained by mixing communities that occupy adjacent niches. We provide a proof of principle that in the open ocean information on spatial variability of communities can compensate for limited local knowledge, suggesting the possibility of integrating in-situ and satellite observations to monitor biodiversity distribution at the global scale.

Assessment of climate change downscaling and non-stationarity on the spatial pattern of a mangrove ecosystem in an arid coastal region of southern Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Mangrove wetlands exist in the transition zone between terrestrial and marine environments and have remarkable ecological and socio-economic value. This study uses climate change downscaling to address the question of non-stationarity influences on mangrove variations (expansion and contraction) within an arid coastal region. Our two-step approach includes downscaling models and uncertainty assessment, followed by a non-stationary and trend procedure using the Extreme Value Analysis (extRemes code). The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) model along with two different general circulation model (GCMs) (MIRH and HadCM3) were used to downscale climatic variables during current (1968-2011) and future (2011-2030, 2045-2065, and 2080-2099) periods. Parametric and non-parametric bootstrapping uncertainty tests demonstrated that the LARS-WGS model skillfully downscaled climatic variables at the 95 % significance level. Downscaling results using MIHR model show that minimum and maximum temperatures will increase in the future (2011-2030, 2045-2065, and 2080-2099) during winter and summer in a range of +4.21 and +4.7 A degrees C, and +3.62 and +3.55 A degrees C, respectively. HadCM3 analysis also revealed an increase in minimum (similar to+3.03 A degrees C) and maximum (similar to+3.3 A degrees C) temperatures during wet and dry seasons. In addition, we examined how much mangrove area has changed during the past decades and, thus, if climate change non-stationarity impacts mangrove ecosystems. Our results using remote sensing techniques and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney two-sample test indicated a sharp decline in mangrove area during 1972,1987, and 1997 periods (p value = 0.002). Non-stationary assessment using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions by including mangrove area as a covariate further indicated that the null hypothesis of the stationary climate (no trend) should be rejected due to the very low p values for precipitation (p value = 0.0027), minimum (p value = 0.000000029) and maximum (p value = 0.00016) temperatures. Based on non-stationary analysis and an upward trend in downscaled temperature extremes, climate change may control mangrove development in the future.

In this study, a total of 50 Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images were used to analyze the geological features and spectral characteristics of the Nansha reefs. The exposed islands/sandbanks, reef flats and sub-tidal reefs were identified with the near-infrared band, the red and green bands, and the blue band, respectively. Based on the relationships among various characteristics and bands illustrated in the OLI images, the maximum between-cluster variance threshold algorithm (OTSU method) and the mathematical morphology were employed to extract characteristic parameters of the spatial geometry of the reefs from top to bottom, which were subsequently operated by a series of post-processing methods such as vectorization, simplification and topological analysis. Among the 132 standalone reefs and 16 atolls that are identified in the study, four reefs have yet to be named in the Standard Names of Various Islands in the South China Sea and the website Nansha Islands Online (http://www.nansha.org/). Another 24 ones are exposed to the atmosphere even during high tides. Taiping Island with an area of 0.57 km(2) represents the largest exposed geological feature. This study demonstrated the applicability of medium-resolution satellite images to derive the coral reef information effectively and thus provided information for the related departments that are responsible to manage the coast. An improved resolution of multispectral bands with the panchromatic band in higher spatial resolution (15 m for OLI image) is expected to provide an optimum satellite based approach to map marine habitats.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				OCT	2016	35	10					11	19		10.1007/s13131-016-0898-6								WOS:000385152000002

Indeed, the acoustic response depends on several physicochemical factors such as sediment grain size, bulk density, water content, and mineralogy. The objective of the present study is to assess the suitability of seismic peak amplitude as a predictor of total organic carbon (TOC) content in shallow marine sediments, based on data collected in the Cabo Frio mud belt in an upwelling zone off southeastern Brazil. These comprise records of P-wave velocity (V (P)) along 680 km of high-resolution single-channel seismic surveys, combined with analyses of grain size, wet bulk density, absolute water content and TOC content for four piston-cores. TOC contents of sediments from 13 box-cores served to validate the methodology. The results show well-defined positive correlations between TOC content and mean grain size (phi scale) as well as absolute water content, and negative correlations with V (P), wet bulk density, and acoustic impedance. These relationships yield a regression equation by which TOC content can be satisfactorily predicted on the basis of acoustic impedance for this region: y = - 4.84 ln(x) + 40.04. Indeed, the derived TOC contents differ by only 5% from those determined by geochemical analysis. After appropriate calibration, acoustic impedance can thus be conveniently used as a predictor of large-scale spatial distributions of organic carbon enrichment in marine sediments. This not only contributes to optimizing scientific project objectives, but also enhances the cost-effectiveness of marine surveys by greatly reducing the ship time commonly required for grid sampling.																	0276-0460	1432-1157				OCT	2016	36	5					395	403		10.1007/s00367-016-0449-3								WOS:000383468800007

While various algorithms were proposed in the literature so far and tested for oceanic waters of diverse constituent composition, an independent algorithm evaluation is needed for local ocean waters that have dynamic variation in optically active water constituents such as colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). This paper evaluates the performance of chlorophyll algorithms for Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) radiometric data, using in situ measurements collected at 491 stations around Korea Peninsula during 2010-2014 from which there were 130 match-ups with GOCI data. For the evaluation in areas with high variation in SPM, water samples were first classified into three levels of SPM, and then the coefficients of candidate algorithms were newly derived for the turbidity cases using the in situ and GOCI remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) data. Functional forms of traditional band ratio algorithms (e.g. OC algorithms (O'Reilly et al., 1998) and Tassan's algorithm (Tassan, 1994)), fluorescence line height algorithm, and near-infrared-to-red band ratio approach were tested. The evaluation results for the coincident in situ pairs of R-rs and chlorophyll measurements showed that the mean uncertainty was <35% with the correlation around 0.8 by using the 00 with turbidity consideration (OCT) and Tassan's algorithm with turbidity dependent coefficients (Tassan-TD). For the GOCI match-ups, the mean uncertainty for all turbidity levels was around 35% with correlation around 0.65, when OCT and Tassan-TD were used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Ghanea, M; Moradi, M; Kabiri, K				Ghanea, Mohsen; Moradi, Masoud; Kabiri, Keivan			A novel method for characterizing harmful algal blooms in the Persian Gulf using MODIS measurements	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Biophysical properties of water undergo meaningful variations under red tide (RT) outbreak. A massive Cochlodiniurn polykrikoids RT began in the eastern Persian Gulf (PG) in October 2008 and extended to the northern PG in December 2008. It killed large fish and hampered marine industries and water desalination appliances. Yet monthly averages of satellite-derived Chl-a (Chlorophyll-a), nFLH (normalized Fluorescence Line Height), and K-d(490) (diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm) have not been compared in the PG. MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor provides global coverage, with short revisit time, and accessible, well validated ocean color products. This study compares the behavior of MODIS Chl-a, nFLH, and K-d(490) in both normal and RT conditions. In doing so, their color maps are shown during normal and RT periods. Then, monthly variations of these products are shown as time series between 2002 and 2008. HOCI (Hybrid Ocean Color Index) is defined by integrating these products to detect RT affected areas. The results gained from 100 locations in the PG show that HOCI >0.18 mW cm(-2) sr(-1) sr(-1) mg m(-4) and nFLH >0.04 mW cm(-2) gm(-1) mu m(-1) sr(-1) discriminates non-bloom waters from algal blooms. R-rs(443)/R-rs(412) > 1 is a proper statement to separate Trichodesmium erythtraeum from Noctiluca millaris, Noctiluca scintillans, and diatoms. R-rs(667)/R-rs(443) > 1 can differentiate Cochlodinium polykrikoids from T. erythtraeum, N. millaris, N. scintillans, and diatoms as well. So, the combination of HOCI and R-rs(667)/R-rs(443) ratio is useful for detection and quantization of C. polykrikoids. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Geospatial approach towards enumerative analysis of suspended sediment concentration for Ganges-Brahmaputra Bay	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												This study presents an easy, modular, user-friendly, and flexible software package for processing of Landsat 7 ETM and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS data for estimating suspended particulate matter concentrations in the coastal waters. This package includes 1) algorithm developed using freely downloadable SCILAB package, 2) ERDAS Models for iterative processing of Landsat images and 3) ArcMAP tool for plotting and map making. Utilizing SCILAB package, a module is written for geometric corrections, radiometric corrections and obtaining normalized water-leaving reflectance by incorporating Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. Using ERDAS models, a sequence of modules are developed for iterative processing of Landsat images and estimating suspended particulate matter concentrations. Processed images are used for preparing suspended sediment concentration maps. The applicability of this software package is demonstrated by estimating and plotting seasonal suspended sediment concentration maps off the Bengal delta. The software is flexible enough to accommodate other remotely sensed data like Ocean Color monitor (OCM) data, Indian Remote Sensing data (IRS), MODIS data etc. by replacing a few parameters in the algorithm, for estimating suspended sediment concentration in coastal waters.

Impact of habitat structure on fish populations in kelp forests at a seascape scale	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Habitat use by a species is a vital component in explaining the dynamics of natural populations. For mobile marine species such as fishes, describing habitat heterogeneity at a seascape scale is essential because it quantifies the spatial extent to which fishes are interacting with their environment. Here, we explored the relationships between habitat metrics and the density and size of kelp forest fishes across a seascape that is naturally fragmented. Multibeam sonar and GIS analysis were employed to create a seascape map that explicitly defined bathymetry and spatial configuration of rocky reefs in southern California (USA). Georeferenced subtidal transects were conducted across this seascape to describe habitat attributes, including the density of macroalgae, and record the number and size of fishes. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify which variables of habitat structure were most important in describing numerical density, biomass density, average size, and maximum size for fishes. Responses to different habitat components were dependent on particular species, choice of spatial scale, and the inherent characteristics of the seascape itself. Notably, the relative influence of seascape components was dependent on the configuration of the seascape, where fishes in a more isolated and less connected seascape were more influenced by spatial configuration than fishes in a seascape with greater habitat connectedness. This study demonstrates that explicit habitat maps allow for a more comprehensive understanding of population structure when describing fishes across large spatial scales.

Oil spills can be detected using some type of remote sensing data such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, but to determine of oil-spill origin is difficult. Oil spill hindcast models are commonly used to simulate the origin points. Surface winds, surface currents and random walk are three major parameters in the oil hindcast process. In coastal regions, the parameters are affected by offshore bathymetry, local weather, etc. In particular, random walk is more sensitive to the traits of coastal regions. However, most state-of-the-art hindcast models use an empirical and constant value for conducting random walk. In this paper, a random walk parameterization hindcast method (RWPHM) for the Bohai Sea is proposed, in which random walk is initially parameterized and combined with remote sensing data and oil-spill models. The backward-in-time method is validated using data for the Penglai 19-3 spill accident observed between June 11 and 19, 2011. The results confirm that the accuracy of random walk is significant for improving the accuracy of oil-spill hindcasting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The CMEMS OSR draws on expert analysis and provides a 3-D view (through reanalysis systems), a view from above (through remote-sensing data) and a direct view of the interior (through in situ measurements) of the global ocean and the European regional seas. The report is based on the unique CMEMS monitoring capabilities of the blue (hydrography, currents), white (sea ice) and green (e.g. Chlorophyll) marine environment. This first issue of the CMEMS OSR provides guidance on Essential Variables, large-scale changes and specific events related to the physical ocean state over the period 1993-2015. Principal findings of this first CMEMS OSR show a significant increase in global and regional sea levels, thermosteric expansion, ocean heat content, sea surface temperature and Antarctic sea ice extent and conversely a decrease in Arctic sea ice extent during the 1993-2015 period. During the year 2015 exceptionally strong large-scale changes were monitored such as, for example, a strong El Nino Southern Oscillation, a high frequency of extreme storms and sea level events in specific regions in addition to areas of high sea level and harmful algae blooms. At the same time, some areas in the Arctic Ocean experienced exceptionally low sea ice extent and temperatures below average were observed in the North Atlantic Ocean.

Here, using continuous 3-dimensional measurements by an ocean glider across a K. brevis bloom in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico between 1 and 8 August 2014, we show the vertical migration behavior of K brevis. Within the bloom where K. brevis concentration is between 100,000 and 1,000,000 cells L-1, the stratified water shows a two-layer system with the depth of pycnocline ranging between 14-20 m and salinity and temperature in the surface layer being <34.8 and >28 degrees C, respectively. The bottom layer shows the salinity of >36 and temperature of <26 degrees C. The low salinity is apparently due to coastal runoff, as the top layer also shows high amount of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Within the top layer, chlorophyll-a fluorescence shows clear diel changes in the vertical structure, an indication off( brevis vertical migration at a mean speed of 0.5-1 m h(-1). The upward migration appears to start at sunrise at a depth of 8-10 m, while the downward migration appears to start at sunset (or when surface light approaches 0) at a depth of 2 m. These vertical migrations are believed to be a result of the need of K. brevis cells for light and nutrients in a stable, stratified, and CDOM-rich environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The humpback vocalizations comprised of both song and non-song are analyzed. The song vocalizations, composed of highly structured and repeatable set of phrases, are characterized by inter-pulse intervals of 3.5 +/- 1.8 s. Songs were detected throughout the diel cycle, occuring roughly 40% during the day and 60% during the night. The humpback non-song vocalizations, dominated by shorter duration (3 s) downsweep and bow-shaped moans, as well as a small fraction of longer duration (approximate to 5 s) cries, have significantly larger mean and more variable inter-pulse intervals of 14.2 +/- 11 s. The non-song vocalizations were detected at night with negligible detections during the day, implying they probably function as nighttime communication signals. The humpback song and non-song vocalizations are separately localized using the moving array triangulation and array invariant techniques. The humpback song and non-song moan calls are both consistently localized to a dense area on northeastern Georges Bank and a less dense region extended from Franklin Basin to the Great South Channel. Humpback cries occur exclusively on northeastern Georges Bank and during nights with coincident dense Atlantic herring shoaling populations, implying the cries are feeding-related.																	2072-4292					SEP	2016	8	9							712	10.3390/rs8090712								WOS:000385488000022

Feasibility of Acoustic Remote Sensing of Large Herring Shoals and Seafloor by Baleen Whales	REMOTE SENSING												Recent research has found a high spatial and temporal correlation between certain baleen whale vocalizations and peak herring spawning processes in the Gulf of Maine. These vocalizations are apparently related to feeding activities with suggested functions that include communication, prey manipulation, and echolocation. Here, the feasibility of the echolocation function is investigated. Physical limitations on the ability to detect large herring shoals and the seafloor by acoustic remote sensing are determined with ocean acoustic propagation, scattering, and statistical theories given baleen whale auditory parameters. Detection is found to be highly dependent on ambient noise conditions, herring shoal distributions, baleen whale time-frequency vocalization spectra, and geophysical parameters of the ocean waveguide. Detections of large herring shoals are found to be physically feasible in common Gulf of Maine herring spawning scenarios at up to 10 +/- 6 km in range for humpback parameters and 1 +/- 1 km for minke parameters but not for blue and fin parameters even at zero horizontal range. Detections of the seafloor are found to be feasible up to 2 +/- 1 km for blue and humpback parameters and roughly 1 km for fin and minke parameters, suggesting that the whales share a common acoustic sensation of rudimentary features of the geophysical environment.					/0000-0002-0261-4482												2072-4292					SEP	2016	8	9							693	10.3390/rs8090693								WOS:000385488000003

Using the features of sensor surveillance system and mathematical trajectory models, the cooperation of surveillance and trajectory under oil spill emergency response is presented in this paper. Based on integration of equation simulating an oil spill trajectory, the method for remote-sensing application time (Te) has been described, and optimization of processing time described in the application time equation has been proposed. This contribution, which is integrated with remote-sensing and mathematical models, is expected to be a powerful tool for real-time contingency planning in the Dalian Xingang oil spill. According to these findings, the method allowed spills emergency alerts to make the best decision for choosing remote-sensing data, considering effective temporary resolution.				lin, junjie/G-5715-2011	lin, junjie/0000-0003-0955-3106												0254-8704					SEP	2016	37	5			SI		1177	1180										WOS:000387200600019

Here, a hybrid method, including analytical, semianalytical, and empirical steps, is developed to estimate PSD through the median diameter of suspended particles (D-v(50)). Four cruise surveys were conducted to measure optical scattering properties, particle concentrations, spectral reflectance, and particle-size distributions (obtained with a LISST instrument covering a size range of 2.5-500 mu m) in coastal waters of Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and Jiangsu coastal region. Based on the Mie scattering theory, D-v(50) is closely related to massspecific backscattering coefficient of suspended particles (b(bp)*), and their relationship is calibrated through a power model (R-2=0.796, n = 67, p< 0.001) for the D-v(50) range of 23.5-379.8 lm. The model is shown to perform better than the previously used inverse-proportion model. The retrieval of b(bp)* is through a bio-optical model that links remote sensing reflectance just beneath the surface to inherent optical properties, where a close empirical relationship is established between particulate backscattering and particle concentration. The hybrid method shows high degree of fitting (R-2 = 0.875, n = 46, p < 0.001) between the measured and estimated D-v(50) for the size range of 17.2-325.2 lm used in the model calibration, while validation using two independent data sets shows mean absolute percentage errors of 46.0% and 64.7%, respectively. Application of the hybrid method to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data results in spatial distributions of D-v(50) that are generally consistent with those from in situ observations, suggesting potential use of the method in studying particle dynamics through time series of remote sensing observations. However, its general applicability to other regions still requires further research.

With the recent advent of low-cost lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAVs for low-altitude aerial observation are becoming commodities rather than special equipment. Therefore, the appearance of low-cost hyperspectral imagers is anticipated for aerial hyperspectral sensing via UAVs. In this paper, we describe the development of a low-cost hyperspectral imager based on a whiskbroom scanning mechanism. The main components of the developed system include an optical fiber bundle, a swing mirror, and compact spectrometers. An image formed by an objective lens is quantized into a set of pixels by a two-dimensional array of quartz fiber-optic cables at one end of an optical fiber bundle. The quantized image travels to the other end of the bundle, inside of which a swing mirror is used for cross-track scanning. The light in each pixel of the quantized image is then measured using a compact spectrometer. Calculated reflectances in close-range measurements of color checkered patterns were spatially and spectrally accurate. In an aerial measurement of a coastal area from a 20-m altitude via a lightweight UAV, a hyperspectral image with a 0.5-m spatial resolution and an 8-m swath was acquired. Based on pattern matching using cross correlation, classification of three classes of marine macrophyte beds, agar, coralline, and sand realized overall accuracies of 0.755 (diffuse dominant illumination) and 0.719 (direct sunlight dominant illumination).

J	McCaul, M; Barland, J; Cleary, J; Cahalane, C; McCarthy, T; Diamond, D				McCaul, Margaret; Barland, Jack; Cleary, John; Cahalane, Conor; McCarthy, Tim; Diamond, Dermot			Combining Remote Temperature Sensing with in-Situ Sensing to Track Marine/Freshwater Mixing Dynamics	SENSORS												The ability to track the dynamics of processes in natural water bodies on a global scale, and at a resolution that enables highly localised behaviour to be visualized, is an ideal scenario for understanding how local events can influence the global environment. While advances in in-situ chem/bio-sensing continue to be reported, costs and reliability issues still inhibit the implementation of large-scale deployments. In contrast, physical parameters like surface temperature can be tracked on a global scale using satellite remote sensing, and locally at high resolution via flyovers and drones using multi-spectral imaging. In this study, we show how a much more complete picture of submarine and intertidal groundwater discharge patterns in Kinvara Bay, Galway can be achieved using a fusion of data collected from the Earth Observation satellite (Landsat 8), small aircraft and in-situ sensors. Over the course of the four-day field campaign, over 65,000 in-situ temperatures, salinity and nutrient measurements were collected in parallel with high-resolution thermal imaging from aircraft flyovers. The processed in-situ data show highly correlated patterns between temperature and salinity at the southern end of the bay where freshwater springs can be identified at low tide. Salinity values range from 1 to 2 ppt at the southern end of the bay to 30 ppt at the mouth of the bay, indicating the presence of a freshwater wedge. The data clearly show that temperature differences can be used to track the dynamics of freshwater and seawater mixing in the inner bay region. This outcome suggests that combining the tremendous spatial density and wide geographical reach of remote temperature sensing (using drones, flyovers and satellites) with ground-truthing via appropriately located in-situ sensors (temperature, salinity, chemical, and biological) can produce a much more complete and accurate picture of the water dynamics than each modality used in isolation.

J	Ohashi, Y; Iida, T; Sugiyama, S; Aoki, S				Ohashi, Yoshihiko; Iida, Takahiro; Sugiyama, Shin; Aoki, Shigeru			Spatial and temporal variations in high turbidity surface water off the Thule region, northwestern Greenland	POLAR SCIENCE					4th International Symposium for Arctic Science (ISAR) / 3rd International Conference for Arctic Research Planning (ICARP) held as the Science Symposium of the Arctic Science Summit Week	APR 27-30, 2015	Toyama, JAPAN					Glacial meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet and ice caps forms high turbidity water in the proglacial ocean off the Greenland coast. Although the timing and magnitude of high turbidity water export affect the coastal marine environment, for example, through impacts on biological productivity, little is known about the characteristics of this high turbidity water. In this paper, we therefore report on the spatial and temporal variations in high turbidity water off the Thule region in northwestern Greenland, based on remote sensing, reflectance data at a wavelength of 555 nm (Rrs555). The high turbidity area, identified on the basis of high reflectivity (Rrs555 >= 0.0070 sr(-1)), was generally distributed near the coast, where many outlet glaciers terminate in the ocean and on land. The extent of the high turbidity area exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variability, and its annual maximum extent was significantly correlated with summer air temperature. Assuming a linear relationship between the high turbidity area and summer temperature, annual maximum extent increases under the influence of increasing glacial meltwater discharge, as can be inferred from present and predicted future warming trends.

Meteo-marine parameters for highly variable environment in coastal regions from satellite radar images	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING					36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment (ISRSE)	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The German Bight of the North Sea is the area with highly variable sea state conditions, intensive ship traffic and with a high density of offshore installations, e.g. wind farms in use and under construction. Ship navigation and the docking on offshore constructions is impeded by significant wave heights H-S > 1.3 m. For these reasons, improvements are required in recognition and forecasting of sea state H-S in the range 0-3 m. Thus, this necessitates the development of new methods to determine the distribution of meteo-marine parameters from remote sensing data with an accuracy of decimetres for H-S The operationalization of these methods then allows the robust automatic processing in near real time (NRT) to support forecast agencies by providing validations for model results. A new empirical algorithm XWAVE_C (C = coastal) for estimation of significant wave height from X-band satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been developed, adopted for coastal applications using TerraSAR-X (TS-X) and Tandem-X (TD-X) satellites in the German Bight and implemented into the Sea Sate Processor (SSP) for fully automatic processing for NRT services. The algorithm is based on the spectral analysis of subscenes and the model function uses integrated image spectra parameters as well as local wind information from the analyzed subscene. The algorithm is able to recognize and remove the influence of non-sea state produced signals in the Wadden Sea areas such as dry sandbars as well as nonlinear SAR image distortions produced by e.g. short wind waves and breaking waves. Also parameters of very short waves, which are not visible in SAR images and produce only unsystematic clutter, can be accurately estimated. The SSP includes XWAVE_C, a pre-filtering procedure for removing artefacts such as ships, seamarks, buoys, offshore constructions and slicks, and an additional procedure performing a check of results based on the statistics of the whole scene. The SSP allows an automatic processing of TS-X images with an error RMSE = 25 cm and Scatter Index SI = 20% for total significant wave height H-S from sequences of TS-X StripMap images with a coverage of similar to 30 km x 300 km across the German Bight. The SSP was tuned spatially with model data of the German Weather Service's (DWD) CWAM (Coastal WAve Model) with 900 m horizontal resolution and tuned in situ with 6 buoys located in DWD model domain in the German Bight. The collected, processed and analyzed data base for the German Bight consists of more than 60 TS-X StripMap scenes/overflights with more than 200 images since 2013 with sea state acquired in the domain H-S = 0-7 m with a mean value of 1.25 m over all available scenes at buoy locations. The paper addresses the development and implementation of XWAVE_C, and presents the possibilities of SSP delivering sea state fields by reproducing local H-S variations connected with local wind gusts, variable bathymetry and moving wind fronts under different weather conditions.

J	Zou, YR; Shi, LJ; Zhang, SL; Liang, C; Zeng, T				Zou Yarong; Shi Lijian; Zhang Shengli; Liang Chao; Zeng Tao			Oil spill detection by a support vector machine based on polarization decomposition characteristics	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Marine oil spills have caused major threats to marine environment over the past few years. The early detection of the oil spill is of great significance for the prevention and control of marine disasters. At present, remote sensing is one of the major approaches for monitoring the oil spill. Full polarization synthetic aperture radarc SAR data are employed to extract polarization decomposition parameters including entropy (H) and reflection entropy (A). The characteristic spectrum of the entropy and reflection entropy combination has analyzed and the polarization characteristic spectrum of the oil spill has developed to support remote sensing of the oil spill. The findings show that the information extracted from (1-A)x(1-H) and (1-H)xA parameters is relatively evident effects. The results of extraction of the oil spill information based on HxA parameter are relatively not good. The combination of the two has something to do with H and A values. In general, when H>0.7, A value is relatively small. Here, the extraction of the oil spill information using (1-A)x (1-H) and (1-H)xA parameters obtains evident effects. Whichever combined parameter is adopted, oil well data would cause certain false alarm to the extraction of the oil spill information. In particular the false alarm of the extracted oil spill information based on (1-A)x(1-H) is relatively high, while the false alarm based on (1-A)xH and (1-H)xA parameters is relatively small, but an image noise is relatively big. The oil spill detection employing polarization characteristic spectrum support vector machine can effectively identify the oil spill information with more accuracy than that of the detection method based on single polarization feature.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				SEP	2016	35	9					86	90		10.1007/s13131-016-0935-5								WOS:000383924200011						
J	Farrington, JW; Burns, KA; Leinen, MS				Farrington, John W.; Burns, Kathryn A.; Leinen, Margaret S.			Synthesis and Crosscutting Topics	OCEANOGRAPHY												In recent years, there have been significant advances in fluid dynamics/physical oceanography, microbiology, weathering, remote sensing, and analytical chemistry as they pertain to the fate and effects of oil spills. Effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on water column organisms and ecosystems have been difficult to ascertain. Laboratory experiments have expanded understanding of oil effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton. "Marine oil snow" has been identified as a significant factor in the fate of oil chemicals and their deposition with sediments. Oil chemicals and their effects on 24 km(2) of mud-benthic communities surrounding the well site, and in a few other areas, have lasted several years. Some deep-sea corals have also been affected for several years, and oil chemicals and their effects in heavily oiled marsh areas are projected to last a decade or longer. Lightly oiled marsh areas have recovered or are recovering. Research about use of dispersants highlights the need to update the 2005 National Research Council study of dispersant use on oil spills. Ongoing research should provide some closure for the issues of long-term effects on fisheries and marine mammals, and impacts on human health. Practical uses of this new knowledge are discussed briefly.																	1042-8275					SEP	2016	29	3			SI		204	213		10.5670/oceanog.2016.84								WOS:000382334500026						
J	Kordi, MN; O'Leary, M				Kordi, Moataz N.; O'Leary, Michael			Geomorphic classification of coral reefs in the north western Australian shelf	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Coral reefs occur extensively along the northwest Australian continental shelf in the Kimberley Bioregion (KIM), forming major geomorphic features along and just off the coast. These reefs have not been studied in as much detail as the offshore reefs and are poorly known due to the coastal conditions, including extremely high tide regimes, high turbidity and complex coastline morphology. This study aims to establish a regional-scale distribution map of exposed and intertidal reefs of the KIM and to classify the Kimberley reefs into types, adopting widely recognised reef classification and typology schemes. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used in this study to process and produce digital maps as well as to provide some of the first detailed spatial analysis of reef distribution. Outcomes of this study showed that the Kimberley reefs possess strong morphological complexity and clear regional patterns. The study revealed that the number of Kimberley reefs and their area are considerably (60%) greater than previously thought; the total combined reefal area is approximately 1,950 km(2). Fringing reefs have been identified as the dominant reef type and are widely distributed throughout the KIM. It was also found that tidal range affected the distribution of reef geomorphologies. The outcomes of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the Kimberley reefs, and provide marine park managers with essential and quality scientific information so that better management decisions can be made in this area.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

J	Wang, MH; Son, S				Wang, Menghua; Son, SeungHyun			VIIRS-derived chlorophyll-a using the ocean color index method	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An implementation approach using the ocean color index (OCI)-based chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) algorithm for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) has been developed. The OCI Chl-a algorithm for satellite-derived Chl-a data was originally developed by Hu, Lee, and Franz (2012) (J. Geophys. Res., 117, C01011, doi: 01010.01029/02011JC007395) for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It uses two Chl-a algorithms, i.e., the color index (CO-based (reflectance difference-based) algorithm for oligotrophic waters and the usual ocean chlorophyll-type (OCx)-based (reflectance ratio-based) algorithm (e.g., OO3M for MODIS and OC3V for VIIRS), and merges the two algorithms for different Chl-a range applications (named OCI algorithm). In this study, we use the in situ Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) optics data to demonstrate conclusively that using the OCI-based Chl-a algorithm can significantly improve VIIRS Chl-a data over oligotrophic waters with much reduced data noise from instrument calibration and the imperfect atmospheric correction. Using the VIIRS-measured global Chl-a data derived from the Multi Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, we have developed the Cl-based algorithm specifically for VIIRS, and further improved the two Chl-a algorithms merging method using the blue-green reflectance ratio values. Extensive evaluation results show that the new OCI Chl-a algorithm for VIIRS can produce consistent Chl-a data compared with those from the OC3V algorithm. In particular, the data transition between the CI-based and OC3V-based Chl-a algorithm is quite smooth, and there are no obvious discontinuities in VIIRS-derived Chl-a data. The new OCI-based Chl-a algorithm has been implemented in MSL12 for routine production of VIIRS global Chl-a data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1 x 1 spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FIexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.

A review of marine geomorphometry, the quantitative study of the seafloor	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Geomorphometry, the science of quantitative terrain characterization, has traditionally focused on the investigation of terrestrial landscapes. However, the dramatic increase in the availability of digital bathymetric data and the increasing ease by which geomorphometry can be investigated using geographic information systems (GISs) and spatial analysis software has prompted interest in employing geomorphometric techniques to investigate the marine environment. Over the last decade or so, a multitude of geomorphometric techniques (e.g. terrain attributes, feature extraction, automated classification) have been applied to characterize seabed terrain from the coastal zone to the deep sea. Geomorphometric techniques are, however, not as varied, nor as extensively applied, in marine as they are in terrestrial environments. This is at least partly due to difficulties associated with capturing, classifying, and validating terrain characteristics underwater. There is, nevertheless, much common ground between terrestrial and marine geomorphometry applications and it is important that, in developing marine geomorphometry, we learn from experiences in terrestrial studies. However, not all terrestrial solutions can be adopted by marine geomorphometric studies since the dynamic, four-dimensional (4-D) nature of the marine environment causes its own issues throughout the geomorphometry workflow. For instance, issues with underwater positioning, variations in sound velocity in the water column affecting acoustic-based mapping, and our inability to directly observe and measure depth and morphological features on the seafloor are all issues specific to the application of geomorphometry in the marine environment. Such issues fuel the need for a dedicated scientific effort in marine geomorphometry. This review aims to highlight the relatively recent growth of marine geomorphometry as a distinct discipline, and offers the first comprehensive overview of marine geomorphometry to date. We address all the five main steps of geomorphometry, from data collection to the application of terrain attributes and features. We focus on how these steps are relevant to marine geomorphometry and also highlight differences and similarities from terrestrial geomorphometry. We conclude with recommendations and reflections on the future of marine geomorphometry. To ensure that geomorphometry is used and developed to its full potential, there is a need to increase awareness of (1) marine geomorphometry amongst scientists already engaged in terrestrial geomorphometry, and of (2) geomorphometry as a science amongst marine scientists with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.

E.			Seasonal change of phytoplankton (spring vs. summer) in the southern Patagonian shelf	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												As part of the Patagonian Experiment (PATEX) project two sequential seasons (spring/summer 2007-2008) were sampled in the southern Patagonian shelf, when physical-chemical-biological (phytoplankton) data were collected. Phytoplankton biomass and community composition were assessed through both microscopic and high-performance liquid chromatography/chemical taxonomy (HPLC/CHEMTAX) techniques and related to both in situ and satellite data at spatial and seasonal scales. Phytoplankton seasonal variation was clearly modulated by water column thermohaline structure and nutrient dynamics [mainly dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and silicate]. The spring phytoplankton community showed elevated biomass and was dominated by diatoms [mainly Corethron pennatum and small ( <20 mu m) cells of Thalassiosira spp.], associated with a deeper and more weakly stratified upper mixed layer depth (UMLD) and relatively low nutrient concentrations, which were probably a result of consumption by the diatom bloom. In contrast, the phytoplankton community in summer presented lower biomass and was mainly dominated by haptophytes (primarily Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis antarctica) and dinoflagellates, associated with shallower and well-stratified upper mixed layers with higher nutrient concentrations, likely due to lateral advection of nutrient-rich waters from the Malvinas Current. The gradual establishment of a strongly stratified and shallow UMLD as season progressed, was an important factor leading to the replacement of the spring diatom community by a dominance of calcifying organisms, as shown in remote sensing imagery and confirmed by microscopic examination. Furthermore, in spring, phaeopigments a (degradation products of chlorophyll a) relative to chlorophyll a, were twice that of summer, indicating the diatom bloom was under higher grazing pressure.

Habitat and distribution predictions for marine fishery species under climate change scenarios are important for understanding the overall impacts of such global changes on the human society and on the ecosystem. In this study, we examine the impacts of climate change on anchovy fisheries off Chile using predicted changes in global models according to the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model 3.0 (CCSM3) and IPCC high future CO2 emission scenario A2, habitat suitability index (HSI) models and satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimates from high-resolution regional models for the simulation period 2015-2065. Predictions of SST from global climate models were regionalised using the Delta statistical down scaling technique. Predictions of chlorophyll-a were developed using historical Chl-a and SST (20032013) satellite data and applying a harmonic model. The results show an increase. in SST of up to 2.5 degrees C by 2055 in the north and central-south area for an A2 scenario. The habitat suitability index model was developed using historical (2001-2011) monthly fisheries and environmental data. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) was used as an abundance index in developing the HSI models and was calculated as the total catch (ton) by hold capacity (m(3)) in a 10' x 10' fishing grid square of anchovy, integrated over one month of fishing activity. The environmental data included the distance to coast (DC), thermal (SST) and food availability (Chl-a) conditions. The HSI modelling consists of estimating SI curves based on available evidence regarding the optimum range of environmental conditions for anchovy and estimating an integrated HSI using the Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM) method. The results of this work show that the model has produced robust estimates of habitat suitability and geographic distribution off Chile and has been especially effective in capturing the spatial and temporal variability of CPUE. Using IDRISI geographical information system (GIS), these HSI models simulated monthly changes in the habitat suitability (i.e., relative abundance) and distribution of anchovy off Chile forced by changes in the regionalised SST and Chl-a as projected by the NCAR model under the A2 emission scenario. The simulations predicted a moderate negative change of 17% and 13% for the north and central-south areas, respectively, in the habitat suitability (i.e., potential relative abundance) of anchovy by 2055.

I. C. A) project. The system consists of a submerged, reinforced, multi-fiber cable containing six single-mode telecom grade optical fibers that, exploiting the stimulated Brillouin scattering, provide distributed temperature sensing (DTS) with 1 m of spatial resolution. The obtained data show that the offshore caldera, at least along the monitored profile, has many points of heat discharge associated with fluid emission. A loose association between the temperature profile and the main structural features of the offshore caldera was also evidenced by comparing DTS data with a high-resolution reflection seismic survey. This represents an important advancement in the monitoring of this high-risk volcanic area, since temperature variations are among the precursors of magma migration towards the surface and are also crucial data in the study of caldera dynamics. The adopted system can also be applied to many other calderas which are often partially or largely submerged and hence difficult to monitor.

Multi-directional wave spectra from marine X-band radar	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The signal measured by heave-pitch-roll directional wave buoys yields the first four coefficients of a Fourier series. Data adaptive methods must be employed to estimate a directional wave spectrum. Marine X-band radars (MRs) have the advantage over buoys that they can measure "model-free" two-dimensional (2D) wave spectra. This study presents the first comprehensive validation of MR-derived multi-directional wave characteristics. It is based on wave data from the 2010 Impact of Typhoons on the Ocean in the Pacific (ITOP) experiment in the Philippine Sea, namely MR measurements from R/V Roger Revelle, Extreme Air-Sea Interaction (EASI) buoy measurements, as well as WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) modeling results. Buoy measurements of mean direction and spreading as function of frequency, which do not require data adaptive methods, are used to validate the WW3 wave spectra. An advanced MR wave retrieval technique is introduced that addresses various shortcomings of existing methods. Spectral partitioning techniques, applied to MR and WW3 results, reveal that multimodal seas are frequently present. Both data sets are in excellent agreement, tracking the evolution of up to 4 simultaneous wave systems over extended time periods.

J.; Ghedira, Hosni			Corals & benthic habitat mapping using DubaiSat-2: a spectral-spatial approach applied to Dalma Island, UAE (Arabian Gulf)	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Satellite remote sensing-based monitoring of coastal habitats, like those in the Arabian Gulf, presents a special challenge due to the attenuation of light through the turbid atmosphere and water, as well as the spectral similarity of many benthic habitats. The present study aims to evaluate the potential of DubaiSat-2 imagery in mapping corals and benthic habitat in the vicinity of Dalma Island, United Arab Emirates (UAE). To do so, this study proposes a spectral-spatial method that uses a combination of different remote sensing techniques in order to discern benthic communities with reference to their spatial distribution. This method involves multi-level segmentation, non-linear feature analysis and ensemble learning methods for the characterization of corals, benthic classes and underlying seabeds. Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest, pixel-based methods, were also used for comparison of classification performances. Comparative data are derived from published marine habitat maps. The spectral-spatial method achieves 96.60% overall accuracy. Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest classification methods are assessed to be 92.59% and 94.52% accurate, respectively. The application of the proposed method and the use of DubaiSat-2 imagery can help in achieving well-designed coastal management plans in the region.

Subglacial hydrology at Rink Isbrae, West Greenland inferred from sediment plume appearance	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY					International Symposium on Hydrology of Glaciers and Ice Sheets	JUN, 2015	Hofn, ICELAND	Univ Iceland, Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Iceland Meteorol Off, Natl Power Co Iceland, Iceland Road & Coastal Adm, Iceland Glaciol Soc, Geoscience Soc Iceland				Marine-terminating outlet glaciers discharge most of the Greenland ice sheet's mass through frontal ablation and meltwater runoff. While calving can be estimated by in situ and remote sensing observations, submarine melting and subglacial meltwater transport are more challenging to quantify. Here we investigate the subglacial hydrology of Rink Isbrae, a fast-flowing West Greenland tidewater glacier, using time-lapse photography, modeled runoff estimates and daily satellite imagery from 2007 to 2011. We find that sediment plumes appear episodically at four distinct locations across the terminus, and last between 2 h and 17 d. This suggests short-term variability in discharge and the existence of persistent pathways. The seasonal onset of sediment plumes occurs before supraglacial lake drainages, shortly after the onset of runoff, and only after the wintertime ice melange has begun disintegrating. Plumes were also visible after the cessation of runoff (23 +/- 5 d), which is indicative of subglacial storage. The lack of either a seasonal velocity change or a correspondence between meltwater availability and plume occurrence suggests that the subglacial system persists in a state of inefficient drainage. Subglacial hydrology at tidewater glaciers is of critical importance in understanding dynamics at the ice front.

Motivated by these considerations, the CADDYCognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy FP7 project sets forth the main goal of developing a cooperative autonomous underwater robotic system to monitor and assist human divers, thus affording them increased levels of safety during the execution of challenging scientific and commercial missions. This article presents the main results obtained in the first 2 years of the project along the following main research topics: Seeing the Diver, where the focus is placed on the 3D reconstruction of a diver's model (pose estimation and recognition of hand gestures) through remote and local sensing technologies, thus enabling behavior interpretation; Understanding the Diver, with the objective of interpreting the model and physiological measurements of the diver in order to determine the state of the diver; and Diver-Robot Cooperation and Control, aimed at investigating the interaction of the diver with underwater vehicles endowed with rich sensory motor skills, focusing on cooperative control and optimal formation with the diver as an integral part of the overall vehicle-diver formation.

TSS models applicable to data collected by satellite sensors can be used to determine TSS with reasonable accuracy and of adequate spatial and temporal resolution to be of use for coastal water quality monitoring. Thus, a study is presented here where we develop a semi-analytic sediment model (SASM) applicable to any sensor with red and near infrared (NIR) bands. The calibration and validation of the SASM using bootstrap and cross-validation methods showed that the SASM applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua band 1 data retrieved TSS with a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean averaged relative error (MARE) of 5.75 mg/L and 33.33% respectively. The application of the SASM over our study region using MODIS-Aqua band 1 data showed that the SASM can be used to monitor the on-going, post and pre-dredging activities and identify daily TSS anomalies that are caused by natural and anthropogenic processes in coastal waters of northern Western Australia.

However, restricted by the tough observation conditions, few underway datasets of sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) have been obtained, with most of them in the eastern areas. Satellite remote sensing data can provide valuable information covered by a large area synchronously with high temporal resolution for assessments of pCO(2) that subsequently allow quantification of air-sea carbon dioxide 2 flux. However, pCO(2) in the Bering Sea is controlled by multiple factors and thus it is hard to develop a remote sensing algorithm with empirical regression methods. In this paper pCO(2) in the Bering Sea from July to September was derived based on a mechanistic semi-analytical algorithm (MeSAA). It was assumed that the observed pCO(2) can be analytically expressed as the sum of individual components controlled by major factors. First, a reference water mass that was minimally influenced by biology and mixing was identified in the central basin, and then thermodynamic and biological effects were parameterized for the entire area. Finally, we estimated pCO(2) with satellite temperature and chlorophyll data. Satellite results agreed well with the underway observations. Our study suggested that throughout the Bering Sea the biological effect on pCO(2) was more than twice as important as temperature, and contributions of other effects were relatively small. Furthermore, satellite observations demonstrate that the spring phytoplankton bloom had a delayed effect on summer pCO(2) but that the influence of this biological event varied regionally; it was more significant on the continental slope, with a later bloom, than that on the shelf with an early bloom. Overall, the MeSAA algorithm was not only able to estimate pCO(2) in the Bering Sea for the first time, but also provided a quantitative analysis of the contribution of various processes that influence pCO(2).																	2072-4292					JUL	2016	8	7							558	10.3390/rs8070558								WOS:000382224800028						
J	Wei, YB; Zhang, JK; Lu, ZZ				Wei, Yanbo; Zhang, Jian-Kang; Lu, Zhizhong			A Novel Successive Cancellation Method to Retrieve Sea Wave Components from Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Image Sequences	REMOTE SENSING												In this paper, we consider retrieving individual wave components in a multi-directional sea wave model. To solve this problem, a currently and commonly used method is three-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (3D DFT) on the radar image sequence. However, the uniform frequency and the uniform wavenumber in a wavenumber frequency domain can not always strictly satisfy the dispersion relation, and the spectral leakage in both temporal and spatial domains exists due to the limited analysis area selected from an image sequence. As a result, the DFT method incurs undesirable error performance in retrieving directional wave components. By deeply investigating the data structure of the multi-directional sea wave model, we obtain a new and decomposable matrix representation for processing the wave components. Then, a novel successive cancellation method is proposed to efficiently and effectively extract individual wave components, whose frequency and wavenumber rigorously satisfy the liner dispersion relation. Thus, it avoids spectral leakage in the spatial domain. The algorithm is evaluated by using linear synthetic wave image sequences. The validity of the proposed novel algorithm is verified by comparing the retrieved parameters of amplitude, phase, and direction of the individual wave components with the simulated parameters as well as those obtained by using the 3D DFT method. In addition, the reconstructed sea field using the retrieved wave components is also compared with the simulated remote sensing images as well as those attained using the inverse 3D DFT method. All the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is more effective and has better performance for retrieving individual wave components from the spatio-temporal remote sensing image sequences than the 3D DFT method.																	2072-4292					JUL	2016	8	7							607	10.3390/rs8070607								WOS:000382224800077

Seascapes as a new vernacular for pelagic ocean monitoring, management and conservation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												For terrestrial and marine benthic ecologists, landscape ecology provides a framework to address issues of complexity, patchiness, and scale-providing theory and context for ecosystem based management in a changing climate. Marine pelagic ecosystems are likewise changing in response to warming, changing chemistry, and resource exploitation. However, unlike spatial landscapes that migrate slowly with time, pelagic seascapes are embedded in a turbulent, advective ocean. Adaptations from landscape ecology to marine pelagic ecosystem management must consider the nature and scale of biophysical interactions associated with organisms ranging from microbes to whales, a hierarchical organization shaped by physical processes, and our limited capacity to observe and monitor these phenomena across global oceans. High frequency, multiscale, and synoptic characterization of the 4-D variability of seascapes are now available through improved classification methods, a maturing array of satellite remote sensing products, advances in autonomous sampling of multiple levels of biological complexity, and emergence of observational networks. Merging of oceanographic and ecological paradigms will be necessary to observe, manage, and conserve species embedded in a dynamic seascape mosaic, where the boundaries, extent, and location of features change with time.

Mediterranean aerosol typing by integrating three-wavelength lidar and sun photometer measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Backscatter lidar measurements at 355, 532, and 1064 nm combined with aerosol optical thicknesses (AOTs) from sun photometer measurements collocated in space and time were used to retrieve the vertical profiles of intensive and extensive aerosol parameters. Then, the vertical profiles of the ngstrom coefficients for different wavelength pairs (angstrom(lambda(1), lambda(2), z)), the color ratio (CR(z)), the fine mode fraction (eta(z)) at 532 nm, and the fine modal radius (R (f) (z)), which represent aerosol characteristic properties independent from the aerosol load, were used for typing the aerosol over the Central Mediterranean. The ability of the ngstrom coefficients to identify the main aerosol types affecting the Central Mediterranean with the support of the backward trajectory analysis was first demonstrated. Three main aerosol types, which were designed as continental-polluted (CP), marine-polluted (MP), and desert-polluted (DP), were identified. We found that both the variability range and the vertical profile structure of the tested aerosol intensive parameters varied with the aerosol type. The variability range and the altitude dependence of the aerosol extinction coefficients at 355, 532, and 1064 nm, respectively, also varied with the identified aerosol types even if they are extensive aerosol parameters. DP, MP, and CP aerosols were characterized by the angstrom(532, 1064 nm) mean values +/- 1 standard deviation equal to 0.5 +/- 0.2, 1.1 +/- 0.2, 1.6 +/- 0.2, respectively. eta(%) mean values +/- 1SD were equal to 50 +/- 10, 73 +/- 7, and 86 +/- 6 for DP, MP, and CP aerosols, respectively. The R (f) and CR mean values +/- 1SD were equal to 0.16 +/- 0.05 mu m and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively, for DP aerosols; to 0.12 +/- 0.03 mu m and 1.8 +/- 0.4, respectively, for MP aerosols; and to 0.11 +/- 0.02 mu m and 1.7 +/- 0.4, respectively, for CP aerosols. CP and DP aerosols were on average responsible for greater AOT and LR values, but the LR and AOT dependence on wavelength was stronger for CP than for DP aerosols. The plots of the lidar ratio values at 355 nm versus the mean columnar values of the 532-1064 nm ngstrom coefficient (angstrom(c)), the fine mode radius, the fine mode fraction at 532 nm (eta (c)), and the color ratio, respectively, furthermore revealed the greater ability of the angstrom(c) and eta (c) values to characterize different aerosol types.

A case study at Portofino MPA	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Baseline data on the distribution, condition and extent of coralligenous and cave bioconcretions is one of the main requirements of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) necessary to assess the achievement of a Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020. In this study the potential of remote sensing and distribution modelling techniques to map, measure descriptors and choose indicators were tested, that could provide standard methods for the assessment of the health status and assist in monitoring activities. It is demonstrated how, by combining different methodologies, it is possible to map the distribution of the bioconcretions with acceptable accuracy and to discriminate the main habitat types and fades. In addition, zonal statistical analysis revealed that fishing activities primarily coincide with areas of high coverage of the bioconcretions. Results demonstrate that the presented methodology is a valuable simple tool to assess several MSFD descriptors and indicators, and could strengthen management efficiency when making informed, ecologically relevant decisions.

J	Kordi, MN; O'Leary, M				Kordi, Moataz N.; O'Leary, Michael			A spatial approach to improve coastal bioregion management of the north western Australia	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Coral reefs are a major coastal feature of the Kimberley bioregion in north-western Australia; however, very little is known about the habitats and substrates of the reefs in this coast. Previous studies have been conducted on a broad scale, but no geomorphological, surface substrate and habitat maps of the reefs have been produced. Such maps would provide researchers and coastal zone managers with significant information and estimations of reef growth and productivity. The primary aim of this study was to obtain detailed information on reefs in the Kimberley bioregion. This study used remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as multiple other data sources, to map reef geomorphic zones and the associated key habitats and substrate types of shallow nearshore reefs. Despite the macrotidal regimes and the turbid waters of the study area, remote sensing was effectively used to identify the dominant habitats and substrate types of eight reef platforms. This study provides long-term quantitative assessments of the main habitats and substrates of these reefs and offers a better understanding of reefs in the Kimberly bioregion. It is also a source of valuable information for the marine park and coastal managers investigating the coral reefs that have been targeted for conservation, but have not yet been the subject of regional analysis.

Bridge-based sensing of NOX and SO2 emissions from ocean-going ships	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												As emissions from nonroad mobile sources face increased regulatory scrutiny, a surprisingly few number of real-world, in-use measurements exist for these sources. This paper reports the first use of an open path Remote Sensing Device (RSD) to measure emissions from ocean-going ships, including cruise ships. This noninvasive technique measured NOX and SO2 emission factors from 16 individually identified ocean-going ships as they passed under the Lions Gate Bridge in Vancouver, B.C. and their exhaust plumes passed through the sensing beam of the RSD on a bridge directly above. Ship NOX emissions generally agreed with previous studies showing no emissions trends across vessel type. Ship SO2 emissions were reasonable based on expected Environmental Control Area fuel sulfur requirements and corresponded to 0.4-2.4% sulfur in the fuels. This method's specificity of individual vessel SO2 measurements suggests that this technique could be used as a tool to detect high sulfur fuel use in vessels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The model works as a function of the inherent optical properties (absorption and backscattering), depth, and solar zenith angle. Results of this model are validated using a large number of in-situ measurements of K-d(lambda) in clear oceanic, turbid coastal and productive lagoon waters. To further evaluate its relative performance, K-d(lambda) values obtained from this model are compared with results from three existing models. Validation results show that the present model is a better descriptor of K-d(lambda) and shows an overall better performance compared to the existing models. The applicability of the present model is further tested on two Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) remote sensing images acquired simultaneously with our field measurements. The K-d(lambda) spectra derived from HICO imageries have good agreement with measured data with the mean relative percent error of less than 12% which are well within the benchmark for a validated uncertainty of +/- 35% endorsed for the remote sensing products in oceanic waters. The model offers potential advantages for predicting changes in spectral and vertical K-d values in a wide variety of waters within inland and coastal environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Three scattering corrections are applied to in situ absorption and attenuation profile data for a range of coastal and oceanic waters, but are found to have only very limited impact on subsequent closure attempts for these stations. Best-fit regressions on log-transformed measured and modelled downwards irradiance, E-d, and upwards radiance, L-u, profiles have median slopes between 0.92 - 1.24, revealing a tendency to underestimate E-d and L-u with depth. This is only partly explained by non-inclusion of fluorescence emission from CDOM and chlorophyll in the simulations. There are several stations where multiple volume scattering function related data processing steps perform poorly which suggests the potential existence of unresolved features in the modelling of the angular distribution of scattered photons. General optical closure therefore remains problematic, even though there are many cases in the data set where the match between measured and modelled radiometric data is within 25% RMS%E. These results are significant for applications that rely on optical closure e. g. assimilating ocean colour data into coupled physical-ecosystem models.

As part of the DUST Aging and Transport from Africa to the Caribbean (Dust-ATTACk) intensive field campaign, the size distribution and optical properties of mineral dust were measured in June-July 2012 on the east coast of Puerto Rico, more than 5000 km from the west coast of Africa. During the recorded dust events, the PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) concentrations increased from 20 to 70 mu gm(-3). Remote sensing observations and modeling analysis were used to identify the main source regions, which were found in the Western Sahara, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, and Mali. The microphysical and optical properties of the dust plumes were almost independent of origin. The size distribution of mineral dust after long-range transport may have modal diameters similar to those on the eastern side of the Atlantic short time after emission, possibly depending on height of transport. Additional submicron particles of anthropogenic absorbing aerosols (likely from regional marine traffic activities) can be mixed within the dust plumes, without affecting in a significant way the PM10 absorption properties of dust observed in Puerto Rico. The Dust-ATTACk experimental data set may be useful for modeling the direct radiative effect of dust. For accurate representation of dust optical properties over the Atlantic remote marine region, we recommend mass extinction efficiency (MEE) and single- scattering albedo values in the range 1.1-.5m(2)g(-1) and 0.97-0.98, respectively, for visible wavelengths.				andrews, elisabeth/A-7104-2018	andrews, elisabeth/0000-0002-9394-024X; Cassola, Federico/0000-0003-4670-740X												2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	2016	121	12					7117	7138		10.1002/2016JD024783								WOS:000381631800026

In the present study, a hybrid model is presented along with empirical methods to remotely determine the amount and type of CDOM in coastal and inland water environments. A large set of in-situ data collected on several oceanographic cruises and field campaigns from different regional waters was used to develop empirical methods for studying the distribution and dynamics of CDOM, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and salinity. Our validation analyses demonstrated that the hybrid model is a better descriptor of CDOM absorption spectra compared to the existing models. Additional spectral slope parameters included in the present model to differentiate between terrestrially derived and marine CDOM pools make a substantial improvement over those existing models. Empirical algorithms to derive CDOM, DOC and salinity from remote sensing reflectance data demonstrated success in retrieval of these products with significantly low mean relative percent differences from large in-situ measurements. The performance of these algorithms was further assessed using three hyperspectral HICO images acquired simultaneously with our field measurements in productive coastal and lagoon waters on the southeast part of India. The validation match-ups of CDOM and salinity showed good agreement between HICO retrievals and field observations. Further analyses of these data showed significant temporal changes in CDOM and phytoplankton absorption coefficients with a distinct phase shift between these two products. Healthy phytoplanlcton cells and macrophytes were recognized to directly contribute to the autochthonous production of colored humic-like substances in variable amounts within the lagoon system, despite CDOM content being partly derived through river run-off and wetland discharges as well as from conservative mixing of different water masses. Spatial and temporal maps of CDOM, DOC and salinity products provided an interesting insight into these CDOM dynamics and conservative behavior within the lagoon and its extension in coastal and offshore waters of the Bay of Bengal. The hybrid model and empirical algorithms presented here can be useful to assess CDOM, DOC and salinity fields and their changes in response to increasing runoff of nutrient pollution, anthropogenic activities, hydrographic variations and climate oscillations.

Agardh is one of the most diverse genera of marine macroalgae, and commonly inhabits shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters. This study aimed at investigating the effect of seasonality and the associated water-quality changes on the distribution, canopy cover, mean thallus length and biomass of Sargassum beds around Point Peron, Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, southwest Australia. Samples of Sargassum and seawater were collected every 3 mo from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2014, from 4 different reef zones. A combination of in situ observations and WorldView-2 satellite remote-sensing images were used to map the spatial distribution of Sargassum beds and other associated benthic habitats. The results demonstrated strong seasonal variation in the physicochemical water parameters, canopy cover, mean thallus length, and biomass of Sargassum, which were significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by nutrient concentrations (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and rainfall. However, no significant variation in any studied parameter was observed among the 4 reef zones. The highest Sargassum biomass peaks occurred between late spring and early summer (from September to January). The results provide essential information to guide effective conservation and management, as well as sustainable utilisation of this renewable coastal marine resource.

Environmental correlates of nearshore habitat distribution by the Critically Endangered M(a)over-barui dolphin	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Effective management of space-use conflicts with anthropogenic activities is contingent upon reliable knowledge of a species' ecology. The M (a) over bar ui dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori maui is endemic to New Zealand and is listed as Critically Endangered, mainly as a result of fisheries bycatch. Despite conservation efforts, the population was estimated at 55 animals in 2011. Here we investigate environmental correlates of M (a) over bar ui dolphin nearshore distribution, using 119 encounters with M (a) over bar ui dolphin groups during boat-based, coastal surveys across 4 summers (2010, 2011, 2013, 2015). We describe the nearshore distribution using a kernel density analysis with differential smoothing on the x- and y-axes to account for the nearshore preference of the dolphins and the survey design. In all years, dolphins were encountered consistently in a restricted area (4 year area of overlap: 87.3 km(2)). We modelled habitat preference with boosted regression trees, using presence/absence of dolphins relative to static and dynamic environmental predictors. An index of coastal turbidity was created based on a near-linear relationship between Secchi disk measurements and log-transformed remotely sensed chl a concentration. Sea surface temperature (SST; 22.6% contribution), turbidity (22.2%), distance to major watersheds (17%), depth (14.5%), distance to minor watersheds (13.3%) and distance to the coast (10.4%) partly explained M (a) over bar ui dolphin distribution. We detected a match between predicted areas of high nearshore habitat suitability around North Island and historical sightings (76.2% overlap), thus highlighting potential areas of M (a) over bar ui dolphin recovery. Our study presents methods broadly applicable to distribution analyses, and demonstrates an evidence-based application toward managing M (a) over bar ui dolphin habitat.

Strong anthropization, over-exploitation of natural resources, and climate change affect the natural amount of phytoplankton and, therefore, represent a continuous threat to the biodiversity in marine waters. In particular, a concerning risks for coastal waters is the increase in nutrient inputs of terrestrial/anthropogenic origin that can lead to undesirable modifications of phytoplankton concentration (i.e., eutrophication). Monitoring chlorophyll (Chl) concentration, which is a proxy of phytoplankton biomass, is an efficient tool for recording and understanding the response of the marine ecosystem to human pressures and thus for detecting eutrophication. Here, we compute Chl trends over the Mediterranean Sea by using satellite data, also highlighting the fact that remote sensing may represent an efficient and reliable solution to synoptically control the "good environmental status" (i.e., the Marine Directive to achieve Good Environmental Status of EU marine waters by 2020) and to assess the application of international regulations and environmental directives. Our methodology includes the use of an ad hoc regional (i.e., Mediterranean) algorithm for Chl concentration retrieval, also accounting for the difference between offshore (i.e., Case I) and coastal (i.e., Case II) waters. We apply the Mann-Kendall test and the Sens's method for trend estimation to the Chl concentration de-seasonalized monthly time series, as obtained from the X-11 technique. We also provide a preliminary analysis of some particular trends by evaluating their associated inter-annual variability. The high spatial resolution of our approach allows a clear identification of intense trends in those coastal waters that are affected by river outflows. We do not attempt to attribute the observed trends to specific anthropogenic events. However, the trends that we document are consistent with the findings of several previous studies.

J	Abualhin, K				Abualhin, Khaldoun			Mapping of Underwater Seabed Morphology of the Gaza Strip Coastal Zone Using Remote sensing technique	Earth Sciences Research Journal												The study investigated the feasibility of applying the depth-invariant index algorithm to delineate the shallow underwater geomorphological features using QuickBird imagery. Although the technical procedures of the depthinvariant index are already demonstrated in the professional literature, the algorithm needs to be applied and tested in several coastal regions with different seawater conditions and properties. Some of the geomorphological features in the coastal zone of the Gaza Strip are seasonal features such as underwater sand bars. However, since these features are non-permanent and dynamic, it would be useful to utilize satellite data to detect changes in both locations and depth, and also to monitor this feature in shallow coastal water. The importance of identifying the underwater sand bars in the coastal zone can be significant in the case of rip currents, and swimming conditions. Additionally, using satellite imagery for detecting dynamic underwater coastal morphologies may enable local authorities to adopt such an algorithm with a combination of satellite imagery for fast, efficient and extensive coverage mapping. While information about seafloor features can be obtained using active satellite data such as RADAR or LiDAR imagery, active satellite data are not available and require advanced processing and logistical resources, which are difficult to obtain in the case of the Gaza Strip. The study instead used passive QuickBird satellite imagery to map and delineate the seabed morphologies through the calculating the depth-invariant index for the spectral bands. By using the depth-invariant index, it was possible to distinguish and delineate the major underwater sand bars within the entire coastal zone of the Gaza Strip. Also, the spectral and spatial resolution of QuickBird imagery exhibited a substantial capability in mapping and delineating the underwater seabed morphologies.																	1794-6190					JUN	2016	20	2								10.15446/esrj.v20n2.50256								WOS:000392804600004

This review synthesizes current understanding of high-latitude (>= 50 degrees N and >= 40 degrees S) dust source geography and dynamics and provides a prospectus for future research on the topic. Although the fundamental processes controlling aeolian dust emissions in high latitudes are essentially the same as in temperate regions, there are additional processes specific to or enhanced in cold regions. These include low temperatures, humidity, strong winds, permafrost and niveo-aeolian processes all of which can affect the efficiency of dust emission and distribution of sediments. Dust deposition at high latitudes can provide nutrients to the marine system, specifically by contributing iron to high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll oceans; it also affects ice albedo and melt rates. There have been no attempts to quantify systematically the expanse, characteristics, or dynamics of high-latitude dust sources. To address this, we identify and compare the main sources and drivers of dust emissions in the Northern (Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Iceland) and Southern (Antarctica, New Zealand, and Patagonia) Hemispheres. The scarcity of year-round observations and limitations of satellite remote sensing data at high latitudes are discussed. It is estimated that under contemporary conditions high-latitude sources cover >500,000 km(2) and contribute at least 80-100 Tg yr(-1) of dust to the Earth system (similar to 5% of the global dust budget); both are projected to increase under future climate change scenarios.

This approach has two components: (1) a scheme of combining a neural network and an algebraic solution for the derivation of IOPs, and (2) relationships between R-rs residual errors at 670 nm and other spectral bands. This approach is evaluated with both synthetic and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data, and the results show that it can significantly reduce the effects of residual errors in R-rs on the retrieval of IOPs, and at the same time remove partially the R-rs residual errors for "low-quality'' and "high-quality'' data defined in this study. Furthermore, more consistent estimation of chlorophyll concentrations between the empirical blue-green ratio and band-difference algorithms can be derived from the corrected "low-quality'' and "high-quality'' R-rs. These results suggest that it is possible to improve both data quality and quantity of satellite-retrieved R-rs over clear open-ocean waters with a step considering the spectral relationships of the residual errors in R-rs after the default atmospheric correction procedure and without fixing R-rs at 670 nm to one value for clear waters in a small region such as 3 x 3 box.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2016	121	6					3866	3886		10.1002/2016JC011673								WOS:000383467800012

Examination of Abiotic Drivers and Their Influence on Spartina alterniflora Biomass over a Twenty-Eight Year Period Using Landsat 5 TM Satellite Imagery of the Central Georgia Coast	REMOTE SENSING												We examined the influence of abiotic drivers on inter-annual and phenological patterns of aboveground biomass for Marsh Cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, on the Central Georgia Coast. The linkages between drivers and plant response via soil edaphic factors are captured in our graphical conceptual model. We used geospatial techniques to scale up in situ measurements of aboveground S. alterniflora biomass to landscape level estimates using 294 Landsat 5 TM scenes acquired between 1984 and 2011. For each scene we extracted data from the same 63 sampling polygons, containing 1222 pixels covering about 1.1 million m(2). Using univariate and multiple regression tests, we compared Landsat derived biomass estimates for three S. alterniflora size classes against a suite of abiotic drivers. River discharge, total precipitation, minimum temperature, and mean sea level had positive relationships with and best explained biomass for all dates. Additional results, using seasonally binned data, indicated biomass was responsive to changing combinations of variables across the seasons. Our 28-year analysis revealed aboveground biomass declines of 33%, 35%, and 39% for S. alterniflora tall, medium, and short size classes, respectively. This decline correlated with drought frequency and severity trends and coincided with marsh die-backs events and increased snail herbivory in the second half of the study period.

J	Uhl, F; Bartsch, I; Oppelt, N				Uhl, Florian; Bartsch, Inka; Oppelt, Natascha			Submerged Kelp Detection with Hyperspectral Data	REMOTE SENSING												Submerged marine forests of macroalgae known as kelp are one of the key structures for coastal ecosystems worldwide. These communities are responding to climate driven habitat changes and are therefore appropriate indicators of ecosystem status and health. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a tool for a spatial kelp habitat mapping. The difficulty in optical kelp mapping is the retrieval of a significant kelp signal through the water column. Detecting submerged kelp habitats is challenging, in particular in turbid coastal waters. We developed a fully automated simple feature detection processor to detect the presence of kelp in submerged habitats. We compared the performance of this new approach to a common maximum likelihood classification using hyperspectral AisaEAGLE data from the subtidal zones of Helgoland, Germany. The classification results of 13 flight stripes were validated with transect diving mappings. The feature detection showed a higher accuracy till a depth of 6 m (overall accuracy = 80.18%) than the accuracy of a maximum likelihood classification (overall accuracy = 57.66%). The feature detection processor turned out as a time-effective approach to assess and monitor submerged kelp at the limit of water visibility depth.																	2072-4292					JUN	2016	8	6							487	10.3390/rs8060487								WOS:000379985300046

Due to a wide latitudinal distribution, Brazilian mangroves can be found within a large range of environmental conditions. However, little attention has been given to the description of environmental variables driving the distribution of mangrove species in Brazil. In this study, we present a novel and unprecedented description of environmental conditions for all mangroves along the Brazilian coast focusing on species limits. We apply a descriptive statistics and data-driven approach using Self-Organizing Maps and we combine data from terrestrial and marine environmental geodatabases in a Geographical Information System. We evaluate 25 environmental variables (21 bioclimatic variables, three sea surface temperature derivates, and salinity). The results reveal three groups of correlated variables: (i) air temperature derivates and sea surface temperature derivates; (ii) air temperature, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation derivates; and (iii) precipitation derivates, aridity and salinity. Our results unveil new locations of extreme values of temperature and precipitation. We conclude that Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa are more limited by precipitation and aridity and that they do not necessarily follow a latitudinal gradient. Our data also reveal that the lowest air temperatures of the coldest month are not necessarily found at the southernmost limits of mangroves in Brazil; instead they are localized at the Mesoregion of Vale do Itajai. However, the minimum sea surface temperature drops gradually with higher latitudes in the Brazilian southern hemisphere and is probably a better indicator for the decrease of species at the latitudinal limits of mangroves than the air temperature and precipitation.

Recent studies by Lebassi et al. found that the average maximum air temperatures during the summer in two populated California coastal areas decreased at low-elevation areas open to marine air penetration during the period of 1970-2005. This coastal cooling was attributed to an increase in sea-breeze activity. The aims of this work are to better understand the coastal flow patterns and sea-land thermal gradient by improving the land-cover classification scheme in the region using updated airborne remote sensing data and to assess the suitability of the updated regional atmospheric modeling system for representing maritime flows in this region. This study uses high-resolution airborne data from the NASA Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission preparatory flight campaign over Southern California and surface ground stations to compare observations against model estimations. Five new urban land classes were created using broadband albedo derived from the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor and then assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The updated model captures the diurnal spatial and temporal sea-breeze patterns in the region. Results show notable improvements of simulated daytime surface temperature and coastal winds using the HyspIRI-derived products in the model against the default land classification, reaffirming the importance of accounting for heterogeneity of urban surface properties.

Low-altitude remote sensing using a digital camera suspended from a vessel-towed balloon is used to track trajectories of floating buoys deployed on the ocean. Surface-current velocities are thereafter computed by sequentially moving buoy locations on photo images converted into ground (Cartesian) coordinates. Field experiments were conducted in July and August 2013 using a balloon towed by a research vessel on the Seto Inland Sea. The image-derived currents were compared with those derived from buoy locations recorded by GPS receivers attached to each floating buoy. It was found that surface currents computed using GPS data contain unrealistic values arising from stochastic fluctuations in those data. However, the image-derived currents reproduced well convergent flows and a cyclonic eddy that accumulated foam and marine debris, as actually observed during the surveys. This performance is attributed to the fact that the image processing acts as a filter to remove erroneous buoy locations in computing surface currents. The estimated error was 4.1 cm s(-1), sufficiently small to measure snapshots of surface coastal currents with magnitudes greater than several tens of centimeters per second.

The mapping approach was based on data provided by conventional onland field works, marine remote sensing survey and aerial photo interpretation. These data sources were integrated into a GIS platform allowing reliable mapping solutions. The geological formations encountered were grouped into individual geotechnical units according to uniformity in lithological character, while the seabed sub-bottom structure was also obtained through several seafloor thematic map compilation. Shoreline variability and evolution for a long time period (1945-2008) were also investigated and mapped. The synergistic use of the results deducted from those disciplinary surveys is finally presented in a single engineering geological map covering the onshore and offshore area.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				JUN	2016	9	2					183	196		10.1007/s12145-016-0250-x								WOS:000376455900004

The trend of rising sea surface temperature (SST) was the main factor maintaining phytoplankton positive net growth and resulted in a trend of increasing Chl at high latitudes in all seasons. At latitudes of 36-46A degrees N, east of 160A degrees E, the trend of rising SST was accompanied by a trend of declining Chl, markedly in spring and fall, which could be ascribed to strengthened stratification. The trends of environmental variables in the Oyashio area have modified conditions in a way detrimental to phytoplankton growth, the result being a trend of declining Chl from spring to fall. Chl south of roughly 36A degrees N exhibited different trends in different seasons because of the different trends of vertical stratification. Whereas the observed 16-year Chl trends were not primarily influenced by interannual climate variability, to some degree they were likely modified by decadal variability associated with a weakened Aleutian Low pressure. This work prompts further comprehensive studies to investigate the probable ecological consequences of the observed Chl trend for high-trophic-level marine organisms in the NWPO.

J	Crespo, JA; Posselt, DJ				Crespo, Juan A.; Posselt, Derek J.			A-Train-Based Case Study of Stratiform-Convective Transition within a Warm Conveyor Belt	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Clouds are both produced by and interact with the mesoscale and synoptic-scale structure of extratropical cyclones (ETCs) in ways that are still not well understood. Cloud-scale radiative and latent heating modifies the thermal environment, leading to a response in the dynamics that can in turn feed back on cloud distribution and microphysical properties. Key to the structure of ETCs is the warm conveyor belt (WCB); the poleward-ascending airstream that produces the bulk of the clouds and precipitation. This paper examines a long-lived WCB that persisted over the western North Atlantic Ocean in nearly the same location for several days. During this time, the storm was sampled multiple times by NASA's A-Train satellite constellation, and a clear transition from stratiform to convective clouds was observed. Examination of coincident temperature and water vapor data reveals destabilization of the thermodynamic profile after the cyclone reached maturity. CloudSat radar reflectivity from two sequential overpasses of the warm front depicts a change from stratiform to convective cloud structure, and high-frequency microwave data reveal an increase in the amount of ice hydrometeors. The presence of convection may serve to strengthen the warm frontal trough while slowing the movement of the primary low pressure center. The stratiform-convective transition cannot be detected from passive measurements of cloud-top pressure. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of multivariate satellite observations for examining the outcome of dynamic processes in ETCs, and highlight the need for more rapid temporal profiling in future remote sensing observing systems.

The engineering of networked devices in underwater environment is today considered a critical research challenge. The propagation of acoustic waves in water is characterized by low, distance-dependent bandwidth with high latency, and multi-path effects, which make it necessary the design of novel system-level solutions, communication protocols, and algorithms specifically tailored for these types of applications. This paper describes a novel hardware-software sensing platform for computing a synthetic index developed for marine ecology studies, called the acoustic complexity index. Computing this index entails performing the fast Fourier transform of signals in the range of audio frequencies. The adoption of a centralized approach/architecture would entail the transmission of the signals toward a sink for their processing, severely impacting communication efficiency. The development of the proposed low-power sensing module enables to carry on the computation on board of remote nodes, which work as virtual sensors. This reduces the communication burden ( of about five orders of magnitude) with a negligible energy overhead due to on board computation.

J	Komorcec, D; Matika, D				Komorcec, Domagoj; Matika, Dario			Small crafts role in maritime traffic and detection by technology integration	POMORSTVO-SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL OF MARITIME RESEARCH												Maritime traffic has always played an important economic, strategic and transportation role for a maritime country. Small vessels, considering total maritime traffic in the Adriatic Sea, play an important role, although their numbers are often not considered as a potential security risk. Although small vessel accidents do not have damage potential as the large ones, they still need to be regarded as a significant risk to safety of navigation. The first part of this paper shows, thru analysis of SAR action statistical data, that the total number of all accidents is dominated by accidents involving small vessels. A particular problem in the maritime traffic monitoring is the fact that small vessels, because of their characteristics, have a reduced detection probability by modern monitoring technologies and as such can be used as a non-traditional security threat. With development of electronic and information technologies, sensor systems, remote sensing and detection systems, as well as global satellite systems, and the introduction of a legal requirement of AIS on board ships, maritime traffic control has become easier, more organized and more reliable. Although application of these technologies has brought some progress in maritime traffic monitoring, small and fast vessels that are not equipped with AIS system can still be relatively unnoticed in all increasing maritime traffic. For this reason, a solution is perceived in the integration of radar, satellite and electro-optical technologies.

Linkages between the circulation and distribution of dissolved organic matter in the White Sea, Arctic Ocean	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The White Sea is a semi-enclosed Arctic marginal sea receiving a significant loading of freshwater (225-231 km(3) yr(-1) equaling an annual runoff yield of 2.5 m) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) from river run-off. We report discharge weighed values of stable oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of -14.0 parts per thousand in Northern Dvina river for the period 10 May-12 October 2012. We found a significant linear relationship between salinity (S) and delta O-18 (delta O-18 = -17.66 +/- 0.58+0.52 +/- 0.02 x S; R-2=0.96, N=162), which indicates a dominant contribution of river water to the freshwater budget and little influence of sea ice formation or melt. No apparent brine additions from sea-ice formation is evident in the White Sea deep waters as seen from a joint analysis of temperature (T), S, delta O-18 and a(CDOM)(350) data, confirming previous suggestions about strong tidal induced vertical mixing in winter being the likely source of the deep waters. We investigated properties and distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the White Sea basin and coastal areas in summer. We found contrasting DOM properties in the inflowing Barents Sea waters and White Sea waters influenced by terrestrial runoff. Values of absorption by CDOM at 350 nm (a(CDOM)(350)) and DOC (exceeding 10 m(-1) and 550 mu mol l(-1), respectively) in surface waters of the White Sea basin are higher compared to other river-influenced coastal Arctic domains. Linear relationship between S and CDOM absorption, and S and DOC (DOC=959.21 +/- 52.99-25.80 +/- 1.79 x S; R-2=0.85; N=154) concentrations suggests conservative mixing of DOM in the White Sea. The strongest linear correlation between CDOM absorption and DOC was found in the ultraviolet (DOC=56.31 +/- 2.76+9.13 +/- 0.15 x a(CDOM)(254); R-2=0.99; N=155), which provides an easy and robust tool to trace DOC using CDOM absorption measurements as well as remote sensing algorithms. Deviations from this linear relationship in surface waters likely indicate contribution from different rivers along the coast of the White Sea. Characteristics of CDOM further indicate that there is limited removal or change in the DOM pool before it exits to the Barents Sea. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Vahtmae, E; Kutser, T				Vahtmaee, Ele; Kutser, Tiit			Airborne mapping of shallow water bathymetry in the optically complex waters of the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Accurate determination of the water depth is important for marine spatial planning, producing maritime charts for navigation, seabed morphology studies, and carrying out different activities in the coastal waters. Bathymetric data are lacking foremost in the shallow water regions as those areas are often inaccessible to the hydrographic ships carrying out echo sounding measurements. Remote sensing technology can be used as an alternative for shallow water bathymetry mapping. Varieties of empirical methods have been proposed for bathymetry retrieval, where the relationship between remotely sensed radiance of the water body and the water depth at sampled locations was established empirically. Two most widely used depth derivation methods, the linear band model proposed by Lyzenga (1978, 1985, 2006), and the log-transformed band ratio model proposed by Stumpf et al. (2003), were applied to the different preprocessing level airborne Hyspex hyperspectral images from the optically complex Baltic Sea area and evaluated for accuracy. Results showed that the Lyzenga linear band model outperformed the Stumpf log-transformed band ratio model. The best results were achieved with the atmospherically corrected images. The application of glint correction did not improve, but even reduced the accuracy of bathymetric maps.

Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002-2013	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Water clarity is a key factor for the health of marine ecosystems. The Australian Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is located on a continental shelf, with >35 major seasonal rivers discharging into this 344,000 km(2) tropical to subtropical ecosystem. This work investigates how river discharges affect water clarity in different zones along and across the GBR. For each day over 11 years (2002-2013) we calculated 'photic depth' as a proxy measure of water clarity (calibrated to be equivalent to Secchi depth), for each 1 km2 pixel from MODIS-Aqua remote sensing data. Long-term and seasonal changes in photic depth were related to the daily discharge volumes of the nearest rivers, after statistically removing the effects of waves and tides on photic depth. The relationships between photic depths and rivers differed across and along the GBR. They typically declined from the coastal to offshore zones, and were strongest in proximity to rivers in agriculturally modified catchments. In most southern inner zones, photic depth declined consistently throughout the 11-year observation period; such long-term trend was not observed offshore nor in the northern regions. Averaged across the GBR, photic depths declined to 47% of local maximum values soon after the onset of river floods, and recovery to 95% of maximum values took on average 6 months (range: 150-260 days). The river effects were strongest at latitude 14.5 degrees-19.0 degrees S, where river loads are high and the continental shelf is narrow. Here, even offshore zones showed a >40% seasonal decline in photic depth, and 17-24% reductions in annual mean photic depth in years with large river nutrients and sediment loads. Our methodology is based on freely available data and tools and may be applied to other shelf systems, providing valuable insights in support of ecosystem management. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFICATION APPROACH FOR OIL SPILL DETECTION ON SAR IMAGES	IIOAB JOURNAL												Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is one of the coherent technique, that has been shown to have a great potential for marine surveillance applications such as oil spill and ship tracking detection. In this paper, we proposed an approach called a grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture feature, are applied on the SAR images to spill the oil from selected region. This uses artificial neural networks which classifies each pixel of selected region of interest (ROI) on SAR image('s). The performance development is studied by utilizing a time series of SAR images in a single ocean surface region acquired from SAR scene time series. Thereby, the remote sensing setup is trained on preliminary image of the time series and then pragmatic to consequent images from the radar satellites. After applying the classification method, the result of accuracy is at least 75% depending on the choice of our oil spill regime type. It is possible only with the radar satellite incidence projection views from the training dataset, is similar to that the classified image('s). Our proposed approach computational cost is moderately considering for classification operational procedure, near-real time service of SAR image processing.																	0976-3104					MAY	2016	7	5			SI		225	235										WOS:000397197100019

An Object-Based Image Analysis Approach for Detecting Penguin Guano in very High Spatial Resolution Satellite Images	REMOTE SENSING												The logistical challenges of Antarctic field work and the increasing availability of very high resolution commercial imagery have driven an interest in more efficient search and classification of remotely sensed imagery. This exploratory study employed geographic object-based analysis (GEOBIA) methods to classify guano stains, indicative of chinstrap and Adelie penguin breeding areas, from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery and closely examined the transferability of knowledge-based GEOBIA rules across different study sites focusing on the same semantic class. We systematically gauged the segmentation quality, classification accuracy, and the reproducibility of fuzzy rules. A master ruleset was developed based on one study site and it was re-tasked "without adaptation" and "with adaptation" on candidate image scenes comprising guano stains. Our results suggest that object-based methods incorporating the spectral, textural, spatial, and contextual characteristics of guano are capable of successfully detecting guano stains. Reapplication of the master ruleset on candidate scenes without modifications produced inferior classification results, while adapted rules produced comparable or superior results compared to the reference image. This work provides a road map to an operational "image-to-assessment pipeline" that will enable Antarctic wildlife researchers to seamlessly integrate VHSR imagery into on-demand penguin population census.																	2072-4292					MAY	2016	8	5							375	10.3390/rs8050375								WOS:000378406400019

Mapping for coral reef conservation: comparing the value of participatory and remote sensing approaches	ECOSPHERE												Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66%; RS: 76%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.																	2150-8925					MAY	2016	7	5							e01325	10.1002/ecs2.1325								WOS:000377215200030

Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Cloud Cover and Fog Inundation in Coastal California: Ecological Implications	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in coastal California where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during otherwise warm and dry summer months. Summer fog and stratus can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets and often have different spatial and temporal patterns. Here, this study uses remote sensing datasets to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of cloud cover over California's northern Channel Islands. The authors found marine stratus to be persistent from May to September across the years 2001-12. Stratus clouds were both most frequent and had the greatest spatial extent in July. Clouds typically formed in the evening and dissipated by the following early afternoon. This study presents a novel method to downscale satellite imagery using atmospheric observations and discriminate patterns of fog from those of stratus and help explain patterns of fog deposition previously studied on the islands. The outcomes of this study contribute significantly to the ability to quantify the occurrence of coastal fog at biologically meaningful spatial and temporal scales that can improve the understanding of cloud-ecosystem interactions, species distributions, and coastal ecohydrology.

The total levels of trace elements associated with the cells were significantly higher in the exposed than in control ones. Concomitantly, specific cell growth was significantly lower in exposed P. tricornutum, suggesting that trace elements affected the microalgae physiology. The LIF emission spectra showed two typical emission bands in red (683698 nm) and far-red (725-730 nm) regions. Deviations in LIF spectra and changes in F685/F735 ratio were investigated as indicators of trace element-induced changes. Fluorescence intensity emitted by exposed microalgae decreased in far-red region when compared to control cells, suggesting Chl a damage and impairment of pigment biosynthesis pathways by trace elements, confirmed by Chl a and carotenoid concentration decrease. Significant increase in F685/F735 ratio was detected for all elements except Zn and more accentuated for Co, Hg, and Mix. Significant deviations in wavelength emission maxima in red region were also more significant (between 8 and 13 nm) for Co, Hg, and Mix. Growth changes agreed with deviations in LIF spectra and F685/F735 ratio, supporting their applicability as indicators. This study clearly shows F685/F735 ratio and the deviations in wavelength emission maxima as adequate trace element stress indicators and P. tricornutum as a promising biomonitor model species. LIF-based techniques can be used as time-saving, highly sensitive, and effective alternative tool for the detection of trace element stress, with potential for remote sensing and trace element contamination screening in marine coastal areas.

Three different methods, including the iterative least square approach, the normalized scalar product method, and the polar current shell algorithm, that have been used for horizontally polarized data are employed here. A comprehensive comparison of the performance of the three methods is conducted using the radar images collected by the V-pol radar deployed on the Forschungsplattformen in Nord- und Ostsee No. 3 (FINO3) offshore research platform and the acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data in the North Sea. The results indicate that all three methods are capable of providing reliable current speed and direction measurements from V-pol data, with similar performance. Based on the experimental data for which the current magnitude is less than 0.5 m/s, the radar-derived results agree best with the ADCP data at a depth of 6-8 m, with the root mean square difference for current velocity x- and y-components being 7.2-8.9 cm/s. The correlation coefficients between the radar-derived and ADCP-measured current velocity components are as high as 0.87-0.93.

M.; van Gils, Jan A.; van der Heide, Tjisse			Drought, Mutualism Breakdown, and Landscape-Scale Degradation of Seagrass Beds	CURRENT BIOLOGY												In many marine ecosystems, biodiversity critically depends on foundation species such as corals and seagrasses that engage in mutualistic interactions [1-3]. Concerns grow that environmental disruption of marine mutualisms exacerbates ecosystem degradation, with breakdown of the obligate coral mutualism ("coral bleaching") being an iconic example [2, 4, 5]. However, as these mutualisms are mostly facultative rather than obligate, it remains unclear whether mutualism breakdown is a common risk in marine ecosystems, and thus a potential accelerator of ecosystem degradation. Here, we provide evidence that. drought triggered landscape-scale seagrass degradation and show the consequent failure of a facultative mutualistic feedback between seagrass and sulfide-consuming lucinid bivalves that in turn appeared to exacerbate the observed collapse. Local climate and remote sensing analyses revealed seagrass collapse after a summer with intense low-tide drought stress. Potential analysis a novel approach to detect feedback-mediated state shifts-revealed two attractors (healthy and degraded states) during the collapse, suggesting that the drought disrupted internal feedbacks to cause abrupt, patch-wise degradation. Field measurements comparing degraded patches that were healthy before the collapse with patches that remained healthy demonstrated that bivalves declined dramatically in degrading patches with associated high sediment sulfide concentrations, confirming the breakdown of the mutualistic seagrass-lucinid feedback. Our findings indicate that drought triggered mutualism breakdown, resulting in toxic sulfide concentrations that aggravated seagrass degradation. We conclude that external disturbances can cause sudden breakdown of facultative marine mutualistic feedbacks. As this may amplify ecosystem degradation, we suggest including mutualisms in marine conservation and restoration approaches.				van der Geest, Matthijs/A-4744-2013; Olff, Han/A-8516-2008; Smolders, Alfons/H-2583-2012; Lamers, Leon/A-8718-2012; van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008; Christianen, Marjolijn/B-8847-2011	van der Geest, Matthijs/0000-0002-9837-3803; Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Lamers, Leon/0000-0003-3769-2154; van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; Christianen, Marjolijn/0000-0001-5839-2981; van Belzen, Jim/0000-0003-2099-1545												0960-9822	1879-0445				APR 25	2016	26	8					1051	1056		10.1016/j.cub.2016.02.023								WOS:000375339700023	26972316

Considered as an invasive species and a trophic competitor of the cultivated conspecific oyster, it is now seen as a resource by oyster farmers following recurrent mass summer mortalities of oyster spat since 2008. Spatial distribution maps of wild oyster reefs are required by local authorities to help define management strategies. In this work, visible near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing was investigated to map two contrasted intertidal reef structures: clusters of vertical oysters building three-dimensional dense reefs in muddy areas and oysters growing horizontally creating large fiat reefs in rocky areas. A spectral library, collected in situ for various conditions with an ASD spectroradiometer, was used to run Spectral Angle Mapper classifications on airborne data obtained with an HySpex sensor (160 spectral bands) and SPOT satellite HRG multispectral data (3 spectral bands). With HySpex spectral/spatial resolution, horizontal oysters in the rocky area were correctly classified but the detection was less efficient for vertical oysters in muddy areas. Poor results were obtained with the multispectral image and from spatially or spectrally degraded HySpex data, it was clear that the spectral resolution was more important than the spatial resolution. In fact, there was a systematic mud deposition on shells of vertical oyster reefs explaining the misclassification of 30% of pixels recognized as mud or microphytobenthos. Spatial distribution maps of oyster reefs were coupled with in situ biomass measurements to illustrate the interest of a remote sensing product to provide stock estimations of wild oyster reefs to be exploited by oyster producers. This work highlights the interest of developing remote sensing techniques for aquaculture applications in coastal areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although great efforts have been made to prevent aquatic ecosystem degradation, the degree, extent and impacts of this phenomenon remain controversial and unclear, such as its driving mechanisms. Here, we present results from a 17-year field investigation (1998-2014) of water quality and a 12-year remote sensing mapping (2003-2014) of the aquatic vegetation presence frequency (VPF) in Eastern Lake Taihu, a macrophyte-dominated bay of Lake Taihu in China. In the past 17 years, nutrient concentrations and water level (WL) have significantly increased, but the Secchi disk depth (SDD) has significantly decreased. These changes were associated with increased lake eutrophication and a degraded underwater light climate that further inhibited the growth of aquatic vegetation. In Eastern Lake Taihu, increased nutrients, chlorophyll a and WL, and a decreased SDD were all significantly correlated with a decreased VPF. NH4 (+)-N concentration and SDD/WL were the most important controlling factors for VPF. Therefore, increased anthropogenic nutrient inputs and a degraded underwater light climate surely result in a decreased VPF. These results elucidate the driving mechanism of aquatic vegetation degradation and will facilitate Lake Taihu ecological restoration.																	2045-2322					APR 4	2016	6								23867	10.1038/srep23867								WOS:000373271000001	27041062

Not many coastal sites with unbounded ocean with high tidal current speed have been reported. The coastal sea near the Cape Fuguei in northwestern Taiwan is such a site with a high tidal power potential. The purpose of this study is to investigate the tidal current speed at this location for assessing the tidal current power potential. In-situ and remote sensing instruments were deployed simultaneously to measure the temporal and spatial distributions of tidal currents. An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was deployed at a 26 m depth site and an X-band marine radar was installed at a coastal building. Two measurements lasting over one month were done. Both instruments showed the maximum current speed at the surface was more than 3.5 m/s in the measurement period. ADCP measurements showed that the time mean speed in the upper layer (-1.7 to -6 m) was 1.5 m/s. The current speed decreased with depth slightly. It was also found from both ADCP and radar measurements that in the surface layer, the probability of duration for current speed exceeding 1 m/s was more than 70%. In addition, radar measurement showed that the average surface current speed at the area from 2 km offshore out to 4 km (radar offshore limit) was more than 1 m/s. The size of this area is more than 15 km(2).																	2214-1669					APR	2016	13						193	205		10.1016/j.ijome.2015.02.002								WOS:000381687600012

Solar Irradiance Changes and Phytoplankton Productivity in Earth's Ocean Following Astrophysical Ionizing Radiation Events	ASTROBIOLOGY												Two atmospheric responses to simulated astrophysical ionizing radiation events significant to life on Earth are production of odd-nitrogen species, especially NO2, and subsequent depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone depletion increases incident short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVB, 280-315nm) and longer (>600nm) wavelengths of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR, 400-700nm). On the other hand, the NO2 haze decreases atmospheric transmission in the long-wavelength UVA (315-400nm) and short-wavelength PAR. Here, we use the results of previous simulations of incident spectral irradiance following an ionizing radiation event to predict changes in terran productivity focusing on photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton. The prediction is based on a spectral model of photosynthetic response, which was developed for the dominant genera in central regions of the ocean (Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus), and on remote-sensing-based observations of spectral water transparency, temperature, wind speed, and mixed layer depth. Predicted productivity declined after a simulated ionizing event, but the effect integrated over the water column was small. For integrations taking into account the full depth range of PAR transmission (down to 0.1% of utilizable PAR), the decrease was at most 2-3% (depending on strain), with larger effects (5-7%) for integrations just to the depth of the surface mixed layer. The deeper integrations were most affected by the decreased utilizable PAR at depth due to the NO2 haze, whereas shallower integrations were most affected by the increased surface UV. Several factors tended to dampen the magnitude of productivity responses relative to increases in surface-damaging radiation, for example, most inhibition in the modeled strains is caused by UVA and PAR, and the greatest relative increase in damaging exposure is predicted to occur in the winter when UV and productivity are low.

In this study, Worldview-2 (WV-2) imagery was combined with field sampling to demonstrate the capability of mapping species type, percentage cover, and above-ground biomass of seagrasses in monsoonal southern Thailand. A high accuracy positioning technique, involving the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), was used to record field sample data positions and reduce uncertainties in matching locations between satellite and field data sets. Our results showed high accuracy (90.67%) in mapping seagrass distribution and moderate accuracies for mapping percentage cover and species type (73.74% and 75.00%, respectively). Seagrass species type mapping was successfully achieved despite discrimination confusion among Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides species with greater than 50% cover. The green, yellow, and near infrared spectral channels ofWV-2 were used to estimate the above-ground biomass using a multiple linear regression model (RMSE of +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2), R = 0.68). The average total above-ground biomass was 23.95 +/- 10.38 g.DW/m(2). The seagrass maps produced in this study are an important step towards measuring the attributes of seagrass biodiversity and can be used as inputs to seagrass dynamic models and conservation efforts.

This study presents classification work for data sets that were collected in the Yellow Sea during six cruises (spring and autumn, 2003; summer and winter, 2006/2007; and spring and autumn, 2007). Specifically, we analyzed classification features of Rrs spectra and obtained spatio-temporal characteristics of reflectance and bio-optical properties in the coastal waters. Yellow Sea waters were classified into the following four typical regions based on their spatial distribution characteristics: middle of the Yellow Sea (MYS), north Yellow Sea (NYS), coastal Shandong (CS), and Jiangsu shoal (JS), and five water type categories consisting of Classes A-E were used to represent water colors from clear to very turbid. Application of this classification scheme to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) imagery revealed seasonal variations in the data, which suggests that the water types have both significant temporal and spatial distributions. In particular, the area of Class E waters in the Jiangsu shoal tended to gradually shrink in summer and expand in winter. The spatio-temporal variability was due to the influence of various environmental factors such as currents, tidal activity, fresh water discharges, monsoon winds, and typhoons.

J	Gao, F; Chen, XJ; Guan, WJ; Li, G				Gao Feng; Chen Xinjun; Guan Wenjiang; Li Gang			A new model to forecast fishing ground of Scomber japonicus in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												The pelagic species is closely related to the marine environmental factors, and establishment of forecasting model of fishing ground with high accuracy is an important content for pelagic fishery. The chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea is an important fishing target for Chinese lighting purse seine fishery. Based on the fishery data from China's mainland large-type lighting purse seine fishery for chub mackerel during the period of 2003 to 2010 and the environmental data including sea surface temperature (SST), gradient of the sea surface temperature (GSST), sea surface height (SSH) and geostrophic velocity (GV), we attempt to establish one new forecasting model of fishing ground based on boosted regression trees. In this study, the fishing areas with fishing effort is considered as one fishing ground, and the areas with no fishing ground are randomly selected from a background field, in which the fishing areas have no records in the logbooks. The performance of the forecasting model of fishing ground is evaluated with the testing data from the actual fishing data in 2011. The results show that the forecasting model of fishing ground has a high prediction performance, and the area under receiver operating curve (AUC) attains 0.897. The predicted fishing grounds are coincided with the actual fishing locations in 2011, and the movement route is also the same as the shift of fishing vessels, which indicates that this forecasting model based on the boosted regression trees can be used to effectively forecast the fishing ground of chub mackerel in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				APR	2016	35	4					74	81		10.1007/s13131-015-0767-8								WOS:000374250700010

It is one of the most conspicuous and ecologically important components of the still poorly known mesopelagic ecosystem. Acoustic data were collected from both fishing and research vessels along 18 transects for a total of 47 682 linear kilometers to investigate large-scale distribution of micronekton over a long latitudinal gradient (20-50 degrees S) and two contrasted seasons (summer and winter) in the South-Western Indian Ocean. Acoustic backscatter at 38 kHz was used as a proxy of mid-water organisms' abundance (0-800 m depth). Two consistent features were diel vertical migration of backscatters and vertical distribution of micronekton in three distinct layers, namely the surface (SL), intermediate (IL) and deep (DL) layers. Satellite remote sensing data was used to position oceanic fronts, and hence define water masses, from the tropical to low Antarctic zones. A key finding of this study was the significant correlation observed between abundance and distribution of acoustic backscatter and position relative to these front and water masses. Total backscatter peaked in the subtropical zone, with low abundances in the colder Polar Frontal Zone. The high overall abundances in subtropical waters resulted mainly from high backscatters in the IL and DL that contrasted with low SL values, especially during the day (2-11%). The warmer the waters, the higher SL backscatter was, with the highest absolute and relative (38-51% of the total abundance) values observed at night in the Tropical Zone and the lowest abundance in the Antarctic Zone. No significant seasonal pattern was found, but SL backscatters were very low in winter compared to summer in the Polar Frontal Zone. Moreover, the Northern winter shift of the fronts induced a Northern latitudinal shift of the peak in abundance from summer to winter. The present study highlights the value of building large acoustic databases collected from both research and fishing vessels. The method provides unique opportunities to gather basic information on micronekton and is an essential step to describe oceanic zones of relevant biological interest in terms of trophic ecology.

In this study, we examined the influence of oil droplet size of highly dispersed Petrobaltic crude on the underwater visible light flux and the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of seawater, including absorption, scattering, backscattering and attenuation coefficients. On the basis of measured data and Mie theory, we calculated the IOPs of dispersed Petrobaltic crude oil in constant concentration, but different log-normal size distributions. We also performed a radiative transfer analysis, in order to evaluate the influence on the downwelling irradiance E (d) , remote sensing reflectance R (rs) and diffuse reflectance R, using in situ data from the Baltic Sea. We found that during dispersion, there occurs a boundary size distribution characterized by a peak diameter d (0) = 0.3 mu m causing a maximum E (d) increase of 40 % within 0.5-m depth, and the maximum E (d) decrease of 100 % at depths below 5 m. Moreover, we showed that the impact of size distribution on the "blue to green" ratios of R (rs) and R varies from 24 % increase to 27 % decrease at the same crude oil concentration.

However, accessibility for this kind of data with a high level of detail for very shallow and inaccessible marine habitats has been often challenging, time consuming. Spatial and temporal coverage often has to be compromised to make more cost effective the monitoring routine. Nowadays, emerging technologies, can overcome many of these constraints. Here we describe a recent development in remote sensing based on a small unmanned drone (UAVs) that produce very fine scale maps of fish nursery areas. This technology is simple to use, inexpensive, and timely in producing aerial photographs of marine areas. Both technical details regarding aerial photos acquisition (drone and camera settings) and post processing workflow (3D model generation with Structure From Motion algorithm and photo-stitching) are given. Finally by applying modern algorithm of semi-automatic image analysis and classification (Maximum Likelihood, ECHO and Object-based Image Analysis) we compared the results of three thematic maps of nursery area for juvenile sparid fishes, highlighting the potential of this method in mapping and monitoring coastal marine habitats.

Here we use passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS)(7,8) in an important North Atlantic feeding ground(9,10) to instantaneously detect, localize and classify MM vocalizations from diverse species over an approximately 100,000 km(2) region. More than eight species of vocal MMs are found to spatially converge on fish spawning areas containing massive densely populated herring shoals at night-time(11-16) and diffuse herring distributions during daytime. We find the vocal MMs divide the enormous fish prey field into species-specific foraging areas with varying degrees of spatial overlap, maintained for at least two weeks of the herring spawning period. The recorded vocalization rates are diel (24 h)-dependent for all MM species, with some significantly more vocal at night and others more vocal during the day. The four key baleen whale species of the region: fin, humpback, blue and minke have vocalization rate trends that are highly correlated to trends in fish shoaling density and to each other over the diel cycle. These results reveal the temporospatial dynamics of combined multi-species MM foraging activities in the vicinity of an extensive fish prey field that forms a massive ecological hotspot, and would be unattainable with conventional methodologies. Understanding MM behaviour and distributions is essential for management of marine ecosystems and for accessing anthropogenic impacts on these protected marine species(1-5,17,18).

Over the last decades, satellite remote sensing tools have provided quasi-global measurements of ocean altimetry by merging data from different satellite missions. While there is a widely use of altimeter data for model validation, practical tools for model validation remain scarce. Our purpose is to fill this gap by introducing ALTWAVE, a MATLAB user-oriented toolbox for oceanographers and coastal engineers developed to validate wave model results based on visual features and statistical estimates against satellite derived altimetry. Our toolbox uses altimetry information from the GlobWave initiative, and provides a sample application to validate a one year wave hindcast for the Gulf of Mexico. ALTWAVE also offers an effective toolbox to validate wave model results using altimeter data, as well as a guidance for non-experienced satellite data users. This article is intended for wave modelers with no experience using altimeter data to validate their results. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of seabed mapping methods for fine-scale classification of extremely shallow benthic habitats - Application to the Venice Lagoon, Italy	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Recent technological developments of multibeam echosounder systems (MBES) allow mapping of benthic habitats with unprecedented detail. MBES can now be employed in extremely shallow waters, challenging data acquisition (as these instruments were often designed for deeper waters) and data interpretation (honed on datasets with resolution sometimes orders of magnitude lower). With extremely high-resolution bathymetry and co-located backscatter data, it is now possible to map the spatial distribution of fine scale benthic habitats, even identifying the acoustic signatures of single sponges. In this context, it is necessary to understand which of the commonly used segmentation methods is best suited to account for such level of detail. At the same time, new sampling protocols for precisely geo-referenced ground truth data need to be developed to validate the benthic environmental classification. This study focuses on a dataset collected in a shallow (2-10 m deep) tidal channel of the Lagoon of Venice, Italy. Using 0.05-m and 0.2-m raster grids, we compared a range of classifications, both pixel-based and object-based approaches, including manual, Maximum Likelihood Classifier, Jenks Optimization clustering, textural analysis and Object Based Image Analysis. Through a comprehensive and accurately geo-referenced ground truth dataset, we were able to identify five different classes of the substrate composition, including sponges, mixed submerged aquatic vegetation, mixed detritic bottom (fine and coarse) and unconsolidated bare sediment. We computed estimates of accuracy (namely Overall, User, Producer Accuracies and the Kappa statistic) by cross tabulating predicted and reference instances. Overall, pixel based segmentations produced the highest accuracies and the accuracy assessment is strongly dependent on the number of classes chosen for the thematic output. Tidal channels in the Venice Lagoon are extremely important in terms of habitats and sediment distribution, particularly within the context of the new tidal barrier being built. However, they had remained largely unexplored until now, because of the surveying challenges. The application of this remote sensing approach, combined with targeted sampling, opens a new perspective in the monitoring of benthic habitats in view of a knowledge-based management of natural resources in shallow coastal areas.

Habitat-based cetacean density models for the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Cetaceans are protected worldwide but vulnerable to incidental harm from an expanding array of human activities at sea. Managing potential hazards to these highly-mobile populations increasingly requires a detailed understanding of their seasonal distributions and habitats. Pursuant to the urgent need for this knowledge for the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, we integrated 23 years of aerial and shipboard cetacean surveys, linked them to environmental covariates obtained from remote sensing and ocean models, and built habitat-based density models for 26 species and 3 multi-species guilds using distance sampling methodology. In the Atlantic, for 11 well-known species, model predictions resembled seasonal movement patterns previously suggested in the literature. For these we produced monthly mean density maps. For lesser-known taxa, and in the Gulf of Mexico, where seasonal movements were less well described, we produced year-round mean density maps. The results revealed high regional differences in small delphinoid densities, confirmed the importance of the continental slope to large delphinoids and of canyons and seamounts to beaked and sperm whales, and quantified seasonal shifts in the densities of migratory baleen whales. The density maps, freely available online, are the first for these regions to be published in the peer-reviewed literature.

This was approached by combining, at a national or regional level, regulatory monitoring phytoplankton and biotoxin data with satellite remote sensing and other information on current marine conditions, coupled with regional scale models that included a representation of HAB transport. Synthesis of these products was achieved by expert interpretation within HAB risk alert bulletins that were prepared on a regular basis (typically weekly) for use by the aquaculture industry.

The associated algorithms were generally site specific or developed over a relatively narrow range of concentration, which make them inappropriate for global applications (or at least over broad SPM range). In the frame of the GlobCoast project, a large in situ data set of SPM and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), has been built gathering together measurements from various coastal areas around Europe, French Guiana, North Canada, Vietnam, and China. This data set covers various contrasting coastal environments diversely affected by different biogeochemical and physical processes such as sediment resuspension, phytoplankton bloom events, and rivers discharges (Amazon, Mekong, Yellow river, MacKenzie, etc.). The SPM concentration spans about four orders of magnitude, from 0.15 to 2626 g center dot m(-3). Different empirical and semi-analytical approaches developed to assess SPM from R-rs(lambda) were tested over this in situ data set. As none of them provides satisfactory results over the whole SPM range, a generic semi-analytical approach has been developed. This algorithm is based on two standard semi-analytical equations calibrated for low-to-medium and highly turbid waters, respectively. A mixing law has also been developed for intermediate environments. Sources of uncertainties in SPM retrieval such as the bio-optical variability, atmospheric correction errors, and spectral bandwidth have been evaluated. The coefficients involved in these different algorithms have been calculated for ocean color (SeaWiFS, MODIS-A/T, MERIS/OLCI, VIIRS) and high spatial resolution (LandSat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) sensors. The performance of the proposed algorithm varies only slightly from one sensor to another demonstrating the great potential applicability of the proposed approach over global and contrasting coastal waters.

Remote sensing monitoring products have been developed to map the spatial extent, composition and frequency of occurrence of river plumes in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. There is, however, a need to incorporate these monitoring products into Risk Assessment Frameworks as management decision tools. A simple Satellite Risk Framework has been recently proposed to generate maps of potential risk to seagrass and coral reef ecosystems in the GBR focusing on the Austral tropical wet season. This framework was based on a "magnitude x likelihood" risk management approach and GBR plume water types mapped from satellite imagery. The GBR plume water types (so called "Primary" for the inshore plume waters, "Secondary" for the midshelf-plume waters and "Tertiary" for the offshore plume waters) represent distinct concentrations and combinations of land-sourced and marine contaminants. The current study aimed to test and refine the methods of the Satellite Risk Framework. It compared predicted pollutant concentrations in plume water types (multi-annual average from 2005-2014) to published ecological thresholds, and combined this information with similarly long-term measures of seagrass and coral ecosystem health. The Satellite Risk Framework and newly-introduced multi-annual risk scores were successful in demonstrating where water conditions were, on average, correlated to adverse biological responses. Seagrass meadow abundance (multi-annual change in % cover) was negatively correlated to the multi-annual risk score at the site level (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.05). Relationships between multi-annual risk scores and multi-annual changes in proportional macroalgae cover (as an index for coral reef health) were more complex (R-2 = 0.04, p > 0.05), though reefs incurring higher risk scores showed relatively higher proportional macroalgae cover. Multi-annual risk score thresholds associated with loss of seagrass cover were defined, with lower risk scores (<= 0.2) associated with a gain or little loss in seagrass cover (gain/-12%), medium risk scores (0.2-0.4) associated with moderate loss (-12/-30%) and higher risk scores (>0.4) with the greatest loss in cover (>-30%). These thresholds were used to generate an intermediate river plume risk map specifically for seagrass meadows of the GBR. An intermediate river plume risk map for coral reefs was also developed by considering a multi-annual risk score threshold of 0.2-above which a higher proportion of macroalgae within the algal communities can be expected. These findings contribute to a long-term and adaptive approach to set relevant risk framework and thresholds for adverse biological responses in the GBR. The ecological thresholds and risk scores used in this study will be refined and validated through ongoing monitoring and assessment. As uncertainties are reduced, these risk metrics will provide important information for the development of strategies to manage water quality and ecosystem health.

During the growing season, MSAV develops to form dense canopy seaweed beds that play a vital role in coastal marine ecosystems and offer great potential to chemical, pharmaceutical, and bio-energy industries. At present, the total biomass and the distribution of the MSAV beds along the coast of Western Australia (WA) are not fully identified and quantified. Therefore, the application of satellite remote sensing data with high spatial resolution for examining the MSAV beds is required. The main objective of the present study was to assess and map the distribution of MSAV at two sites; Rottnest Island and Point Peron, Rockingham, WA, using WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite data. These study sites are important marine protected areas in WA waters with extraordinary documented biodiversity. By means of quantitative quadrat techniques, the MSAV canopy covers and fresh biomass data from the ground truth observations were assessed from September 2012 to December 2014. At Point Peron, the fresh biomass of Sargassum in the inter-tidal zone reached 5651.7 +/- 754.5, 5218.9 +/- 192.6, 1136.6 +/- 526.4, and 3472.2 +/- 434.2 g m(-2) for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. The overall accuracy of the minimum distance method was employed and yielded the highest accuracy rates of 90.93% (Kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 97.13% (kappa = 0.96) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The Mahalanobis classification with overall accuracy yielded 90.66% (kappa = 0.88) and 94.16% (kappa = 0.85) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The study results revealed that WV2 satellite data provided evidence of the high accuracy of MSAV classification.

The chosen along-track baseline between both platforms needs to be on the order of ten to several tens of kilometers, resulting in a time lag of several seconds between the target observations. With the proposed method, the true geographical positions, the velocities, and the moving directions of the detected moving targets can be estimated with high accuracy. The method has been verified and evaluated using experimental data acquired with the German TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X radar satellite formation. The results are compared with ground truth reference data.

J	Xu, CY; Chen, JW; Yan, DX; Ji, J				Xu, Chunying; Chen, Jiawang; Yan, Dongxu; Ji, Jian			Review of Underwater Cable Shape Detection	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Underwater cables play vital roles in marine engineering because they provide power and communication connections from the shore to an increasing number of sea installations. To ensure the system is operating reliably and continuously, it is necessary to detect the shapes of underwater cables in real time. However, this task is difficult to accomplish because the underwater cables are located in a dynamic and complicated subsea environment, which can cause changes in position, depth, and visibility. In this report, the current development of underwater cable shape detection methods, including visual, acoustic, magnetic detection, and multisensor fusion detection, and the advantages and disadvantages are described and analyzed. Furthermore, the disadvantages of these methods are addressed, which, based on survey platforms with high cost, include a long detection period and the failure to reveal emergencies. Then, the need to construct a simple and reliable system to detect the shapes of underwater cables is highlighted, and one possible solution based on bend sensors embedded in underwater cables is discussed.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				MAR	2016	33	3					597	606		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0112.1								WOS:000372789200001

To demonstrate a developing technology, sensors and acoustic modems were powered with energy harvested from the seafloor, and data were relayed acoustically in near-real time to the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) observatory in Monterey Bay, California, and to surface research vessels. MARS is a cabled observatory in deep water (~890 m) at the edge of Monterey Canyon. An acoustic modem was attached to the MARS node and configured to send out commands to, and relay data received from, remote modems. Two benthic microbial fuel cells (BMFCs) positioned approximately 0.5 km away from MARS supplied power to the remote modems and sensors. At their peak performance, these BMFCs produced continuous power densities of ~35 mW m(-2) (footprint area). The modems utilized in this study contained an integrated power management platform (PMP) designed to manage and store the electrical energy generated by each BMFC and to record BMFC performance parameters and sensor data on an hourly basis. Temperature and either oxygen or conductivity sensors were chosen because of their common use and environmental relevance. Acoustically transmitted data records show that the BMFCs renewed energy stores and that the oceanographic sensors measured dissolved oxygen, temperature, and conductivity reliably throughout the operational life of each BMFC system (~6 months). These systems remained in place for more than 12 months.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				MAR	2016	33	3					607	617		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0102.1								WOS:000372789200002

Demarcating saline water intrusion pathways using remote sensing, GIS and geophysical techniques in structurally controlled coastal aquifers in Southern India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Application of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) with the help of ground truth studies like vertical electrical soundings (VES) and water quality measurements gave a comprehensive picture on saline water intrusion pathways in the structural controlled aquifers of Uppanar and Cauvery River systems located in Sirkazhi and Mannanpandal coastal areas of Southern India. The detailed geomorphic units and lineaments were mapped using IRS LISS-III (1: 50,000 Scale) and SRTM Elevation Digital data under GIS environment. The area is mainly alluvial deposits of Holocene Age and classified into three major geomorphic units (i.e., fluvial, fluviomarine, and marine geomorphic units). The identified lineaments are mostly trending North-northeast (NNE)South-southwest (SSW), Northeast (NE)-Southwest (SW), Northwest (NW)-Southeast (SE), East-West (EW) and East-Northeast (ENE)-West-Southwest (WSW) directions. Some of them are potential for fresh groundwater occurrence and movement. The lineaments trending NE-SW, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW act as pathways for saline water intrusion to the inland. The lineament L1 (NNE-SSW trending) conformed as a sinisterly shifted fault played a significant role in saline water intrusion. The area within the parallel lineaments L2 and L3 oriented ENE-WSW direction indicates low topography, beach ridges, paleo-channel sinuosity, large aerial extent of tidal flats, and backwater inundation. All the above geomorphic units gave indirect evidence of land subsidence, which was confirmed with the help of sub-surface geo-electrical signals obtained through VES and in situ groundwater quality measurements. Integrating all the above results, the saline water spread and fresh water pockets were identified.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2016	75	5							363	10.1007/s12665-015-4940-3								WOS:000372171700004						
J	Nyberg, B; Howell, JA				Nyberg, Bjorn; Howell, John A.			Global distribution of modern shallow marine shorelines. Implications for exploration and reservoir analogue studies	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Deposits of marginal marine depositional systems make up significant hydrocarbon reservoirs in the rock record. These systems are deposited by a complex interaction between competing depositional processes which can result in heterogeneous and compartmentalized reservoirs. Shallow marine systems are described using a ternary classification describing the relative importance of wave, tide and fluvial processes at the coastline. With the advent of freely available remote sensing data, modern systems are being increasingly used as analogues for the ancient, however to date, there has been no systematic quantification of global modern paralic systems. The aim of the present study has been to map and classify all the world's shorelines by ternary process and to consider the distribution and controls on different shoreline types. The semi-automated classification of marginal marine clastic shorelines has been achieved by combining data from a series of proxies for the ternary processes. Combined with coastline morphology, an algorithm predicts shoreline classification with an 85% success rate when compared to manual interpretation. Using this algorithm, the global shoreline has been subdivided into 246,777, 5 km segments and the distribution and proportions of these analyzed. The first order classification subdivides 28% of the world's coastlines as depositional. Within the depositional coastlines 62% are Wave-dominated, 35% Tide-dominated and 3% Fluvial-dominated. Analysis of shoreline type distribution suggests a complex network of inter-related controlling factors. Of these, climate and tectonic setting are reasonably well constrained in the ancient and can be used to predict the probability of a specific shoreline type. In addition to shedding insight into the controls on the distribution of different shoreline types, the results of this study can also be used to identify suitable modern analogues for ancient systems, which in turn can be used to extract data for better reservoir characterization.

J	Swan, CM; Vogt, M; Gruber, N; Laufkoetter, C				Swan, Chantal M.; Vogt, Meike; Gruber, Nicolas; Laufkoetter, Charlotte			A global seasonal surface ocean climatology of phytoplankton types based on CHEMTAX analysis of HPLC pigments	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Much advancement has been made in recent years in field data assimilation, remote sensing and ecosystem modeling, yet our global view of phytoplankton biogeography beyond chlorophyll biomass is still a cursory taxonomic picture with vast areas of the open ocean requiring field validations. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment data combined with inverse methods offer an advantage over many other phytoplankton quantification measures by way of providing an immediate perspective of the whole phytoplankton community in a sample as a function of chlorophyll biomass. Historically, such chemotaxonomic analysis has been conducted mainly at local spatial and temporal scales in the ocean. Here, we apply a widely tested inverse approach, CHEMTAX, to a global climatology of pigment observations from HPLC. This study marks the first systematic and objective global application of CHEMTAX, yielding a seasonal climatology comprised of similar to 1500 1 degrees x 1 degrees global grid points of the major phytoplankton pigment types in the ocean characterizing cyanobacteria, haptophytes, chlorophytes, cryptophytes, dinofiagellates, and diatoms, with results validated against prior regional studies where possible. Key findings from this new global view of specific phytoplankton abundances from pigments are a) the large global proportion of marine haptophytes (comprising 32 5% of total chlorophyll), whose biogeochemical functional roles are relatively unknown, and b) the contrasting spatial scales of complexity in global community structure that can be explained in part by regional oceanographic conditions. The results are publically accessible via doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.855412, and will guide future parameterizations of marine ecosystem models exploring the link between phytoplankton community structure and marine biogeochemical cycles.

Using mechanistic modelling, we investigated how global change relates to the invasion of European coasts by a non-native marine invertebrate, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. LocationBourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast was considered as the northern boundary of C.gigas expansion at the time of its introduction to Europe in the 1970s. From this latitudinal reference, variations in the spatial distribution of the C.gigas reproductive niche were analysed along the north-western European coast from Gibraltar to Norway. MethodsThe effects of environmental variations on C.gigas physiology and phenology were studied using a bioenergetics model based on Dynamic Energy Budget theory. The model was forced with environmental time series including insitu phytoplankton data, and satellite data of sea surface temperature and suspended particulate matter concentration. ResultsSimulation outputs were successfully validated against insitu oyster growth data. In Bourgneuf Bay, the rise in seawater temperature and phytoplankton concentration has increased C.gigas reproductive effort and led to precocious spawning periods since the 1960s. At the European scale, seawater temperature increase caused a drastic northward shift (1400km within 30years) in the C.gigas reproductive niche and optimal thermal conditions for early life stage development. Main conclusionsWe demonstrated that the poleward expansion of the invasive species C.gigas is related to global warming and increase in phytoplankton abundance. The combination of mechanistic bioenergetics modelling with insitu and satellite environmental data is a valuable framework for ecosystem studies. It offers a generic approach to analyse historical geographical shifts and to predict the biogeographical changes expected to occur in a climate-changing world.

Environmental sensitivity mapping of the coast of Karnataka, west coast of India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental sensitivity maps have been prepared to identify the sensitive coastal resources, oil spill contingency planning and its results. The present study attempts to identify the environmental sensitivity to the oil spill of Karnataka coast by using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Nearly 300 km long coastline of Karnataka is endowed with a vast variety of natural resources and aesthetics. Several of the rivers that originate in the Western Ghats form wide extensive estuaries, backwaters and mangrove forests before debouching into the Arabian Sea. Besides, several non-vegetal wetlands like beaches, spits, shoals, mudflats, rocky cliffs and a few islands are found scattered all along the coast. A major port (New Mangalore Port), ten minor ports and a naval base (near Karwar) are also situated in the study area. As a result, various ESI types namely: 1A, 1B, 3A, 4, 6B, 8B, 9B, 10A, 10B and 10D were noticed in the study area. Bio-resources such as birds, marine mammals, reptiles (sea turtle), shellfish; and habitats like corals etc.; and human-use resources such as factories, ferry, boat ramp, access to vehicles, beach etc. are mapped in this study.

Comparing the spatio-temporal variability of remotely sensed oceanographic parameters between the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal throughout a decade	CURRENT SCIENCE												The spatio-temporal variability of sea-surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) was evaluated in the Arabian Sea (ABS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB), from July 2002 to November 2014 by means of remotely sensed monthly composite Aqua MODIS level-3 data having a spatial resolution of 4.63 km. Throughout the time period under consideration, the surface waters of ABS (27.76 +/- 1.12 degrees C) were slightly cooler than BoB (28.93 +/- 0.76 degrees C); this was observed during all the seasons. On the contrary, the availability of PAR was higher in ABS (45.76 +/- 3.41 mol m(-2) d(-1)) compared to BoB (41.75 +/- 3.75 mol m(-2) d(-1)), and its spatial dynamics in the two basins was mainly regulated by cloud cover and turbidity of the water column. The magnitude and variability of Chl-a concentration were substantially higher in ABS (0.487 +/- 0.984 mg m(-3)), compared to BoB (0.187 +/- 0.243 mg m(-3)), and spatially higher values were observed near the coastal waters. Both POC and PIC exhibited higher magnitudes in ABS compared to BoB; however, the difference was substantially high in case of POC. None of the parameters showed any significant temporal trend during the 12-year span, except PIC, which exhibited a significant decreasing trend in ABS.

The effects of tectonic deformation and sediment allocation on shelf habitats and megabenthic distribution and diversity in southern California	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Landscape and seascape structures are typically complex and manifest as patch mosaics within characteristic biomes, bordering one another in gradual or abrupt ecotones. The underlying patch structure in coastal shelf ecosystems is driven by the interaction of tectonic, sedimentary, and sea level dynamic processes. Animals and plants occupy and interact within these mosaics. Terrestrial landscape ecological studies have shown that patch structure is important for ecological processes such as foraging, connectivity, predation, and species dynamics. The importance of patch structure for marine systems is less clear because far fewer pattern-process studies have been conducted in these systems. For many coastal shelf systems, there is a paucity of information on how species occupy shelf seascapes, particularly for seascapes imbued with complex patch structure and ecotones that are common globally due to tectonic activity. Here, we present the results of a study conducted along a myriameter-scale gradient of bottom and sub-bottom geological forcing altered by tectonic deformation, sea level transgression and sediment allocation. The resulting seascape is dominated by unconsolidated sediments throughout, but also exhibits increasing density and size of outcropping patches along a habitat patch gradient forced by the erosion of a sea level transgressive surface that has been deformed and tilted by tectonic forcing. A combination of sub-bottom profiling, multibeam bathymetry, and ROV surveys of the habitats and the demersal megafauna occupying the habitats indicate (1) significant beta diversity along this gradient, (2) biological diversity does not scale with habitat diversity, and (3) species occupy the patches disproportionately (non-linearly) with regard to the proportional availability of their preferred habitats. These results indicate that shelf habitat patch structure modulates species specific processes and interactions with other species. Further studies are needed to examine experimentally the mechanics of how patch structure modulates ecological processes in shelf systems. Our results also provide further support for including multiple spatial scales of patch structure for the application of remote habitat sensing as a surrogate for biological community structure.

Identifying predictable foraging habitats for a wide-ranging marine predator using ensemble ecological niche models	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Ecological niche modelling can provide valuable insight into species' environmental preferences and aid the identification of key habitats for populations of conservation concern. Here, we integrate biologging, satellite remote-sensing and ensemble ecological niche models (EENMs) to identify predictable foraging habitats for a globally important population of the grey-headed albatross (GHA) Thalassarche chrysostoma Location Bird Island, South Georgia; Southern Atlantic Ocean. Methods GPS and geolocation-immersion loggers were used to track at-sea movements and activity patterns of GHA over two breeding seasons (n = 55; brood-guard). Immersion frequency (landings per 10-min interval) was used to define foraging events. EENM combining Generalized Additive Models (GAM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) identified the biophysical conditions characterizing the locations of foraging events, using time-matched oceanographic predictors (Sea Surface Temperature, SST; chlorophyll a, chl-a; thermal front frequency, TFreq; depth). Model performance was assessed through iterative cross-validation and extrapolative performance through cross-validation among years. Results Predictable foraging habitats identified by EENM spanned neritic (<500 m), shelf break and oceanic waters, coinciding with a set of persistent biophysical conditions characterized by particular thermal ranges (3-8 degrees C, 12-13 degrees C), elevated primary productivity (chl-a > 0.5 mg m(-3)) and frequent manifestation of mesoscale thermal fronts. Our results confirm previous indications that GHA exploit enhanced foraging opportunities associated with frontal systems and objectively identify the APFZ as a region of high foraging habitat suitability. Moreover, at the spatial and temporal scales investigated here, the performance of multi-model ensembles was superior to that of single-algorithm models, and cross-validation among years indicated reasonable extrapolative performance. Main conclusions EENM techniques are useful for integrating the predictions of several single-algorithm models, reducing potential bias and increasing confidence in predictions. Our analysis highlights the value of EENM for use with movement data in identifying at-sea habitats of wide-ranging marine predators, with clear implications for conservation and management.

This model is based on the consideration of AOT fields as realizations of a stochastic process that is the exponent of an underlying Gaussian process with a specific autocorrelation function. In this approach, AOT fields have lognormal PDFs and structure functions with the correct asymptotic behavior at large scales. The latter is an advantage compared with fractal (scale invariant) approaches. The simple analytical form of the structure function in the proposed model facilitates its use for the parameterization of AOT statistics derived from remote sensing data. The new approach is illustrated using a 1-yr-long global MODISAOT dataset (over ocean) with 10-km resolution. It was used to compute AOT statistics for sample cells forming a grid with 58 spacing. The observed shapes of the structure functions indicated that, in a large number of cases, the AOT variability is split into two regimes that exhibit different patterns of behavior: small-scale stationary processes and trends reflecting variations at larger scales. The small-scale patterns are suggested to be generated by local aerosols within the marine boundary layer, while the large-scale trends are indicative of elevated aerosols transported from remote continental sources. This assumption is evaluated by comparison of the geographical distributions of these patterns derived from MODIS data with those obtained from the GISS GCM. This study shows considerable potential to enhance comparisons between remote sensing datasets and climate models beyond regional mean AOTs.

Moving Towards Dynamic Ocean Management: How Well Do Modeled Ocean Products Predict Species Distributions?	REMOTE SENSING												Species distribution models are now widely used in conservation and management to predict suitable habitat for protected marine species. The primary sources of dynamic habitat data have been in situ and remotely sensed oceanic variables (both are considered measured data), but now ocean models can provide historical estimates and forecast predictions of relevant habitat variables such as temperature, salinity, and mixed layer depth. To assess the performance of modeled ocean data in species distribution models, we present a case study for cetaceans that compares models based on output from a data assimilative implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to those based on measured data. Specifically, we used seven years of cetacean line-transect survey data collected between 1991 and 2009 to develop predictive habitat-based models of cetacean density for 11 species in the California Current Ecosystem. Two different generalized additive models were compared: one built with a full suite of ROMS output and another built with a full suite of measured data. Model performance was assessed using the percentage of explained deviance, root mean squared error (RMSE), observed to predicted density ratios, and visual inspection of predicted and observed distributions. Predicted distribution patterns were similar for models using ROMS output and measured data, and showed good concordance between observed sightings and model predictions. Quantitative measures of predictive ability were also similar between model types, and RMSE values were almost identical. The overall demonstrated success of the ROMS-based models opens new opportunities for dynamic species management and biodiversity monitoring because ROMS output is available in near real time and can be forecast.																	2072-4292					FEB	2016	8	2							149	10.3390/rs8020149								WOS:000371898800052

On the other hand, the remotely sensed imagery data has been used extensively in the identification of geological and geomorphological details of Ras Al-Shabaan. The geomorphological studies showed that depositional processes of wadis and channels are predominant at the Ras Al-Shabaan coast. The changes in geomorphological and geological data of Ras Al-Shabaan were identified by remote sensing image software. Two Landsat ETM+ images from 1990 and 2010 have been processed. The analysis of remote sensing data combined with field investigations and reference data were used to monitor, delineate, and describe the geomorphological changes of Ras Al-Shabaan coast during proceedings of supervised classification of ground units. Hence, the change detection statistics have been used in ground units. Geological and geomorphological maps were digitized by using ArcGIS software. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) were employed in order to monitor the results of changes occurred in the line of the coast. The satellite image processing and water index data were transferred to the ArcGIS program to draw the coast lines and to stand on the changes occurred. Thereby, it was possible to identify the most prominent landforms and geomorphic units of this area. Results showed that platforms, barriers, rocky heads, islands, coral reefs, submerged reefs, tidal channels, dissolution grooves, sabkhas, inlet system, waves work, and shoreline processes were included in coastal prominent landforms. The circumstances that formed this coast are not permanent, as it is changing rapidly and continuously due to erosion and uplift processes.

Breeding within a cost-effective distance from food-abundant foraging grounds may be crucial for successful reproduction. In this study, foraging areas, ranges and habitats of high-Arctic little auks (Alle alle) breeding on Bjamoya in the Barents Sea, at the southern edge of their breeding range, were investigated combining GPS-tracking and satellite remote sensing. Birds were expected to forage in areas with productive oceanographic features (cold shelf and frontal zone waters) close to their breeding colony. Contrary to expectation, they foraged in warm waters (sea surface temperature median 6.6 degrees C), optimal for boreal zooplanlcton. Little auks preferred shallow shelf waters (mean depth 74 m) characterized by higher chlorophyll a concentrations. Parent birds performed both short (ST) and long (LT) foraging trips, both of considerably longer duration compared to other colonies in more high-Arctic environment. During ST they probably spent more time searching for preferred Arctic prey (dominating in chick diet samples) among abundant Atlantic zooplankton. Long duration of LT resulted from exploring distant cold waters abundant in Arctic zooplankton community. This confirms that little auks are able to respond to various environmental conditions through the plasticity of their foraging behavior without negative consequences for chick survival. To date, observed changes in marine environment have not posed a threat to the ability of little auks on Bjarnaya to feed their chicks energy-rich zooplanlcton. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of reduced water quality on coral reefs in and out of no-take marine reserves	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Near-shore marine environments are increasingly subjected to reduced water quality, and their ability to withstand it is critical to their persistence. The potential role marine reserves may play in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality has received little attention. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in live coral and macro-algal cover and water quality during moderate and major flooding events of the Fitzroy River within the Keppel Bay region of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 2007 to 2013. We used 7 years of remote sensing data on water quality and data from long-term monitoring of coral reefs to quantify exposure of coral reefs to flood plumes. We used a distance linear model to partition the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors, including zoning, as drivers of the observed changes in coral and macro-algae cover. Moderate flood plumes from 2007 to 2009 did not affect coral cover on reefs in the Keppel Islands, suggesting the reef has intrinsic resistance against short-term exposure to reduced water quality. However, from 2009 to 2013, live coral cover declined by approximate to 50% following several weeks of exposure to turbid, low salinity water from major flood plume events in 2011 and subsequent moderate events in 2012 and 2013. Although the flooding events in 2012 and 2013 were smaller than the flooding events between 2007 to 2009, the ability of the reefs to withstand these moderate floods was lost, as evidenced by a approximate to 20% decline in coral cover between 2011 to 2013. Although zoning (no-take reserve or fished) was identified a significant driver of coral cover, we recorded consistently lower coral cover on reserve reefs than on fished reefs throughout the study period and significantly lower cover in 2011. Our findings suggest that even reefs with an inherent resistance to reduced water quality are not able to withstand repeated disturbance events. The limitations of reserves in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality on near-shore coral reefs underscores the importance of integrated management approaches that combine effective land-based management with networks of no-take reserves.

Modelling the spatial distribution of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica along the North African coast: Implications for the assessment of Good Environmental Status	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 is a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered as an indicator of environment quality in coastal areas. This species forms large meadows, which are sensitive to several anthropogenic pressures and the decrease in their extension is considered a priority issue for the Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this study was to develop a Species Distribution Model for P. oceanica, to be applied to the Mediterranean North African coast, in order to obtain an estimation of the potential distribution of this species in the region. The Species Distribution Model was calibrated using high resolution data from 4 Mediterranean sites, located in Italy and Spain, as the study area is a data-poor zone with regard to seagrass distribution (i.e. only for some areas detailed distribution maps are available). The model was then validated using available data concerning the North African coast. The probability of presence of the species in a given area was modelled using a binomial generalized linear model as a function of the bathymetry and water transparency, dissolved organic matter, sea surface temperature and salinity, mainly obtained from satellite data. Model selection procedure suggests that water transparency plays a major role, but also other variables, such as salinity and sea surface temperature, are important at larger spatial scales in explaining meadows distribution. The availability of high resolution time-series of input data allowed us to apply the validated model to the whole North African coast. Suitable areas are strongly related to the coastal realm, and cover a large portion of North African coasts, with Tunisian and Lybian ones being the most relevant zones for this species. In particular, the shelf of the Gulf of Gabes includes large areas with environmental conditions suitable for the species. Based on model predictions, we developed a robust indicator of potential habitat suitability, which could be used for the assessment of Good Environmental Status, as requested by the Ecosystem Based Approach, to be implemented at the scale of the whole Mediterranean basin in the framework of the Barcelona Convention.

Indeed, shipping routes are becoming very crowded and the likelihood of oil slick occurrence is increasing. In this frame, a fully integrated remote sensing system can be a valuable monitoring tool. We propose an integrated and interoperable system able to monitor ship traffic and marine operators, using sensing capabilities from a variety of electronic sensors, along with geo-positioning tools, and through a communication infrastructure. Our system is capable of transferring heterogeneous data, freely and seamlessly, between different elements of the information system (and their users) in a consistent and usable form. The system also integrates a collection of decision support services providing proactive functionalities. Such services demonstrate the potentiality of the system in facilitating dynamic links among different data, models and actors, as indicated by the performed field tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Laboratory experiments for inter-comparison of three volume scattering meters to measure angular scattering properties of hydrosols	OPTICS EXPRESS												Measurements of the volume scattering function (VSF) of hydrosols is of primary importance to investigate the interaction of light with hydrosols and to further interpret in situ and remote sensing data of ocean color. In this paper, a laboratory inter-comparison experiment of three recently developed VSF meters that are able to measure the scattered light for a wide range of scattering angle at 515 nm wavelength is performed using phytoplankton cultures and mineral-like hydrosols. A rigorous measurement protocol was employed to ensure good quality data. In particular, the protocol enabled removing the influence of bacteria on the hydrosols within the sample. The differences in the VSF measurements between the instruments vary from 10 to 25% depending on the composition of the hydrosols. The analysis of the angular features of the VSF revealed a sharp increase of the VSF beyond the scattering angle of 150 degrees for some phytoplankton species. Such behavior is observed for two of the three VSF meters, thus suggesting that it is not due to instrumental artifacts but more likely to phytoplankton optical properties themselves. Moreover, comparisons with currently used theoretical phase functions show that the models are not able to reproduce satisfactorily the directional patterns in the backscattering region. This study suggests that a better modelling of the VSF shape of phytoplankton at high scattering angles is required to correctly represent the angular shape of the VSF in the backscattering hemisphere. Tabulated values of the measured phase functions are provided for scattering angles from 0.1 to 175 degrees.

Here we provide evidence supporting connection between the presence of surfactantassociated bacteria in the near-surface layer of the ocean, slicks on the sea surface, and a distinctive feature in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of the sea surface. From DNA analyses of the in situ samples using pyrosequencing technology, we found the highest abundance of surfactantassociated bacterial taxa in the near-surface layer below the slick. Our study suggests that production of surfactants by marine bacteria takes place in the organic-rich areas of the water column. Produced surfactants can then be transported to the sea surface and form slicks when certain physical conditions are met. This finding has potential applications in monitoring organic materials in the water column using remote sensing techniques. Identifying a connection between marine bacteria and production of natural surfactants may provide a better understanding of the global picture of biophysical processes at the boundary between the ocean and atmosphere, air-sea exchange of greenhouse gases, and production of climate-active marine aerosols.																	2045-2322					JAN 12	2016	6								19123	10.1038/srep19123								WOS:000368110800001	26753514

Remote Sensing Observations of Ocean Surface Chlorophyll and Temperature with the Impact of Cyclones and Depressions over the Bay of Bengal Water	MARINE GEODESY												MODIS-Aqua derived eight-day composite chlorophyll concentration data analyzed to study the impact of cyclones and depressions on the Bay of Bengal productivity. A total of 15 cyclonic storms and depressions picked up from the India Meteorological Department datasets. MODIS-Aqua data analyzed during October 2002 to December 2009. There was observation of depressions (D), deep depressions (DD), cyclonic storms (CS), severe cyclonic storms (SCS), and very severe cyclonic storms (VSCS) with categories of intensities ("T" numbers 1.5-6) and wind speeds (25-108knots). The chlorophyll concentration observed to be high (1.0-5.0mg/m(3)) with the impact in the coastal and offshore waters. Quickscat scatterometer data showed high wind speed (about 10meters/second). Sea surface temperature (SST) observed to be decreased (roughly 2 degrees C) with effect of cyclones. The cyclone numbers, intensity, and chlorophyll concentration has been observed to be increasing from 2002 to 2009, with observation of VSCS "Sidr" during 2007. The study would be interesting to link carbon flux/sequestration, marine food chain, and harnessing fishery resources in a postcyclone period.																	0149-0419	1521-060X				JAN 2	2016	39	1					53	76		10.1080/01490419.2015.1121172								WOS:000372740600004

In a pilot research project, we integrate changes in different types of ES along a gradient of land-and seascape units (terrestrial, coastal and marine). This gradient includes developed urban and peri-urban areas, and undeveloped areas including submerged lands in the coastal (territorial) waters of Israel. The emphasis in our research is on development of a practical methodology for sustainable (urban and rural) development. Goals of the pilot project presented here include: (1) evaluation of various ecosystem services based on categorical indicators for each of the four ES types: provisional, regulating, supporting and cultural; (2) development of a method that can be used on a wider scale across varying landscape units; and (3) refinement of scenario building relevant to local planning institutions and frameworks. The project's final product consists of GIS-generated maps. These maps are the basis for weighing trade-offs in ES across relevant land-and seascape units in the Mt. Carmel region of Israel. Despite some limitations, this approach to ES assessment is helpful, and if improved upon in some of the ways described herein, it can provide the first steps for infusing ES values within planning frameworks in Israel and beyond.																			978-3-319-26218-5; 978-3-319-26216-1				2016	14						23	41		10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5_3	10.1007/978-3-319-26218-5							WOS:000398203700003

For the first time experimentally confirmed the efficiency of the new method of directly measuring the slope variances and other surface waves parameters affect the scattering of ultrasound and microwaves. The method is based on the analysis of spectral and energy characteristics of the reflected acoustic waves at underwater surface waves observation. A feature of this method is the simultaneous use of multiple antennas with different radiation patterns. The scheme of measurements with a single radiating and three receiving antennas with different radiation patterns implemented in the acoustical wave gauge manufactured in the IAP RAS. Sensing of the water surface occurs vertically, so that the scattering occurs in quasispecular area. This measurement scheme allows retrieving all the parameters of surface waves that effect on scattering cross-section, the width and the shift of Doppler spectrum of the reflected radiation.

In recent years, with the development of stealth technology, directly through the radar to detect ship targets in complex sea background, has become more and more difficult. In this context, many scholars have turned to wake of the motion ship or submarine. Ship wake electromagnetic scattering characteristics analysis and corresponding remote sensing technology have become one of the important research directions in the field of marine remote sensing and military target detection. Research on ship wake electromagnetic scattering properties is the theoretical basis of the ship motion target recognition, which has the important theory value for radar imaging. In this paper, firstly, we established target scattering model which includes sea surface model and wake model. The random sea surface using the Pierson-Moskowitz type wave spectrum is generated. The wake models consist of Kelvin wake model, narrow V wake model and internal wave wake model. Second, we choose Kirchhoff resident phase method to calculate the rough surface and analysis the polarization characteristics of target scattering. Third, the simulations in different sea levels with or without sea wake are presented. Last, the suitable method for the orientation detection of wake is discussed for the searching task.																			978-1-5090-6093-1				2016							4962	4966										WOS:000400013904164

In addition to the highest spatial resolution, it is also featured with high radiometric precision and high positioning accuracy, etc.. However, regarding current supervision of sea resources, perfect data processing work flow has not been formed yet. In this paper, four methods of Brovey, Gram-Spectral pan sharpening (G-S), PC Spectral SharPening (PC) and Pansharp (PSH) are adopted to conduct comparative experiments for image fusion and evaluate images that have been fused both subjectively and objectively. Objective evaluation indexes including the average value, the variance, the entropy, the average gradient and the correlation coefficient are selected to compute and analyze fusion effects. According to the research results, it could be indicated that such four fusion methods of GF-2 Satellite are able to be used to significantly improve both the spatial resolution and the utilization ratio of images. And the method of PSH should be employed in case that GF-2 images are applied into visual interpretation and thematic charting.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							3770	3773		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729977								WOS:000388114603202

Traditional bathymetry methods can provide accurate measurements of the water depth. But remote sensing has characteristics such as speediness, synchronization, large area, high resolution and so on, and it can solve many problems which are hard to overcome in traditional fathoming method. To fully utilize the existing resources of remote sensing images and excavate multitemporal information effectively, the paper proposed the fusion model of multi-temporal remote sensing bathymetry inversion in Beidao Island based on fuzzy membership degree.

The uncertainties associated with MODIS daily PAR need to be quantified in order to understand the uncertainties in the estimated PP. On the other hand, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES) provides estimates of hourly solar radiation product (24 images per day) over North America, which can be integrated to produce daily PAR. In this study, both GOES iPAR and daily PAR are used to compare with the corresponding MODIS products to understand uncertainties in MODIS daily PAR products and to understand how multiple measurements per day can improve daily PAR estimates. While GOES iPAR and MODIS iPAR showed excellent consistency over cloud-free regions, their daily PAR products showed some degree of discrepancy due to variable cloud cover.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							5845	5847		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730527								WOS:000388114605200

To monitor the thermal pollution of cooling-water discharge from the coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plant in the eastern coastal region in China, the mono-window algorithm for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared bands of Landsat TM/ETM+, and HJ IRS data is improved by integrating the atmospheric correction model. The SST variability influenced by the thermal discharge from the coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plant near Xiangshan Harbour, Tianwan and Yueqing Bay in the eastern coastal area in China is investigated by comparing the distributions of SST around the power plants before and after the operation of the power plants. The results indicate that the spatial variability of SST rise depends on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, tide, etc. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3. was not large, thermal discharge still exerts impact on ecosystems within the bay to some degree due to the relatively closeness of the environment of the bay. Taking the coastal terrain near the power plants into consideration, more reasonable operation projects of the power plants and the design of the intake and discharge mouth should be set up in order to accelerate the dilution, diffusion and cooling of the thermal plume under the influence of discharged flow of the rivers, and reduce the impact of thermal pollution on the ecological community with high biodiversity in the intertidal zone.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7659	7662		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730997								WOS:000388114607117

These images are used, among other purposes, for monitoring coastal and marine waters pollution where oil floating on the surface becomes visible because it damps the short gravity-capillary waves that are responsible for the radar backscattering [14]. Nowadays an important number of SAR images are available and this number will increase in coming years thanks the launch of Cosmo-Skymed 2nd generation, recent availability of Sentinel-1, ALOS Palsar-2 products and future SAOCOM launch. That will provide information suitable to support decision makers in managing emergencies or potential disasters. The present study show the results obtained from 190 regions of interest extracted from a set of X, C and L Band images, where a database related to spatial, textural, spectral and contextual characteristics of the features detected was ingested into a neural network algorithm. The classification process reached percentages of up to 95% of cases of oil spills and look-alikes correctly classified depending on the wavelength, the polarization and incidence angle.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							7715	7717										WOS:000388114607132

MAPPING OF THE SEAGRASS COVER ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF TURKEY USING LANDSAT 8 OLI IMAGES	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Benthic habitat is defined as ecological environment where marine animals, plants and other organisms live in. Benthic habitat mapping is defined as plotting the distribution and extent of habitats to create a map with complete coverage of the seabed showing distinct boundaries separating adjacent habitats or the use of spatially continuous environmental data sets to represent and predict biological patterns on the seafloor. Seagrass is an essential endemic marine species that prevents coast erosion and regulates carbon dioxide absorption in both undersea and atmosphere. Fishing, mining, pollution and other human activities cause serious damage to seabed ecosystems and reduce benthic biodiversity. According to the latest studies, only 5-10% of the seafloor is mapped, therefore it is not possible to manage resources effectively, protect ecologically important areas. In this study, it is aimed to map seagrass cover using Landsat 8 OLI images in the northern part of Mediterranean coast of Turkey. After pre-processing (e.g. radiometric, atmospheric, water depth correction) of Landsat images, coverage maps are produced with supervised classification using in-situ data which are underwater photos and videos. Result maps and accuracy assessment are presented and discussed.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF LANDSAT-8 IMAGERY FOR RETRIEVING SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (CASE STUDY PERSIAN GULF)	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the critical parameters in marine meteorology and oceanography. The SST datasets are incorporated as conditions for ocean and atmosphere models. The SST needs to be investigated for various scientific phenomenon such as salinity, potential fishing zone, sea level rise, upwelling, eddies, cyclone predictions. On the other hands, high spatial resolution SST maps can illustrate eddies and sea surface currents. Also, near real time producing of SST map is suitable for weather forecasting and fishery applications. Therefore satellite remote sensing with wide coverage of data acquisition capability can use as real time tools for producing SST dataset. Satellite sensor such as AVHRR, MODIS and SeaWIFS are capable of extracting brightness values at different thermal spectral bands. These brightness temperatures are the sole input for the SST retrieval algorithms. Recently, Landsat8 successfully launched and accessible with two instruments on-board: (1) the Operational Land Imager (OLI) with nine spectral bands in the visual, near infrared, and the shortwave infrared spectral regions; and (2) the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) with two spectral bands in the long wavelength infrared. The two TIRS bands were selected to enable the atmospheric correction of the thermal data using a split window algorithm (SWA). The TIRS instrument is one of the major payloads aboard this satellite which can observe the sea surface by using the split-window thermal infrared channels (CH10: 10.6 mu m to 11.2 mu m; CH11: 11.5 mu m to 12.5 mu m) at a resolution of 30 m. The TIRS sensors have three main advantages comparing with other previous sensors. First, the TIRS has two thermal bands in the atmospheric window that provide a new SST retrieval opportunity using the widely used split-window (SW) algorithm rather than the single channel method. Second, the spectral filters of TIRS two bands present narrower bandwidth than that of the thermal band on board on previous Landsat sensors. Third, TIRS is one of the best space born and high spatial resolution with 30 m. in this regards, Landsat-8 can use the Split-Window (SW) algorithm for retrieving SST dataset. Although several SWs have been developed to use with other sensors, some adaptations are required in order to implement them for the TIRS spectral bands. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a SW, adapted for use with Landsat-8 TIRS data, along with its accuracy assessment. In this research, that has been done for modelling SST using thermal Landsat 8-imagery of the Persian Gulf. Therefore, by incorporating contemporary in situ data and SST map estimated from other sensors like MODIS, we examine our proposed method with coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) on check point to model SST retrieval for Landsat-8 imagery. Extracted results for implementing different SW's clearly shows superiority of utilized method by R-2=0.95 and RMSE=0.24.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1107	1110		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1107-2016								WOS:000393156000186

OIL SPILL DETECTION AND MONITORING OF ABU DHABI COASTAL ZONE USING KOMPSAT-5 SAR IMAGERY	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Abu Dhabi Government endorsed vision for its Maritime Strategy 'A safe, secure and sustainable maritime domain for Abu Dhabi'. This research study share this vision using the concept of monitoring as tool for marine protection against any possible oil pollution. The best technology to detect and monitor oil pollution and in particularly oil spill is SAR imagery In this case study we chose KOMPSAT-5 SAR. KOMPSAT-5 carries X-band SAR for earth observation, and is capable of day-and-night imaging under all weather condition. It provides three operation modes: High Resolution Mode to provide 1 m resolution, Standard Mode to provide 3 m resolution and Wide Swath Mode to provide 20 m resolution with 100 km swath at 550 km altitude, with four modes of polarization. KOMPSAT-5 provides products for various applications; security and defense, mapping, and natural resource management, environmental monitoring, disaster monitoring and more. For our case study we chose to work with Wide Swath mode (WS) with Vertical polarization (VV) to cover a wide area of interest located to the north west of Abu Dhabi including some important islands like "Zirku Island", and areas with oil production activities The results of data acquired on 4th May 2015 show some spot of oil spill with length estimated about 3 KM, and the daily satellite data acquisition over the period July 24 through July 31 shows serious and many oil spill events some are small, but many others are considered to be big with area size around 20 km(2). In the context of oil spill pollution in the seas, we have to consider the development and increase of overseas transportation, which is an important factor for both social and economic sectors. The harmful effects of marine pollution are numerous, from the damage of marine life to the damage of the aquatic ecosystem as whole. As such, the need for oil slick detection is crucial, for the location of polluted areas and to evaluate slick drift to protect the coastline. Satellite-based oil spill monitoring system now can be used to take precautions and even to determine the possible polluter; it has a vital importance on the detection and protection of national and international waters from the possible damages of petroleum hazard. Finally, and as we suggested in previous studies, we recommend to the national authorities to establish a national near-real time oil spill monitoring system based on SAR satellite imagery, with the support of other tools like AIS and navigation radars																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1115	1121		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1115-2016								WOS:000393156000188

DETECTION OF COASTLINE DEFORMATION USING REMOTE SENSING AND GEODETIC SURVEYS	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				The coastal areas are being destroyed due to the usage that effect the natural balance. Unconsciously sand mining from the sea for nearshore nourishment and construction uses are the main ones. Physical interferences for mining of sand cause an ecologic threat to the coastal environment. However, use of marine sand is inevitable because of economic reasons or unobtainable land-based sand resources. The most convenient solution in such a protection-usage dilemma is to reduce negative impacts of sand production from marine. This depends on the accurate determination of criteriaon production place, style, and amount of sand. With this motivation, nearshore geodedic surveying studies performed on Kilyos Campus of Bogazici University located on the Black Sea coast, north of Istanbul, Turkey between 2001-2002. The study area extends 1 km in the longshore. Geodetic survey was carried out in the summer of 2001 to detect the initial condition for the shoreline. Long-term seasonal changes in shoreline positions were determined biannually. The coast was measured with post-processed kinematic GPS. Besides, shoreline change has studied using Landsat imagery between the years 1986-2015. The data set of Landsat 5 imageries were dated 05.08.1986 and 31.08.2007 and Landsat 7 imageries were dated 21.07.2001 and 28.07.2015. Landcover types in the study area were analyzed on the basis of pixel based classification method. Firstly, unsupervised classification based on ISODATA (Iterative Self Organizing Data Analysis Technique) has been applied and spectral clusters have been determined that gives prior knowledge about the study area. In the second step, supervised classification was carried out by using the three different approaches which are minimum-distance, parallelepiped and maximum-likelihood. All pixel based classification processes were performed with ENVI 4.8 image processing software. Results of geodetic studies and classification outputs will be presented in this paper.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1169	1174		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1169-2016								WOS:000393156000198

Large oil spill classification using SAR images based on spatial histogram	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Among the different types of marine pollution, oil spill is a major threat to the sea ecosystems. Remote sensing is used in oil spill response. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active microwave sensor that operates under all weather conditions and provides information about the surface roughness and covers large areas at a high spatial resolution. SAR is widely used to identify and track pollutants in the sea, which may be due to a secondary effect of a large natural disaster or by a man-made one. The detection of oil spill in SAR imagery relies on the decrease of the backscattering from the sea surface, due to the increased viscosity, resulting in a dark formation that contrasts with the brightness of the surrounding area. Most of the use of SAR images for oil spill detection is done by visual interpretation. Trained interpreters scan the image, and mark areas of low backscatter and where shape is a-symmetrical. It is very difficult to apply this method for a wide area. In contrast to visual interpretation, automatic detection algorithms were suggested and are mainly based on scanning dark formations, extracting features, and applying big data analysis. We propose a new algorithm that applies a nonlinear spatial filter that detects dark formations and is not susceptible to noises, such as internal or speckle. The advantages of this algorithm are both in run time and the results retrieved. The algorithm was tested in genesimulations as well as on COSMO-SkyMed images, detecting the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (occurred on 20/4/2010). The simulation results show that even in a noisy environment, oil spill is detected. Applying the algorithm to the Deep Horizon oil spill, the algorithm classified the oil spill better than focusing on dark formation algorithm.

Retrieval of concentrations of seawater natural components from reflectance spectrum	22ND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				22nd International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUN 30-JUL 03, 2016	Tomsk, RUSSIA	SPIE, Russian Fdn Basic Res, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, SP Equipment, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys				Results of the seawater reflectance coefficient measurements carried out in 2002 - 2014 on the oceanographic platform of Marine Hydrophysical Institute using spectrophotometer designed by authors are discussed. Reflectance is measured in range 390 - 700 nm with 2.5 nm step. The light reflected by sea surface is taken into account by special measurement technique. The processing algorithm allows to calculate the following seawater biooptical characteristics: concentration of phytoplankton pigments, absorption by nonliving organic matter and backscattering by suspended matter, and also to detect presence of auxiliary photosynthetic pigments based on the reconstructed spectrum of phytoplankton absorption. The proposed method makes it possible to carry out operational sub-satellite monitoring of marine environment and to validate the algorithms of remote sensing data processing.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0512-1				2016	10035								100352Y	10.1117/12.2247845								WOS:000392623500106

"Mangrove classification through the use of Object Oriented Classification and Support Vector Machine of LiDAR datasets: a case study in Naawan and Manticao, Misamis Oriental, Philippines"	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VII	Proceedings of SPIE				SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VII	SEP 27-29, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grows at the surface between the land and the sea in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. Mangroves are essential in supporting various marine life, thus, it is important to preserve and manage these areas. There are many approaches in creating Mangroves maps, one of which is through the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). It is a remote sensing technique which uses light pulses to measure distances and to generate three-dimensional point clouds of the Earth's surface. In this study, the topographic LiDAR Data will be used to analyze the geophysical features of the terrain and create a Mangrove map. The dataset that we have were first pre-processed using the LAStools software. It is a software that is used to process LiDAR data sets and create different layers such as DSM, DTM, nDSM, Slope, LiDAR Intensity, LiDAR number of first returns, and CHM. All the aforementioned layers together was used to derive the Mangrove class. Then, an Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) was performed using eCognition. OBIA analyzes a group of pixels with similar properties called objects, as compared to the traditional pixel-based which only examines a single pixel. Multi-threshold and multiresolution segmentation were used to delineate the different classes and split the image into objects. There are four levels of classification, first is the separation of the Land from the Water. Then the Land class was further dived into Ground and Non-ground objects. Furthermore classification of Nonvegetation, Mangroves, and Other Vegetation was done from the Non-ground objects. Lastly Separation of the mangrove class was done through the Use of field verified training points which was then run into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. Different classes were separated using the different layer feature properties, such as mean, mode, standard deviation, geometrical properties, neighbor-related properties, and textural properties. Accuracy assessment was done using a different set of field validation points. This workflow was applied in the classification of Mangroves to a LiDAR dataset of Naawan and Manticao, Misamis Oriental, Philippines. The process presented in this study shows that LiDAR data and its derivatives can be used in extracting and creating Mangrove maps, which can be helpful in managing coastal environment.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0414-8; 978-1-5106-0415-5				2016	10005								UNSP 100051B	10.1117/12.2241964								WOS:000391483900037

Hyperspectral imaging is valuable in marine monitoring, search and rescue. On the demand of spectral imaging of objects under the complex sea scene, physics based simulation method of spectral image of object under sea scene is proposed. On the development of an imaging simulation model considering object, background, atmosphere conditions, sensor, it is able to examine the influence of wind speed, atmosphere conditions and other environment factors change on spectral image quality under complex sea scene. Firstly, the sea scattering model is established based on the Philips sea spectral model, the rough surface scattering theory and the water volume scattering characteristics. The measured bi directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data of objects is fit to the statistical model. MODTRAN software is used to obtain solar illumination on the sea, sky brightness, the atmosphere transmittance from sea to sensor and atmosphere backscattered radiance, and Monte Carlo ray tracing method is used to calculate the sea surface object composite scattering and spectral image. Finally, the object spectrum is acquired by the space transformation, radiation degradation and adding the noise. The model connects the spectrum image with the environmental parameters, the object parameters, and the sensor parameters, which provide a tool for the load demonstration and algorithm development.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0770-5; 978-1-5106-0771-2				2016	10156								UNSP 101561N	10.1117/12.2247241								WOS:000388803200057

SeaHawk: An advanced CubeSat mission for sustained ocean color monitoring	SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND NEXT-GENERATION SATELLITES XX	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XX	SEP 26-28, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Sustained ocean color monitoring is vital to understanding the marine ecosystem. It has been identified as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and is a vital parameter in understanding long-term climate change. Furthermore, observations can be beneficial in observing oil spills, harmful algal blooms and the health of fisheries. Space-based remote sensing, through MERIS, SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments, have provided a means of observing the vast area covered by the ocean which would otherwise be impossible using ships alone. However, the large pixel size makes measurements of lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal zones difficult. Furthermore, retirement of a number of widely used and relied upon ocean observation instruments, particularly MERIS and SeaWiFS, leaves a significant gap in ocean color observation opportunities This paper presents an overview of the SeaHawk mission, a collaborative effort between Clyde Space Ltd., the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Cloudland Instruments, and Goddard Spaceflight Center, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The goal of the project is to enhance the ability to observe ocean color in high temporal and spatial resolution through use of a low-cost, next-generation ocean color sensor flown aboard a CubeSat. The final product will be 530 times smaller (0.0034 vs 1.81m(3)) and 115 time less massive (3.4 vs 390.0kg) but with a ground resolution 10 times better whilst maintaining a signal/noise ratio 50% that of SeaWiFs. This paper will describe the objectives of the mission, outline the payload specification and the spacecraft platform to support it.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0404-9; 978-1-5106-0405-6				2016	10000								UNSP 100001C	10.1117/12.2241058								WOS:000391489900030

Remote sensing is an important part of oil spill response. The hyperspectral images can not only provide the space information but also the spectral information. Pixels of interests generally incorporate information from disparate component that requires quantitative decomposition of these pixels to extract desired information. Oil spill detection can be implemented by applying hyperspectral camera which can collect the hyperspectral data of the oil. By extracting desired spectral signature from hundreds of band information, one can detect and identify oil spill area in vast geographical regions. There are now numerous hyperspectral image processing algorithms developed for target detection. In this paper, we investigate several most widely used target detection algorithm for the identification of surface oil spills in ocean environment. In the experiments, we applied a hyperspectral camera to collect the real life oil spill. The experimental results shows the feasibility of oil spill detection using hyperspectral imaging and the performance of hyperspectral image processing algorithms were also validated.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0479-7; 978-1-5106-0480-3				2016	10030								100301G	10.1117/12.2244924								WOS:000393152500025

AUTOMATIC SEA BIRD DETECTION FROM HIGH RESOLUTION AERIAL IMAGERY	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Great efforts are presently taken in the scientific community to develop computerized and (fully) automated image processing methods allowing for an efficient and automatic monitoring of sea birds and marine mammals in ever-growing amounts of aerial imagery. Currently the major part of the processing, however, is still conducted by especially trained professionals, visually examining the images and detecting and classifying the requested subjects. This is a very tedious task, particularly when the rate of void images regularly exceeds the mark of 90%. In the content of this contribution we will present our work aiming to support the processing of aerial images by modern methods from the field of image processing. We will especially focus on the combination of local, region-based feature detection and piecewise global image segmentation for automatic detection of different sea bird species. Large image dimensions resulting from the use of medium and large-format digital cameras in aerial surveys inhibit the applicability of image processing methods based on global operations. In order to efficiently handle those image sizes and to nevertheless take advantage of globally operating segmentation algorithms, we will describe the combined usage of a simple performant feature detector based on local operations on the original image with a complex global segmentation algorithm operating on extracted sub images. The resulting exact segmentation of possible candidates then serves as a basis for the determination of feature vectors for subsequent elimination of false candidates and for classification tasks.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B7					299	303		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-299-2016								WOS:000393155900046

The investigation is focused on a specific subdomain in the Northwestern Mediterranean where several observational networks encompassing both in situ and remote sensing instruments are available. This region is relevant since it includes two harbours and a marine protected area, the Ebro River Delta. Class-1 and class-2 skill metrics are used in concert to quantitatively evaluate the quality of hourly IBI surface fields. The impact of riverine discharges on the coastal circulation is investigated by comparing the signal of the Ebro River freshwater outflow in both observed (high-frequency radar (HFR)) and modelled (IBI) current maps. The ability of the HFR and IBI to detect the presence of coastal eddies is also qualitatively estimated by calculating surface vorticity maps. According to the results, basic circulation features are statistically reproduced by IBI in reference to mean and variance, despite some model drawbacks in terms of reduced energy content in surface currents. IBI has proven to be a robust model solution in the study area, able to act as a consistent large-scale 'father' system in future downscaling approaches by providing coherent open boundary conditions to nested high-resolution coastal models.

It consists of a set of Earth observation satellites and in-situ sensors that provide geo-information that are used, through a set of Copernicus services, for applications related to the environment and global security. The main services of the Copernicus programme address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency management and security. In Germany, there is a national service team of Copernicus service coordinators, who are responsible for the national development of the Copernicus services and for providing user-specific information about the Copernicus processes. These coordinators represent the contact points for all the programmes and services concerning their respective Copernicus theme. To publish information about Copernicus, national conferences and workshops are organised. Many people are involved in planning the continuous process of bringing the information to public authorities, research institutes and commercial companies. The Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (Bundesamt fur Kartographie and Geodasie, BKG) is one such organisation, and is mainly responsible for the national land monitoring service of Copernicus. To make use of the freely available data from the Copernicus programme, the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy is currently developing new applications and projects in the field of remote sensing and land monitoring. These projects can be used by other public authorities as examples on how to use the Copernicus data and services for their individual demands and requirements. Copernicus data and services are currently not very commonly used in the daily routine of the national mapping agencies, but they will soon be.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B1					1195	1199		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B1-1195-2016								WOS:000392750100181

Fisheries sector employs 38 million people, especially marine fisheries who are sensitive to the natural hazards like cyclone or rough sea conditions. 370 million Indians residing over 8118 kms of coastline are exposed to 10% of the world's tropical cyclones. During 1891 to 2000, 308 cyclones hit the Indian West coast, leading to loss of lives and livelihood and damaging the public infrastructure; resetting the development pace, repeatedly. Technological advancements like Remote Sensing, Data Analytics and weather models have improved the accuracy of prediction of the natural hazards. Communication technologies such as mobile phones are spreading too and have become affordable. Hence, such revolution in Information generation and Communication technology has increased the hope of identifying the hazards in advance, their impact region (exposure) and the people / property vulnerability towards it. mKRISHI (R) Fisheries used the Wind and Wave information generated by INCOIS and using the service design concept, simplified the delivery of information to local language on mobile phones. Such communication helped fishers, their family and other stakeholders to identify the risk zones, their occurrence date and time and accordingly responded to it or re-planned their journey. This data driven planning is helping the fishers reduce the risk exposure and hence saving the lives of many fishers. We also experimented with the extension of mobile signal in the deep sea, to create a digital information highway upto 30km from the coast. This paper captures the experience, methodology followed, learning and set of recommendations, which can help develop a strategy for Early Warning System (EWS) to improve safety at sea and coastal regions.																	2158-3404		978-1-5090-2498-8				2016							106	111										WOS:000391412400018

Radar probing of surfactant films on the water surface using dual co-polarized SAR	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2016	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 26-27, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Microwave radar is a very perspective tool for all-weather monitoring of film slicks which appear in radar imagery of the water surface as areas of reduced backscattering due to damping of short wind waves. Information about the backscatter variations obtained from single band/one polarization radar seems to be insufficient for film characterization, so, new capabilities of multi-polarization radar for monitoring of film slicks have been actively discussed in the literature. In this paper results of new field experiments on remote sensing of film slicks using dual co-polarized radars: a satellite X-band TerraSAR-X and recently designed at IAP RAS a Multifrequency Radar Complex - three-band scatterometer operating in X-/C-/S-bands and mounted onboard a ship are presented. Along with backscattering depression the variations of polarized (Bragg) and non polarized radar backscatter components in slicks were analyzed. It is obtained that VV-to-HH backscatter ratio is smaller than the ratio predicted by a Bragg (two-scale) model thus indicating that additional, non polarized (NP), component also contributes to the total radar backscatter. Assuming the radar backscatter to be a sum of polarized (Bragg) and NP components the latter was eliminated from the total radar backscatter, and contrasts for the Bragg and NP components were obtained. The contrasts for the polarized component allowed us to estimate damping of gravity-capillary wind waves at Bragg wavelengths in slick and to give more accurate comparison with models of wave damping due to elastic film.

The joint influences of wind fetch and water depth on the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) of and Doppler spectra for echoes from nearshore sea surfaces are mainly studied. The numerical results show that with a further increasing fetch, the excess of NRCS for small depth sea over that for deeper sea increases, and Doppler spectral features are also intensely influenced by nonlinear interactions between waves in the large wind fetch and small water depth marine environment. These both indicate that the effects of the finite depth are more prominent with increasing wind fetch, especially for HH polarization.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0402-5; 978-1-5106-0403-2				2016	9999								UNSP 999913	10.1117/12.2241327								WOS:000391353700027

The environment change data such as sea primary productivity, marine fishing and main pollutants were collected and surveyed by remote sensing images, and the methods for ecosystem service value assessment were employed to analyze the influence of environment change to ecosystem service value in the Bohai sea. The result show: the primary production, pollutants loading, coastline and sea area have changed greatly in the Bohai Sea since 1988. The environmental changes increased the value of marine ecosystem services value from 529.42 billion RMB in 1988 to 558.83 billion RMB in 2013. The ecosystem services values of recreation, food and materials production, O-2 supply, climate regulation and primary productivity were raised. However, other marine ecosystem services value, including biological control, pollutant purification, knowledge broaden and biodiversity protection were lowered.																			978-1-60595-343-4				2016							333	339										WOS:000389851900051

The fact will have non-negligible influence on the marine environment in and around where the plants site. Hence, it's significant to monitor the temporal and spatial variation of the warm-water discharge for the assessment of the effect of the plant on its surrounding marine environment. The paper describes an approach for the dynamic monitoring of the warm-water discharge of coastal plants based on the airborne high-resolution thermal infrared remote sensing technology. Firstly, the geometric correction was carried out for the thermal infrared remote sensing images acquired on the aircraft. Secondly, the atmospheric correction method was used to retrieve the sea surface temperature of the images. Thirdly, the temperature-rising districts caused by the warm-water discharge were extracted. Lastly, the temporal and spatial variations of the warm-water discharge were analyzed through the geographic information system (GIS) technology. The approach was applied to Qinshan nuclear power plant (NPP), in Zhejiang Province, China. In considering with the tide states, the diffusion, distribution and temperature-rising values of the warm-water discharged from the plant were calculated and analyzed, which are useful to the marine environment assessment.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0121-5				2016	9880								988029	10.1117/12.2227567								WOS:000389776100056

Region with the secluded underwater hill streamlined with currents was selected. Measurements were carried out from the onboard of vessels on move and in drift by optical, radar, acoustic equipment, and STD probe. The complex different structure of waters, which was formed under the influence of shelf waters and water of the open sea interaction, was observed during the experiment. The analysis of measurements in the water column showed that that the flow around underwater elevation forms the hydrophysical disturbances of marine environment. Maximum flow observed above the slopes of underwater elevation and reach 50 cm/s. Wind speed varied from 0 to 10 m/s. On radar panoramas in the region of underwater elevation is observed the appearance of the wave structure, different from the background wind waves. This anomaly on the sea surface is connected with non-uniform current in the neighborhood underwater elevation.

Determination of immersion factors for radiance sensors in marine and inland waters: A semi-analytical approach using refractive index approximation	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEANS AND INLAND WATERS: TECHNIQUES, APPLICATIONS, AND CHALLENGES	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Oceans and Inland Waters - Techniques, Applications, and Challenges	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			Underwater radiometers are generally calibrated in air using a standard source. The immersion factors are required for these radiometers to account for the change in the in-water measurements with respect to in-air due to the different refractive index of the medium. The immersion factors previously determined for RAMSES series of commercial radiometers manufactured by TriOS are applicable to clear oceanic waters. In typical inland and turbid productive coastal waters, these experimentally determined immersion factors yield significantly large errors in water-leaving radiances (L-w) and hence remote sensing reflectances (R-rs). To overcome this limitation, a semi-analytical method with based on the refractive index approximation is proposed in this study, with the aim of obtaining reliable L-w and R-rs from RAMSES radiometers for turbid and productive waters within coastal and inland water environments. We also briefly show the variation of pure water immersion factors (I-fw) and newly derived I-f on L-w and R-rs for clear and turbid waters. The remnant problems other than the immersion factor coefficients such as transmission, air-water and water-air Fresnel's reflectances are also discussed.

The ocean colour remote sensing has played a significant role in monitoring the turbidity level in marine and inland water bodies. However, algorithms to accurately estimate the turbidity in such optically complex waters are scarce or limited by high level of uncertainty due to various issues. The present study proposes a simple, two band algorithm to estimate turbidity in both turbid and clear waters. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(670)/R-rs(670)+R-rs(555)) represents the proxy of TSS (Total suspended sediment) and therefore, positively correlates to turbidity. The new algorithm is based on the assumption that light reflected in these two vital bands contains the essential information regarding the total suspended matter in the water column. The statistical results showed that the percent mean relative error between the predicted turbidity and the measured turbidity was within +/- 20%. To further demonstrate the robustness of the present algorithm, the spatial grid contours for the measured and the predicted turbidity was generated for the month of January 2014, August 2013 and May 2012 for the coastal waters in Bay of Bengal (Point Calimere, located in the southeast coast of India). The close consistency between the predicted and measured turbidity spatial patterns revealed that the present algorithm can be applied with high confidence to predict turbidity in both coastal and inland waters.

The prime focus of this study is to explore the potential of the fully polarimetric SAR data and analyze the different scattering mechanisms for the oil spilled regions. In this study the fully polarized and orthorectified, L band data of UAVSAR airborne sensor is used which is captured on June 22nd 2010, during which the Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. For the detection of oil spill different decomposition techniques such as Freeman, Yamaguchi and H/A/alpha are studied and classified using Wishart classification. Freeman and Yamaguchi decomposition helped in understanding the type of scattering mechanism taking place in slick covered regions, sea surface and in the presence of ships/rig. A set of polarimetric parameters such as magnitude of correlation coefficient, cross product of co polarized channels, anisotropy, alpha, entropy and the intensity of the coherency matrix are studied which helped in distinguishing the oil spills, sea surface and the look-alikes. The Wishart classification result of Freeman and Yamaguchi decompositions showed more reliable results in comparison to the K-means classification results obtained through segmentation of combined H/A/alpha decomposition. The entropy, anisotropy and magnitude of correlation coefficient are dependent on the angle of incidence. At low incidence angle the entropy value of oil spills are similar to that of the sea surface whereas the magnitude of correlation coefficient which is a function of dielectric constant, increases for oil spills at low incidence angle. The polarimetric parameter, intensity of the coherency matrix utilizes the whole coherency matrix by calculating its determinant and proven to provide good discrimination between the oil spills and the sea surface.

The Source Region of Three Rivers (SRTR), as the birthplace of Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Lancang River, is an important resource of wetlands in China and Asian, which also forms ecological security barrier for China's Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Here the wetlands information was extracted based TM data from 1976 to 2013. The results show that in 2013 the total area of wetlands, including the marsh, lake, river and reservoirs and pond, is 1.47 million hectares, nearly 5% of the whole SRTR. And the area of lake wetland is half of that of the total wetlands, 2.04 times than marsh wetland. From 1976 to 2013, the wetlands in SRTR have experienced a relatively large magnitude and speed of the variance. From the special perspective, the wetlands in the north and south of Yangtze River Basin vary greatly. The substantial reduction of marsh wetland impacts on the whole trend of the wetlands. And the lake wetland changes steady with a small addition, which lessens the magnitude and speed of the variance of the total wetlands area. In 1995 and 2000, with the smallest wetlands areas, the area of marsh wetland is obviously smaller than that of Lake Wetland. The wetlands in Yangtze River basin had been reducing obviously since 2004, while the Yellow River basin increasing. When it comes to the 18 national nature reserves within SRTR, the wetlands' area has a downward trend as the whole region, with significant fluctuation and relatively larger amplitude, especially the marsh wetland here reduces obviously. The change of wetlands' area is one of important indicators for ecological environment. The monitoring results can provide meaningful help and reference for government's decision-making and other researches.																	2380-8039		978-1-5090-1479-8				2016																		WOS:000389576700043

Resource Assessment Methods in the Offshore Wind Energy Sector	FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND FARMS	Green Energy and Technology											Offshore wind industry has experienced a large development over the past decades. Some key factors in the development, sitting and operation of an offshore wind farm include the accurate estimation and forecast of the wind resources and the quantification of the inherent variability in wind power generation. Wind resource estimates are characterized by various degrees of uncertainties that could lead to highly misleading results. Most often, risk-based financial models on which wind project investments are based, are strongly dependent upon these uncertainties, which constitute a barrier for wind energy penetration into the electricity grid. On that account, for a correct and reliable wind power assessment it is of utmost importance to increase the quality and quantity of wind data available. An accurate estimation of wind field is a challenging task that requires reliable sources of data. Offshore meteorological observations from meteorological masts or marine buoys constitute the most commonly used source of data to build energy density maps due to its large reliability. Nevertheless, in situ measures are often sparsely located, not available where the observations are most needed, and have a poor temporal coverage. To overcome these limitations, the wind field may be obtained from a variety of alternative methods available for energy assessment, from satellite remote sensing observations to numerical weather prediction models. This paper gives an overview of the available methods for addressing the wind resource and overall development potential of a candidate site together with a review of the statistical methods to deal with variability and long-term extrapolation of wind speed time series. Finally, the present and future challenges and perspectives are addressed and identified, highlighting the reforms that may be crucial in the forthcoming period.

Tides, discharge strength and the presence of islands control sediments within these four outlets. Sediments are deposited, and form three shoals and two channels. The shoreline and its seabed topography have changed dramatically with increasing human impact. In order to understand the geomorphological evolution of Lingdingyang Bay and its hydrodynamics, we integrated data obtained from two marine environment investigations conducted by the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey (GMGS) in 2003 and in 2012, together with remote sensing multi-temporal images and historical materials, and analysed them using a geographical information system (GIS). The results obtained show that the outlets are becoming narrower; the surface water area of Lingdingyang Bay is diminishing. Meanwhile, the sediment flux is reducing and becoming finer grained because the currents are being blocked by shoals and islands. Some parts of the bay are becoming deeper (27-37 m in the Chuanbi Channel). Correspondingly, the hydrodynamics in the bay are becoming weaker and sediments easier to deposit. Water exchange between the inner and outer sea is decreasing under the influence of unrestricted anthropogenic activities. Lingdingyang Bay should be managed and protected continuously based on a scientific framework: otherwise, it will become narrower and, perhaps, even evolving eventually into a river, which may result in serious futures disasters through flooding and tides.																	0305-8719		978-1-86239-740-8				2016	429						171	184		10.1144/SP429.14								WOS:000388376800011

Science of Autonomy: Time-Optimal Path Planning and Adaptive Sampling for Swarms of Ocean Vehicles	SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF OCEAN ENGINEERING												The science of autonomy is the systematic development of fundamental knowledge about autonomous decision making and task completing in the form of testable autonomous methods, models and systems. In ocean applications, it involves varied disciplines that are not often connected. However, marine autonomy applications are rapidly growing, both in numbers and in complexity. This new paradigm in ocean science and operations motivates the need to carry out interdisciplinary research in the science of autonomy. This chapter reviews some recent results and research directions in time-optimal path planning and optimal adaptive sampling. The aim is to set a basis for a large number of vehicles forming heterogeneous and collaborative underwater swarms that are smart, i.e., knowledgeable about the predicted environment and their uncertainties, and about the predicted effects of autonomous sensing on future operations. The methodologies are generic and applicable to any swarm that moves and senses dynamic environmental fields. However, our focus is underwater path planning and adaptive sampling with a range of vehicles such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), gliders, ships or remote sensing platforms.																			978-3-319-16649-0; 978-3-319-16648-3				2016							481	497			10.1007/978-3-319-16649-0							WOS:000385959700024

An algorithm for assessing reef biodiversity in benthic habitats is presented. The method consists of capturing spectral heterogeneity from hyperspectral images using vector quantization (VQ) method and use the result for prediction of benthic species richness. The results are compared with that of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) method. The validation of the process index is done by comparing the Shannon entropy from actual field data and the Shannon entropy computed from the image. The hyperspectral image corresponds to the marine coastal area of Enrique Reef in La Parguera, Puerto Rico which includes all biological communities associated with the sea floor, from the top of the intertidal zone and inner reaches of estuaries down to the deep sea. This work provides fundamental and basic information on benthic habitats for automating the process of marine biodiversity assessment for remote sensing satellite images.																	2154-4824						2016																		WOS:000386618400002

However, the development and the utilization of the ocean's biological carbon pump are greatly limited because of human's limited knowledge of the ocean. Remote sensing methods have played important roles in understanding and exploring the ocean, and the lidar is one of the most outstanding representatives for its high spatial and temporal resolution, especially the ability of the vertical detection. High-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) employs an ultra-narrow spectral filter to separate scattering signals between particles and water molecules without assuming a lidar ratio, and obtains the optical properties of the ocean with a high accuracy. Nevertheless, the complexity of the seawater causes variable optical properties, which gives huge potentiality to develop the HSRL working at different wavelengths in order to promote the inversion accuracy and increase the detection depth. The field-widened Michelson interferometer (FWMI), whose central transmittance can be tuned to any wavelength, can be employed as the HSRL spectral filter and solve the problem that the operating wavelength of the iodine filter cannot change. Moreover, the FWMI has a very large field of view, which gives its superiority over Fabry-Perot interferometer that is an another popular HSRL filter. The principle of the HSRL based on the FWMI designing for the ocean remote sensing will be presented in detail. Furthermore, the availability of the application of the FWMI influenced by the disturbance of the states of Brillouin scattering is analyzed and the preliminary theory shows that the HSRL instrument basing on FWMI could be employed in the marine remote sensing with a high accuracy.																	0197-7385		978-1-4673-9724-7				2016																		WOS:000386521800401

Whether for scientific sampling and exploration, subsea mining, offshore oil & gas production, or installation and maintenance of marine renewable energy devices, there is a regular and increasing need for intervention to conduct maintenance work or repair failed equipment. As work is conducted in hostile, deep and remote locations where divers cannot be used, the use of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) is commonplace. Despite advances in sensing and machinery, however, significant challenges persist with ROV operations. Inadequate situational awareness, data deluge, and cumbersome operator controls combine to create a technological hurdle that is yet to be overcome. In this work we address the problem of using multiple pilots to collaboratively operate a single robotic system to perform a variety of tasks underwater.

J	Wicaksono, P				Wicaksono, Pramaditya			Improving the accuracy of Multispectral-based benthic habitats mapping using image rotations: the application of Principle Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The low number of water penetration bands in multispectral images limits the maximum descriptive resolution and the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitats maps, especially at higher levels of benthic habitats scheme complexities. This research aimed at improving the accuracy of benthic habitats mapping by exploiting the spectral performance of multispectral images using image rotation techniques, which is very beneficial for fast, accurate, and repeatable mapping. Kemujan Island as part of the Karimunjawa archipelago in Indonesia is selected as the study area. Principle Component Analysis ( PCA) and Independent Component Analysis ( ICA) were applied on Worldview-2 prior to image classification. The inputs for PCA and ICA are deglint bands and water column-corrected bands. Field benthic data collected from photo-transect technique were used to train the rotated datasets in the classification process and to assess the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitat maps. Three levels of benthic habitats classification schemes were constructed based on the variation of benthic habitats insitu, which covers the variations of coral reefs, seagrass, macro algae, and bare substratum. The results show that the application of image rotations on Worldview-2 improves the overall accuracy of benthic habitats mapping and become more effective as the classification scheme complexities increase. In the absence of water column correction, PCA and ICA become the best option to assist benthic habitats mapping.

However, the current algorithms and methods usually fail on optically complex waters like coastal and inland waters. The whole Baltic Sea can be considered as optically complex coastal waters. Remote assessment of water quality parameters (eg., chlorophyll-a concentration) is of interest for monitoring of marine environment, but hasn't been used as a routine approach in Latvia. In this study, two simultaneous hyperspectral airborne data and in situ measurement campaigns were performed in the Gulf of Riga near the River Daugava mouth in summer 2015 to simulate Sentinel-3 data and test existing algorithms for retrieval of Level 2 Water products. Comparison of historical data showed poor overall correlation between in situ measurements and MERIS chlorophyll-a data products. Better correlation between spectral chl-a data products and in situ water sampling measurements was achieved during simultaneous airborne and field campaign resulting in R-2 up to 0.94 for field spectral data, R-2 of 0.78 for airborne data. Test of all two band ratio combinations showed that R-2 could be improved from 0.63 to 0.94 for hyperspectral airborne data choosing 712 and 728 nm bands instead of 709 and 666 nm, and R-2 could be improved from 0.61 to 0.83 for simulated Sentinel-3 OLCI data choosing Oa10 and Oa8 bands instead of Oa11 and Oa8. Repeated campaigns are planned during spring and summer blooms 2016 in the Gulf of Riga to get larger data set for validation and evaluate repeatability. The main challenges remain to acquire as good data as possible within rapidly changing environment and often cloudy weather conditions.

However, human's knowledge about the ocean is greatly limited. Now, in situ, acoustic and remote sensing methods have been applied in the research to understand and explore the ocean. Especially, the lidar is one outstanding remote sensing method for its high spatial and temporal resolution as well as the ability of the vertical detection. High-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) employs an ultra-narrow spectral filter to distinguish scattering signals between particles and water molecules without assuming a lidar ratio and obtains optical properties of the ocean with a high accuracy. Nevertheless, the complexity of the seawater causes variable marine optical properties, which gives huge potentiality to develop a HSRL working at different wavelengths in order to promote the inversion accuracy and increase the detection depth. The field-widened Michelson interferometer (FWMI), whose central transmittance can be tuned to any wavelength and field of view is large, can be employed as the HSRL spectral filter and solves problems that the operating wavelength of the iodine filter is fixed and the field of view of Fabry-Perot interferometer is small. The principle of the HSRL based on the FWMI designing for the ocean remote sensing will be presented in detail. In addition, the availability of the application of the FWMI influenced by the disturbance of the states of Brillouin scattering is analyzed and the preliminary theory shows that the HSRL instrument basing on FWMI could be employed in the marine remote sensing with a high accuracy.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0073-7				2016	9832								UNSP 983214	10.1117/12.2224488								WOS:000385794300030

MODIS-Aqua Data based Detection and Classification of Algal Blooms along the Coast of India using RLS Classifier	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS	Procedia Computer Science				6th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications (ICACC)	SEP 06-08, 2016	Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol, Kochi, INDIA		Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol			In the field of marine biology, researches reveal that there exists a constant increase in Algal bloom (AB) count, along the coast of India. This work aims at detecting and classifying six most frequently appearing algal blooms in this region (viz.: Trichodesmium erythraeum, Noctiluca scintillans/miliaris, Cocholodinium ploykrikoides, Chattonella marina and Karenia mikimotoi blooms). The uniqueness of ocean's optical properties such as remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)) during bloom period serve as the underlying features on whose grounds classification is performed. These parameters are acquired from Aqua/MODIS sensor measurements and Regularized least squares classifier is used in GURLS library for classification. An overall classification accuracy of 94.37% is obtained using both R-rs and nL(w) features, which is superior to the previously conducted studies for monitoring ABs using optical properties of water. Given a MODIS image, a map is developed wherein the pixels with ABs are highlighted and the causative species is recognized. A MODIS image is available every two days and hence frequent generation of AB moitoring maps is possible, which is of great significance in the fisheries industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The objective of the thesis is to develop advanced image processing techniques applied to high resolution remote sensing imagery for the ecosystem conservation. Different pre-processing steps have been applied in order to acquire high quality imagery. The thesis is focused in three ecosystems from Canary Islands where, after an extensive analysis and evaluation, Weighted Wavelet 'a trous' through Fractal Dimension Maps and Fast Intensity Hue Saturation are used in the pansharpening process, then, a RPC model performs the orthorectification and finally, the atmospheric correction is carried out by the 6S algorithm. The final step is to generate marine and terrestrial thematic products using advanced classification techniques for the management of natural resources.																	2166-0727		978-989-98434-6-2				2016																		WOS:000382923300095

A joint program now exists between BSEE and NVESD that addresses these capability gaps in remote sensing of oil spills. Laboratory experiments, calibration techniques, and field tests were performed at Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Santa Barbara, California; and the Ohmsett Test Facility in Leonardo, New Jersey. Weathered crude oils were studied spectroscopically and characterized with LWIR, and low-light-level visible/NIR, and SWIR cameras. We designed and fabricated an oil emulsion thickness calibration cell for spectroscopic analysis and ground truth, field measurements. Digital night vision cameras provided real-time, wide-dynamic-range imagery, and were able to detect and recognize oil from full sun to partial moon light. The LWIR camera provided quantitative oil analysis (identification) for >1 mm thick crude oils both day and night. Two filtered, co-registered, SWIR cameras were used to determine whether oil thickness could be measured in real time. Spectroscopic results revealed that oil emulsions vary with location and weathered state and some oils (e.g., ANS and Santa Barbara seeps) do not show the spectral rich features from archived Deep Water Horizon hyperspectral data. Multi-sensor imagery collected during the 2015 USCG Airborne Oil Spill Remote Sensing & Reporting Exercise and the design of a compact, multiband imager are discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0068-3				2016	9827								UNSP 98270B	10.1117/12.2222064								WOS:000383238700010

Study Method for Quantifying in a Global Scale	REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS ANDALUCES												This research is aimed at quantifying the importance of coastal cities in the world. The study includes a detailed analysis of all cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, from 1945 to the present. Coastal cities have been differentiated from the inland cities. To do this, two sources of information were used: analysis of databases United Nations and Google Earth remote sensing. When these two sources are related, allowing a fairly accurate study of the coastal urban world stage. The vision of this research is dynamic because it pays close attention to the changing nature of urbanization phenomenon in the world's coastlines. The result is of great importance for the Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The increasing number of cities and population in the coastal zone exerts enormous pressure on coastal and marine ecosystems. It is possible that the new scenario that is observed on the coasts of the world also requires new management approaches.																	0212-8594	2340-2776					2016	33	1					64	83		10.12795/rea.2016.i33.04								WOS:000382985300004

In this paper there is described a special approach based on specific approach coming from advanced image analysis method created for the purpose of tracking objects. Unfortunately, object recognition using image analysis involves some level of uncertainty.

Ocean colour opportunities from Meteosat Second and Third Generation geostationary platforms	OCEAN SCIENCE												Ocean colour applications from medium-resolution polar-orbiting satellite sensors have now matured and evolved into operational services. These applications are enabled by the Sentinel-3 OLCI space sensors of the European Earth Observation Copernicus programme and the VIIRS sensors of the US Joint Polar Satellite System programme. Key drivers for the Copernicus ocean colour services are the national obligations of the EU member states to report on the quality of marine, coastal and inland waters for the EU Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Further applications include CO2 sequestration, carbon cycle and climate, fisheries and aquaculture management, near-real-time alerting to harmful algae blooms, environmental monitoring and forecasting, and assessment of sediment transport in coastal waters. Ocean colour data from polar-orbiting satellite platforms, however, suffer from fractional coverage, primarily due to clouds, and inadequate resolution of quickly varying processes. Ocean colour remote sensing from geostationary platforms can provide significant improvements in coverage and sampling frequency and support new applications and services. EUMETSAT's SEVIRI instrument on the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation platforms (MSG) is not designed to meet ocean colour mission requirements, however, it has been demonstrated to provide valuable contribution, particularly in combination with dedicated ocean colour polar observations. This paper describes the ongoing effort to develop operational ocean colour water turbidity and related products and user services from SEVIRI. SEVIRI's multi-temporal capabilities can benefit users requiring improved local-area coverage and frequent diurnal observations. A survey of user requirements and a study of technical capabilities and limitations of the SEVIRI instruments are the basis for this development and are described in this paper. The products will support monitoring of sediment transport, water clarity, and tidal dynamics by providing hourly coverage and long-term time series of the diurnal observations. Further products and services are anticipated from EUMETSAT's FCI instruments on Meteosat Third Generation satellites (MTG), including potential chlorophyll a products.																	1812-0784						2016	12	3					703	713		10.5194/os-12-703-2016								WOS:000379347400006

Here we describe the data compiled for the validation of the ocean-colour products from the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI). The data were acquired from several sources (MOBY, BOUSSOLE, AERONET-OC, SeaBASS, NOMAD, MERMAID, AMT, ICES, HOT, GeP&CO), span between 1997 and 2012, and have a global distribution. Observations of the following variables were compiled: spectral remote-sensing reflectances, concentrations of chlorophyll a, spectral inherent optical properties and spectral diffuse attenuation coefficients. The data were from multi-project archives acquired via the open internet services or from individual projects, acquired directly from data providers. Methodologies were implemented for homogenisation, quality control and merging of all data. No changes were made to the original data, other than averaging of observations that were close in time and space, elimination of some points after quality control and conversion to a standard format. The final result is a merged table designed for validation of satellite-derived ocean-colour products and available in text format. Metadata of each in situ measurement (original source, cruise or experiment, principal investigator) were preserved throughout the work and made available in the final table. Using all the data in a validation exercise increases the number of matchups and enhances the representativeness of different marine regimes. By making available the metadata, it is also possible to analyse each set of data separately. The compiled data are available at doi: 10.1594/PANGAEA.854832 (Valente et al., 2015).

Several available Chl a algorithms were sea-truthed against the largest in situ publicly available Chl a data set ever used for calibration and validation over the Baltic region. To account for the known biogeochemical heterogeneity of the Baltic, matchups were calculated for three separate areas: (1) the Skagerrak and Kattegat, (2) the central Baltic, including the Baltic Proper and the gulfs of Riga and Finland, and (3) the Gulf of Bothnia. Similarly, within the operational context of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) the three areas were also considered as a whole in the analysis. In general, statistics showed low linearity. However, a bootstrapping-like assessment did provide the means for removing the bias from the satellite observations, which were then used to compute basin average time series. Resulting climatologies confirmed that the three regions display completely different Chl a seasonal dynamics. The Gulf of Bothnia displays a single Chl a peak during spring, whereas in the Skagerrak and Kattegat the dynamics are less regular and composed of highs and lows during winter, progressing towards a small bloom in spring and a minimum in summer. In the central Baltic, Chl a follows a dynamics of a mild spring bloom followed by a much stronger bloom in summer. Surface temperature data are able to explain a variable fraction of the intensity of the summer bloom in the central Baltic.																	1812-0784						2016	12	2					379	389		10.5194/os-12-379-2016								WOS:000378176300004

The development of novel methods for the on-line control of cyanobacteria concentration and, moreover, for prediction of bloom spreading is of interest for monitoring the state of ecosystem. Here, we report the results of the joint application of hyperspectral measurements and remote sensing of Curonian Lagoon in July 2015 aimed at the assessment of cyanobacteria communities. We show that hyperspectral data allow on-line detection and qualitative estimation of cyanobacteria concentration, while the remote sensing data indicate the possibility of cyanobacteria bloom detection using the spectral features of upwelling irradiation.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0226-7				2016	9917								99170V	10.1117/12.2239600								WOS:000378215300031

Sea ice cover in Isfjorden and Hornsund, Svalbard (2000-2014) from remote sensing data	CRYOSPHERE												A satellite database including 16 555 satellite images and ice charts displaying the area of Isfjorden, Hornsund, and the Svalbard region has been established with focus on the time period 2000-2014. 3319 manual interpretations of sea ice conditions have been conducted, resulting in two time series dividing the area of Isfjorden and Hornsund into "fast ice" (sea ice attached to the coastline), "drift ice", and "open water". The maximum fast ice coverage of Isfjorden is >40% in the periods 2000-2005 and 2009-2011 and stays <30% in 2006-2008 and 2012-2014. Fast ice cover in Hornsund reaches >40% in all considered years, except for 2012 and 2014, where the maximum stays <20%. The mean seasonal cycles of fast ice in Isfjorden and Hornsund show monthly averaged values of less than 1% between July and November and maxima in March (Isfjorden, 35.7 %) and April (Hornsund, 42.1 %), respectively. A significant reduction of the monthly averaged fast ice coverage is found when comparing the time periods 2000-2005 and 2006-2014. The seasonal maximum decreases from 57.5 to 23.2% in Isfjorden and from 52.6 to 35.2% in Hornsund. A new index, called "days of fast ice" (DFI), is introduced for quantification of the interannual variation of fast ice cover, allowing for comparison between different fjords and winter seasons. Considering the time period from 1 March until end of the sea ice season, the mean DFI values for 2000-2014 are 33.1 +/- 18.2 DFI (Isfjorden) and 42.9 +/- 18.2 DFI (Hornsund). A distinct shift to lower DFI values is observed in 2006. Calculating a mean before and after 2006 yields a decrease from 50 to 22 DFI for Isfjorden and from 56 to 34 DFI for Hornsund. Fast ice coverage generally correlates well with remote-sensing sea surface temperature and in situ air temperature. An increase of autumn ocean heat content is observed during the last few years when the DFI values decrease. The presented sea ice time series can be utilized for various climate effect studies linked to, e.g. glacier dynamics, ocean chemistry, and marine biology.

For decades, traditional remote sensing retrieval methods that rely solely on the spectral intensity of the water-leaving light have provided indicators of marine ecosystem health. As the demand for retrieval accuracy rises, use of the polarized nature of light as an additional remote sensing tool is becoming necessary. For two weeks in December 2015, the NOAA NPP-VIIRS Calibration/Validation cruise continuously observed the polarized radiance of the ocean and the sky using a HyperSAS-POL system. Additionally, a full Stokes imaging polarimetric camera was used to acquire images and videos of the sea surface and sky during stations at coincident angles with HyperSAS-POL. Polarized remote sensing reflectance is computed for all viewing elevations present in the polarization images, and the results are compared to vector radiative transfer calculations.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0094-2				2016	9853								98530O	10.1117/12.2225111								WOS:000377707500018

Oil spill contingency planning is of utmost importance in order to plan for mitigation and remediation of the oceanic oil spill. Remote sensing technologies are used for monitoring the oil spills on the ocean and coastal region. Airborne and satellite sensors such as optical, infrared, ultraviolet, radar and microwave sensors are available for remote surveillance of the ocean. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is used most extensively for oil-spill monitoring because of its capability to operate during day/night and cloud-cover condition. This study detects the possible oil spill regions on fully polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle - Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) images. The UAVSAR image is decomposed using Cloude-Pottier polarimetric decomposition technique to obtain entropy and alpha parameters. In addition, other polarimetric features such as co-polar correlation and degree of polarization are obtained for the UAVSAR images. These features are used to with fuzzy logic based classification to detect oil spill on the SAR images. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0094-2				2016	9853								985310	10.1117/12.2223966								WOS:000377707500029

Comparative analyses about the differences of optical characteristics and composition between riverine and reservoir waters in the second Songhuajiang River tributaries were conducted, and the influencing factors impacting on chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and organic carbon (DOC) were examined based on the absorption properties. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended matter (TSM) were significantly higher in the riverine waters, and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was opposite. The relationship between the CDOM absorption coefficient at specific wavelength and DOC concentration both in the riverine and reservoir waters exhibited a positive correlation (r = 0.90, p< 0.01). The close relationship between Chl-a concentration and CDOM absorption confirmed a small amount of phytoplankton absorption to total absorption in the individual samplings. Analysis of absorption ratio (E-250:365), specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), and spectral slope ratio (S-r) indicated that CDOM in riverine waters had lower aromaricity, molecular weight, and vascular plant contributions than in reservoir waters. Furthermore, non-algal particles played an important role in the total non-water absorption for riverine waters, and CDOM was dominant in the reservoir waters. This indicated that the Yinma River watershed was strongly influenced by the artificial discharge. As a parameter of the bio-optical model, the spectral characteristics of CDOM could help to adjust derived algorithms based on remote sensing and to estimate the dissolved organic carbon flux.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2016	25	3					1061	1073		10.15244/pjoes/61669								WOS:000377240700016

RS techniques are used to perform analysis of water quality in coastal water bodies; to identify, characterize and analyze river plumes; to extract estuarine/coastal sandy bodies; to identify beach features/patterns; and to evaluate the changes and integrity (health) of the coastal lagoon habitats. For effective management of these ecosystems, it is essential to have satellite data available and complementary accurate information about the current state of the coastal regions, in addition to well-informed forecasts about its future state. In recent years, the use of space, air and ground-based RS strategies has allowed for the rapid data collection, Image processing (Pixel-Based and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification) and dissemination of such information to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards, anthropic pressures, and to monitoring essential ecological processes, life support systems and biological diversity.

Satellite based sensors provide a repetitive and synoptic coverage of inaccessible/larger areas which generated a time series database useful in identification and mapping of environment and resources. These databases form a scientific tool for various stakeholders to device suitable strategies for management of coastal and marine resources. This chapter analyses the various applications of satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling on identification and mapping of mangroves, coral reefs, fishing and molluscan grounds in the coastal marine ecosystems with relevant case studies and illustrations. The mapping methods for mangroves explains the classification protocols, advantages in using different remote sensing techniques and the comparison of different mapping techniques. In case of reef mapping, the vulnerability mapping of reefs due to extreme events is also discussed. Fish movement in a dynamic environment and the mapping of these movements with the help of proxy indicators are also detailed. Molluscan mapping is done based on the biomass differences during different seasons and their physical attributes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						105	123		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_4	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800005

Remote Sensing of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation	SEAFLOOR MAPPING ALONG CONTINENTAL SHELVES: RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUALIZING BENTHIC ENVIRONMENTS	Coastal Research Library											Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV), such as eelgrass, provides important ecological functions including food and habitat for ducks, geese, crabs, fish, clams, and other species. SAV also filters out excess nutrients from storm water that runs off into coastal waters, thus improving water quality. Eelgrass meadows can decrease the damaging effects of waves and reduce shoreline erosion. To protect these vital ecosystems, scientists need to monitor coastal vegetation changes as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. New satellites, sensors and data analysis techniques are providing remotely sensed data that are effective for monitoring coastal features and processes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, LiDAR and radar systems are available for mapping coastal marshes, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), coral reefs, beach profiles, water turbidity, chlorophyll concentration and eutrophication. Since coastal ecosystems, such as SAV beds, have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they must be observed with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. New satellites, carrying sensors with fine spatial (0.4-4 m) or spectral (200 narrow bands) resolution are now more accurately detecting changes in salt marsh and SAV extent, health, productivity and habitat quality. Using time-series of images enables scientists to study the health of SAV and other coastal ecosystems and to determine long-term trends and short-term changes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						125	140		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_5	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800006

An 11-year global gridded aerosol optical thickness reanalysis (v1.0) for atmospheric and climate sciences	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												While stand alone satellite and model aerosol products see wide utilization, there is a significant need in numerous atmospheric and climate applications for a fused product on a regular grid. Aerosol data assimilation is an operational reality at numerous centers, and like meteorological reanalyses, aerosol reanalyses will see significant use in the near future. Here we present a standardized 2003-2013 global 1 x 1 degrees and 6-hourly modal aerosol optical thickness (AOT) reanalysis product. This data set can be applied to basic and applied Earth system science studies of significant aerosol events, aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction, and electro-optical propagation and sensor performance, among other uses. This paper describes the science of how to develop and score an aerosol reanalysis product. This reanalysis utilizes a modified Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) at its core and assimilates quality controlled retrievals of AOT from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) on Terra. The aerosol source functions, including dust and smoke, were regionally tuned to obtain the best match between the model fine-and coarse-mode AOTs and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOTs. Other model processes, including deposition, were tuned to minimize the AOT difference between the model and satellite AOT. Aerosol wet deposition in the tropics is driven with satellite-retrieved precipitation, rather than the model field. The final reanalyzed fine-and coarse-mode AOT at 550 nm is shown to have good agreement with AERONET observations, with global mean root mean square error around 0.1 for both fine-and coarse-mode AOTs. This paper includes a discussion of issues particular to aerosol reanalyses that make them distinct from standard meteorological reanalyses, considerations for extending such a reanalysis outside of the NASA A-Train era, and examples of how the aerosol reanalysis can be applied or fused with other model or remote sensing products. Finally, the reanalysis is evaluated in comparison with other available studies of aerosol trends, and the implications of this comparison are discussed.

A sensitivity study of annual area change for Greenland ice sheet marine terminating outlet glaciers: 1999-2013	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The mass flux from marine terminating glacier outlets from the Greenland ice sheet is a significant mass budget term. Yet, glacier calving sensitivity to climate parameters is not well understood. In this study, the front area changes of 42 marine terminating Greenland outlet glaciers were measured annually from 1999 to 2013 using optical satellite imagery. Thirty-five glaciers retreated, while seven remained stable. The average front position change was -240 m a(-1) and the total rate of front area change was -114 km(2) a(-1). The yearly average area changes of all measured glaciers are compared with interannual variations in sea surface temperature (SST), sea-ice concentration (SIC), surface melt, Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface air temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. We find: (1) northwestern glaciers area change have a significant correlation with surface melt and NH land temperature variations; (2) southeastern glaciers have a significant correlation with local SST, SIC and NH temperatures; and (3) southwestern glaciers area change correlate significantly with local SST and NAO index. We conclude that a climate sensitivity signal emerges considering a population of glaciers. Further, we find a significant correlation between the date of minimum extent and glacier latitude. Area change data are available from http://GAC.geus.dk.

We characterized the aerosol optical properties and type in the low and middle troposphere using an automated procedure combining Rayleigh-Mie-Raman lidar (355, 387 and 407aEuro-nm) with depolarization (355aEuro-nm) and AERONET Cimel(A (R)) sun-photometer data. Results show a high variability due to varying dynamical forcing. The mean column-averaged lidar backscatter-to-extinction ratio (BER) was close to 0.024aEuro-sr(-1) (lidar ratio of similar to aEuro parts per thousand 41.7aEuro-sr), with a large dispersion of +/- 33aEuro-% over the whole observation period due to changing atmospheric transport regimes and aerosol sources. The ground-based remote-sensing measurements, coupled with satellite observations, allowed the documentation of (i) dust particles up to 5aEuro-km (above sea level) in altitude originating from Morocco and Algeria from 15 to 18 June with a peak in aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of 0.25aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.05 at 355aEuro-nm, (ii) a long-range transport of biomass burning aerosol (AOTaEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-0.18aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.16) related to North American forest fires detected from 26 to 28 June 2013 by the lidar between 2 and 7aEuro-km and (iii) mixture of local sources including marine aerosol particles and pollution from Spain. During the biomass burning event, the high value of the particle depolarization ratio (8-14aEuro-%) may imply the presence of dust-like particles mixed with the biomass burning aerosols in the mid-troposphere. For the field campaign period, we also show linearity with SEVIRI retrievals of the aerosol optical thickness despite 35aEuro-% relative bias, which is discussed as a function of aerosol type.

For the recent 3 decades, area of the coastal wetland is decreasing and the ecological function is gradually degraded with the rapid development of economy, which restricts the sustainable development of economy and society in the coastal areas of China in turn. It is a major demand of the national reality to carry out the monitoring of coastal wetlands, to master the distribution and dynamic change. UAV, namely unmanned aerial vehicle, is a new platform for remote sensing. Compared with the traditional satellite and manned aerial remote sensing, it has the advantage of flexible implementation, no cloud cover, strong initiative and low cost. Image -spectrum merging is one character of high spectral remote sensing. At the same time of imaging, the spectral curve of each pixel is obtained, which is suitable for quantitative remote sensing, fine classification and target detection. Aimed at the frontier and hotspot of remote sensing monitoring technology, and faced the demand of the coastal wetland monitoring, this paper used UAV and the new remote sensor of high spectral imaging instrument to carry out the analysis of the key technologies of monitoring coastal wetlands by UAV on the basis of the current situation in overseas and domestic and the analysis of developing trend. According to the characteristic of airborne hyperspectral data on UAV, that is "three high and one many", the key technology research that should develop are promoted as follows: 1) the atmosphere correction of the UAV hyperspectral in coastal wetlands under the circumstance of complex underlying surface and variable geometry, 2) the best observation scale and scale transformation method of the UAV platform while monitoring the coastal wetland features, 3) the classification and detection method of typical features with high precision from multi scale hyperspectral images based on time sequence. The research results of this paper will help to break the traditional concept of remote sensing monitoring coastal wetlands by satellite and manned aerial vehicle, lead the trend of this monitoring technology, and put forward a new technical proposal for grasping the distribution of the coastal wetland and the changing trend and carrying out the protection and management of the coastal wetland.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-881-1				2016	9796								UNSP 97962S	10.1117/12.2229746								WOS:000374450700100

Redeinition of cell size classiication of phytoplankton - a potential tool for improving the quality and assurance of data interpretation	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												To date, phytoplankton cell size classiication is based on linear metrics (nano: 2-20 mu m; micro: 20-200 mu m; macro: >200 mu m) although three-dimensional metrics are used for cell or body size descriptions of all terrestrial and aquatic organisms. This study proposes a redeinition of phytoplankton size classiication expressed in terms of cell volume (mu m(3)) metrics by analyzing statistically a data set of 397 species from three major groups of eukaryotic taxa (diatoms, dinolagellates, coccolithophores). The three size classes based on cell volume metrics are nanoplankton (10-10(3) mu m(3)), microplankton (10(3)-10(6) mu m(3)) and macroplankton (10(6)-10(9)mu m(3)). Size spectra of cell volume frequencies, species richness-cell size and cell abundance-cell size relationships were evaluated with the use of cell volume (mu m(3)) metrics while fitting of the relevant equations signiicantly accounted for the data. The analysis of size classes versus taxonomic composition based on cell volume metrics revealed taxonomic group (diatoms, dinolagellates, coccolithophores) differentiations in nano-micro-macro size classes, thus providing an accurate size classiication within and among taxa. This classiication offers more precise information on the taxon-size relationships, which are valuable for phytoplankton community structure studies and useful for further development of the remote sensing models designed for differentiating phytoplankton taxa by satellite.																	1108-393X						2016	17	1					56	64										WOS:000374469200006

Big data opportunities and challenges for assessing multiple stressors across scales in aquatic ecosystems	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Aquatic ecosystems are under threat from multiple stressors, which vary in distribution and intensity across temporal and spatial scales. Monitoring and assessment of these ecosystems have historically focussed on collection of physical and chemical information and increasingly include associated observations on biological condition. However, ecosystem assessment is often lacking because the scale and quality of biological observations frequently fail to match those available from physical and chemical measurements. The advent of high-performance computing, coupled with new earth observation platforms, has accelerated the adoption of molecular and remote sensing tools in ecosystem assessment. To assess how emerging science and tools can be applied to study multiple stressors on a large (ecosystem) scale and to facilitate greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines, a workshop was held on 10-12 September 2014 at the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences, Australia. Here we introduce a conceptual framework for assessing multiple stressors across ecosystems using emerging sources of big data and critique a range of available big-data types that could support models for multiple stressors. We define big data as any set or series of data, which is either so large or complex, it becomes difficult to analyse using traditional data analysis methods.

Overview of the Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment/Aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing on the Mediterranean Climate (ChArMEx/ADRIMED) summer 2013 campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx; http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr) is a collaborative research program federating international activities to investigate Mediterranean regional chemistry-climate interactions. A special observing period (SOP-1a) including intensive airborne measurements was performed in the framework of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region (ADRIMED) project during the Mediterranean dry season over the western and central Mediterranean basins, with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements and their modeling. The SOP-1a took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013. Airborne measurements were made by both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research aircraft operated from Sardinia (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and remote-sensing measurements, respectively, and by sounding and drifting balloons, launched in Minorca. The experimental setup also involved several ground-based measurement sites on islands including two ground-based reference stations in Corsica and Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in Minorca and Sicily. Additional measurements including lidar profiling were also performed on alert during aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS stations at Granada and Barcelona in Spain, and in southern Italy. Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used. Dedicated meso-scale and regional modeling experiments were performed in relation to this observational effort. We provide here an overview of the different surface and aircraft observations deployed during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated modeling studies together with an analysis of the synoptic conditions that determined the aerosol emission and transport. Meteorological conditions observed during this campaign (moderate temperatures and southern flows) were not favorable to producing high levels of atmospheric pollutants or intense biomass burning events in the region. However, numerous mineral dust plumes were observed during the campaign, with the main sources located in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440 nm) over the western and central Mediterranean basins. One important point of this experiment concerns the direct observations of aerosol extinction onboard the ATR-42, using the CAPS system, showing local maxima reaching up to 150Mm(-1) within the dust plume. Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50Mm(-1)) has also been observed within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42 extinction coefficient observations with absorption and scattering measurements, we performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent agreement with estimated optical properties. This additional information on extinction properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering albedo (SSA) with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean. Our results show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530 nm) for all flights studied compared to that reported in the literature on this optical parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in SSA with values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North American smoke particles located above (up to 6-7 km in altitude). Aircraft and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by a large size (> 10 mu m in diameter) within dust plumes. In most of cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging between 5 and 10 mu m, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave (SW) direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been merged and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW instantaneous forcing (up to -90Wm(-2) at noon). Aircraft observations provide also original estimates of the vertical structure of SW and LW radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous values of about 5 degrees K per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of 30 degrees) within the dust layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional climate (RCM) and chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good agreement for simulated AOD compared with observations from the AERONET/PHOTONS network and satellite data, especially for long-range dust transport. Calculations of the 3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an average of about -10 to -20Wm(-2) (for the whole period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima (-50Wm(-2)) over northern Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is shown to be highly variable within the domain, due to moderate absorbing properties of dust and changes in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations indicate negative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive forcing over northern Africa. Finally, a multiyear simulation, performed for the 2003 to 2009 period and including an ocean-atmosphere (O-A) coupling, underlines the impact of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea surface temperature, O-A fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the Mediterranean.

Ecosystem model intercomparison of under-ice and total primary production in the Arctic Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Previous observational studies have found increasing primary production (PP) in response to declining sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, under-ice PP was assessed based on three coupled ice-ocean-ecosystem models participating in the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) project. All models showed good agreement with under-ice measurements of surface chlorophyll-a concentration and vertically integrated PP rates during the main under-ice production period, from mid-May to September. Further, modeled 30-year (1980-2009) mean values and spatial patterns of sea ice concentration compared well with remote sensing data. Under-ice PP was higher in the Arctic shelf seas than in the Arctic Basin, but ratios of under-ice PP over total PP were spatially correlated with annual mean sea ice concentration, with higher ratios in higher ice concentration regions. Decreases in sea ice from 1980 to 2009 were correlated significantly with increases in total PP and decreases in the under-ice PP/total PP ratio for most of the Arctic, but nonsignificantly related to under-ice PP, especially in marginal ice zones. Total PP within the Arctic Circle increased at an annual rate of between 3.2 and 8.0 Tg C/yr from 1980 to 2009. This increase in total PP was due mainly to a PP increase in open water, including increases in both open water area and PP rate per unit area, and therefore much stronger than the changes in under-ice PP. All models suggested that, on a pan-Arctic scale, the fraction of under-ice PP declined with declining sea ice cover over the last three decades.

While advances in remote sensing, integrative modelling and meta-analysis enable generalisations from field observations, there is an underlying need for high-resolution, standardised and geo-referenced field data. Here, we evaluate a new approach aimed at optimising data collection and analysis to assess broad-scale patterns of coral reef community composition using automatically annotated underwater imagery, captured along 2 km transects. We validate this approach by investigating its ability to detect spatial (e.g., across regions) and temporal (e.g., over years) change, and by comparing automated annotation errors to those of multiple human annotators. Our results indicate that change of coral reef benthos can be captured at high resolution both spatially and temporally, with an average error below 5%, among key benthic groups. Cover estimation errors using automated annotation varied between 2% and 12%, slightly larger than human errors (which varied between 1% and 7%), but small enough to detect significant changes among dominant groups. Overall, this approach allows a rapid collection of in-situ observations at larger spatial scales (km) than previously possible, and provides a pathway to link, calibrate, and validate broader analyses across even larger spatial scales (10-10,000 km(2)).

Influence of timing of sea ice retreat on phytoplankton size during marginal ice zone bloom period on the Chukchi and Bering shelves	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The size structure and biomass of a phytoplankton community during the spring bloom period can affect the energy use of higher-trophic-level organisms through the predator-prey body size relationships. The timing of the sea ice retreat (TSR) also plays a crucial role in the seasonally ice-covered marine ecosystem, because it is tightly coupled with the timing of the spring bloom. Thus, it is important to monitor the temporal and spatial distributions of a phytoplankton community size structure. Prior to this study, an ocean colour algorithm was developed to derive phytoplankton size index F-L, which is defined as the ratio of chlorophyll a (chl a) derived from cells larger than 5 mu m to the total chl a, using satellite remote sensing for the Chukchi and Bering shelves. Using this method, we analysed the pixel-by-pixel relationships between F-L during the marginal ice zone (MIZ) bloom period and TSR over the period of 1998-2013. The influences of the TSR on the sea surface temperature (SST) and changes in ocean heat content (Delta OHC) during the MIZ bloom period were also investigated. A significant negative relationship between F-L and the TSR was widely found in the shelf region during the MIZ bloom season. However, we found a significant positive (negative) relationship between the SST (Delta OHC) and TSR. Specifically, an earlier sea ice retreat was associated with the dominance of larger phytoplankton during a colder and weakly stratified MIZ bloom season, suggesting that the duration of the nitrate supply, which is important for the growth of large-sized phytoplankton in this region (i.e. diatoms), can change according to the TSR. In addition, under-ice phytoplankton blooms are likely to occur in years with late ice retreat, because sufficient light for phytoplankton growth can pass through the ice and penetrate into the water columns as a result of an increase in solar radiation toward the summer solstice. Moreover, we found that both the length of the ice-free season and the annual median of F-L positively correlated with the annual net primary production (APP). Thus, both the phytoplankton community composition and growing season are important for the APP in the study area. Our findings showed a quantitative relationship between the interannual variability of F-L, the TSR, and the APP, which suggested that satellite remote sensing of the phytoplankton community size structure is suitable to document the impact of a recent rapid sea ice loss on the ecosystem of the study region.

Quantifying Marine Boundary Layer Water Vapor beneath Low Clouds with Near-Infrared and Microwave Imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study investigates the synergy of collocated microwave radiometry and near-infrared imagery to estimate the marine boundary layer water vapor beneath uniform cloud fields. Microwave radiometry provides the total column water vapor, while the near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor. In combining the two datasets, we apply several flags as well as proximity tests to remove pixels with high clouds and/or intrapixel heterogeneity. Comparisons against radiosonde and ECMWF reanalysis data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. Last, it is shown that the measured AMSR-MODIS boundary layer water vapor can be analyzed using sea surface temperature and cloud-top pressure information by employing simple equations based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.

Projected SST trends across the Caribbean Sea based on PRECIS downscaling of ECHAM4, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The Caribbean Sea and adjacent land areas are highly sensitive to the projected impacts of global climate change. The countries bordering the Caribbean Sea depend heavily on coastal and marine assets as a major source of livelihood support. Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are known to be associated with coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and other phenomena that threaten livelihoods in the region. The paucity of SST systematic observations in both the Caribbean Sea and adjoining Western Atlantic waters is a limiting factor in the projection of future climate change impacts on the region's marine resources. Remote sensing of SST by satellites began only within the last three decades and although the data collected so far might be insufficient to provide conclusive definitions of long-term SST variations in the Caribbean waters, these data along with the output from climate model simulations provide a useful basis for gaining further insights into plausible SST futures under IPCC SRES scenarios. In this paper, we examine the recent SST records from the NESDIS AVHRR satellite data and NOAA Optimum Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature V2 and provide a comparative analysis of projected SST changes for the Caribbean Sea up to the end of the twenty-first century, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios' simulations of the sea surface skin temperatures (SSsT) using the Hadley Centre's regional model, PRECIS. The implications of these projected SST changes for bleaching of coral reefs, one of the region's most valuable marine resource, and for rainfall are also discussed.																	0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2016	123	1-2					199	215		10.1007/s00704-014-1346-1								WOS:000368715000016

Toward an Efficient and Comprehensive Assessment of Marine Sediments Through Combining Hydrographic Surveying and Geoacoustic Inversion	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												Acoustic remote sensing techniques are an attractive means for obtaining information on the composition of marine sediments since they have high coverage capabilities and thus allow for efficient surveying. Operating at a wide range of specific frequencies, the acoustic sensors provide insight into the sediment body at different depths. This article suggests an efficient manner to combine high-and low-frequency acoustics for obtaining a comprehensive description of fine-grained sediments in a shallow water environment, as was aimed at by the Maritime Rapid Environmental Assessment/Blue Planet trial (MREA/BP'07). This trial was carried out in the Mediterranean Sea in 2007, employing a variety of acoustic sensors, including echosounders, seismic systems, and dedicated array configurations. In a previous paper (Siemes et al., IEEE J. Ocean. Eng. vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 766-778), we established a three-dimensional picture of the sediment distribution in the MREA/BP'07 area by associating high-frequency echosounder data with low-frequency seismics. A classification based solely on these hydrographic measurements, however, could not provide the physical properties of the near-surface sediments. In the current article we complement this environmental picture with results from a geoacoustic inversion effort, which do provide information on the actual physical properties, such as sound speed, density, attenuation, and layer thickness. In contrast to carrying out the inversion over the complete area, only a limited number of locations was selected for inversion, to limit the computational efforts. This selection was based on the hydrographic environmental picture obtained in (Siemes et al., IEEE J. Ocean. Eng. vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 766-778). Inverted sediment properties obtained within similar hydrographic regions confirm the similarity in sediment type among these regions, whereas differences in sediment properties between different hydrographic regions are confirmed as well. Variations in the inversion results within an area with a single sediment type could be attributed to the presence of gas. These results show the suitability of the proposed approach, where backscatter and seismic data discern areas that a priori would differ in their near-surface sediment properties and where geoacoustic inversion assigns actual sediment parameters to these different areas.																	0364-9059	1558-1691				JAN	2016	41	1					190	203		10.1109/JOE.2015.2410871								WOS:000368394400018

The models were based on cell density (N) dependent parameterizations of the spectral backscattering coefficients, b(b) (lambda), obtained from in situ measurements. There was a strong relationship between b(b) (lambda) and N, with a minimum regression coefficient of 0.97 at 488 nm and a maximum value of 0.98 at other bands. The cell density calculated by the multiband inversion model was similar to the field measurements of the coastal waters (the average relative error was only 8.9%), but it could not accurately discern the red tide from mixed pixels, and this led to overestimation of the area affected by the red tide. While the single-band inversion model is less precise than the former model in the high chlorophyll water, it could eliminate the impact of the suspended sediments and make more accurate estimates of the red tide area. We concluded that the two models both have advantages and disadvantages; these methods lay the foundation for developing a remote sensing forecasting system for red tides.																	1687-9309	1687-9317					2016									1780986	10.1155/2016/1780986								WOS:000367969700001

Classification of Continental Shelves in Terms of Geospatially Integrated Physiographic Realms and Morphodynamic Zones	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The continental shelf off southeast Florida contains a range of benthic environments that are discernible via remote sensing platforms because of low turbidity in the water column. Using the Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS), physiographic realms and associated morphodynamic zones were cognitively interpreted and classified at a nominal scale of 1:6000 across four remote sensing platforms (i.e. GeoEye IKONOS-2, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper UK, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper [ETM], and National Agriculture Imagery Program [NAIP] high-resolution aerial orthoimagery). Attribute tables were created in conjunction with interpretations to quantify and compare spatial relationships between classificatory units and the different remote sensing platforms. Resultant maps exported from ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software showed that while IKONOS-2 satellite imagery and NAIP aerial orthoimagery provided the greatest detail, classification of physiographic realms and morphodynamic zones was still possible using TM and ETM satellite images. Overall, it was determined that IKONOS-2 provided the most beneficial imagery when applying such a classification of coastal and seafloor features. It is postulated that accurate delineation of physiographic realms and morphodynamic zones can provide a foundation for more in-depth biogeomorpholocial classification (e.g., further subdivision into benthic geoforms, coastal landforms, biological cover) along continental shelves.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2016	32	1					1	34		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15A-00003.1								WOS:000368221800001

However, fewer categories of water quality parameters can be monitored by remote sensing technology than the 35 specified in GB3097-1997 Marine Water Quality Standard. Therefore, we considered which parameters must be selected by remote sensing and how to model for water quality evaluation using the finite parameters. In this paper, focused on Leizhou Peninsula nearshore waters, we found N, P, COD, PH and DO to be the dominant parameters of water quality by analyzing measured data. Then, mathematical statistics was used to determine that the relationship among the five parameters was COD > DO > P > N > pH. Finally, five-parameter, fourparameter and three-parameter water quality evaluation models were established and compared. The results showed that COD, DO, P and N were the necessary parameters for remote sensing evaluation of the Leizhou Peninsula nearshore water quality, and the optimal comprehensive water quality evaluation model was the fourparameter model. This work may serve as a reference for monitoring the quality of other marine waters by remote sensing.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JAN	2016	35	1					114	117		10.1007/s13131-016-0802-4								WOS:000367846500014

It is also important to convert the measured radiances to the nadir direction when comparing and merging products from different satellite missions. The standard correction method developed by Morel and coworkers requires knowledge of the chlorophyll concentration. Also, the standard method was developed based on the Case 1 (open ocean) assumption, which makes it unsuitable for Case 2 situations such as turbid coastal waters. We introduce a neural network method to convert the angle-dependent water-leaving radiance (or the corresponding remote sensing reflectance) from the observation direction to the nadir direction. This method relies on neither an "atmospheric correction" nor prior knowledge of the water constituents or the inherent optical properties. It directly converts the remote sensing reflectance from an arbitrary slanted viewing direction to the nadir direction by using a trained neural network. This method is fast and accurate, and it can be easily adapted to different remote sensing instruments. Validation using NuRADS measurements in different types of water shows that this method is suitable for both Case 1 and Case 2 waters. In Case 1 or chlorophyll-dominated waters, our neural network method produces corrections similar to those of the standard method. In Case 2 waters, especially sediment-dominated waters, a significant improvement was obtained compared to the standard method.

A temporal waterline approach to mapping intertidal areas using X-band marine radar	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Mapping the morphology of intertidal areas is a logistically challenging, time consuming and expensive task due to their large expanse and difficulties associated with access. A technique is presented here that uses standard marine navigational radar operating at X-band frequency. The method uses a series of time-exposure radar images over the course of a two-week tidal cycle to identify the elevation of the wetting and drying transitions at each pixel in the radar images, thereby building up a morphological map of the target intertidal area. This "Temporal Waterline" method is applied to a dataset acquired from Hilbre Island at the mouth of the Dee Estuary, UK, spanning March 2006 to January 2007. The radar gathered data with a radial range of 4 km and the resulting elevation maps describe the intertidal regions of that area. The results are compared with airborne LiDAR data surveyed over the same area and within the radar survey time period. The residual differences show good agreement across large areas of beach and sandbanks, with concentrations of poor estimations around points that are shadowed from the radar or likely to suffer from pooling water.

J	Sun, SJ; Hu, CM; Tunnel, JW				Sun, Shaojie; Hu, Chuanmin; Tunnel, John W., Jr.			Surface oil footprint and trajectory of the Ixtoc-I oil spill determined from Landsat/MSS and CZCS observations	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The Ixtoc-I oil spill occurred in 1979 in shallow waters (50 m) of the Bay of Campeche, Mexico. Although it is known that a large portion of the released oil from this second largest accidental marine oil spill in history reached the surface, to date there has been no attempt to document the surface footprint and trajectory of the released oil. Our study attempts to fill this knowledge gap using remote sensing data collected by Landsat/MSS and CZCS. Both showed the same general patterns of oil trajectory to the northwest and north, nearly parallel to the coastline of the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) with possible oil landing on Mexican and Texas beaches. Field observations at selected beaches and islands along the coast of the western and southern GoM during and after the spill confirmed these satellite-based findings, which were also used to help in planning a recent field campaign to collect sediment samples in the southern GoM.

Our goal was to assess to what extent variation in composition could be explained by habitat and water quality variables. The habitat variables consisted of depth, substrate type and scleractinian coral cover while water quality variables were derived from ocean color satellite imagery, including the colored dissolved organic matter index (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chlor-a) and remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm (Rrs_645). Together, habitat and water quality variables explained from 31% (sediment bacteria) to 80% (forams) of the variation in composition. The variation in composition of corals, sponges, forams and sediment archaea was primarily related to habitat variables, while the variation in composition of sediment bacteria was primarily related to water quality variables. Habitat and water quality variables explained similar amounts of variation in the composition of corals and sediment bacteria. CDOM (sponges, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea), Chlor-a (corals and forams) and Rrs_645 (sponges and forams) proved significant predictors of variation in composition for the studied taxa. In addition to water quality variables, all taxa responded to a range of habitat variables including depth and the percentage cover of various benthic life forms including coral cover variables, rubble and sand. Sand cover was the most important habitat variable for corals, sponges, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea. Coral life forms including the cover of branching and tabular corals were important habitat variables for sponges and forams. These results show marked differences in how various taxa respond to variation in habitat and water quality in the Spermonde Archipelago. Moreover, our results indicate that variables estimated from ocean color satellite imagery proved to be better predictors of variation in marine community composition than commonly-used proxies such as the distance offshore or distance to the nearest river.

The primary application of scatterometry is the measurement of near-surface ocean winds. By combining sigma degrees measurements from different azimuth angles, the 10 m vector wind can be determined through a Geophysical Model Function (GMF), which relates wind and backscatter. This paper proposes a mission concept for the measurement of both oceanic winds and surface currents, which makes full use of earlier C-band radar remote sensing experience. For the determination of ocean currents, in particular, the novel idea of using two chirps of opposite slope is introduced. The fundamental processing steps required to retrieve surface currents are given together with their associated accuracies. A detailed description of the mission proposal and comparisons between real and retrieved surface currents are presented. The proposed ocean Doppler scatterometer can be used to generate global surface ocean current maps with accuracies better than 0.2 m/s at a spatial resolution better than 25 km (i.e., 12.5 km spatial sampling) on a daily basis. These maps will allow gaining some insights on the upper ocean mesoscale dynamics. The work lies at a frontier, given that the present inability to measure ocean currents from space in a consistent and synoptic manner represents one of the greatest weaknesses in ocean remote sensing.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC	2015	120	12					7857	7879		10.1002/2015JC011011								WOS:000369153200009						
J	Bushinsky, SM; Emerson, S				Bushinsky, Seth M.; Emerson, Steven			Marine biological production from in situ oxygen measurements on a profiling float in the subarctic Pacific Ocean	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Evaluating the organic carbon flux from the surface ocean to the interior (the marine biological pump) is essential for predictions of ocean carbon cycle feedback to climate change. One approach for determining these fluxes is to measure the concentration of oxygen in the upper ocean over a seasonal cycle, calculate the net O-2 flux using an upper ocean model, and then use a stoichiometric relationship between oxygen evolved and organic carbon produced. Applying this tracer in a variety of ocean areas over seasonal cycles requires accurate O-2 measurements on autonomous vehicles. Here we demonstrate this approach using an O-2 sensor on a profiling float that is periodically calibrated against atmospheric pO(2). Using accurate data and a model that includes all physical and biological processes influencing oxygen, we determine an annual net community production of 0.7 +/- 0.5 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) in the northeast Pacific Ocean (50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) from June 2012 to June 2013. There is a strong seasonal cycle in net biological oxygen production with wintertime fluxes caused by bubble processes critical to determining the annual flux. Approximately 50% of net autotrophic production during summer months is consumed by net respiration during the winter. The result is a biological pump in the subarctic Pacific Ocean that is less than that determined by similar methods in the subtropics to the south. This estimate is significantly lower than that predicted by satellite remote sensing and global circulation models.

With polar bears (Ursus maritimus), the technique has only proven effective on landscapes with little topographic relief that are devoid of snow and ice, and time-consuming manual review of imagery is required to identify bears. Here, we evaluated mechanisms to further develop methods for satellite imagery by examining data from Rowley Island, Canada. We attempted to automate and expedite detection via a supervised spectral classification and image differencing to expedite image review. We also assessed what proportion of a region should be sampled to obtain reliable estimates of density and abundance. Although the spectral signature of polar bears differed from nontarget objects, these differences were insufficient to yield useful results via a supervised classification process. Conversely, automated image differencing-or subtracting one image from another-correctly identified nearly 90% of polar bear locations. This technique, however, also yielded false positives, suggesting that manual review will still be required to confirm polar bear locations. On Rowley Island, bear distribution approximated a Poisson distribution across a range of plot sizes, and resampling suggests that sampling >50% of the site facilitates reliable estimation of density (CV <15%). Satellite imagery may be an effective monitoring tool in certain areas, but large-scale applications remain limited because of the challenges in automation and the limited environments in which the method can be effectively applied. Improvements in resolution may expand opportunities for its future uses.

Implication of regionalization and connectivity analysis for marine spatial planning and coastal management in the Gulf of Cadiz and Alboran Sea	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												This work proposes a regionalization of marine waters south of the Iberian Peninsula, north Morocco and Algeria based on empirical orthogonal functions and GIS analysis. The regions identified are consistent and correspond to hydrological mesoscale and macroscale structures well characterized from physical and biological viewpoints. Although it is difficult to determine the boundaries of a fluid continuously moving, the procedure used recognizes the most frequent patterns and can be used to geographically reference the most likely position of the limit among the regions. Once established the regions, the connectivity among them is addressed by means of geostrophic currents derived from altimetry data. The main geostrophic circulation pattern depict an elevated connectivity in the area that might facilitate the conservation and recovery of species, but also imply a higher vulnerability to negative external forces and highlight the need of models, marine spatial planning, and coastal management approaches that include the pelagic ecosystem and connectivity of the seas. Furthermore, the results confirm that the cooperation between public authorities at different levels (local, regional, state) as well as among coastal countries is essential for Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and prevention of potential risk derived from upcoming marine activities in the framework of the 2020 Agenda and Blue Growth Strategy (European Commission, 2012). The recently approved Directive for Marine Spatial Planning and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (European Commission, 2013), with the objective to avoid conflicts among diverse users and guarantees stable environment and sustainable growth, requiring information concerning regionalization and connectivity in the sea, but this information is not always available in all regions, space and time scales. Our approach offers a cheap, fast and universal applicable methodology for mesoscale regionalization and connectivity estimation as a starting point of a nested MSP approach until further detailed oceanographic studies can be carried out at the most interesting points identified in the respective area considered in the MSP.

J	Saul, S; Purkis, S				Saul, Steven; Purkis, Sam			Semi-Automated Object-Based Classification of Coral Reef Habitat using Discrete Choice Models	REMOTE SENSING												As for terrestrial remote sensing, pixel-based classifiers have traditionally been used to map coral reef habitats. For pixel-based classifiers, habitat assignment is based on the spectral or textural properties of each individual pixel in the scene. More recently, however, object-based classifications, those based on information from a set of contiguous pixels with similar properties, have found favor with the reef mapping community and are starting to be extensively deployed. Object-based classifiers have an advantage over pixel-based in that they are less compromised by the inevitable inhomogeneity in per-pixel spectral response caused, primarily, by variations in water depth. One aspect of the object-based classification workflow is the assignment of each image object to a habitat class on the basis of its spectral, textural, or geometric properties. While a skilled image interpreter can achieve this task accurately through manual editing, full or partial automation is desirable for large-scale reef mapping projects of the magnitude which are useful for marine spatial planning. To this end, this paper trials the use of multinomial logistic discrete choice models to classify coral reef habitats identified through object-based segmentation of satellite imagery. Our results suggest that these models can attain assignment accuracies of about 85%, while also reducing the time needed to produce the map, as compared to manual methods. Limitations of this approach include misclassification of image objects at the interface between some habitat types due to the soft gradation in nature between habitats, the robustness of the segmentation algorithm used, and the selection of a strong training dataset. Finally, due to the probabilistic nature of multinomial logistic models, the analyst can estimate a map of uncertainty associated with the habitat classifications. Quantifying uncertainty is important to the end-user when developing marine spatial planning scenarios and populating spatial models from reef habitat maps.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					15894	15916		10.3390/rs71215810								WOS:000367534000005

Derivation of High-Resolution Bathymetry from Multispectral Satellite Imagery: A Comparison of Empirical and Optimisation Methods through Geographical Error Analysis	REMOTE SENSING												The high importance of bathymetric character for many processes on reefs means that high-resolution bathymetric models are commonly needed by marine scientists and coastal managers. Empirical and optimisation methods provide two approaches for deriving bathymetry from multispectral satellite imagery, which have been refined and widely applied to coral reefs over the last decade. This paper compares these two approaches by means of a geographical error analysis for two sites on the Great Barrier Reef: Lizard Island (a continental island fringing reef) and Sykes Reef (a planar platform reef). The geographical distributions of model residuals (i.e., the difference between modelled and measured water depths) are mapped, and their spatial autocorrelation is calculated as a basis for comparing the performance of the bathymetric models. Comparisons reveal consistent geographical properties of errors arising from both models, including the tendency for positive residuals (i.e., an under-prediction of depth) in shallower areas and negative residuals in deeper areas (i.e., an over-prediction of depth) and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in model errors. A spatial error model is used to generate more reliable estimates of bathymetry by quantifying the spatial structure (autocorrelation) of model error and incorporating this into an improved regression model. Spatial error models improve bathymetric estimates derived from both methods.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16257	16273		10.3390/rs71215829								WOS:000367534000024						
J	Al-Habashneh, AA; Moloney, C; Gill, EW; Huang, WM				Al-Habashneh, Al-Abbass; Moloney, Cecilia; Gill, Eric W.; Huang, Weimin			An Adaptive Method of Wave Spectrum Estimation Using X-Band Nautical Radar	REMOTE SENSING												In this paper, the dependency of wave spectrum estimation on the analysis window orientation for X-band marine radar data is investigated. The investigation is made for the case where both wind wave and swell components are present. Our results show that more accurate and reliable wave spectrum estimates are obtained when one analysis window for each component (wind waves or swell) is used and is oriented in the up-wave direction of that component. The final wave spectrum estimation is found by averaging the output of those analysis windows. Since the direction of wind waves and swell is not known a priori, a new method is proposed to recursively determine the number and orientation of analysis windows. This method is referred to as the Adaptive Recursive Positioning Method (ARPM). For validation, ocean wave spectra are estimated from X-band marine radar field data using the ARPM and the standard method, using uniformly distributed analysis windows. The results from both methods are compared to ground truth wave spectra acquired using waverider buoy data. Results have shown that the ARPM produces a 10% improvement in the agreement (represented by the correlation coefficient) between the ground truth wave spectrum and the marine radar estimated wave spectrum. This improvement is reflected in a 5% to 30% accuracy enhancement in the wave period estimation and in peak wave direction. The ARPM not only increases the accuracy of wave period and direction estimation, but it also increases the method's reliability by producing a lower error standard deviation. Although these improvements are at the price of extra computational time, it has been found that this overhead is acceptable since it is far from the upper bound that requires offline analysis.

Despite the existence of very high-resolution remote sensing technology for nearly two decades, comprehensive assessment of coral reef habitats at national to regional spatial scales and at very high spatial resolution is still scarce. Here, we develop benthic habitat maps at a sub-national scale by analyzing large multispectral QuickBird imagery dataset covering similar to 686 km(2) of the main shallow coral fringing reef along the southern border with Tanzania (4.68 degrees S, 39.18 degrees E) to the reef end at Malindi, Kenya (3.2 degrees S, 40.1 degrees E). Mapping was conducted with a user approach constrained by ground-truth data, with detailed transect lines from the shore to the fore reef. First, maps were used to evaluate the present management system's effectiveness at representing habitat diversity. Then, we developed three spatial prioritization scenarios based on differing objectives: (i) minimize lost fishing opportunity; (ii) redistribute fisheries away from currently overfished reefs; and (iii) minimize resource use conflicts. We further constrained the priority area in each prioritization selection scenario based on optionally protecting the least or the most climate exposed locations using a model of exposure to climate stress. We discovered that spatial priorities were very different based on the different objectives and on whether the aim was to protect the least or most climate-exposed habitats. Our analyses provide a spatially explicit foundation for large-scale conservation and management strategies that can account for ecosystem service benefits.

Remote sensing applications have progressed significantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantified. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1-6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1% coefficient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10% CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1-3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8% and 37%. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.

Estimation of primary production in the Arctic Ocean using ocean colour remote sensing and coupled physical-biological models: Strengths, limitations and how they compare	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Over the last decade, several studies have reported a significant increase in marine primary production of the Arctic Ocean due mainly to a decrease in the extent of the icepack. Given the lack of in situ measurements, these studies were either based on prognostic models that use time series of remote sensing measurements of clouds, ice concentration and, most importantly, phytoplankton biomass at ocean surface (ocean colour remote sensing, OCRS), and coupled physical-biological ice-ocean (CPBO) dynamic models. In this paper, we review the strengths and limitations of these two approaches when applied in the Arctic Ocean. More specifically, we examine how they compare in terms of phytoplankton growth modelling and parameterisation, including relative to the current literature on measured Arctic phytoplankton growth parameters.

Although frequent enough to have been observed by Darwin, blooms of M. rubrum are notoriously difficult to quantify because M. rubrum can aggregate into massive clouds of rusty-red water in a very short time due to its high growth rates and rapid swimming behavior and can disaggregate just as quickly by vertical or horizontal dispersion. A September 2012 hyperspectral image from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean sensor aboard the International Space Station captured a dense red tide of M. rubrum (10(6) cells per liter) in surface waters of western Long Island Sound. Genetic data confirmed the identity of the chloroplast as a cryptophyte that was actively photosynthesizing. Microscopy indicated extremely high abundance of its yellow fluorescing signature pigment phycoerythrin. Spectral absorption and fluorescence features were related to ancillary photosynthetic pigments unique to this organism that cannot be observed with traditional satellites. Cell abundance was estimated at a resolution of 100 m using an algorithm based on the distinctive yellow fluorescence of phycoerythrin. Future development of hyperspectral satellites will allow for better enumeration of bloom-forming coastal plankton, the associated physical mechanisms, and contributions to marine productivity.

A Simple Model for Marine Radar Images of the Ocean Surface	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												This letter describes a simple model for the backscattered signal received from the ocean surface by a horizontal-polarization marine radar operating at low grazing angles, including the effects of the logarithmic amplifiers conventionally used in these radars. Shadowing is accounted for via geometric optics. The range dependence of the mean radar signal predicted by this model compares well with that observed in two marine radar data sets collected under different environmental conditions. The model also indicates that the radar signal modulation ( the deviation from the mean normalized by the mean) is proportional to the radial component of the surface slope in unshadowed regions. This suggests the possibility of direct quantitative wave observations using marine radar modulation data, without the need for calibration.

In order to examine their potential as an indicator of local variation in sea surface temperature (SST), we collected 70 surface sediments from the Chinese coastal seas (CCSs), including 16 from the Yangtze Estuary, to determine their tetraether lipid composition. The proportion of OH-GDGTs relative to total isoprenoid GDGTs increased with latitude from 1.8% to 12.8% and correlated strongly with SST, as indicated from redundancy analysis. The variation in OH-GDGT composition was best captured by the weighted average number of cyclopentane moieties in OH-GDGT-1 and -2 (RI-OH), which correlated significantly with both summer and autumn SST and was associated with minimum residual SST relative to remote sensing data. The large input of terrigenous organic matter to the Yangtze Estuary appears to have no significant influence on the OH-GDGT based proxy. Our study suggests that RI-OH could serve as a useful proxy for recording warm seasonal SST in the CCSs. A global surface sediment compilation further indicates that RI-OH and its derivative, RI-OH', which additionally contains OH-GDGT-0, may be used to estimate SST in warm (ca. > 15 degrees C annual mean SST) and cold (ca. < 15 degrees C) environments, respectively.

J	Jung, R; Adolph, W; Ehlers, M; Farke, H				Jung, Richard; Adolph, Winny; Ehlers, Manfred; Farke, Hubert			A multi-sensor approach for detecting the different land covers of tidal flats in the German Wadden Sea - A case study at Norderney	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The tidal flats of the Wadden Sea are a highly dynamic and largely natural ecosystem with high economic and ecological value but which are also at risk due to climate change, rising sea levels, algae blooms, invasive species and marine pollution. There is a need for the detection of emerging changes and the potential loss of the natural or semi-natural ecosystems accompanied by a decrease in water quality. Accessibility both from sea and land is very poor, which makes the monitoring and mapping of tidal flat environments from in situ measurements very difficult In this study, a multi-sensor concept for the classification of intertidal areas in the Wadden Sea is developed. The basis for this method is a combined analysis involving RapidEye (RE) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite data combined with ancillary vector data about the distribution of vegetation, shellfish beds and sediments for the accuracy assessment The overall methodology is based on a hierarchical decision tree. First, the water coverage is separated from the tidal flats by using the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Second, the shellfish beds are estimated with the textural features of the TSX data and morphologic filters (MFs). Third, the classification of vegetation (salt marsh, sea grass/algae) is based on the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), object-based features and exclusionary criteria. The remaining area is then separated into different sediment types with an algorithm that uses a thresholding technique applied to radiometric values, the MSAVI and a majority filter. The results show that we are able to identify the location and shape of salt marsh and shellfish beds (a true positive rate of 0.63 and a precision of 0.55) by using multi-sensor remote sensing data. A detailed shellfish bed classification can only be done with radar sensors, like TSX. The extraction of the sea grass areas from the multi-sensor approach is difficult Sea grass often grows very sparsely in the study area which, with respect to the spatial resolution of RE, leads to a mixture of the spectral signatures of sediment and sea grass. The classification of the sediment types in tidal flats is a challenge compared to vegetation and shellfish beds. An overall accuracy of 64.53%, 66.85%, 68.22% and 68.2% was achieved. The results emphasize that a sediment-type classification cannot be achieved with high accuracy using spectral properties alone due to their similarity, which is predominately caused by their water content.

Atmospheric Wake of Madeira: First Aerial Observations and Numerical Simulations	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The island of Madeira is well known for giving rise to atmospheric wakes. Strong and unsteady atmospheric wakes, resembling a von Karman vortex street, are frequently observed in satellite images leeward of Madeira, especially during summer months, when conditions favoring the formation of atmospheric wakes occur frequently under the influence of the Azores high.Reported here is the analysis of the first airborne measurements of Madeira's wake collected during the 2010 Island-induced Wake (I-WAKE) campaign. High-resolution in situ and remote sensing data were collected in the I-WAKE by a research aircraft. The measurements reveal distinctive wake signatures, including strong lateral wind shear zones and warm and dry eddies downwind of the island. A strong anticorrelation of the horizontal wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST) was found within the wake.High-resolution numerical simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model were used to study the dynamics of the wake generation and its temporal evolution. The comparison of the model results and observations reveals a remarkable fidelity of the simulated wake features within the marine boundary layer (MBL). Strong potential vorticity (PV) anomalies were found in the simulated MBL wake, emanating from the flanks of the island. The response of the wake formation within the MBL to surface friction and enhanced thermal forcing is explored through the model sensitivity analyses.

The tectonic stress field is crucial to the study of tectonics, engineering, marine geology, seismology and the exploration of marine resources. In the exploration of marine resources, it is often necessary to study the mechanics and deformations of the rock in the oceanic crust. An iso-elevation line map of the fold's structural layer is a basic way to indicate the features and shapes of the fold, which is more important - especially in the field of exploratory marine petroleum engineering. To draw this map, though, requires a great deal of data, for structural profiles and drilling. It is very difficult to obtain these data, especially in mountainous regions or areas where mineral exploration has recently begun. This greatly limits the progress of marine exploratory engineering. In this paper, the author proposes a new theory and method for calculating the structural stress field using the composite quantitative data of remote sensing information on circular structures and related linear structures, in order to approximate the iso-elevation line map of local structures on the basis of the phase-separation analysis of remote sensing information field and the theory of elastic mechanics. The theory and method have been practically applied in many tested areas, and its effects are remarkable.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	2015					73		448	452		10.2112/SI73-079.1								WOS:000351538400080

These pigments usually vary in presence and concentration and influence the spectral characteristics of corals. We studied the variations in pigment composition among seven Caribbean shallow-water Scleractinian corals by means of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to further resolve the discrimination of corals. We found a total of 27 different pigments among the coral species, including some alteration products of the main pigments. Additionally, pigments typically found in endolithic algae were also identified. A Principal Components Analysis and a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed the separation of coral species based on pigment composition. All the corals were collected under the same physical environmental conditions. This suggests that pigment in the coral's symbionts might be more genetically-determined than influenced by prevailing physical conditions of the reef. We further investigated the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) as a tool for estimating the total pigment concentration of reef corals. Depending on the coral species, the Rrs and the total symbiont pigment concentration per coral tissue area correlation showed 79.5-98.5% confidence levels demonstrating its use as a non-invasive robust technique to estimate pigment concentration in studies of coral reef biodiversity and health.																	1932-6203					NOV 30	2015	10	11							e0143709	10.1371/journal.pone.0143709								WOS:000365889800059	26619210					
J	Zhu, XY; Li, Y; Feng, HY; Liu, BX; Xu, J				Zhu, Xueyuan; Li, Ying; Feng, Haiyang; Liu, Bingxin; Xu, Jin			Oil spill detection method using X-band marine radar imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												A viable method to implement oil spill detection and monitoring based on marine radar is proposed. The primary data of this study are obtained from the X-band marine radar of the teaching-training ship, YUKUN, of the Dalian Maritime University on July 21, 2010, when a pipeline burst and an oil spill accident occurred at the Xingang Port in Dalian. Aiming at the working characteristics of marine radar, the adaptive median filter algorithm is improved to eliminate the radar shared-frequency interference by adding the identification of noise points and resetting the neighborhood window. A power attenuation correction method is proposed to solve the uneven distribution in resolution and echo intensity by acquiring the average power distribution of radar images simultaneously. Oil spill will be easily detected from different sea backgrounds after morphological processing, gray segmentation, and image smoothing. Comparison with the images extracted from a thermal infrared sensor on the same monitoring point demonstrates the validity of the extraction method for oil spill based on X-band marine radar.

While remote sensing and open water sampling already described the physical nature of this upwelling, the spatial and temporal effects on key parameters and processes in the water column have not been investigated yet, although being highly relevant for coral reef functioning. The present study investigated a range of water parameters on two coral reefs with different exposure to upwelling (Matapalo and Bajo Rojo) in a weekly to monthly resolution over one year (May 2013 to April 2014). Based on air temperature, wind speed and water temperature, three time clusters were defined: a) May to November 2013 without upwelling, b) December 2013 to April 2014 with moderate upwelling, punctuated by c) extreme upwelling events in February, March and April 2014. During upwelling peaks, water temperatures decreased by 7 degrees C (Matapalo) and 9 degrees C (Bajo Rojo) to minima of 20.1 and 15.3 degrees C respectively, while phosphate, ammonia and nitrate concentrations increased 3 to 15-fold to maxima of 1.3 mu mol PO43- L-1, 3.0 mu mol NH4+ L-1 and 9.7 mu mol NO3- L-1. This increased availability of nutrients triggered several successive phytoplankton blooms as indicated by 3-(Matapalo) and 6-fold (Bajo Rojo) increases in chlorophyll a concentrations. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON) increased by 40 and 70% respectively from February to April 2014. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 70% in December and stayed elevated for at least 4 months, indicating high organic matter release by primary producers. Such strong cascading effects of upwelling on organic matter dynamics on coral reefs have not been reported previously, although likely impacting many reefs in comparable upwelling systems.																	1932-6203					NOV 11	2015	10	11							e0142681	10.1371/journal.pone.0142681								WOS:000364433100112	26560464					
J	Nasiha, HJ; Shanmugam, P				Nasiha, Hussain J.; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Estimating the Bulk Refractive Index and Related Particulate Properties of Natural Waters From Remote-Sensing Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												A proof-of-concept method is developed to estimate bulk refractive index (eta(bp)) of particles for deriving information on their composition and optical properties of natural waters using satellite ocean color data. It estimates eta(bp) as a function of the backscattering ratio (B-p), hyperbolic slope of the particle size distribution (xi derived from the beam attenuation slope beta), and apparent density of particles (rho(a)) as described in our previous inversion model. For deriving these parameters from remote-sensing data, large in situ measurement data of the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), particulate scattering (b(p)), backscattering (b(bp)) beam attenuation (c(p)), and seawater constituents' concentrations are used to establish the required relationships and derive the model parameters (i.e., eta(bp) <- B-p, xi, rho(a); Bp <- R-rs; xi <-beta <- c(p) <- Turbidity; Turbidity <- R-rs; and rho(a) <- c(p)). When validated with those derived from in situ data spanning the large dynamic range in water optical properties and relevant water constituents impacting the remote-sensing signal, the derived model parameters and bulk refractive index had errors of a few percent which falls well within the benchmark for a validated uncertainty of +/- 35% endorsed for the remote-sensing retrieval of chlorophyll-a in oceanic waters. The model was applied to regional and global images of satellite ocean color observations provided by the MODIS-Aqua sensor. Global images of seasonal climatology over a decade of MODIS-Aqua ocean color observations provided interesting insights into the seasonal variability of eta(bp) in coastal and open ocean waters. To further investigate the bulk particulate assemblages in some regional waters, several MODIS-Aqua imageries from different regional waters dominated by sediment-laden river plumes and phytoplankton blooms were analyzed. Satellite retrievals of the eta(bp) varied from 1.035 to 1.05 for clear oceanic waters, 1.045-1.07 for phytoplankton-dominated waters (higher water content), 1.05-1.15 for floating algal blooms and Cocolithophore blooms, 1.07-1.10 for coastal waters dominated by detrital particles, and 1.10-1.28 for river plume and sediment-laden coastal waters (lower water content). These results were consistent with those expected for the waters examined, being in excellent agreement with the previous reports and estimates based on the laboratory/in situ measurements and modeling studies. Given the fact that there is currently no satellite-based method to differentiate between bulk particulate compositions, the new method provides a valuable tool for estimating eta(bp) values as a proxy for the apparent density and composition of particles and such information when derived from satellite ocean color data provides new tools for improving our current understanding of particle dynamics of pelagic ecosystems, advancing biogeochemical modeling, assessing the global ocean ecosystem, and elucidating the coastal processes.

Using Lagrangian-based process studies to test satellite algorithms of vertical carbon flux in the eastern North Pacific Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The biological carbon pump is responsible for the transport of similar to 5-20 Pg C yr(-1) from the surface into the deep ocean but its variability is poorly understood due to an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying planktonic processes. In fact, algorithms designed to estimate carbon export from satellite products incorporate fundamentally different assumptions about the relationships between plankton biomass, productivity, and export efficiency. To test the alternate formulations of export efficiency in remote-sensing algorithms formulated by Dunne et al. (2005), Laws et al. (2011), Henson et al. (2011), and Siegel et al. (2014), we have compiled in situ measurements (temperature, chlorophyll, primary production, phytoplankton biomass and size structure, grazing rates, net chlorophyll change, and carbon export) made during Lagrangian process studies on seven cruises in the California Current Ecosystem and Costa Rica Dome. A food-web based approach formulated by Siegel et al. (2014) performs as well or better than other empirical formulations, while simultaneously providing reasonable estimates of protozoan and mesozooplankton grazing rates. By tuning the Siegel et al. (2014) algorithm to match in situ grazing rates more accurately, we also obtain better in situ carbon export measurements. Adequate representations of food-web relationships and grazing dynamics are therefore crucial to improving the accuracy of export predictions made from satellite-derived products. Nevertheless, considerable unexplained variance in export remains and must be explored before we can reliably use remote sensing products to assess the impact of climate change on biologically mediated carbon sequestration.

The challenges of designing a metadata standard that meets the unique requirements of specific user communities are examined, including in situ measurement of reflectance underwater, using coral as a case in point. Metadata schema mappings from seven existing metadata standards demonstrate that they consistently fail to meet the needs of field spectroscopy scientists for general and specific applications ( = 22%, sigma = 32% conformance with the core metadata requirements and = 19%, sigma = 18% for the special case of a benthic (e.g., coral) reflectance metadataset). Issues such as field measurement methods, instrument calibration, and data representativeness for marine field spectroscopy campaigns are investigated within the context of submerged benthic measurements. The implication of semantics and syntax for a robust and flexible metadata standard are also considered. A hybrid standard that serves as a best of breed incorporating useful modules and parameters within the standards is proposed. This paper is Part 3 in a series of papers in this journal, examining the issues central to a metadata standard for field spectroscopy datasets. The results presented in this paper are an important step towards field spectroscopy metadata standards that address the specific needs of field spectroscopy data stakeholders while facilitating dataset documentation, quality assurance, discoverability and data exchange within large-scale information sharing platforms.

At present, methods for estimating the deposition flux are mainly limited to direct measurements or model outputs. Additionally, satellite remote sensing was often used to estimate the integral dust column concentration ( DCC). In this paper, an algorithm is developed to estimate the mass deposition fluxes of Asian dust by satellite. The dust aerosol is identified firstly and then the DCC is derived based on the relationships between the pre-calculated lookup table ( LUT) and observations from Japanese geostationary Multi-functional Transport Satellites ( MTSAT). The LUT is built on the dust cloud and surface parameters by a radiation transfer model Streamer. The average change rate of deposition is derived, which shows an exponential decay dependence on transport time along the pathway. Thus, the deposition flux is acquired via integrating the hourly deposition. This simple algorithm is applied to a dust storm that occurred in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea from 1 to 3 March 2008. Results indicate that the properties of the dust cloud over the study area changed rapidly and the mass deposition flux is estimated to be 2.59 Mt.																	2073-4433					NOV	2015	6	11					1771	1784		10.3390/atmos6111771								WOS:000365692200010

Towards an integration of scale and complexity in marine ecology	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Manipulative field experiments provide a window into the complexity of nature. Yet there is concern that we lack resolution by conducting experiments on a scale that is too small and short to include the relevant complexity of the study system. We addressed this issue by asking how and why the scale (local and global spatial extent, spatial grain, duration) and complexity (number of species, factors, treatment combinations) of experiments performed on marine hard substrata (rocky intertidal, RI; coral reef, CR; rocky subtidal, RS; mangrove root, MR) has changed by assessing 311 total experiments published since 1961 in Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field experiments include site replication, as only 34.7% of all experiments were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding of marine communities and ecosystems.

Such methodology can be applied, at screening level, also in areas where field data are lacking, and consists in two steps. In the first one, candidate areas are ranked according to criteria which take into account the risk of cage breaking due to wave actions and fish welfare requirements. This step involves the post-processing of satellite data and results of operational oceanographic models by means a multi-criteria methodology implemented in a GIS environment. In the second step, an integrated aquaculture impact assessment model is applied to the most suitable areas in order to obtain a preliminary assessment of the potential interaction of a newly established cage with benthic habitats. The methodology was applied to an Algerian coastal area near the town of Bejaia where the central government is planning to develop aquaculture activities. Results show that the procedure allows to perform a site selection, which combines the quality of a site from the aquaculture use perspective with the conservation of endangered benthic habitats (Posidonia oceanica meadows) under the spatial restrictions imposed by existing activities. This result goes in the direction of defining site selection methodologies complying with the principles of the ecosystem approach to aquaculture and providing a science-based support in the framework of the implementation of the UNEP/MAP ecological approach.

Layered effects of parental condition and larval survival on the recruitment of neighboring haddock stocks	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used remote sensing chlorophyll a concentration data, spring copepod abundance, and individual fish condition information to understand the annual recruitment variability of two neighboring haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) stocks in the Gulf of Maine region. When we considered the full range of recruitment variability, the abundance of the copepods Calanus finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp. failed to explain the variation in survivor ratio in either stock. However, when we examined this relationship with subsets of the data, we found that Pseudocalanus spp. appears to have had an effect on survivor ratio. The full range of recruitment variability of the Georges Bank stock was found to correlate with the timing and size of the fall bloom the year before recruitment, which has been termed the parental condition hypothesis, suggesting that the fall bloom affects the condition of spawning adults and thus recruitment. The absence of a correlation between fall bloom and recruitment in the Gulf of Maine stock can be attributed to the difference in fall bloom frequency between the two stock areas. It appears that both parental condition and larval survival affect haddock recruitment; however, the relative impact of these effects depends on the contrasting nature of ecosystem environmental drivers.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2015	72	11					1672	1681		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0084								WOS:000364104300007

Liquid water cloud properties during the Polarimeter Definition Experiment (PODEX)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We present retrievals of water cloud properties from the measurements made by the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) during the Polarimeter Definition Experiment (PODEX) held between January 14 and February 6, 2013. The RSP was onboard the high-altitude NASA ER-2 aircraft based at NASA Dryden Aircraft Operation Facility in Palmdale, California. The retrieved cloud characteristics include cloud optical thickness, effective radius and variance of cloud droplet size distribution derived using a parameter-fitting technique, as well as the complete droplet size distribution function obtained by means of Rainbow Fourier Transform. Multi-modal size distributions are decomposed into several modes and the respective effective radii and variances are computed. The methodology used to produce the retrieval dataset is illustrated on the examples of a marine stratocumulus deck off California coast and stratus/fog over California's Central Valley. In the latter case the observed bimodal droplet size distributions were attributed to two-layer cloud structure. All retrieval data are available online from NASA GISS website. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using ecological models to assess ecosystem status in support of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve, for all European seas, "Good Environmental Status" (GEnS), by 2020. Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with similar to 49% and similar to 43% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3%) and sea floor integrity (similar to 8%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.

Comparison of Incoherent and Coherent Wave Field Measurements Using Dual-Polarized Pulse-Doppler X-Band Radar	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Radar-based remote sensing for measurement of ocean surface waves presents advantages over conventional point sensors such as wave buoys. As its use becomes more widespread, it is important to understand the sensitivity of the extracted wave parameters to the characteristics of the radar and the scatterers. To examine such issues, experiments were performed offshore of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier in July 2010. Radar measurements in low wind speeds were performed with a dual-polarized high-resolution X-band pulse-Doppler radar at low grazing angles along with two independent measurements of the surface waves using conventional sensors, a GPS-based buoy, and an ultrasonic array. Comparison between radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler modulations shows peak values occurring nearly in-phase, in contrast with tilt modulation theory. Spectral comparisons between Doppler-based and RCS-based spectra show that Doppler-based spectra demonstrate greater sensitivity to swell-induced modulations, whereas RCS-based spectra show greater sensitivity to small-scale modulations (or generally have more noise at high frequency), and they equally capture energy at the wind wave peak. Doppler estimates of peak period were consistent with the conventional sensors, whereas the RCS differed in assignment of peak period to wind seas rather than swell in a couple of cases. Higher order period statistics of both RCS and Doppler were consistent with the conventional sensors. Radar-based significant wave heights are lower than buoy-based values and contain nontrivial variability of similar to 33%. Comparisons between HH and VV polarization data show that VV data more accurately represent the wave field, particularly as the wind speeds decrease.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				NOV	2015	53	11					5926	5942		10.1109/TGRS.2015.2427748								WOS:000359541100011

We map its grounding line positions in 1996 and 2013 using differential radar interferometry (InSAR) data and develop precise, high-resolution topographies of its ice surface and ice draft using NASA Operation IceBridge data, InSAR data, and a mass conservation method. We detect a 1 to 3km retreat of the grounding line in 17years. The retreat is asymmetrical along a two-lobe pattern, where ice is only grounded a few 10m above sea level, or ice plain, which may unground further with only modest amounts of ice thinning. The pattern of retreat indicates ice thinning of 12m in 17years or 0.70.1m/yr at the grounding line on average. Sustained thinning will cause further grounding line retreat but may not be conducive to a marine instability.

Foraging distribution of Cape gannets in relation to oceanographic features, prey availability and marine protected areas	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Seabirds forage in a dynamic environment of heterogeneously distributed prey resources. Many seabird species use oceanographic features that promote prey aggregation, as a means of locating prey patches. The combination of tracking data, remote-sensing data and estimates of prey availability is useful in determining how seabirds locate prey. GPS tracks of foraging Cape gannets Morus capensis were collected across 3 breeding seasons and tested for inter-annual changes in home range size and foraging effort, and compared against the availability of their predominant prey (sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus) as determined from acoustic surveys. Biophysical features associated with foraging were compared to a random point dataset using a binomial general linear mixed model, while foraging distributions of Cape gannets were compared against the placement of marine protected areas (MPAs). The total home range of foraging Cape gannets, breeding at Bird Island, South Africa, propagated westwards over the 3 breeding seasons, which coincided with a concurrent westward contraction in the distribution of sardine and anchovy. Foraging effort showed an apparent increase in response to low prey densities and occurred mostly outside MPAs. Although gannets seemed to forage in relatively cold waters, biophysical features were generally unreliable predictors of gannet foraging distribution. The relationship between home range and prey distribution, coupled with recent declines in local prey availability, demonstrates the ability of gannets to track the distribution of their prey resources. However, the ephemeral and dynamic nature of these prey resources places a major constraint on conservation-based spatial planning involving Cape gannets.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				OCT 14	2015	537						277	288		10.3354/meps11428								WOS:000363180900021

A review of accomplishments and challenges	MAMMAL REVIEW												1. Regular monitoring of animal populations must be established to ensure wildlife protection, especially when pressure on animals is high. The recent development of drones or unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) opens new opportunities. UASs have several advantages, including providing data at high spatial and temporal resolution, providing systematic, permanent data, having low operational costs and being low-risk for the operators. However, UASs have some constraints, such as short flight endurance. 2. We reviewed studies in which wildlife populations were monitored by using drones, described accomplishments to date and evaluated the range of possibilities UASs offer to provide new perspectives in future research. 3. We focused on four main topics: 1) the available systems and sensors; 2) the types of survey plan and detection possibilities; 3) contributions towards anti-poaching surveillance; and 4) legislation and ethics. 4. We found that small fixed-wing UASs are most commonly used because these aircraft provide a viable compromise between price, logistics and flight endurance. The sensors are typically electro-optic or infrared cameras, but there is the potential to develop and test new sensors. 5. Despite various flight plan possibilities, mostly classical line transects have been employed, and it would be of great interest to test new methods to adapt to the limitations of UASs. Detection of many species is possible, but statistical approaches are unavailable if valid inventories of large mammals are the purpose. 6. Contributions of UASs to anti-poaching surveillance are not yet well documented in the scientific literature, but initial studies indicate that this approach could make important contributions to conservation in the next few years. 7. Finally, we conclude that one of the main factors impeding the use of UASs is legislation. Restrictions in the use of airspace prevent researchers from testing all possibilities, and adaptations to the relevant legislation will be necessary in future.																	0305-1838	1365-2907				OCT	2015	45	4					239	252		10.1111/mam.12046								WOS:000368509700004						
J	Montes-Hugo, M; Xie, HX				Montes-Hugo, Martin; Xie, Huxiang			An inversion model based on salinity and remote sensing reflectance for estimating the phytoplankton absorption coefficient in the Saint Lawrence Estuary	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The inversion of individual inherent optical properties (IOPs) is very challenging in optically complex waters and within the violet spectral range (i.e., 380-450 nm) due to the strong light attenuation caused by chromophoric dissolved organic matter, nonalgal particulates, and phytoplankton. Here we present a technique to better discriminate light absorption contributions due to phytoplankton based on a hybrid model (QAA-hybrid) that combines regional Saint Lawrence System estimates of IOPs derived from a quasi-analytical algorithm (hereafter QAA-SLE) and empirical relationships between salinity and IOPs. Preliminary results in the Saint Lawrence System during May 2000 and April 2001 showed that QAA-hybrid estimates of phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 443 nm have a smaller bias with respect to in situ measurements (root-mean-square deviation, RMSD50.156) than those derived from QAA-SLE (RMSD50.341). These results were valid for surface waters (i.e., 0-5 m depth) of the lower estuary with a salinity and chlorophyll-a concentration range of 22-28 psu and 2.1-13.8 mg m(-3), respectively.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT	2015	120	10					6958	6970		10.1002/2015JC011079								WOS:000365539700022

However, these areas face many environmental challenges related to climate change and human-induced impacts. Space-borne remote sensing systems may be restricted in monitoring these areas because of their spatial and temporal resolutions. In situ measurements are also constrained from accessing the area and obtaining wide-coverage data. In these respects, airborne remote sensing sensors could be the most appropriate tools for monitoring these coastal areas. In this study, a cost-effective airborne remote sensing system with synthetic aperture radar and thermal infrared sensors was implemented to survey coastal areas. Calibration techniques and geophysical model algorithms were developed for the airborne system to observe the topography of intertidal flats, coastal sea surface current, sea surface temperature, and submarine groundwater discharge.																	1424-8220					OCT	2015	15	10					25366	25384		10.3390/s151025366								WOS:000364242300035						
J	Cristina, S; Icely, J; Goela, PC; DelValls, TA; Newton, A				Cristina, Sonia; Icely, John; Goela, Priscila Costa; Angel DelValls, Tomas; Newton, Alice			Using remote sensing as a support to the implementation of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive in SW Portugal	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of coastal countries are coming under increasing pressure from various economic sectors such as fishing, aquaculture, shipping and energy production. In Europe, there is a policy to expand the maritime economic sector without damaging the environment by ensuring that these activities comply with legally binding Directives, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). However, monitoring an extensive maritime area is a logistical and economic challenge. Remote sensing is considered one of the most cost effective, methods for providing the spatial and temporal environmental data that will be necessary for the effective implementation of the MSFD. However, there is still a concern about the uncertainties associated with remote sensed products. This study has tested how a specific satellite product can contribute to the monitoring of a MSFD Descriptor for "good environmental status" (GES). The results show that the quality of the remote sensing product Algal Pigment Index 1 (API 1) from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor of the European Space Agency for ocean colour products can be effectively validated with in situ data from three stations off the SW Iberian Peninsula. The validation results show good agreement between the MERIS API 1 and the in situ data for the two more offshore stations, with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.79, and with lower uncertainties for the average relative percentage difference (RPD) of 24.6% and 27.9% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.40 and 0.38 for Stations B and C, respectively. Near to the coast, Station A has the lowest R-2 of 0.63 and the highest uncertainties with an RPD of 112.9% and a RMSE of 1.00. It is also the station most affected by adjacency effects from the land: when the Improved Contrast between Ocean and Land processor (ICOL) is applied the R-2 increases to 0.77 and there is a 30% reduction in the uncertainties estimated by RPD. The MERIS API 1 product decreases from inshore to offshore, with higher values occurring mainly between early spring and the end of the summer, and with lower values during winter. By using the satellite images for API 1, it is possible to detect and track the development of algal blooms in coastal and marine waters, demonstrating the usefulness of remote sensing for supporting the implementation of the MSFD with respect to Descriptor 5: Eutrophication. It is probable that remote sensing will also prove to be useful for monitoring other Descriptors of the MSFD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzed the wetlands in Shanghai, a province-level city, using remote sensing, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques based on the Chinese national wetland inventory procedure and standards. FORMOSAT imagery acquired in 2012 and Navy nautical charts of the Yangtze estuarine area were used in conjunction with object-oriented segmentation, expert interpretation, and field validation to determine wetland status. Landsat imagery from 1985, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2013 as well as social-economic data collected from 1985 to 2013 were used to further assess wetland changes. In 2013, Shanghai contained 376970.6 ha of wetlands, and 78.8% of all wetlands were in marine or estuarine systems. Estuarine waters comprised the single largest wetland category. Between the first national wetland inventory in 2003 and the second national wetland inventory in 2013, Shanghai lost 50519.1 ha of wetlands, amounting to a mean annual loss rate of 1.2% or an 11.8% loss over the decade. Declines were proportionately higher in marine and estuarine wetlands, with an annual loss of 1.8%, while there was a sharp increase of 1882.6% in constructed water storage areas for human uses. Diking, filling, impoundment and reclamation, which are all attributable to the economic development and urbanization associated with population increases, were the major factors that explained the gain and loss of wetlands. Additional factors affecting wetland losses and gains include sediment trapping by the hydropower system, which reduces supply to the estuary and erodes wetlands, and sediment trapping by the jetties, spur dikes, and diversion bulwark associated with a navigation channel deepening project, which has the converse effect, increasing saltmarsh wetland area at Jiuduansha shoal by three times between 2000 and 2013.

Cumulative pressures from extreme weather with a high frequency of large scale flooding in recent years has been linked to the large scale reported decline in the health of inshore seagrass systems and coral reefs in the central areas of the GBR, with concerns for the recovery potential of these impacted ecosystems. Management authorities currently rely on remotely-sensed (RS) and in situ data for water quality monitoring to guide their assessment of water quality conditions in the GBR. The use of remotely-sensed satellite products provides a quantitative and accessible tool for scientists and managers. These products, coupled with in situ data, and more recently modelled data, are valuable for quantifying the influence of river plumes on seagrass and coral reef habitat in the GBR. This article reviews recent remote sensing techniques developed to monitor river plumes and water quality in the GBR. We also discuss emerging research that integrates hydrodynamic models with remote sensing and in situ data, enabling us to explore impacts of different catchment management strategies on GBR water quality.

J	Chi, GY; Huang, B; Ma, J; Shi, Y; Chen, X				Chi, Guangyu; Huang, Bin; Ma, Jian; Shi, Yi; Chen, Xin			Effects of iron on growth and reflectance spectrum of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis viridis	PHYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Iron is an important factor in algal blooms because it is involved in cyanobacterial pigment biosynthesis and therefore has the ability to influence the pigment status of algal cells. This role in pigment biosynthesis offers the opportunity for rapid monitoring of iron availability to cyanobacteria through spectral reflectance characterization. In the present study, the freshwater cyanobacterium Microcystis viridis was cultured with different levels of iron. Cell density, cellular content of iron and photosynthetic pigments, and spectral reflectivity of M.viridis were determined daily during the course of the culture experiment. The results showed that at the lowest iron concentration (0.01M) the growth of M.viridis was seriously limited, and the maximal cell density was only approximately 6.4% of the density observed with an iron concentration of 18M. Iron availability dramatically affected chlorophyll a, carotenoid and phycocyanin content, with the greatest impact on chlorophyll a. The iron-induced changes in content and ratios of pigments were detectable through spectral reflectance. Eleven spectral indices previously developed for the estimation of concentrations and/or ratios of pigments and a newly proposed chlorophyll a/phycocyanin index were found to be suitable for generating sensitive regression models between cellular iron content and spectral parameters. The comprehensive application of key sensitive spectral indices and regression equations should help to support monitoring and diagnosis of iron availability to cyanobacteria via remote sensing.																	1322-0829	1440-1835				OCT	2015	63	4					265	273		10.1111/pre.12100								WOS:000363663000003						
J	Coen, LD; Bishop, MJ				Coen, Loren D.; Bishop, Melanie J.			The ecology, evolution, impacts and management of host-parasite interactions of marine molluscs	JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY												Molluscs are economically and ecologically important components of aquatic ecosystems. In addition to supporting valuable aquaculture and wild-harvest industries, their populations determine the structure of benthic communities, cycling of nutrients, serve as prey resources for higher trophic levels and, in some instances, stabilize shorelines and maintain water quality. This paper reviews existing knowledge of the ecology of host-parasite interactions involving marine molluscs, with a focus on gastropods and bivalves. It considers the ecological and evolutionary impacts of molluscan parasites on their hosts and vice versa, and on the communities and ecosystems in which they are a part, as well as disease management and its ecological impacts. An increasing number of case studies show that disease can have important effects on marine molluscs, their ecological interactions and ecosystem services, at spatial scales from centimeters to thousands of kilometers and timescales ranging from hours to years. In some instances the cascading indirect effects arising from parasitic infection of molluscs extend well beyond the temporal and spatial scales at which molluscs are affected by disease. In addition to the direct effects of molluscan disease, there can be large indirect impacts on marine environments resulting from strategies, such as introduction of non-native species and selective breeding for disease resistance, put in place to manage disease. Much of our understanding of impacts of molluscan diseases on the marine environment has been derived from just a handful of intensively studied marine parasite-host systems, namely gastropod-trematode, cockle-trematode, and oyster-protistan interactions. Understanding molluscan host-parasite dynamics is of growing importance because: (I) expanding aquaculture; (2) current and future climate change; (3) movement of non-native species; and (4) coastal development are modifying molluscan disease dynamics, ultimately leading to complex relationships between diseases and cultivated and natural molluscan populations. Further, in some instances the enhancement or restoration of valued ecosystem services may be contingent on management of molluscan disease. The application of newly emerging molecular tools and remote sensing techniques to the study of molluscan disease will be important in identifying how changes at varying spatial and temporal scales with global change are modifying host-parasite systems.
