Human-driven loss of hydrologic connectivity by roads, artificial channels and water flow regulation appears to be the reason behind mangrove mortality in this ungauged wetland. In this study, we determined the CGSM's current state of hydrologic connectivity by combining a remote sensing technique, termed as Wetland Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), with a hydrologic study of river water discharge. For this research, we processed 29 ALOS-PALSAR acquisitions taken during the period 2007-2011 and generated 66 interferograms that provide information on relative surface water level changes. We found that change in water discharge upstream on the main tributary of the CGSM could explain at most 17% of the variance of the change in water level in the CGSM. Fresh water inputs into the wetland were identified only when the mean daily water discharge in the river exceeded 700m(3) s(-1), which corresponds to only 30% of the days during the period. The interferogram analysis also revealed that artificial channels within the wetland serve as barriers to water flow and contribute to the overall loss in hydrologic connectivity. We recommend increasing fresh water inputs from the Magdalena River by reducing water regulation of fresh water from the river and improving connectivity on either side of the artificial channels crossing the CGSM. This study emphasizes the potential of the application of wetland InSAR to determine hydrologic connectivity in wetlands that are completely or poorly ungauged and to define the necessary guidelines for wetland hydrologic restoration.																	1748-9326					FEB	2018	13	2							024003	10.1088/1748-9326/aa9d23								WOS:000423452800002

Remote sensing of mangrove forest phenology and its environmental drivers	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mangrove forest phenology at the regional scale have been poorly investigated and its driving factors remain unclear. Multi-temporal remote sensing represents a key tool to investigate vegetation phenology, particularly in environments with limited accessibility and lack of in situ measurements. This paper presents the first characterisation of mangrove forest phenology from the Yucatan Peninsula, south east Mexico. We used 15-year time-series of four vegetation indices (EVI, NDVI, gNDVI and NDWI) derived from MODIS surface reflectance to estimate phenological parameters which were then compared with in situ climatic variables, salinity and litterfall. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) was used to smooth the raw data and four phenological parameters were estimated: start of season (SOS), time of maximum greenness (Max Green), end of season (EOS) and length of season (LOS). Litterfall showed a distinct seasonal pattern with higher rates during the end of the dry season and during the wet season. Litterfall was positively correlated with temperature (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) and salinity (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). The results revealed that although mangroves are evergreen species the mangrove forest has clear greenness seasonality which is negatively correlated with litterfall and generally lagged behind maximum rainfall. The dates of phenological metrics varied depending on the choice of vegetation indices reflecting the sensitivity of each index to a particular aspect of vegetation growth. NDWI, an index associated to canopy water content and soil moisture had advanced dates of SOS, Max Green and EOS while gNDVI, an index primarily related to canopy chlorophyll content had delayed dates. SOS ranged between day of the year (DOY) 144 (late dry season) and DOY 220 (rainy season) while the EOS occurred between DOY 104 (mid-dry season) to DOY 160 (early rainy season). The length of the growing season ranged between 228 and 264 days. Sites receiving a greater amount of rainfall between January and March showed an advanced SOS and Max Green. This phenological characterisation is useful to understand the mangrove forest dynamics at the landscape scale and to monitor the status of mangrove. In addition the results will serve as a baseline against which to compare future changes in mangrove phonology due to natural or anthropogenic causes.

J	Watson, EB; Corona, AH				Burke Watson, Elizabeth; Hinojosa Corona, Alejandro			Assessment of Blue Carbon Storage by Baja California (Mexico) Tidal Wetlands and Evidence for Wetland Stability in the Face of Anthropogenic and Climatic Impacts	SENSORS												Although saline tidal wetlands cover less than a fraction of one percent of the earth's surface (similar to 0.01%), they efficiently sequester organic carbon due to high rates of primary production coupled with surfaces that aggrade in response to sea level rise. Here, we report on multi-decadal changes (1972-2008) in the extent of tidal marshes and mangroves, and characterize soil carbon density and source, for five regions of tidal wetlands located on Baja California's Pacific coast. Land-cover change analysis indicates the stability of tidal wetlands relative to anthropogenic and climate change impacts over the past four decades, with most changes resulting from natural coastal processes that are unique to arid environments. The disturbance of wetland soils in this region (to a depth of 50 cm) would liberate 2.55 Tg of organic carbon (C) or 9.36 Tg CO(2)eq. Based on stoichiometry and carbon stable isotope ratios, the source of organic carbon in these wetland sediments is derived from a combination of wetland macrophyte, algal, and phytoplankton sources. The reconstruction of natural wetland dynamics in Baja California provides a counterpoint to the history of wetland destruction elsewhere in North America, and measurements provide new insights on the control of carbon sequestration in arid wetlands.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							32	10.3390/s18010032								WOS:000423286300032

While significant advances have been made in mangrove mapping using remote sensing, no study has documented long-term changes in mangrove extents in Sierra Leone-one of the most vulnerable countries in West Africa. Such understanding is critical for devising regional management strategies that can support local livelihoods. We utilize multi-date Landsat data and cloud computational techniques to quantify spatiotemporal changes in land cover, with focus on mangrove ecosystems, for 1990-2016 along the coast of Sierra Leone. We specifically focus on four estuaries-Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Yawri Bay, and Sherbro. We relied on the k-means approach for an unsupervised classification, and validated the classified map from 2016 using ground truth data collected from Sentinel-2 and high-resolution images and during field research (accuracy: 95%). Our findings indicate that the Scarcies river estuary witnessed the greatest mangrove loss since 1990 (45%), while the Sierra Leone river estuary experienced mangrove gain over the last 26 years (22%). Overall, the Sierra Leone coast lost 25% of its mangroves between 1990 and 2016, with the lowest coverage in 2000, during the period of civil war (1991-2002). However, natural mangrove dynamics, as supported by field observations, indicate the potential for regeneration and sustainability under carefully constructed management strategies.																	1424-8220					JAN	2018	18	1							12	10.3390/s18010012								WOS:000423286300012

Historical changes in the shoreline positions and inundation based on projected sea-level scenarios of 0.5 and 1 m were assessed for Nagapattinam District, a low-lying coastal area in the southeast coast of India, using high-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data; multi-dated Landsat satellite images of 1978, 1991, 2003, and 2015; and census data of 2011. Image processing, geographical information system, and digital shoreline analysis system methods were used in the study. The shoreline variation indicated that erosion rate varied at different time scales. The end point rate indicated the highest mean erosion of - 3.12 m/year, occurred in 73% of coast between 1978 and 1991. Weighted linear regression analysis revealed that the coast length of 83% was under erosion at a mean rate of - 2.11 m/year from 1978 to 2015. Sea level rise (SLR) impact indicated that the coastal area of about 14,122 ha from 225 villages and 31,318 ha from 272 villages would be permanently inundated for the SLR of 0.5 and 1 m, respectively, which includes agriculture, mangroves, wetlands, aquaculture, and forest lands. The loss of coastal wetlands and its associated productivity will severely threaten more than half the coastal population. Adaptation measures in people participatory mode, integrated into coastal zone management with a focus on sub-regional coastal activities, are needed to respond to the consequences of climate change.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							51	10.1007/s10661-017-6426-0								WOS:000422680800051

An assessment of commonly employed satellite-based remote sensors for mapping mangrove species in Mexico using an NDVI-based classification scheme	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Optimizing the classification accuracy of a mangrove forest is of utmost importance for conservation practitioners. Mangrove forest mapping using satellite-based remote sensing techniques is by far the most common method of classification currently used given the logistical difficulties of field endeavors in these forested wetlands. However, there is now an abundance of options from which to choose in regards to satellite sensors, which has led to substantially different estimations of mangrove forest location and extent with particular concern for degraded systems. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of mangrove forest classification using different remotely sensed data sources (i.e., Landsat-8, SPOT-5, Sentinel-2, and WorldView-2) for a system located along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Specifically, we examined a stressed semiarid mangrove forest which offers a variety of conditions such as dead areas, degraded stands, healthy mangroves, and very dense mangrove island formations. The results indicated that Landsat-8 (30 m per pixel) had the lowest overall accuracy at 64% and that WorldView-2 (1.6 m per pixel) had the highest at 93%. Moreover, the SPOT-5 and the Sentinel-2 classifications (10 m per pixel) were very similar having accuracies of 75 and 78%, respectively. In comparison to WorldView-2, the other sensors overestimated the extent of Laguncularia racemosa and underestimated the extent of Rhizophora mangle. When considering such type of sensors, the higher spatial resolution can be particularly important in mapping small mangrove islands that often occur in degraded mangrove systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							23	10.1007/s10661-017-6399-z								WOS:000422680800032

This paper summarizes the geo-historical evolution of Vitoria, the main transformations of the urban area and their relationship with the current landscape while introducing a new geological map of the city produced from the identification and delineation of technogenic deposits. Bibliographical, cartographic and field surveys were done using the Geographic Information System integrated with Remote Sensing products and techniques to produce the maps. The results show that, currently, Vitoria has 10 km(2) of technogenic deposits, corresponding to about 12% of its geological coverage while 61% of the shoreline perimeter is artificialized. Urban roads, recreational areas, and residential neighborhoods were settled over landfills, 52% of which covered either water depths or mangrove forest. It is concluded that the topography was the greatest obstacle to the occupation and development of Vitoria earlier. Almost the whole perimeter of Vitoria Island and mainland have been altered by landfill. However, these "new" spaces remained as the limiting factor to any re-adaptation attempt of the coastal ecosystems, especially mangroves, in a future scenario of sea level oscillations.																	0964-5691	1873-524X				JAN 1	2018	151						45	52		10.1016/j.ocecoamart.2017.10.026								WOS:000418973100005						
J	Suyadi; Gao, J; Lundquist, CJ; Schwendenmann, L				Suyadi; Gao, Jay; Lundquist, Carolyn J.; Schwendenmann, Luitgard			Sources of uncertainty in mapping temperate mangroves and their minimization using innovative methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Estimates of temperate mangrove forest cover are required for management of estuarine ecosystems, particularly in areas experiencing rapid change in mangrove distribution. However, it remains challenging to obtain accurate estimates of temperate mangrove cover using remote sensing because of the unique physical features and environmental conditions of temperate mangroves. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop an improved image analysis approach for estimating temperate mangrove forest cover using remote sensing and (2) to test the new approach by comparing its accuracy and uncertainty with those of traditional image analysis. The study area (around 1500 ha) is located in the southern part of the Waitemata Harbour, Auckland, New Zealand. Landsat images and field surveys were used for mapping, and uncertainty was quantified using a Monte Carlo approach. This study showed that, using a traditional approach of mapping, misclassification was the highest source of uncertainty (up to 19% for dwarf mangroves and 16% for tall mangroves), followed by water column effects (up to 7% for dwarf mangroves and 5% for tall mangroves) and positional errors (up to 4% for dwarf mangroves and 5% for tall mangroves). Improved image analysis enhanced accuracy from 72% to 95% for tall mangroves and from 69% to 90% for dwarf mangroves. The improved approach minimized the overall uncertainty by up to 68% for tall mangroves and 57% for dwarf mangroves. Adopting this innovative approach to image analysis can improve accuracy of estimates of long-term trends in temperate mangrove forest cover.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2018	39	1					17	36		10.1080/01431161.2017.1378455								WOS:000412564000002

A Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Landcover and Coastal Changes at Wandandian Delta System, Southeastern Australia	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Large numbers of people live along and depend upon the world's coastal resources. Human modifications of the coastal zone, in combination with climate induced environmental changes, have had a major effect on the natural ecological systems. GIS analysis of remote sensed data, combined with fieldwork and laboratory tests, can be used to determine the resultant eco-geomorphic changes that need to be managed sustainably on a worldwide scale. Modelling the eco-geomorphic dynamics between 1949 and 2016 on the Wandandian Creek delta (southeastern NSW, Australia) provides a case study of management options for such coastal resources. Results from the Wandandian Creek delta show that sand/silt sediment derived from the partially (22%) modified terrestrial catchment has prograded into the wave-dominated St. Georges Basin where it is impacted by nearshore processes. Clear spatio-temporal growth of the areal extent and elevation of the deltaic levees and sandspits, with their associated mangroves and saltmarshes, has occurred over the past 65 years. Although the growth rate has fluctuated during the study period, due to flood events in 1974, 1990s and 2010, the overall subaerial and subaqueous delta area has had an average growth of 4168 m(2) annually with the shoreline extending 1.451 m/year on average. This geomorphic growth has stabilised the estuarine deltaic habitats with high proportions of nutrients and organic matter, particularly within saltmarsh, mangrove, Casuarina/Juncus and other mixed native plant areas. This research shows the importance of analysing morphological changes observed on the delta that can be related to both anthropogenic modifications and natural processes to the catchment and thus should be used in the development of catchment and coastal management plans.																	2077-1312					DEC	2017	5	4							55	10.3390/jmse5040055								WOS:000423694200011						
J	Padmanaban, R; Bhowmik, AK; Cabral, P				Padmanaban, Rajchandar; Bhowmik, Avit K.; Cabral, Pedro			A Remote Sensing Approach to Environmental Monitoring in a Reclaimed Mine Area	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Mining for resources extraction may lead to geological and associated environmental changes due to ground movements, collision with mining cavities, and deformation of aquifers. Geological changes may continue in a reclaimed mine area, and the deformed aquifers may entail a breakdown of substrates and an increase in ground water tables, which may cause surface area inundation. Consequently, a reclaimed mine area may experience surface area collapse, i.e., subsidence, and degradation of vegetation productivity. Thus, monitoring short-term landscape dynamics in a reclaimed mine area may provide important information on the long-term geological and environmental impacts of mining activities. We studied landscape dynamics in Kirchheller Heide, Germany, which experienced extensive soil movement due to longwall mining without stowing, using Landsat imageries between 2013 and 2016. A Random Forest image classification technique was applied to analyze land-use and landcover dynamics, and the growth of wetland areas was assessed using a Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). We also analyzed the changes in vegetation productivity using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We observed a 19.9% growth of wetland area within four years, with 87.2% growth in the coverage of two major waterbodies in the reclaimed mine area. NDVI values indicate that the productivity of 66.5% of vegetation of the Kirchheller Heide was degraded due to changes in ground water tables and surface flooding. Our results inform environmental management and mining reclamation authorities about the subsidence spots and priority mitigation areas from land surface and vegetation degradation in Kirchheller Heide.

A Multi-Sensor Approach for Assessing Mangrove Biophysical Characteristics in Coastal Odisha, India	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Mangroves around the world play a major role in coastal ecosystem processes by mitigating erosion and serving as a barrier against storm surges. India holds approximately 5% of the world's mangroves, over half of which are found along its east coast. Situated in the state of Odisha, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary are two wetlands of local importance in need of effective management. This study demonstrated the use of Terra, Landsat, and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove health at these two sites. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, were examined to develop biophysical prediction tools and derive a 17-year time-series (from 2000 to 2016) of leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The long-term analysis revealed phenological patterns in the biophysical characteristics such as high values during wet season and low values during the dry season. Correlations between biophysical characteristics and meteorological factors revealed a time lag exists in response to precipitation and associated runoff. In contrast, surface temperature did not show any lag in response time. This study also utilized Sentinel-1 radar data for the first time for Odisha mangroves to show seasonal variability in LAI, GPP, and CHL. The results from radar data were consistent with optical sensors and proved useful for capturing the rainy season, where data were limited due to cloud cover. This study revealed the advantages of using a multi-sensor approach for monitoring mangrove health and defining future monitoring protocols.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					679	700		10.1007/s40010-017-0441-y								WOS:000418819200015

Changing Landscape of Marine National Park and Sanctuary, Gulf of Kachchh: Ecological Assessment of Mangroves and Coral Reefs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												This paper assesses the ecological changes in mangroves and coral reefs of Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNP&S), Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat, India during 1972-2014. Landsat 1 Multi Spectral Scanner data were used for 1972 to map the mangroves and coral reefs whereas Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager data were used to map the coral reef extent only, in MNP&S in 2014. Published literature sources were used to record the area of mangroves and coral reefs of MNP&S for various years between 1972 and 2014, and the changes were analyzed. For the year 1972, total mangrove area mapped is 175.36 sq. km and the total reef area mapped comes out to be 402.14 sq. km. The total area of reef in MNP&S computed for 2014 is 443.49 sq. km. Our analysis shows that MNP&S witnessed severe loss of mangroves till 1992, with annual rate of mangrove degradation being 2.89%. Exploitation by local communities and careless release/spillage of oil and brine by nearby industries were found to be two major anthropogenic factors responsible for degradation of mangroves over a period of four decades. Major reasons found for degradation of reefs in MNP&S were mining and deposition of sediments. The area estimates for coral reefs reported in this paper for 2014 are the latest figures available for coral reefs in this region. It is recommended that monitoring of coastal habitats in MNP&S should be done regularly to understand the changes in the ecology of the area.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					889	900		10.1007/s40010-017-0457-3								WOS:000418819200031						
J	Castillo, JAA; Apan, AA; Maraseni, TN; Salmo, SG				Castillo, Jose Alan A.; Apan, Armando A.; Maraseni, Tek N.; Salmo, Severino G., III			Estimation and mapping of above-ground biomass of mangrove forests and their replacement land uses in the Philippines using Sentinel imagery	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral) missions offers a new opportunity for land-based biomass mapping and monitoring especially in the tropics where deforestation is highest. Yet, unlike in agriculture and inland land uses, the use of Sentinel imagery has not been evaluated for biomass retrieval in mangrove forest and the non-forest land uses that replaced mangroves. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Sentinel imagery for the retrieval and predictive mapping of above-ground biomass of mangroves and their replacement land uses. We used Sentinel SAR and multi spectral imagery to develop biomass prediction models through the conventional linear regression and novel Machine Learning algorithms. We developed models each from SAR raw polarisation backscatter data, multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and canopy biophysical variables. The results show that the model based on biophysical variable Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from Sentinel-2 was more accurate in predicting the overall above-ground biomass. In contrast, the model which utilised optical bands had the lowest accuracy. However, the SAR-based model was more accurate in predicting the biomass in the usually deficient to low vegetation cover non-forest replacement land uses such as abandoned aquaculture pond, cleared mangrove and abandoned salt pond. These models had 0.82-0.83 correlation/agreement of observed and predicted value, and root mean square error of 27.8-28.5 Mg ha(-1). Among the Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, the red and red edge bands (bands 4, 5 and 7), combined with elevation data, were the best variable set combination for biomass prediction. The red edge-based Inverted Red Edge Chlorophyll Index had the highest prediction accuracy among the vegetation indices. Overall, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide satisfactory results in the retrieval and predictive mapping of the above-ground biomass of mangroves and the replacement non-forest land uses, especially with the inclusion of elevation data. The study demonstrates encouraging results in biomass mapping of mangroves and other coastal land uses in the tropics using the freely accessible and relatively high-resolution Sentinel imagery.

J	Hamylton, SM				Hamylton, Sarah M.			Mapping coral reef environments: A review of historical methods, recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reef environments support high levels of marine biodiversity, they are important sites for coastal habitation and they provide a range of goods and ecosystem services such as nearshore fisheries, economic revenue from tourism and breeding sites for seabirds and turtles. Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2017	41	6					803	833		10.1177/0309133317744998								WOS:000418042100006

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Mangrove forests grow in the estuaries of 124 tropical countries around the world. Because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. Landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. Since 2001, over 50 studies have used Landsat or ASTER imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. Even after the Landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). The main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. Programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60% of the time dedicated to these activities. These skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile.

Mangroves provide vital protection to Caribbean island coastline, substantial economic benefit, and crucial habitat for surrounding reef ecosystems. However, Caribbean island mangroves are shrinking as urban areas expand. Such deforestation is of considerable global environmental concern. This study applies a random forest classifier to thirteen Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes from 1985 to 2015 covering Roatan, Honduras, the largest of the Bay Islands. Results indicate that urban area increased by 982.8 ha (227.7%), with 224.1 ha (-19.1%) of mangroves converted to urban areas. Island -wide and outside of protected areas, a significant relationship was found between urban expansion and mangrove loss. Designated protected reserves have stemmed cutting of mangroves and allowed mangroves to fully recover following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. However, despite being illegal under national and international laws, mangrove loss is accelerating outside of protected areas to accommodate growing urban area and tourism infrastructure. This research suggests that rapid urbanization and tourism development in the Caribbean may decrease island ecosystem resiliency to environmental stressors and impair the sustainability of tourism development.

J	Richards, DR; Friess, DA				Richards, Daniel R.; Friess, Daniel A.			Characterizing Coastal Ecosystem Service Trade-offs with Future Urban Development in a Tropical City	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												With rapid urbanization in the coastal zone and increasing habitat losses, it is imperative to understand how urban development affects coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, it is important to understand how habitat fragments can best be incorporated into broader land use planning and coastal management, in order to maximize the environmental benefits they provide. In this study, we characterized the trade-offs between (a) urban development and individual mangrove environmental indicators (habitat quality and ecosystem services), and (b) between different environmental indicators in the tropical nation of Singapore. A range of biological, biophysical, and cultural indicators, including carbon, charcoal production, support for offshore fisheries, recreation, and habitat quality for a threatened species were quantified using field-based, remote sensing, and expert survey methods. The shape of the trade-off Pareto frontiers was analyzed to assess the sensitivity of environmental indicators for development. When traded off individually with urban development, four out of five environmental indicators were insensitive to development, meaning that relatively minor degradation of the indicator occurred while development was below a certain threshold, although indicator loss accelerated once this threshold was reached. Most of the pairwise relationships between the five environmental indicators were synergistic; only carbon storage and charcoal production, and charcoal production and recreational accessibility showed trade-offs. Trade-off analysis and land use optimization using Pareto frontiers could be a useful decision-support tool for understanding how changes in land use and coastal management will impact the ability of ecosystems to provide environmental benefits.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					961	973		10.1007/s00267-017-0924-2								WOS:000412755900012	28835991

However, there is a major challenge in quantifying and mapping LAI using multi-spectral sensors due to the saturation effects of traditional vegetation indices (VIs) for mangrove forests. WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery has proven to be effective to estimate LAI of grasslands and forests, but the sensitivity of its vegetation indices (VIs) has been uncertain for mangrove forests. Furthermore, the single model may exhibit certain randomness and instability in model calibration and estimation accuracy. Therefore, this study aims to explore the sensitivity of WV2 VIs for estimating mangrove LAI by comparing artificial neural network regression (ANNR), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR). The results suggest that the RFR algorithm yields the best results (RMSE = 0.45, 14.55% of the average LAI), followed by ANNR (RMSE = 0.49, 16.04% of the average LAI), and then SVR (RMSE = 0.51, 16.56% of the average LAI) algorithms using 5-fold cross validation (CV) using all VIs. Quantification of the variable importance shows that the VIs derived from the red-edge band consistently remain the most important contributor to LAI estimation. When the red-edge band-derived VIs are removed from the models, estimation accuracies measured in relative RMSE (RMSEr) decrease by 3.79%, 2.70% and 4.47% for ANNR, SVR and RFR models respectively. VIs derived from red-edge band also yield better accuracy compared with other traditional bands of WV2, such as near-infrared-1 and near-infrared-2 band. Furthermore, the estimated LAI values vary significantly across different mangrove species. The study demonstrates the utility of VIs of WV2 imagery and the selected machine-learning algorithms in developing LAI models in mangrove forests. The results indicate that the red-edge band of WV2 imagery can help alleviate the saturation problem and improve the accuracy of LAI estimation in a mangrove area.

Remote sensing data, collected at various spatial resolutions, provide an effective way to map the spatial distribution of mangrove forests over time. However, the spectral signatures of mangrove forests are significantly affected by tide levels. Therefore, mangrove forests may not be accurately mapped with remote sensing data collected during a single-tidal event, especially if not acquired at low tide. This research reports how a decision-tree based procedure was developed to map mangrove forests using multi tidal Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Three indices, including the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NEVILNDMIH (the multiplication of NDVIL by NDMIH, L: low tide level, H: high tide level) were used in this algorithm to differentiate mangrove forests from other land-cover and land-use types in Fangchenggang City, China. Additionally, the recent Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data were selected to validate the results and compare if the methodology is reliable. The results demonstrate that short-term multi-tidal remotely sensed data better represent the unique nearshore coastal wetland habitats of mangrove forests than single-tidal data. Furthermore, multi-tidal remotely-sensed data has led to improved accuracies using two classification approaches: i.e. decision trees and the maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Since mangrove forests are typically found at low elevations, the inclusion of elevation data in the two classification procedures was tested. Given the decision-tree method does not assume strict data distribution parameters, it was able to optimize the application of multi-tidal and elevation data, resulting in higher classification accuracies of mangrove forests. When using multi-source data of differing types and distributions to map mangrove forests, a decision-tree method appears to be superior to traditional statistical classifiers.																	0303-2434					OCT	2017	62						201	214		10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.010								WOS:000408787100019

The expansion of aquaculture production and urbanization have been identified as major causes of mangrove clearance in South-East Asia. The Ca Mau peninsula in Vietnam is leading the country in shrimp aquaculture and at the same time, the region is home to the largest remaining mangrove forests. This study aims to assess the spatial and temporal mangrove forest dynamics in Ngoc Hien district in Ca Mau. Land cover change and fragmentation are quantified using remote sensing imagery consisting of a series of SPOT5 scenes from 2004, 2009 and 2013. The results indicate a high turnover of land cover change, with close to half of the mangrove forests being affected by land cover changes between 2004 and 2014. Net changes in mangrove forest are found to average -0.34% annually, characterized by deforestation between 2004 and 2009 and afforestation of between 2009 and 2013. Fragmentation remains a plausible threat; approximately 35.4% of the mangrove forests in Ngoc Hien are part of interior 'core' forests. Forest zones with different regulation regimes play a significant role in shaping the geographic distribution of mangrove forest changes. The insights into recent mangrove forest dynamics facilitate the informed discussion on improving future protection of the mangrove forests abiding anthropogenic pressures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a new classification algorithm was developed using the biophysical characteristics of mangrove forests in China. More specifically, these forests were mapped by identifying: (1) greenness, canopy coverage, and tidal inundation from time series Landsat data, and (2) elevation, slope, and intersection-with-sea criterion. The annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was found to be a key variable in determining the classification thresholds of greenness, canopy coverage, and tidal inundation of mangrove forests, which are greatly affected by tide dynamics. In addition, the integration of Sentinel-1A VH band and modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) shows great potential in identifying yearlong tidal and fresh water bodies, which is related to mangrove forests. This algorithm was developed using 6 typical Regions of Interest (ROIs) as algorithm training and was run on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to process 1941 Landsat images (25 Path/Row) and 586 Sentinel-1A images circa 2015. The resultant mangrove forest map of China at 30 m spatial resolution has an overall/users/producer's accuracy greater than 95% when validated with ground reference data. In 2015, China's mangrove forests had a total area of 20,303 ha, about 92% of which was in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangdong, and Hainan Provinces. This study has demonstrated the potential of using the GEE platform, time series Landsat and Sentine-1A SAR images to identify and map mangrove forests along the coastal zones. The resultant mangrove forest maps are likely to be useful for the sustainable management and ecological assessments of mangrove forests in China.

Successful estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) in precision agriculture with a UAV image has been reported in several studies. However, in most forests, the challenges associated with the interference from a complex background and a variety of vegetation species have hindered research using UAV images. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have mapped the forest LAI with a UAV image. In addition, the drawbacks and advantages of estimating the forest LAI with UAV and satellite images at high spatial resolution remain a knowledge gap in existing literature. Therefore, this paper aims to map LAI in a mangrove forest with a complex background and a variety of vegetation species using a UAV image and compare it with a WorldView-2 image (WV2). In this study, three representative NDVIs, average NDVI (AvNDVI), vegetated specific NDVI (VsNDVI), and scaled NDVI (ScNDVI), were acquired with UAV and WV2 to predict the plot level (10 x 10 m) LAI. The results showed that AvNDVI achieved the highest accuracy for WV2 (R-2 = 0.778, RMSE = 0.424), whereas ScNDVI obtained the optimal accuracy for UAV (R-2 = 0.817, RMSE = 0.423). In addition, an overall comparison results of the WV2 and UAV derived LAIs indicated that UAV obtained a better accuracy than WV2 in the plots that were covered with homogeneous mangrove species or in the low LAI plots, which was because UAV can effectively eliminate the influence from the background and the vegetation species owing to its high spatial resolution. However, WV2 obtained a slightly higher accuracy than UAV in the plots covered with a variety of mangrove species, which was because the UAV sensor provides a negative spectral response function(SRF) than WV2 in terms of the mangrove LAI estimation.				wang, le/A-7236-2011													0303-2434					SEP	2017	61						22	31		10.1016/j.jag.2017.05.002								WOS:000404313600003

Many novel change detection algorithms based on Landsat time series have been developed We present a comprehensive review of four important aspects of change detection studies based on Landsat time series, including frequencies, preprocessing, algorithms, and applications. We observed the trend that the more recent the study, the higher the frequency of Landsat time series used. We reviewed a series of image preprocessing steps, including atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud shadow detection, and composite/fusion/metrics techniques. We divided all change detection algorithms into six categories, including thresholding, differencing, segmentation, trajectory classification, statistical boundary, and regression. Within each category, six major characteristics of different algorithms, such as frequency, change index, univariate/multivariate, online/offline, abrupt/gradual change, and sub-pixel/pixel/spatial were analyzed. Moreover, some of the widely-used change detection algorithms were also discussed. Finally, we reviewed different change detection applications by dividing these applications into two categories, change target and change agent detection.

J	Sannigrahi, S				Sannigrahi, Srikanta			Modeling terrestrial ecosystem productivity of an estuarine ecosystem in the Sundarban Biosphere Region, India using seven ecosystem models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The net primary production (NPP) is a key indicator for assessing the terrestrial carbon pools and fluxes from the atmosphere to biosphere in any given ecosystem. Adequate measurement of the sensitivity and uncertainty of regional and global carbon pools and fluxes in different climatic and anthropogenic regimes is needed to properly investigate the terrestrial carbon balance. Remote sensing light use efficiency (LUE) approaches can be used to quantify the terrestrial NPP accurately. Using LUE models, NPP was calculated for last two decades of an estuarine ecosystem, the Sundarban Biosphere region, India. Results from seven LUE models: Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), Global Production Efficiency Model (GLO-PEM), Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), Eddy Covariance-Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE), MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD17), Temperature and Greenness (TG), Greenness and Radiation (GR) models were compared to ascertain model consistency for NPP estimation during the study period 2000-2013. To optimize structural biases in the model accurate parameterization and systematic multi method assessment were employed. The influence of the input drivers (biophysical, bioclimatic and environmental stress) on model performances was evaluated. Best model performances were observed over cropland, followed by mixed forest and mangrove ecoregion, respectively. Amongst all model, ECLUE simulated higher NPP at mangrove ecoregion, while the MOD17 model simulated lower NPP in most of the evaluated biomes. In addition, TG and GR models exhibited larger unexplained variances and found statistically significant at mixed forest site. This error was attributed to the absence of environmental stress factors used to drive these model. GLO-PEM and VPM corroborate with NPP prediction among all LUE models. All seven LUE models predict the statistically significant NPP across the biomes and, the poor model performance is attributed to the different parameterization scheme executed for defining the biophysical and stress variables. Biophysical drivers mostly controlled the model performances, followed by environmental stress and bioclimatic drivers, respectively. This analysis is suggesting that the TG and GR model (driven only by the biophysical factors) could be useful in NPP predictions in the regions with no meteorological inputs and real-time eddy covariance flux tower measurement.

J	Tran, LX; Fischer, A				Tran, Loi X.; Fischer, Andrew			Spatiotemporal changes and fragmentation of mangroves and its effects on fish diversity in Ca Mau Province (Vietnam)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangroves are important economically and ecologically, however mangrove cover has declined dramatically leading to habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss. Information on mangrove cover change, fragmentation and impacts on fish diversity is poorly understood. The aims of this study are to detect spatiotemporal changes and mangrove status, examine fragmentation changes and associated effects on fish diversity. Landsat images in1989, 2000, and 2013 were used to classify mangrove cover in Ca Mau Province (Vietnam) and validated against high resolution Pleiades imagery. Fragmentation changes in mangrove cover were examined using series of landscape metrics evaluated against fish diversity indices (Simpson's index, Jaccard's coefficient and relative abundance). Results show that mangrove cover has declined 24.6% in the province. Currently, high and moderately dense mangroves distribute in southern half of the region while the low density mangroves occurs in the northern half. Over the 24 year study periods, the number of patches and edge density has increased 58% and 53.9%, respectively, while the mean patch size and mean patch edge has decreased 52.3% and 26.6%. Fish diversity in the more highly fragmented mangrove area was 1.78 times lower than the less fragmented mangrove. The study illustrates the applicability of using Landsat satellite imagery for use in mangrove fragmentation studies as well as the impact of fragmentation.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2017	21	3					355	368		10.1007/s11852-017-0513-9								WOS:000404531100005						
J	Pham, LTH; Brabyn, L				Pham, Lien T. H.; Brabyn, Lars			Monitoring mangrove biomass change in Vietnam using SPOT images and an object-based approach combined with machine learning algorithms	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove forests are well-known for their provision of ecosystem services and capacity to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Mapping and quantifying mangrove biomass is useful for the effective management of these forests and maximizing their ecosystem service performance. The objectives of this research were to model, map, and analyse the biomass change between 2000 and 2011 of mangrove forests in the Cangio region in Vietnam. SPOT 4 and 5 images were used in conjunction with object-based image analysis and machine learning algorithms. The study area included natural and planted mangroves of diverse species. After image preparation, three different mangrove associations were identified using two levels of image segmentation followed by a Support Vector Machine classifier and a range of spectral, texture and GIS information for classification. The overall classification accuracy for the 2000 and 2011 images were 77.1% and 82.9%, respectively. Random Forest regression algorithms were then used for modelling and mapping biomass. The model that integrated spectral, vegetation association type, texture, and vegetation indices obtained the highest accuracy (R-adj(2) = 0.73). Among the different variables, vegetation association type was the most important variable identified by the Random Forest model. Based on the biomass maps generated from the Random Forest, total biomass in the Cangio mangrove forest increased by 820,136 tons over this period, although this change varied between the three different mangrove associations.

Google Earth (GE), as a free software, hosts high-resolution imagery for many areas of the world. To explore the use of GE imagery for monitoring S. alterniflora invasion and developing an understanding of the invasion process of S. alterniflora in the Zhangjiang Estuary, the object-oriented method and visual interpretation were applied to GE, SPOT-5, and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images. In addition, landscape metrics of S. alterniflora patches adjacent to mangrove forests were calculated and mangrove gaps were recorded by checking whether S. alterniflora exists. The results showed that from 2003-2015, the areal extent of S. alterniflora in the Zhangjiang Estuary increased from 57.94 ha to 116.11 ha, which was mainly converted from mudflats and moved seaward significantly. Analyses of the S. alterniflora expansion patterns in the six subzones indicated that the expansion trends varied with different environmental circumstances and human activities. Land reclamation, mangrove replantation, and mudflat aquaculture caused significant losses of S. alterniflora. The number of invaded gaps increased and S. alterniflora patches adjacent to mangrove forests became much larger and more aggregated during 2003-2015 (the class area increased from 12.13 ha to 49.76 ha and the aggregation index increased from 91.15 to 94.65). We thus concluded that S. alterniflora invasion in the Zhangjiang Estuary had seriously increased and that measures should be taken considering the characteristics shown in different subzones. This study provides an example of applying GE imagery to monitor invasive plants and illustrates that this approach can aid in the development of governmental policies employed to control S. alterniflora invasion.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							539	10.3390/rs9060539								WOS:000404623900030

Madagascar contains 2% of the world's mangroves, over 20% of which is estimated to have been deforested through charcoal production, timber extraction and agricultural development. This study presents a carbon stock assessment of the mangroves in Helodrano Fagnemotse in southwest Madagascar alongside an analysis of mangrove land-cover change from 2002 to 2014. Similar to other mangrove ecosystems in East Africa, higher stature, closed-canopy mangroves in southwest Madagascar were estimated to contain 454.92 (+/- 26.58) Mg.C.ha(-1). Although the mangrove extent in this area is relatively small (1500 ha), these mangroves are of critical importance to local communities and anthropogenic pressures on coastal resources in the area are increasing. This was evident in both field observations and remote sensing analysis, which indicated an overall net loss of 3.18% between 2002 and 2014. Further dynamics analysis highlighted widespread transitions of dense, higher stature mangroves to more sparse mangrove areas indicating extensive degradation. Harnessing the value that the carbon stored within these mangroves holds on the voluntary carbon market could generate revenue to support and incentivise locally-led sustainable mangrove management, improve livelihoods and alleviate anthropogenic pressures.																	1999-4907					JUN	2017	8	6							PMID 190	10.3390/f8060190								WOS:000404099800014

Due to the similar spectral features between mangroves and other land cover types, challenges are posed since the accuracy is sometimes unsatisfactory in distinguishing mangroves from other land cover types with traditional classification methods. In this paper, we propose a classification method named the multi-feature joint sparse algorithm (MF-SRU), in which spectral, topographic, and textural features are integrated as the decision-making features, and sparse representation of both center pixels and their eight neighborhood pixels is proposed to represent the spatial correlation of neighboring pixels, which can make good use of the spatial correlation of adjacent pixels. Experiments are performed on Landsat Thematic Mapper multispectral remote sensing imagery in the Zhangjiang estuary in Southeastern China, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the extraction accuracy of mangroves.																	2220-9964					JUN	2017	6	6							177	10.3390/ijgi6060177								WOS:000404525800023

By comparing several regions during the same timeframe, we highlight different ecological dynamics and the complex ways in which diverse societies respond to the same social, economic, and political processes. Our results reveal the importance of identifying the most relevant temporal and geographic scales, and the multiple (and sometimes opposing) environmental and social processes working simultaneously in different places, as well as the potential shortcomings of policy decisions or development or conservation interventions relying on broad estimates.

The present study was designed to detect the hydromorphologic characteristics of Indus River Estuary (IRE) using medium and high spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery along with field data. Qualitative (visual) and quantitative (analytical) analysis was undertaken, and accuracy of each method as well as remotely sensed data was assessed. Single-band density slicing method was used for water bodies, while multiband supervised and unsupervised classification methods were adopted for the identification of hydromorphologic habitat along with key ecologic features of the IRE. The analysis of satellite imagery showed that the shortwave infrared-2 (band 7) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor performed better than its visible bands for delineating water bodies. The overall classification accuracy was 89%. Supervised classification with the maximum likelihood algorithm performed better for OLI imagery (30 m) than high spatial resolution RapidEye (5 m) imagery. However, unsupervised classification method was not suitable due to the significant overlapping of inter- and intra-class pixels. Overall, due to its adequate spectral range Landsat OLI imagery was utilized for monitoring of terrestrial water bodies and their morphologic features. Thus, we recommend that selecting the spatial resolution of the imagery should be based on the size of the objects to be recognized.																	2193-567X	2191-4281				JUN	2017	42	6					2539	2558		10.1007/s13369-017-2528-9								WOS:000402081500033						
J	Ghosh, MK; Kumar, L; Roy, C				Ghosh, Manoj Kumer; Kumar, Lalit; Roy, Chandan			Climate Variability and Mangrove Cover Dynamics at Species Level in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh	SUSTAINABILITY												Mangrove ecosystems are complex in nature. For monitoring the impact of climate variability in this ecosystem, a multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite. Changes in temperature and rainfall pattern have been suggested as an influential factor responsible for the change in mangrove species composition and spatial distribution. The main aim of this study was to assess the relationship between temperature, rainfall pattern and dynamics of mangrove species in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh, over a 38 year time period from 1977 to 2015. To assess the relationship, a three stage analytical process was employed. Primarily, the trend of temperature and rainfall over the study period were identified using a linear trend model; then, the supervised maximum likelihood classifier technique was employed to classify images recorded by Landsat series and post-classification comparison techniques were used to detect changes at species level. The rate of change of different mangrove species was also estimated in the second stage. Finally, the relationship between temperature, rainfall and the dynamics of mangroves at species level was determined using a simple linear regression model. The results show a significant statistical relationship between temperature, rainfall and the dynamics of mangrove species. The trends of change for Heritiera fomes and Sonneratia apelatala show a strong relationship with temperature and rainfall, while Ceriops decandra shows a weak relationship. In contrast, Excoecaria agallocha and Xylocarpus mekongensis do not show any significant relationship with temperature and rainfall. On the basis of our results, it can be concluded that temperature and rainfall are important climatic factors influencing the dynamics of three major mangrove species viz. H. fomes, S. apelatala and C. decandra in the Sundarbans.

J	Oloo, OJ				Oloo, Okuku Josephat			ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES IN VEGETATION FRACTIONS ESTIMATION	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS												This study aimed at exploring different remote sensing (RS) techniques for quantitatively measuring vegetation and bare soil fractions in dune ecosystems along the Kenyan coast. The accurate measurements of field samples are required by Kenya Wildlife for environmental monitoring. The current methodology for measuring fractions (ecological surveys) is biased, expert dependent and subjective, and for this reason, remote sensing techniques have been explored to find a better cost-effective alternative. Three methods were carried out to estimate different vegetation coverages in field samples and to analyze their performance: classification of photography's taken by hand-held camera, unmixing of aerial photographs, unmixing of Crop scan and Field spec spectral measurements. For these purposes 32 plots of 1x1square meters distributed in 4 transects were selected and measured in the dune ecosystem. According to the field spectral measurements, different targets (lichens, vascular plants, mosses, and bare soil) showed a large spectral variation and overlapping between their spectral signatures. Therefore, classification methods and unmixing techniques led to poor results since they are based upon the spectral signature of the targets. The hand held camera method proved more accurate than Field Spec, Aerial photograph and Crop Scan. Therefore, from the remote sensing methods, this is the best method when considering accuracy. The performance of this method could be improved by adding an extra band (Infrared for instance). This extra band would allow operators to identify and classify better different kind of vegetation in the image.																	2225-8531					APR	2017	6	1					106	129		10.4314/sajg.v6i1.7								WOS:000406048600007						
J	Guo, M; Li, J; Sheng, CL; Xu, JW; Wu, L				Guo, Meng; Li, Jing; Sheng, Chunlei; Xu, Jiawei; Wu, Li			A Review of Wetland Remote Sensing	SENSORS												Wetlands are some of the most important ecosystems on Earth. They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification. Finally, this paper provides some advice on future wetland remote sensing. To our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive and detailed review of wetland remote sensing and it will be a good reference for wetland researchers.

J	Quader, MA; Agrawal, S; Kervyn, M				Quader, Mohammad Abdul; Agrawal, Shefali; Kervyn, Matthieu			Multi-decadal land cover evolution in the Sundarban, the largest mangrove forest in the world	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Having one of the most vulnerable coasts of the world to climate change, Bangladesh and India are facing new challenges to protect Sundarban, the largest mangrove in the world, from adverse impacts of climate-driven changes. In this study, unsupervised classification of mangrove density is performed on Landsat images of folk time periods over 35 years (1975-77, 1989, 2000 and 2010) to identify the spatiotemporal evolution of the Sundarban mangrove, and infer the causes of observed changes. Specifically the influences of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on these changes are discriminated by correlating the observed change patterns with cyclones' tracks, erosion processes and areas of expected human influences as assessed by local stakeholders. Results highlight a very dynamic systerh, with rapid changes characterized by decreasing mangrove density, mainly in India, erosion and accretion. There is similar to 1.2% (or 11,500 ha) net erosion in 35 years in Sundarban, which remains limited relative to the documented high rate of sea level rise of 6 mm/yr. Mangrove density changes are attributed to cyclones, increased salinity and anthropogenic influences. Based on interpretation of the spatial pattern of density changes by local stakeholders, we conclude that the zones accessible to human activities are significantly more affected by land cover changes. Management policies of Sundarban by Bangladeshi and Indian authorities should acknowledge the important role played by natural or global drivers like sea level change, cyclones in affecting the mangrove as well as manage the localized anthropogenic pressures.

Distribution and zonation pattern of mangrove forest in Shoal.Bay Creek, Andaman Islands, India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Mangrove forest distributed throughout the coast of South Andaman Island varies from small patches to dense forest. In the field survey the various species of mangroves dominated in appropriate zones were identified. The coordinates of field survey were used to perform the supervised classification. Zones are classified from seaward to landward end and they are distributed as Seaward fringes, Tall Dense Rhizophora, Rhizophora-Ceriops dense, Xylocarpus mixed, Bruguiera Clumps and Landward Back mangroves. Total area of mangroves in Shoal Bay creek was estimated around 2912.97ha out of this 1688.72 ha of forest occupies by the Dense Rhizophora community and forms strong zonation in the entire creek. In the spices point of view Rhizophora nzucronata and R. apiculata are the most dominant species of the creek which present in all the zones in all sub-tidal creeks of Shoal Bay.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				MAR	2017	46	3					597	604										WOS:000406894300021

Environmental drivers of decadal change of a mangrove forest in the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services, but are under constant pressure from natural, anthropogenic, and climate change related disturbances. Environmental drivers on mangrove change at large spatial scales, other than sea level rise, are not well understood. In here, we use spatially explicit methods to identify the main environmental drivers of mangrove coverage change over a decade in the landscape of the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. A post-supervised classification approach on seven SPOT 5 multispectral satellite images was used to construct thematic maps of mangrove coverage between 2004 and 2014. A linear regression model between the thematic maps was performed to estimate the mangrove coverage change rate per pixel. Climate surfaces for annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature, and annual mean and cumulative precipitation for the region were calculated for the period 1980-2009 using data obtained from the National Meteorological Service. The effect of environmental variables on mangrove coverage change rates was assessed with a boosted generalized additive model (boosted GAM). The lowest and highest overall accuracy obtained for the time series thematic maps were 87.14% (Kappa = 0.78), and 97.5% (Kappa = 0.95), respectively. The most influential environmental variables on mangrove coverage change were annual cumulative precipitation (21%), and annual maximum temperature (9%). Current climate change scenarios for the region predict an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, intensifying environmental stress on this ecosystem. Therefore, adequate management strategies are fundamental to help maintain the mangrove forest under changing environmental conditions.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					167	175		10.1007/s11852-016-0486-0								WOS:000399030200015						
J	Silva, J; Bacao, F; Caetano, M				Silva, Joel; Bacao, Fernando; Caetano, Mario			Specific Land Cover Class Mapping by Semi-Supervised Weighted Support Vector Machines	REMOTE SENSING												In many remote sensing projects on land cover mapping, the interest is often in a sub-set of classes presented in the study area. Conventional multi-class classification may lead to a considerable training effort and to the underestimation of the classes of interest. On the other hand, one-class classifiers require much less training, but may overestimate the real extension of the class of interest. This paper illustrates the combined use of cost-sensitive and semi-supervised learning to overcome these difficulties. This method utilises a manually-collected set of pixels of the class of interest and a random sample of pixels, keeping the training effort low. Each data point is then weighted according to its distance to its near positive data point to inform the learning algorithm. The proposed approach was compared with a conventional multi-class classifier, a one-class classifier, and a semi-supervised classifier in the discrimination of high-mangrove in Saloum estuary, Senegal, from Landsat imagery. The derived classification accuracies were high: 93.90% for the multi-class supervised classifier, 90.75% for the semi-supervised classifier, 88.75% for the one-class classifier, and 93.75% for the proposed method. The results show that accuracy achieved with the proposed method is statistically non-inferior to that achieved with standard binary classification, requiring however much less training effort.

Potential CO2 Emission Due to Loss of Above Ground Biomass from the Indian Sundarban Mangroves During the Last Four Decades	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Sundarban, the largest single patch of mangrove forest of the world is shared by Bangladesh (similar to 60 %) and India (similar to 40 %). Loss of mangrove biomass and subsequent potential emission of carbon dioxide is reported from different parts of the world. We estimated the loss of above ground mangrove biomass and subsequent potential emission of carbon dioxide in the Indian part of the Sundarban during the last four decades. The loss of mangrove area has been estimated with the help of remotely sensed data and potential emission of carbon dioxide has been evaluated with the help of published above ground biomass data of Indian Sundarban. Total loss of mangrove area was found to be 107 km(2) between the year 1975 and 2013. Amongst the total loss similar to 60 % was washed away in the water by erosion, similar to 23 % was converted into barren lands and the rest were anthropogenically transformed into other landforms. The potential carbon dioxide emission due to the degradation of above ground biomass was estimated to be 1567.98 +/- 551.69 Gg during this period, which may account to 64.29 million $ in terms of the social cost of carbon. About three-forth of the total mangrove loss was found in the peripheral islands which are much more prone to erosion. Climate induced changes and anthropogenic land use change could be the major driving force behind this loss of 'blue carbon'.

The total forest cover of the Indian Sundarban, as assessed by Remote Sensing studies for the year 1986, was about 2246.839 km(2), which gradually declined to 2201.41 km(2) in 1996, to 2168.914 km(2) in 2001 and to 2122.421 km(2) in 2012. Strangely, there has been a loss of 124 km(2) of mangrove forest cover in spite of the significant addition of forest by plantation in the northern part and the emergent 'char lands' within the tidal creeks. But the erosion and submergence of the southern sea-facing mangrove islands is even more significant as a result of the strong coastal erosion and sea level rise. The present study identifies six major classes of forest cover by supervised and unsupervised classification of the mangrove forest area, which are Dense Forest, Degraded Forest, Saline Blanks, Water Body, Sand (beaches/dunes), and Mud flats. The principle sequence of forest cover change observed was the transformation of Dense Forest area to Degraded forest and then to Saline blanks, with an occasional reversal of change in isolated cases under specific conditions. Saline blank formation is most dominant in Herobhanga, Ajmalmari East, West and North West, Dulibhasani East and Dulibhasani with significant increase with time. Among the total land use change during the last 26 years, about 47 % of it have been the change of Dense Forest to Degraded Forest, Saline Blanks or Creeks, notwithstanding minor amount of regeneration in some cases. The saline blanks occupy about 12 % of the total changed area at the expense of Dense Forest, Degraded Forest, Creeks/Waterbody which may be due to increasing tidal inundation, an increase of temperature and a reduction of annual rainfall in the area probably in response to climate change.																	2198-0721	2198-073X	978-3-319-46010-9; 978-3-319-46008-6				2017							97	108		10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9_7	10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9							WOS:000419229200009						
J	Nayak, S				Nayak, Shailesh			Coastal zone management in India - present status and future needs	GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												The coastal zone is a region where land, ocean and atmosphere interact and hence it is dynamic in nature. India has a long coastline which was not adequately monitored until the advent of the satellite remote sensing era in the 70s. India has a very robust remote sensing program that the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) series of satellites were effectively used to monitor coastal habitats, landforms, shoreline, water quality, etc., and changes were identified during the last 40 years. The classification system for coastal habitats and the classification and geometric accuracies of products were standardized. Detailed information for mangroves communities and characteristics of coral reefs were generated. The high and low tide lines were delineated seamlessly for the entire coastline using satellite data. All these data were organized in a GIS and the coastal database for the entire country was created. Impacts of various hazards on such as cyclones, tsunami and sea level changes on coastal habitats were documented. Based on topography, shoreline changes and tides, coastal multi-hazard vulnerability maps were characterized by employing the elevation data derived from satellite data and were prepared for the coastline of India. The information on ocean color and sea surface temperature was used to generate potential fishery advisories, which are provided daily to fishermen. The coastal database was utilized effectively to identify coastal regulation zones, marine protected areas, vulnerable zones, etc. Various services for tsunami, fishery and coral reef bleaching were generated for societal benefits. It is planned to develop models for the coastal zone, so that impeding dangers and likely changes in the coastal zone can be predicted and suitable actions can be undertaken. It is necessary to integrate socio-economic data with the knowledge database of coastal zone to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities and the changing climate on the coastal zone.																	1009-5020	1993-5153					2017	20	2			SI		174	183		10.1080/10095020.2017.1333715								WOS:000409348200011

J	Yagci, AL; Santanello, JA; Jones, JW; Barr, J				Yagci, Ali Levent; Santanello, Joseph A.; Jones, John W.; Barr, Jordan			Estimating evaporative fraction from readily obtainable variables in mangrove forests of the Everglades, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A remote-sensing-based model to estimate evaporative fraction (EF) - the ratio of latent heat (LE; energy equivalent of evapotranspiration -ET-) to total available energy - from easily obtainable remotely-sensed and meteorological parameters is presented. This research specifically addresses the shortcomings of existing ET retrieval methods such as calibration requirements of extensive accurate in situ micrometeorological and flux tower observations or of a large set of coarse-resolution or model-derived input datasets. The trapezoid model is capable of generating spatially varying EF maps from standard products such as land surface temperature (T-s) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and daily maximum air temperature (T-a). The 2009 model results were validated at an eddy-covariance tower (Fluxnet ID: US-Skr) in the Everglades using Ts and NDVI products from Landsat as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Results indicate that the model accuracy is within the range of instrument uncertainty, and is dependent on the spatial resolution and selection of end-members (i.e. wet/dry edge). The most accurate results were achieved with the Ts from Landsat relative to the Ts from the MODIS flown on the Terra and Aqua platforms due to the fine spatial resolution of Landsat (30 m). The bias, mean absolute percentage error and root mean square percentage error were as low as 2.9% (3.0%), 9.8% (13.3%), and 12.1% (16.1%) for Landsat-based (MODIS-based) EF estimates, respectively. Overall, this methodology shows promise for bridging the gap between temporally limited ET estimates at Landsat scales and more complex and difficult to constrain global ET remote-sensing models.

J	Silva, J; Bacao, F; Dieng, M; Foody, GM; Caetano, M				Silva, Joel; Bacao, Fernando; Dieng, Maguette; Foody, Giles M.; Caetano, Mario			Improving specific class mapping from remotely sensed data by cost-sensitive learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In many remote-sensing projects, one is usually interested in a small number of land-cover classes present in a study area and not in all the land-cover classes that make-up the landscape. Previous studies in supervised classification of satellite images have tackled specific class mapping problem by isolating the classes of interest and combining all other classes into one large class, usually called others, and by developing a binary classifier to discriminate the class of interest from the others. Here, this approach is called focused approach. The strength of the focused approach is to decompose the original multi-class supervised classification problem into a binary classification problem, focusing the process on the discrimination of the class of interest. Previous studies have shown that this method is able to discriminate more accurately the classes of interest when compared with the standard multi-class supervised approach. However, it may be susceptible to data imbalance problems present in the training data set, since the classes of interest are often a small part of the training set. A result the classification may be biased towards the largest classes and, thus, be sub-optimal for the discrimination of the classes of interest. This study presents a way to minimize the effects of data imbalance problems in specific class mapping using cost-sensitive learning. In this approach errors committed in the minority class are treated as being costlier than errors committed in the majority class. Cost-sensitive approaches are typically implemented by weighting training data points accordingly to their importance to the analysis. By changing the weight of individual data points, it is possible to shift the weight from the larger classes to the smaller ones, balancing the data set. To illustrate the use of the cost-sensitive approach to map specific classes of interest, a series of experiments with weighted support vector machines classifier and Landsat Thematic Mapper data were conducted to discriminate two types of mangrove forest (high-mangrove and low-mangrove) in Saloum estuary, Senegal, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation World Heritage site. Results suggest an increase in overall classification accuracy with the use of cost-sensitive method (97.3%) over the standard multi-class (94.3%) and the focused approach (91.0%). In particular, cost-sensitive method yielded higher sensitivity and specificity values on the discrimination of the classes of interest when compared with the standard multi-class and focused approaches.

J	Wicaksono, P				Wicaksono, Pramaditya			Mangrove above-ground carbon stock mapping of multi-resolution passive remote-sensing systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This research address several issues related to mangrove above-ground carbon stock (AGC) mapping using the integration of remote-sensing images and field data. These issues are (1) remote-sensing image availability for specific mangrove AGC mapping scale and precision, (2) the impact on mangrove AGC modelling due to the difference between images spatial resolution and plot size of field mangrove AGC measurement, which follow the standardized procedure and not specially developed to be integrated with remote-sensing data, and (3) the accuracy of performing mangrove AGC mapping using image at different spatial resolutions using similar field size mangrove AGC data. Four multispectral data sets, namely Worldview-2, Advanced Land Observation System Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer-2 (ALOS AVNIR-2), Advanced Spectral and Thermal Radiometer (ASTER) Visible Near-Infrared (VNIR) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and a Hyperion hyperspectral image were tested for their performance for mangrove AGC mapping. These images represent various spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolutions of remote-sensing data available to date. The mapping was performed using their original spatial resolution, and for Worldview-2 the mapping was also conducted using 10 m spatial resolution. Image radiometric corrections, vegetation indices, principal component analysis and minimum noise fraction were applied to each image. These were used as input in the empirical modelling of mangrove AGC. The results indicate that (1) it is not possible to perform empirical modelling of mangrove AGC using image with sub-canopy spatial resolution, (2) decreasing the spatial resolution may be beneficial to obtaining a significant correlation with mangrove AGC, and (3) it is possible to perform empirical modelling of mangrove AGC mapping using field data not specially intended to be integrated with remote-sensing data, along with some adjustments. This opens up the possibility of utilizing the available field mangrove AGC data collected by stakeholders, that is, government institutions, NGOs, academics, private sector, to assist mangrove AGC mapping across the nation.

Preservation of mangrove forests is important for many reasons, including the prevention of coastal erosion and seawater intrusion; the provision of spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds of diverse marine biota; and for direct use (such as firewood, charcoal, and construction material)-all of which benefit the sustainability of local communities. However, for many mangrove areas of the world, unsustainable resource utilization and the profit orientation of communities have often led to rapid and severe mangrove loss with serious consequences. The mangrove forests of the Takalar District, South Sulawesi, are studied here as a case area that has suffered from degradation and declining spatial extent during recent decades. On the basis of a post-classification comparison of change detection from satellite imagery and a survey of households, we provide an estimate of the mangrove change in the Takalar District during 1979-2011 and the consequences of those changes. Mangrove forest areas were reduced by 66.05 % (3344 hectares) during the 33-year period of analysis, and the biggest annual negative change in dense mangrove forest cover (8.37 %) occurred during the period 2006-2011. The changes were caused mainly by the mangrove clearing and conversion to aquaculture, and consequences have been increasing forest degradation, coastal abrasion, seawater intrusion, a decline in fish capture, a reduction in juvenile shrimp and milkfish, and outbreaks of shrimp disease. On the other hand, the clearing and impoundment of mangrove forests for shrimp and seaweed culture have provided a source of foreign exchange and new opportunities for employment in the study area.

The method has been used to check its suitability over West Bengal, India on clear sky days which is eliminating the need for ground-based observations. The method explicitly recognizes the need for spatially varied input parameters to estimate net radiation using remote sensing information and provides a distributed daily average net radiation map with finer spatial resolution. The satellite-derived radiative flux components were compared with the Eddy Flux Tower measurements located at Bonnie camp within mangrove forest. The bias, root-mean square error and R-2 between modelled and measured INR are 52.07, 49.5Wm(-2) and 0.74, respectively which are within the acceptable limit. The errors in the downward short wave and long wave as well as upward short-wave and long-wave radiative flux are 13.78, 3.54, 12.41 and 3.54%, respectively. Further, variations of all the radiative flux components were analysed over different eco-systems.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2017	32	3					286	297		10.1080/10106049.2016.1140819								WOS:000393207700005						
J	Ghosh, MK; Kumar, L; Roy, C				Ghosh, Manoj Kumer; Kumar, Lalit; Roy, Chandan			Mapping Long-Term Changes in Mangrove Species Composition and Distribution in the Sundarbans	FORESTS												The Sundarbans mangrove forest is an important resource for the people of the Ganges Delta. It plays an important role in the local as well as global ecosystem by absorbing carbon dioxide and other pollutants from air and water, offering protection to millions of people in the Ganges Delta against cyclone and water surges, stabilizing the shore line, trapping sediment and nutrients, purifying water, and providing services for human beings, such as fuel wood, medicine, food, and construction materials. However, this mangrove ecosystem is under threat, mainly due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Anthropogenic and climate change-induced degradation, such as over-exploitation of timber and pollution, sea level rise, coastal erosion, increasing salinity, effects of increasing number of cyclones and higher levels of storm surges function as recurrent threats to mangroves in the Sundarbans. In this situation, regular and detailed information on mangrove species composition, their spatial distribution and the changes taking place over time is very important for a thorough understanding of mangrove biodiversity, and this information can also lead to the adoption of management practices designed for the maximum sustainable yield of the Sundarbans forest resources. We employed a maximum likelihood classifier technique to classify images recorded by the Landsat satellite series and used post classification comparison techniques to detect changes at the species level. The image classification resulted in overall accuracies of 72%, 83%, 79% and 89% for the images of 1977, 1989, 2000 and 2015, respectively. We identified five major mangrove species and detected changes over the 38-year (1977-2015) study period. During this period, both Heritiera fomes and Excoecaria agallocha decreased by 9.9%, while Ceriops decandra, Sonneratia apelatala, and Xylocarpus mekongensis increased by 12.9%, 380.4% and 57.3%, respectively.

Assessment of Land Cover Change Hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh, India Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data and GIS	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is an indispensable tool for assessing and monitoring land use/land cover changes and supports in planning appropriate conservation measures. This study has analysed the status and distribution of different land use/land cover from 1977 to 2015 and identified the land use/land cover change hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh region, India. The total mangrove area has increased from 140.5 km(2) to 700.2 km(2) from 1977 to 2015. Among all the different time periods the highest rate of mangrove expansion was found between 2008 to 2011. The results indicate that during the past four decades, mangrove, salt pans and built-up land have been increased by 79.9 %, 84 % and 93.8 % respectively. About 21.4 km(2) of mangroves was converted to salt pans and built-up land from 1977 to 2015. Annual rate of afforestation was estimated as 7.01, 12.58, 16.03 and 4.73 for 1999-2006, 2006-2008, 2008-2011 and 2011-2015. Hotspot analysis has identified 33 positive and 11 negative change land cover hotspots in Gulf of Kachchh. Strict management policies are required to prevent further loss of mangroves and conservation of ecologically unique ecosystem of Gulf of Kachchh.

Assessment and monitoring of deforestation and land-use changes (1976-2014) in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India using remote sensing and GIS	CURRENT SCIENCE												Andaman and Nicobar Islands are part of Indo-Burma and Sundaland global biodiversity hotspots. This study provides spatial information on forest types, deforestation and associated land-use changes in Andaman and Nicobar Islands during 1976 to 2014. Satellite remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques have been used to analyse forest cover changes, rate of deforestation and to map patterns of forest cover distribution in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Classified maps prepared for 1976, 1989, 1993, 2000, 2006 and 2014 indicate that the forest cover accounts for an area of 7086.1 (85.9%), 6969.2 (84.5%), 6941.1 (84.1%), 6934.6 (84.1%), 6617.8 (80.2%) and 6407.3 sq. km (77.7%) respectively. It was found that the area occupied by evergreen forests is very high, consisting of 3065.1 sq. km (32.2%) followed by semi-evergreen (1531.6 sq. km), moist deciduous (1133.4 sq. km) and mangrove forest (677.2 sq. km) in 2014. There is large-scale deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands which has been estimated as 678.8 sq. km during the last four decades. The loss of forest cover is high in moist deciduous forests which has been estimated as 312.2 sq. km in Andaman Islands; whereas in Nicobar Islands, the highest loss was found in evergreen forests (244.6 sq. km). The rate of deforestation in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was high during 2000-2006 (0.78) indicating major influence of the tsunami of 26 December 2004. The annual rate of deforestation from 2006 to 2014 was 0.40. The geospatial analysis of areas of forest cover change provides baseline information for restoration and conservation planning.

We mapped a total of 16 natural and human land use classes using both a Random Forest algorithm and a multivariate Gaussian model while considering scenarios with all natural forest classes grouped into a single intact or degraded category. Overall, classification accuracy increased for the multivariate Gaussian model with the partitioning of intact and degraded forest into separate forest cover classes but slightly decreased based on the Random Forest classifier. Natural forest cover was estimated to be 80.7% of total area in Tanintharyi. The most prevalent forest types are upland evergreen forest (42.3% of area) and lowland evergreen forest (21.6%). However, while just 27.1% of upland evergreen forest was classified as degraded (on the basis of canopy cover <80%), 66.0% of mangrove forest and 47.5% of the region's biologically-rich lowland evergreen forest were classified as degraded. This information on the current status of Tanintharyi's unique forest ecosystems and patterns of human land use is critical to effective conservation strategies and land-use planning.																	2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							882	10.3390/rs8110882								WOS:000388798400003

However, little is known of the large-scale dynamics of mangrove canopies and how they colonize intertidal areas. Here we focus on a fringe mangrove forest located in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam; a fast prograding shoreline where mangroves are encroaching tidal flats. The spatial and temporal evolution of the mangrove canopy is studied using a time series of Landsat images spanning two decades as well as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data. Our results show that fast mangrove expansion is followed by an increase in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the newly established canopy. We observe three different dynamics of the mangrove fringe: in the southwest part of the fringe, near a deltaic distributary where the fringe boundary is linear, the canopy expands uniformly on the tidal flats with a high colonization rate and high NDVI values. In the northeast part of the fringe, near another distributary, the canopy expands at a much lower rate with low NDVI values. In the fringe center, far from the river mouths, the fringe boundary is highly irregular and mangroves expansion in characterized by sparse vegetated patches displaying low NDVI values. We ascribe these different dynamics to wave action and southwest longshore transport triggered by energetic northeasterly monsoons during winter. We further link the large-scale dynamics of the fringe to small-scale physical disturbances (waves, erosion and deposition) that might prevent the establishment of mangrove seedlings. Based on these results, we include mangrove encroachment in an already published conceptual model of progradation of the Mekong River Delta. We conclude that high NDVI values and a constantly linear vegetation-water interface are indicative of stable mangrove canopies undergoing fast expansion, probably triggered by sediment availability at the shore. Our results can be applied more generally to mangrove forests growing in minerogenic and high tidal range environments with high sediment inputs. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Ayanlade, A; Drake, N				Ayanlade, Ayansina; Drake, Nicolas			Forest loss in different ecological zones of the Niger Delta, Nigeria: evidence from remote sensing	GEOJOURNAL												Despite the importance of the forest resources in tropical regions, forest continues to rapidly decrease due to demand from an ever increasing population. This study uses remote sensing to examine forest loss in the different forest types found in the Niger Delta of Nigeria from 1984 to 2011. The results show that the over utilization of forest resource in the past three decades has resulted in its degradation, particularly within protected areas in the Delta. However, the patterns and intensity of forest loss vary according to the type of forest. The majority of the forest reserves in lowland rainforests have lost over 40 % of their area, freshwater swamp forest reserves have lost about 30 %, whilst the reserves in mangrove forests have lost just 11 %. Deforestation is high in the lowland rainforest because the land is good for agriculture, but lower in freshwater swamp and mangrove forest because the land is covered in swamps and subjected to seasonal flooding, both of which limit accessibility. Drivers of forest loss in the region are complex, including illegal selective logging from both commercial loggers, due to high timber demand in cities and communal logging of firewood by local people used for domestic cooking.

The main objective was to correlate the temporal change in these two indices within two decades with the possible geomorphic processes regulating these patterns. The Sundarban region is composed of almost 200 islands having self-similar coastlines with FDI and SI ranged from 1.002 to 1.202 and 1.016 to 7.546, respectively. Both FDI and SI values along with their temporal change showed that the complexity and irregularity in the island shape increased in the northern and north-eastern parts of the Sundarbans, while in the southern end it exhibited an opposite trend. Apart from a few exceptions, the longer serrated coastlines of the north (FDI > 1.18) became more serrated and rough due to the predominant tidal effect (particularly ebb tidal flow) within the two decades. The comparatively smoother coastlines of the southern islands (FDI < 1.18) became more compact and circular due to strong sea wave action during the same course of time. The spatial variation in FDI was explained in terms of the relative elevation of the islands, which was found to be lower in the northern part, their differential response to rising sea level and the amplified tidal action in this funnel shaped estuary. Apart from changes in fractal dimension, a net land loss of approximate to 60 km(2) was observed within this island system during the study period. These observations imply that with an increasing sea level rise, the northern and southern parts of Sundarbans Island system will respond differentially, resulting in inundation in northern area (water encroachment in the low-lying islands) and land loss in the southern part (erosion in the coastal boundary) causing a severe loss of ecosystem services provided by the mangrove forest.

Assessment of climate change downscaling and non-stationarity on the spatial pattern of a mangrove ecosystem in an arid coastal region of southern Iran	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Mangrove wetlands exist in the transition zone between terrestrial and marine environments and have remarkable ecological and socio-economic value. This study uses climate change downscaling to address the question of non-stationarity influences on mangrove variations (expansion and contraction) within an arid coastal region. Our two-step approach includes downscaling models and uncertainty assessment, followed by a non-stationary and trend procedure using the Extreme Value Analysis (extRemes code). The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) model along with two different general circulation model (GCMs) (MIRH and HadCM3) were used to downscale climatic variables during current (1968-2011) and future (2011-2030, 2045-2065, and 2080-2099) periods. Parametric and non-parametric bootstrapping uncertainty tests demonstrated that the LARS-WGS model skillfully downscaled climatic variables at the 95 % significance level. Downscaling results using MIHR model show that minimum and maximum temperatures will increase in the future (2011-2030, 2045-2065, and 2080-2099) during winter and summer in a range of +4.21 and +4.7 A degrees C, and +3.62 and +3.55 A degrees C, respectively. HadCM3 analysis also revealed an increase in minimum (similar to+3.03 A degrees C) and maximum (similar to+3.3 A degrees C) temperatures during wet and dry seasons. In addition, we examined how much mangrove area has changed during the past decades and, thus, if climate change non-stationarity impacts mangrove ecosystems. Our results using remote sensing techniques and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney two-sample test indicated a sharp decline in mangrove area during 1972,1987, and 1997 periods (p value = 0.002). Non-stationary assessment using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions by including mangrove area as a covariate further indicated that the null hypothesis of the stationary climate (no trend) should be rejected due to the very low p values for precipitation (p value = 0.0027), minimum (p value = 0.000000029) and maximum (p value = 0.00016) temperatures. Based on non-stationary analysis and an upward trend in downscaled temperature extremes, climate change may control mangrove development in the future.

The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the spatial variability of SOC and OCD using geostatistics model as well as field methods at Sagar Island (Sundarban), India. Soil samples at the depths of 0-20 cm were collected from twenty plots at different season to estimate organic carbon concentrations and carbon density in the laboratory. Spatial distributions of SOC and OCD concentrations were estimated using ordinary kriging method. Remote sensing imagery and ground truth helped in identifying different features as well as land use/land cover correctly. Landuse are characterized by coastal water, sand, coastal wetland, salt marsh, agricultural fallow land, sparse vegetation, crop/paddy field, and mixed settlement area. The average value SOC were recorded as 2.80, 1.83, and 2.069 % in post-monsoon, pre-monsoon and monsoon season respectively. Semivariograms models of SOC and OCD in all seasons illustrated strong positive nugget values indicated short scale variability and sampling error. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the SOC model denoted as 0.71, 0.68 and 0.74 and for OCD calculated as 0.78, 0.67 and 0.83 at pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon season respectively. The results illustrated that mangrove forest portrayed highest amount of SOC concentration in both the pre-monsoon (1.05 kg/m(2)) and post-monsoon (0.94 kg/m(2)) season.																	2366-3286	2366-3294				OCT	2016	24	5					503	514		10.1007/s41324-016-0048-4								WOS:000413299000001

Mapping spatial distribution and biomass of coastal wetland vegetation in Indonesian Papua by combining active and passive remotely sensed data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												There is ongoing interest to develop remote sensing methods for mapping and monitoring the spatial distribution and biomass of mangroves. In this study, we develop a suite of methods to evaluate the combination of Landsat-8, ALOS PALSAR, and SRTM data for mapping spatial distribution of mangrove composition, canopy height, and aboveground biomass in the wide intertidal zones and coastal plains of Mimika district, Papua, Indonesia. Image segmentation followed by visual interpretation of composite PALSAR images was used to delineate mangrove areas, whereas a flexible statistical rule based classification of spectral signatures from Landsat-8 images was used to classify mangrove associations. The overall accuracy of land cover classification was 94.38% with a kappa coefficient of 0.94 when validated with field inventory data and Google Earth images. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass were mapped using the SRTM DEM, which were calibrated with field-measured data via quantile regression models. There was a strong correlation between the SRTM DEM and the 0.98 quantile of field canopy heights (H-.98), which was used to represent the tallest trees in each of 196 10 m radius subplots (r = 0.84 and R-2 = 0.804). Model performance was evaluated through 10,000 bootstrapped simulations, producing a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.0 m for canopy height estimation over 30 m pixels of SRTM data. Quantile regression revealed a relatively strong non-linear relationship between the SRTM derived canopy height model and aboveground biomass measured in 0.5 ha mangrove inventory plots (n = 33, R-2 = 0.46). The model results produced estimates of mean standing biomass of 237.52 +/- 982 Mg/ha in short canopy (Avicennia/Sonneratia) stands to 353.52 +/- 98.43 Mg/ha in mature tall canopy (Rhizophora) dominated forest. The model estimates of mangrove biomass were within 90% confidence intervals of area-weighted biomass derived from field measurements. When validated at the landscape scale, the difference between modeled and measured aboveground mangrove biomass was 3.48% with MAE of 105.75 Mg/ha. These results indicate that the approaches developed here are reliable for mapping and monitoring mangrove composition, height, and biomass over large areas of Indonesia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Barragan, JM; de Andres, M				Barragan, Juan Manuel; de Andres, Maria			Urban expansion in the coastal areas of Latin America and Caribbean	REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE												Coastal areas in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are increasingly affected by human settlements. Urban expansion involves a significant change in land use, especially in the coastal area. This research analyses this process from a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Population evolution is studied in all LAC cities with greater than 100,000 inhabitants, differentiating the coastal cities and the interior ones, from 1945 to 2014. The method relates different information sources; from United Nations databases and images from remote sensing.

J	Giri, C				Giri, Chandra			Observation and Monitoring of Mangrove Forests Using Remote Sensing: Opportunities and Challenges	REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove forests, distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, are in a constant flux. They provide important ecosystem goods and services to nature and society. In recent years, the carbon sequestration potential and protective role of mangrove forests from natural disasters is being highlighted as an effective option for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The forests are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic forces. However, accurate, reliable, and timely information of the distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests of the world is not readily available. Recent developments in the availability and accessibility of remotely sensed data, advancement in image pre-processing and classification algorithms, significant improvement in computing, availability of expertise in handling remotely sensed data, and an increasing awareness of the applicability of remote sensing products has greatly improved our scientific understanding of changing mangrove forest cover attributes. As reported in this special issue, the use of both optical and radar satellite data at various spatial resolutions (i.e., 1 m to 30 m) to derive meaningful forest cover attributes (e.g., species discrimination, above ground biomass) is on the rise. This multi-sensor trend is likely to continue into the future providing a more complete inventory of global mangrove forest distributions and attribute inventories at enhanced temporal frequency. The papers presented in this Special Issue provide important remote sensing monitoring advancements needed to meet future scientific objectives for global mangrove forest monitoring from local to global scales.																	2072-4292					SEP	2016	8	9							783	10.3390/rs8090783								WOS:000385488000093

Mangrove areas were mapped prior to Haiyan using 30 m Landsat imagery and a supervised decision-tree classification. A time sequence of 250 m eMODIS data was used to monitor mangrove condition prior to, and following, Haiyan. Based on differences in eMODIS NDVI observations before and after the storm, we classified mangrove into three damage level categories: minimal, moderate, or severe. Mangrove damage in terms of extent and severity was greatest where Haiyan first made landfall on Eastern Samar and Western Samar provinces and lessened westward corresponding with decreasing storm intensity as Haiyan tracked from east to west across the Visayas region of the Philippines. However, within 18 months following Haiyan, mangrove areas classified as severely, moderately, and minimally damaged decreased by 90%, 81%, and 57%, respectively, indicating mangroves resilience to powerful typhoons.

The Shoreline Video Assessment Method (S-VAM): Using dynamic hyperlapse image acquisition to evaluate shoreline mangrove forest structure, values, degradation and threats	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					Symposium on Turning the Tide on Mangrove Loss - A Focus on Asia	2015	Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, PEOPLES R CHINA		Xiamen Univ			Climate change with human direct pressures represent significant threats to the resilience of shoreline habitats like mangroves. A rapid, whole-of-system assessment strategy is needed to evaluate such threats, better linking innovative remote sensing with essential on-ground evaluations. Using the Shoreline Video Assessment Method, we surveyed around 190 km of the mostly mangrove-fringed (78%) coastline of Kien Giang Province, Vietnam. The aim was to identify anthropogenic drivers of degradation, establishing baseline for specific rehabilitation and protection strategies. Fish traps occupy at least 87% of shoreline mangroves, around which there were abundant human activities-like fishing, crabbing, farming, plus collecting firewood and foliage. Such livelihoods were associated with remnant, fringing mangrove that were largely degraded and threatened by erosion retreat, herbivory, and excessive cutting. Our assessment quantified associated threats to shoreline stability, along with previous rehabilitation intervention measures. The method offers key opportunities for effective conservation and management of vulnerable shoreline habitats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stress in mangrove forests: Early detection and preemptive rehabilitation are essential for future successful worldwide mangrove forest management	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					Symposium on Turning the Tide on Mangrove Loss - A Focus on Asia	2015	Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, PEOPLES R CHINA		Xiamen Univ			Mangrove forest rehabilitation should begin much sooner than at the point of catastrophic loss. We describe the need for "mangrove forest heart attack prevention", and how that might be accomplished in a general sense by embedding plot and remote sensing monitoring within coastal management plans. The major cause of mangrove stress at many sites globally is often linked to reduced tidal flows and exchanges. Blocked water flows can reduce flushing not only from the seaward side, but also result in higher salinity and reduced sediments when flows are blocked landward. Long-term degradation of function leads to acute mortality prompted by acute events, but created by a systematic propensity for long-term neglect of mangroves. Often, mangroves are lost within a few years; however, vulnerability is re-set decades earlier when seemingly innocuous hydrological modifications are made (e.g., road construction, blocked tidal channels), but which remain undetected without reasonable large-scale monitoring.

J	Nardin, W; Woodcock, CE; Fagherazzi, S				Nardin, William; Woodcock, Curtis E.; Fagherazzi, Sergio			Bottom sediments affect Sonneratia mangrove forests in the prograding Mekong delta, Vietnam	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Mangrove forests exert a strong influence on tropical deltas by trapping sediments discharged by rivers and by stabilizing the substrate with roots. Understanding the dynamics of sediments and morphology in and around mangrove forests is critical in order to assess the resilience of coastlines in a period of accelerated sea level rise. In this research, sediment samples, mangrove forest characteristics, and remote sensing data are used to investigate the relationship between mangroves and sediment substrate in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Our data show a significant correlation between percent of sand in bottom sediments and density of Sonneratia caseolaris forest. We ascribe this result to higher sediment disturbance in muddy areas that prevents seedling establishment. This correlation potentially allows the determination of substrate characteristics from vegetation attributes detected by remote sensing, despite the impenetrability of the forest canopy. The results presented herein suggest that a supply of sand from the river and hydrodynamic processes moving the sand ashore control the density of the Sonneratia mangrove forests at this location, promoting tidal flat colonization and canopy expansion.

However, the reproducibility of remote sensing methods for discriminating and mapping mangrove habitats is often overstated due to the lack of temporal observations. Here, we investigated the potential use of temporal series of high-resolution multispectral satellite images to discriminate and map four typical Asian ZMS. This study was based on the analysis of eight images acquired between 2001 and 2014 over the mangrove area of Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. Variations between years in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance signatures were examined as functions of the acquisition angles. We also applied maximum likelihood supervised classification to all of the images and determined the variability in the classification errors. We found that the distinction between spectral signatures of ZMS characterized by a close canopy was fairly independent of the season and sensor characteristics. By contrast, the variability in the multispectral signatures of ZMS with open canopies and associated classification errors could be attributed to variability in ground surface scattering. In both cases, sun-viewing geometry could alter the separability between ZMS classes in near-nadir viewing or frontward sun-viewing configurations, thereby explaining why the overall accuracy of ZMS classification might vary from 65% to 80%. Thus, multitemporal analysis is an important stage in the development of robust methods for ZMS mapping. It must be supported by physical-based research aiming to quantify the influences of canopy structure, species composition, ground surface properties, and viewing geometry parameters on ZMS multispectral signatures.

The proposed method produces more and more selections and combinations to increase the possibility of the best decision-making features. This way reduces the correlation coefficient of the random forests, which efficiently lead to the lower generalization error and approach the higher classification accuracy. The standard machine learning datasets were used to verify the validity of the classification. The simulation results showed that the novel algorithm with the multiple classifiers to concurrently segment the objects and achieve the smaller generalization error. Finally, the algorithm was applied to the classified problems of mangrove remote sensing image. Software simulations presents that the classification accuracy is basically stable at around 90 %. This performance is better than the other two decision tree and bagging methods.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mangrove conservation efforts in two adjacent protected areas in China that were under the management policies of the Ramsar Convention (Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (MPMNR), Hong Kong) and China's National Nature Reserve System (Futian Mangrove National Nature Reserve (FMNNR), Shenzhen). To achieve this goal, eleven Landsat images were chosen and classified, areal extent and landscape metrics were then calculated. The results showed that: from 1973-2015, the areal extent of mangroves in both reserves increased, but the net change for the MPMNR (281.43 hm(2)) was much higher than those of the FMNNR (101.97 hm(2)). In general, the area-weighted centroid of the mangroves in FMNNR moved seaward by approximately 120 m, whereas in the MPMNR, the centroid moved seaward even farther (410 m). Although both reserves saw increased integrality and connectivity of the mangrove patches, the patches in the MPMNR always had higher integrality than those in the FMNNR. We concluded that the mangroves in the MPMNR were more effectively protected than those in the FMNNR. This study may provide assistance to the formulation of generally accepted criteria for remote sensing-based evaluation of conservation effectiveness, and may facilitate the development of appropriate mangrove forest conservation and management strategies in other counties.					, Mingming/0000-0002-4548-899X												2072-4292					AUG	2016	8	8							627	10.3390/rs8080627								WOS:000382458700014

Delineation of spatio-temporal changes of shoreline and geomorphological features of Odisha coast of India using remote sensing and GIS techniques	NATURAL HAZARDS												Odisha coast is a dynamic region wherein both natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the shape and position of the shoreline vis-A -vis the coastal processes are prevalent in this region. Geomorphology such as lagoons, tidal flats, mangrove swamps and shoreline is a rapidly changing phenomenon along this coast mainly due to tides, waves, oceanic currents and storm surges. Keeping in view of the above, the present study mainly focused on decadal changes of shoreline and land cover changes, and delineation of geomorphological units along the Odisha coast using geospatial technologies for the period 1990-2009. Spatio-temporal analysis of remote sensing data indicated notable shoreline changes at cyclone land fall locations along the Odisha coast, wherein erosion (loss) and accretion (gain) rates were observed to be high at Paradeep and Kendrapada. During the study period, the rate of accretion was observed to be higher during 1999-2009 compared to 1990-1999. Coastal geomorphology landforms distributions indicate that the swale complex, older and younger coastal plains, tidal flats and mangrove swamp are the dominant features. Long-term land cover analysis indicated that the vegetation cover loss happened in the high vegetated areas during the period 1990-1999 and regeneration during the period 1999-2009.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				JUL	2016	82	3					1437	1455		10.1007/s11069-016-2252-x								WOS:000377792100001

Spatio-temporal changes of a mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone in the northeastern coast of Florida, USA	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												General circulation models predict warming trends and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns that have the potential to alter the structure and function of coastal habitats. The purpose of this study was to quantify the expansion and contraction of mangroves and saltmarsh habitats and assess the impact of climate on these landscape changes. The study was conducted in a mangrove/saltmarsh ecotone in Flagler County, FL, near the northern range limit of mangroves along the Atlantic coast of North America. We used time series of historical aerial photography and high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from 1942 to 2013 to quantify changes in the extent of mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation and compared these changes to climate variables of temperature and precipitation, temperature-seasonality, as well as historical sea-level data. Results showed increases in mangrove extent of 89% between 1942 and 1952, and a continuous increase from 1995 to 2013. Largest decrease in saltmarsh extent occurred between 1942 and 1952 (-136%) and between 2008 and 2013 (-81%). We found significant effects of precipitation, temperature, seasonality, and time on mangrove and saltmarsh areal extent. The statistical effect of sea-level was rather small, but we speculate that it might have ecological impacts on these two coastal ecosystems. Results also showed a cyclical dynamism as well as a reversal in habitat dominance, which may be the result of complex interactions between plant habitats and several environmental drivers of change such as species interactions, and hydrological changes induced by sea-level rise, in addition to temperature and precipitation effects. Our results on mangrove/saltmarsh expansion and contraction may contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies for coastal ecosystems being impacted by climate change.

Location Global, covering 99% of all mangrove forests. Methods We synthesized the Global Forest Change database, the Terrestrial Ecosystems of the World database and the Mangrove Forests of the World database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We then used the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the global, national and protected area scales. Results Countries showing relatively high amounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Guatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation, containing between 26% and 29% of the global mangrove inventory with a deforestation rate of between 0.26% and 0.66% per year. We have made our new database, CGMFC-21, freely available. Main conclusions Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between 0.16% and 0.39% per year. Southeast Asia is a region of concern with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58% and 8.08%, this in a region containing half of the entire global mangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000 to 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized spatial dataset that monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatio-temporal resolutions. These data can be used to drive the mangrove research agenda, particularly as it pertains to monitoring of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.

Mangrove forests store high densities of carbon across the tropical urban landscape of Singapore	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												Tropical forested ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services to rural and urban landscapes, with carbon storage gaining particular attention. Deforestation due to rural-urban transitions may lead to a reduction in carbon storage ability. Coastal mangrove forests are particularly at risk from deforestation due to their location in the rapidly urbanizing coastal zone, and the city state of Singapore is an extreme example, losing as much as 90 % of its original mangrove cover due to land reclamation and reservoir construction. Knowledge of mangrove ecosystem services may allow better conservation, restoration and incorporation of remaining mangrove patches into the urban landscape. Focusing on the regulating ecosystem service of carbon storage, mangrove carbon stocks have been estimated for Singapore using a combination of field and remote sensing techniques. Biomass carbon showed substantial spatial variation, with old, contiguous mangrove patches containing a higher density of biomass carbon than fragmented, river-fringing or restored mangroves. In total, national biomass carbon equated to 116,117.1 megagrams of carbon (Mg C), and a coarse estimate of the total carbon stock (including soil carbon) suggests that Singapore's mangroves may store 450,571.7 Mg C. While lower than other regional estimates focused on natural, oceanic mangroves, this is a significant carbon stock for a disturbed, urban mangrove system, and may be equivalent to the average annual carbon emissions of 621,000 residents. This analysis, alongside a review of other urban forest studies, highlights the importance of forested ecosystems such as mangroves in providing a carbon storage ecosystem service to urban areas.

The existing global and regional maps of Mauritania's mangroves have little detail, and available estimates of the mangrove area differ among studies. We assessed the use of automated Remote Sensing classification techniques to calculate the extent and map the distribution of the mangrove patches located at Cap Timiris, PNBA, using QuickBird and GeoEye imagery. It was possible to detect the northernmost contiguous mangrove patches of West Africa with an accuracy of 87% +/- 2% using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. The main source of error was the low spectral difference between mangroves and other types of terrestrial vegetation, which resulted in an erroneous classification between these two types of land cover. The most reliable estimate for the mangrove area obtained in this study was 19.48 +/- 5.54 ha in 2011. Moreover, we present a special validation procedure that enables a detailed and reliable validation of the land cover maps.																	2072-4292					JUN	2016	8	6							512	10.3390/rs8060512								WOS:000379985300071

Due to a wide latitudinal distribution, Brazilian mangroves can be found within a large range of environmental conditions. However, little attention has been given to the description of environmental variables driving the distribution of mangrove species in Brazil. In this study, we present a novel and unprecedented description of environmental conditions for all mangroves along the Brazilian coast focusing on species limits. We apply a descriptive statistics and data-driven approach using Self-Organizing Maps and we combine data from terrestrial and marine environmental geodatabases in a Geographical Information System. We evaluate 25 environmental variables (21 bioclimatic variables, three sea surface temperature derivates, and salinity). The results reveal three groups of correlated variables: (i) air temperature derivates and sea surface temperature derivates; (ii) air temperature, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation derivates; and (iii) precipitation derivates, aridity and salinity. Our results unveil new locations of extreme values of temperature and precipitation. We conclude that Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa are more limited by precipitation and aridity and that they do not necessarily follow a latitudinal gradient. Our data also reveal that the lowest air temperatures of the coldest month are not necessarily found at the southernmost limits of mangroves in Brazil; instead they are localized at the Mesoregion of Vale do Itajai. However, the minimum sea surface temperature drops gradually with higher latitudes in the Brazilian southern hemisphere and is probably a better indicator for the decrease of species at the latitudinal limits of mangroves than the air temperature and precipitation.

J	Zhang, KQ; Thapa, B; Ross, M; Gann, D				Zhang, Keqi; Thapa, Bina; Ross, Michael; Gann, Daniel			Remote sensing of seasonal changes and disturbances in mangrove forest: a case study from South Florida	ECOSPHERE												Knowledge of the spatial and temporal changes caused by episodic disturbances and seasonal variability is essential for understanding the dynamics of mangrove forests at the landscape scale, and for building a baseline that allows detection of the effects of future environmental change. In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4-7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2-6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these -disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the -27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.																	2150-8925					JUN	2016	7	6							e01366	10.1002/ecs2.1366								WOS:000378523100028

Conservation priorities of forest ecosystems: Evaluation of deforestation and degradation hotspots using geospatial techniques	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Spatially explicit planning is required to set focused conservation priorities and assessing future ecological implications. Spatial ecological modeling and hotspot analysis prioritizes the forest ecosystems and supports the conservation of species level biodiversity. In the present study, the hotspots of deforestation and forest fires were obtained using historical deforestation trends (1975-1985-1995-2005-2014) and fire history (2009-2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The priority areas were identified as deforestation and degradation hotspots using combined measures of threat from deforestation, fire hotspots and current level of forest fragmentation. The state of Andhra Pradesh represents an area of 25985 km(2) (16.2% of total geographical area) under forest cover in 2014. The net deforested area was estimated as 2390 km(2) (8.4%) from 1975 to 2014. We have calculated the region of influence in percentages and found deforestation hotspots covering an average of 40.2% forest, followed by 35.9% under high fragmentation and 19.2% under fire hotspots. Ecosystem level analysis has been carried out for all the forest types i.e., semi evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves, indicating ecosystem vulnerability. According to the results of prioritization, about 10.5% of existing forest had severe ecosystem collapse and categorized as deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Analysis of protected areas shows Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Sri Peninsula Narasimha sanctuary, Papikonda sanctuary and Sri Venkateshwara sanctuary are representing deforestation and degradation hotspot-I. Deforestation and degradation hotspots identified in the study is an excellent surrogate for understanding anthropogenic disturbances and can be effectively useful in forest management to proceed for applicable restoration measures.

J	Al-Naimi, N; Al-Ghouti, MA; Balakrishnan, P				Al-Naimi, Noora; Al-Ghouti, Mohammad A.; Balakrishnan, Perumal			Investigating chlorophyll and nitrogen levels of mangroves at Al-Khor, Qatar: an integrated chemical analysis and remote sensing approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mangroves are unique ecosystems that dominate tropical and subtropical coastlines around the world. They provide shelter and nursery to wide variety of species such as fish and birds. Around 73 species of mangroves were recognized around the world. In Qatar, there is only one mangrove species Avicennia marina that is predominant along the northeastern coast. Assessing the health of these valuable ecosystems is vital for protection, management, and conservation of those resources. In this study, an integrated approach of chemical and remote sensing analysis was implemented to investigate the current status of the mangrove trees in Al-Khor, Qatar. Fifteen different A. marina trees from different locations in the mangrove forest were examined for their chlorophyll and nitrogen content levels. Soil analysis was also conducted to understand the effect of moisture on nitrogen availability. Results shows that currently, mangroves are in a good status in terms of nitrogen availability and chlorophyll levels which are related and both are key factors for photosynthesis. Remote sensing techniques were used for chlorophyll prediction. The results showed that these methods have the potential to be used for chlorophyll prediction and estimation.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2016	188	5							268	10.1007/s10661-016-5269-4								WOS:000376017400009	27048493

Composition, biomass and structure of mangroves within the Zambezi River Delta	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We used a stratified random sampling design to inventory the mangrove vegetation within the Zambezi River Delta, Mozambique, to provide a basis for estimating biomass pools. We used canopy height, derived from remote sensing data, to stratify the inventory area, and then applied a spatial decision support system to objectively allocate sample plots among five strata. Height and diameter were measured on overstory trees, saplings and standing dead trees in nested plots, and biomass was calculated using allometric equations. Each of the eight mangrove species occurring in Mozambique exist within the Delta. They are distributed in heterogeneous mixtures within each of the five canopy height classes, not reflecting obvious zonation. Overstory trees averaged approximately 2000 trees ha(-1), and average basal area ranged from 14 to 41 m(2) ha(-1) among height classes. The composition of the saplings tended to mirror the overstory, and the diameter frequency distributions suggest all-aged stands. Above-ground biomass ranged from 111 to 483 Mg ha(-1) with 95 % confidence interval generally within 15 % of the height class mean. Despite over 3000 trees ha(-1) in the small-tree component, 92 % of the vegetation biomass is in the overstory live trees. The objective inventory design proved effective in estimating forest biomass within the 30,267 ha mangrove forest.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				APR	2016	24	2			SI		173	186		10.1007/s11273-015-9465-8								WOS:000374592800006

Development of national database on long-term deforestation (1930-2014) in Bangladesh	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The aim of the present study is to prepare a nation-wide spatial database on forest cover to assess and monitor the land use changes associated with deforestation in Bangladesh. The multi-source data were interpreted to get the forest cover map of 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2006 and 2014. The spatial information generated on total area under forest cover, rate of deforestation and afforestation, changes across forest types, forest canopy density, replacement land use in deforested area and deforestation hotspots. This spatial analysis has indicated that forest cover is undergoing significant negative change in area and quality. We report that forests in Bangladesh covered an area of 23,140 km(2) in 1930 which has decreased to 14,086 km(2) in 2014, a net loss of 9054 km2 (39.1%) in eight decades. Analysis of annual rate of gross deforestation for the recent period indicates 0.77% during 2006-2014. During the past eight decades, semi-evergreen forests show loss of 56.4% of forest cover followed by moist deciduous forests (51.5%), dry deciduous forests (43.1%) and mangroves (6.5%). The loss of 23.5% of dense forest cover was found from 1975 to 2014. Dense semi-evergreen forests shows more negative change (36.9%) followed by dense moist deciduous forest (32.7%) from 1975 to 2014. Annual rate of deforestation is higher in dense forests compared to open forests from 2006 to 2014 and indicates increased threat due to anthropogenic pressures. The spatial analysis of forest cover change in mangroves has shown a lower rate of deforestation. Most of the forest conversions have led to the degradation of forests to scrub and transition to agriculture and plantation. The study has identified the 'deforestation hotspots' can help in strategic planning for conservation and management of forest resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kamal, M; Phinn, S; Johansen, K				Kamal, Muhammad; Phinn, Stuart; Johansen, Kasper			Assessment of multi-resolution image data for mangrove leaf area index mapping	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The increasing development pressures from urbanization, aquaculture and tourism on worldwide coastal environments and the ecosystem services that mangroves provide make it essential to monitor and manage these environments more effectively. Measuring and monitoring mangrove structure through variables like Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential part of this action. This study investigated the effects of different mangrove environmental settings, satellite image spatial resolutions, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and mapping approaches for LAI estimation. We compared and contrasted the ability of WorldView-2 (WV-2), ALOS AVNIR-2 (AVNIR-2) and Landsat TM (TM) image data (2 m, 10 m and 30 m pixel sizes, respectively), to estimate LAI through regression analysis at sites in Moreton Bay (Australia) and Karimunjawa Island (Indonesia). We also investigated the effect of different pixel averaging windows (3 x 3, 5 x 5, and 7 x 7 pixels) and multi-resolution segmentation scale parameters (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) applied to the WV-2 image for LAI estimation. The results showed that LAI estimation using remote sensing data varies across sites and sensors. Estimation of LAI in this study was influenced by the local spatial variation of mangrove phenological stages and canopy cover. The regression analyses showed significant coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging from 0.50 to 0.83 across different sensors (TM, AVNIR-2, WV-2), segmentation scales (10, 20,30, 40, 50) and SVIs (SR, NDVI, SAVI, EVI). The sensor and SVIs assessment identified the ALOS AVNIR-2 and NDVI as the optimal estimators of LAI, with R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.54 for Moreton Bay, and R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.31 for Karimunjawa Island. The optimum image pixel size for estimating LAI was related to the average canopy size (about 10 m in diameter) and the field sampling size (10 m). Image segmentation significantly increased the LAI estimation accuracy by approximately 14% for both sites. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the relationship between image spatial resolution, field sampling size and spatial variation of mangrove vegetation for estimating LAI. These findings can be potentially used as a guide for selecting the optimum imagery for LAI estimation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, some recent studies using texture indices derived from optical remote sensing data via the Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) approach have provided promising results without saturation problems for some tropical forests, which tend to underestimate AGB predictions. This study was applied to the temperate mixed forest of the Liangshui National Nature Reserve in Northeastern China and demonstrated the capability of FOTO texture indices to obtain a higher prediction quality of forest AGB. Based on high spatial resolution aerial photos (1.0 m spatial resolution) acquired in September 2009, the relationship between FOTO texture indices and field-derived biomass measurements was calibrated using a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to construct a robust prediction model, which avoided the over-fitting problem. By further comparison the performance of the model estimates for greater coverage, the predicted results were compared with a reference biomass map derived from LiDAR metrics. This study showed that the FOTO indices accounted for 88.3% of the variance in ground-based AGB; the root mean square error (RMSE) was 34.35 t/ha, and RMSE normalized by the mean value of the estimates was 22.31%. This novel texture-based method has great potential for forest AGB estimation in other temperate regions.

GIS-based modelling of vulnerability of coastal wetland ecosystems to environmental changes: Comerong Island, southeastern Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Sustainable management of coastal zones has become a complicated issue. The majority of the human population lives along the coast, where their activities, together with a range of environmental changes, have altered the natural ecosystem processes and caused changes in coastal wetlands. To ensure sustainable use of coastal resources, a comprehensive set of modelling tools can help managers to make decisions. This study uses Comerong Island (southeastern NSW, Australia) as a case study to demonstrate the importance of modelling modifications to environmental change. Several data-based modelling approaches are employed to explore how human activities have altered this estuarine island setting over the last sixty years (1949 2014). Multi-temporal changes in land cover, shorelines and sediment delivery are estimated from remote sensing data, GIS analysis, and laboratory tests on water and sediment samples (grain size, X-ray diffraction and loss on ignition and water analysis). Results show there are significant changes to the areal extents and elevation of mangroves, saltmarshes and shorelines in the wetlands on Comerong Island over the time period of analysis, including northern accretion (0.4 km(2)), eastern, middle and southern erosion (0.7 km(2)) of the island. The implementation of modelling using GIS tools, water and sediment samples to monitor ecosystem processes, such as sediment transport and erosion/deposition, will allow resource managers to make more informed decisions by evaluating the potential consequences of the existing situation.

Spatial Analysis of a Coastal Area for Conservation and Fishery of Mangrove Edible Crab (Ucides cordatus)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Mangroves are productive ecosystems of tropical coastal landscapes, constituting habitat for many commercial fisheries, as the crab Ucides cordatus. In Brazil this crab holds a major socio-economic importance for artisanal fishery, but with obvious decline on their productivity. In this study we determined and mapped the more suitable mangrove areas for the conservation and fishery of this crab in the Sao Francisco River Estuary (Northeastern Brazil). We applied a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) in a GIS environment. Ten criteria in total were used, including crab biotic parameters, land use/cover and social factors. Maps of each criterion were produced by GIS techniques with CBERS and SPOT images and by field data. Mangroves more suitable for the conservation of U. cordatus (9.4 km(2)) are near to the river mouth, due to high density and frequency of non-commercial size crabs (NCSC), low density of commercial size crabs (CSC), small crabs and low degree of use for fishery. On the other hand, the mangroves for the crab fishery occurred with a similar area (10.2 km(2)) located farther away from the river mouth, with a high density and frequency of CSC, low density of NCSC, big crabs, medium-high degree of use for fishery and near to the villages. These information and thematic maps can aid government agencies in delineating extractive and fishery exclusion areas, thus contributing to the management plan for this species.

For the demonstration, we selected the coast of French Guiana where mangrove physiognomy and extent continuously vary due to successive and recurrent erosion or accretion phases resulting from the alongshore migration of mud banks originating from the Amazon River. We modelled the French Guiana coastal system as a set of ecological and physical processes involving entities (e.g. ocean, mangrove shoreline, mud bank) that are in relation with each other. Interaction functions are written to specify how the entities change when they interact, according to the level of understanding and knowledge available. The scenario then describes what interaction functions are activated at each time step. We applied the approach to explain mangrove shoreline variations from 1986 to 2009 over 45 kilometres, and examined the contribution of alongshore and cross-shore wave energy and current velocities. The model was run with daily ERA-Interim/ECMWF waves and Mercator-Ocean currents as input data, whereas a time series of remote sensing images was used during the initialization and validation phases. We then discuss the flexibility of our approach to integrate existing models of mangrove forest dynamics.

Spatial Variation in Carbon Storage: A Case Study for Currambene Creek, NSW, Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 +/- 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 +/- 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.

Role of flocculation and settling processes in development of the mangrove-colonized, Amazon-influenced mud-bank coast of South America	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Guianas coast downdrift (northwestward) of the Amazon River mouth is characterized by the periodic migration of mud banks that originate from the Amazon. The characteristic sizes of these banks as well as their rates of alongshore migration have been estimated from remote sensing. However, the physical mechanisms leading to their displacement are not yet fully understood. The present work is aimed at investigating a number of micro-scale processes involved in the coastal and estuarine dynamics of fine sediments, and expected to occur during the migration of mud banks. The relative magnitudes of flocculation, hindered settling and consolidation have been determined. Sampling of coastal mud was carried out during a field survey in 2001 that focussed on the fluid mud layer in the leading edge of a mud bank in French Guiana. Settling column experiments were conducted under quiescent conditions for various mean sediment concentrations in the range of 2.5-110 g.l(-1), which is typical of mud bank concentrations. The time dependent vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration were monitored using an optical settling tank equipped with 32 pre-calibrated optical sensors. The corresponding settling velocities were deduced from the equation of the conservation of mass. The results show that the timescales of hindered settling and consolidation processes are much larger than the timescales of mixing mechanisms such as tides or propagating waves. The individual floc settling velocities are too small to counterbalance the turbulent mixing induced by breaking waves. Hindered settling, favoured by wave action and by the high background suspended sediment concentrations, is thus an overarching process in wave-driven mud bank migration. This pervasive hindered settling regime is characteristic of the wave-exposed outer and leading edges of mud banks where active mobilization of mud assures mud bank migration. As a result, consolidation is theoretically precluded. The experiments pointed out, however, that additional flocculation and differential settling should enhance sedimentation during slack water and under low wave conditions. We deduce from this that enhanced settling in the inner,subtidal-intertidal, parts of leading edges of banks during such conditions is important in the temporary sedimentation that generates gel-like fluid mud patches and mud bars. These low-energy inner, leading parts of banks form an accreted substrate colonized by mangroves, which further contribute to enhanced settling and rapid sedimentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Environmental sensitivity mapping of the coast of Karnataka, west coast of India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental sensitivity maps have been prepared to identify the sensitive coastal resources, oil spill contingency planning and its results. The present study attempts to identify the environmental sensitivity to the oil spill of Karnataka coast by using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Nearly 300 km long coastline of Karnataka is endowed with a vast variety of natural resources and aesthetics. Several of the rivers that originate in the Western Ghats form wide extensive estuaries, backwaters and mangrove forests before debouching into the Arabian Sea. Besides, several non-vegetal wetlands like beaches, spits, shoals, mudflats, rocky cliffs and a few islands are found scattered all along the coast. A major port (New Mangalore Port), ten minor ports and a naval base (near Karwar) are also situated in the study area. As a result, various ESI types namely: 1A, 1B, 3A, 4, 6B, 8B, 9B, 10A, 10B and 10D were noticed in the study area. Bio-resources such as birds, marine mammals, reptiles (sea turtle), shellfish; and habitats like corals etc.; and human-use resources such as factories, ferry, boat ramp, access to vehicles, beach etc. are mapped in this study.

However, due to various human and environmental impacts, the coverage of mangroves is declining on a global scale. The Red Sea is in the northern-most area of the distribution range of mangroves. Little is known about the surface covered by mangroves at this northern limit or about the changes experienced by Red Sea mangroves. We sought to study changes in the coverage of Red Sea mangroves by using multi-temporal Landsat data (1972, 2000 and 2013). Interestingly, our results show that there has been no decline in mangrove stands in the Red Sea but rather a slight increase. The area covered by mangroves is about 69 Km(2) along the African shore and 51 Km(2) along the Arabian Peninsula shore. From 1972 to 2013, the area covered by mangroves increased by about 0.29% y(-1). We conclude that the trend exhibited by Red Sea mangroves departs from the general global decline of mangroves. Along the Red Sea, mangroves expanded by 12% over the 41 years from 1972 to 2013. Losses to Red Sea mangroves, mostly due to coastal development, have been compensated by afforestation projects.

Geomorphic knowledge for mangrove restoration: a pan-tropical categorization	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Extreme events such as storm surges and tsunamis in combination with subsidence of densely populated coastal areas pose an increasing threat to millions of people in the tropics. Intertidal mangrove forests may form a natural protection against some extreme events, but have also widely been destroyed by coastal development. The establishment of mangroves and the maintenance of their stability over the short- to long-term requires an understanding of sedimentary processes and landforms in the coastal zone, making geomorphology a crucial, but sometimes neglected discipline when attempting restoration for disaster risk reduction. Mangrove geomorphic setting varies markedly across the tropics, depending on abiotic parameters such as suspended sediment supply and tidal range, with different restoration strategies suitable for each. In this study we provide a global categorization of mangrove geomorphic settings, based on the literature and global remote sensing data. The world's mangroves can be broadly defined as: (1) minerogenic and high tidal range; (2) minerogenic and low tidal range; and (3) organogenic and low tidal range. We further discuss restoration and management approaches most suitable for each geomorphic setting. Overall, this study can be used to inform managers about the relevance of geomorphic knowledge for successful mangrove restoration, how an understanding of geomorphology can influence site selection and restoration success, and how to match specific restoration methods to the prevailing geomorphic context. The stronger incorporation of geomorphic knowledge into site planning and design will improve the success rates of restoration for this important and globally threatened ecosystem.

A multivariate regression analysis showed the presence of statistically significant negative trends of NDVI (low vegetation activity) in the coverage of mangrove forest, mangrove forest with pickleweed, and pickleweed; however, we did not found any meteorological variable (built time series of average minimum and maximum temperatures, and of accumulated rainfall) that controlled the observed trends. A pixel-by-pixel spatially distributed analysis of the temporal trends of NDVI, complemented by digitalization through photo interpretation of the shrimp farms present in the study area, showed a spatial relationship between the zones of greatest loss of vegetation activity (1990-2010) and the areas with greater proliferation of shrimp farms in the study area. Our study demonstrated the applicability of NDVI for the environmental assessment of mangroves. The relationship between changes in remote sensing indices and environmental variables allows for an efficient evaluation of the main environmental impacts, which can be used for coastal planning and management.

Above-ground biomass and carbon estimates of Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis forests using QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR data	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Mechanisms to mitigate climate change in tropical countries such as India require information on forest structural components i.e., biomass and carbon for conservation steps to be implemented successfully. The present study focuses on investigating the potential use of a one time, QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR L-band 25 m data to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) using a water cloud model (WCM) in a wildlife sanctuary in India. A significant correlation was obtained between the SAR-derived backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) and the field measured AGB, with the maximum coefficient of determination for cross-polarized (HV) sigma degrees for Shorea robusta, and the weakest correlation was observed with co-polarized (HH) sigma degrees for Tectona grandis forests. The biomass of S. robusta and that of T. grandis were estimated on the basis of field-measured data at 444.7 +/- 170.4 Mg/ha and 451 +/- 179.4 Mg/ha respectively. The mean biomass values estimated using the WCM varied between 562 and 660 Mg/ha for S. robusta; between 590 and 710 Mg/ha for T. grandis using various polarized data. Our results highlighted the efficacy of one time, fully polarized PALSAR data for biomass and carbon estimate in a dense forest. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rates and drivers of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia, 2000-2012	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The mangrove forests of Southeast Asia are highly biodiverse and provide multiple ecosystem services upon which millions of people depend. Mangroves enhance fisheries and coastal protection, and store among the highest densities of carbon of any ecosystem globally. Mangrove forests have experienced extensive deforestation owing to global demand for commodities, and previous studies have identified the expansion of aquaculture as largely responsible. The proportional conversion of mangroves to different land use types has not been systematically quantified across Southeast Asia, however, particularly in recent years. In this study we apply a combined geographic information system and remote sensing method to quantify the key proximate drivers (i.e., replacement land uses) of mangrove deforestation in Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2012. Mangrove forests were lost at an average rate of 0.18% per year, which is lower than previously published estimates. In total, more than 100,000 ha of mangroves were removed during the study period, with aquaculture accounting for 30% of this total forest change. The rapid expansion of rice agriculture in Myanmar, and the sustained conversion of mangroves to oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, are identified as additional increasing and under-recognized threats to mangrove ecosystems. Our study highlights frontiers of mangrove deforestation in the border states of Myanmar, on Borneo, and in Indonesian Papua. To implement policies that conserve mangrove forests across Southeast Asia, it is essential to consider the national and subnational variation in the land uses that follow deforestation.

Satellite images and topographic maps spanning the period 1972-2013 were processed to map fishponds and the natural habitats over which they have encroached. Historical archives were consulted and interviews were conducted to understand the historical exploitation of local natural resources and the reasons behind the recorded land changes. Results showed that aquaculture developed in the late nineteenth century and expanded subsequently across the landscape under a succession of forcing factors. The global market, for example, played an early role but a number of land-use changes were also a direct response to changing environmental constraints and natural hazards. These cumulative events have promoted continuous gain in favor of aquaculture, to the detriment of other land-use options.

MANGROVE PLANTATION FOREST ASSESSMENT USING STRUCTURAL ATTRIBUTES DERIVED FROM LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LiDAR) DATA	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Estimating the structural and functional attributes of forests is integral in performing management strategies and for understanding forest ecosystem functions. Field sampling methods through plot level is one of the known strategies in forest studies; however, these methods have its limitations and are prone to subjected biases. Remote Sensing data, particularly that of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) can be utilized to alleviate the limitations of extracting forest structure parameters. The study aims to characterize a Rhizophoraceae-dominated mangrove forest plantation. Point cloud distribution within a 1-hectare plot was processed by utilizing thirty (30) samples of 5x5 meter plots, which were analysed for the characterization and forest structure assessment. Point densities were grouped at intervals of 10% of the plot's maximum height (Height at Bincentile or HBn) to determine where the clustering of points occur per plot. The result shows that most of the points are clustered at HBn with height values ranging from 2.98 to 4.15 meters for plots located at the middle part of the forest, with a standard deviation of 1.78 to 3.69, respectively. On the other hand, sample plots that are located at the periphery part of the forest shows that the point clustering occurs at different heights ranging from 1.71 meters to 4.43 meters, with standard deviation values ranging from 1.69 to 3.81. Plots that are located along the fringes of the forest reflect a stunted clustering of points, while plots that explicitly show mangrove trimmings and cuts reflect even distribution in terms of point density within each HBn. Both species present in the area (R. mucronata and R. apiculata) exhibits similar clustering, which could represent detection of Rhizophoraceae mangroves.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					617	623		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-617-2016								WOS:000393156000105

"Mangrove classification through the use of Object Oriented Classification and Support Vector Machine of LiDAR datasets: a case study in Naawan and Manticao, Misamis Oriental, Philippines"	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VII	Proceedings of SPIE				SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VII	SEP 27-29, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grows at the surface between the land and the sea in tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. Mangroves are essential in supporting various marine life, thus, it is important to preserve and manage these areas. There are many approaches in creating Mangroves maps, one of which is through the use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). It is a remote sensing technique which uses light pulses to measure distances and to generate three-dimensional point clouds of the Earth's surface. In this study, the topographic LiDAR Data will be used to analyze the geophysical features of the terrain and create a Mangrove map. The dataset that we have were first pre-processed using the LAStools software. It is a software that is used to process LiDAR data sets and create different layers such as DSM, DTM, nDSM, Slope, LiDAR Intensity, LiDAR number of first returns, and CHM. All the aforementioned layers together was used to derive the Mangrove class. Then, an Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) was performed using eCognition. OBIA analyzes a group of pixels with similar properties called objects, as compared to the traditional pixel-based which only examines a single pixel. Multi-threshold and multiresolution segmentation were used to delineate the different classes and split the image into objects. There are four levels of classification, first is the separation of the Land from the Water. Then the Land class was further dived into Ground and Non-ground objects. Furthermore classification of Nonvegetation, Mangroves, and Other Vegetation was done from the Non-ground objects. Lastly Separation of the mangrove class was done through the Use of field verified training points which was then run into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. Different classes were separated using the different layer feature properties, such as mean, mode, standard deviation, geometrical properties, neighbor-related properties, and textural properties. Accuracy assessment was done using a different set of field validation points. This workflow was applied in the classification of Mangroves to a LiDAR dataset of Naawan and Manticao, Misamis Oriental, Philippines. The process presented in this study shows that LiDAR data and its derivatives can be used in extracting and creating Mangrove maps, which can be helpful in managing coastal environment.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0414-8; 978-1-5106-0415-5				2016	10005								UNSP 100051B	10.1117/12.2241964								WOS:000391483900037

THE APPLICATION OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) USING CIELAB COLOR MODEL, COLOR INTENSITY AND COLOR CONSTANCY AS FEATURES FOR ORTHO IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OF BENTHIC HABITATS IN HINATUAN, SURIGAO DEL SUR, PHILIPPINES	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				This study demonstrates the application of CIELAB, Color intensity, and One Dimensional Scalar Constancy as features for image recognition and classifying benthic habitats in an image with the coastal areas of Hinatuan, Surigao Del Sur, Philippines as the study area. The study area is composed of four datasets, namely: (a) B1k66L005, (b) B1k66L021, (c) B1k66L024, and (d) B1k66L0114. SVM optimization was performed in Matlab software with the help of Parallel Computing Toolbox to hasten the SVM computing speed. The image used for collecting samples for SVM procedure was B1k66L0114 in which a total of 134,516 sample objects of mangrove, possible coral existence with rocks, sand, sea, fish pens and sea grasses were collected and processed. The collected samples were then used as training sets for the supervised learning algorithm and for the creation of class definitions. The learned hyper-planes separating one class from another in the multi-dimensional feature space can be thought of as a super feature which will then be used in developing the C (classifier) rule set in eCognition (R) software. The classification results of the sampling site yielded an accuracy of 98.85% which confirms the reliability of remote sensing techniques and analysis employed to orthophotos like the CIELAB, Color Intensity and One dimensional scalar constancy and the use of SVM classification algorithm in classifying benthic habitats.					japitana, michelle/0000-0001-7921-1270												2194-9034						2016	41	B7					189	194		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-189-2016								WOS:000393155900029

With the development of industrialization, urbanization and population growth, wetland area is decreasing. And ecological functions gradually weakened. Based on TM remote sensing image from 2000 to 2011, this paper built decision tree model of wetland classification to extract wetland by classify. The paper has an research on the dynamic change of wetland of Xiamen city. The results show a growing trend between 2000 and2011, wetland area of Xiamen city increased 583.16 hm(2). About 448.93 hm(2) area is changed from wetland to non-wetland, which 440.73 hm(2) area of waters into non-wetland. About 583.16 hm(2) area is changed from non-wetland to wetland. The total area of natural wetlands is increasing 239.39 hm(2); including 477.15 hm(2) non-wetland turn into natural wetlands and 237.76 hm(2) natural wetlands turn into artificial wetlands. This shows that human activities lead to a large of natural wetlands of the study area had transformed into wetlands. According to the wetland area and the average annual rate of change, it is easily seen that tidal wetlands, mangroves, farms and salt wetland are large impacted by human activities or other factors.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-249-7				2016	96						698	702										WOS:000392735700131

Environmental impacts of oil production in the Niger Delta: remote sensing and social survey examination	AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW												This study examines environmental change in Tsekelewu, Niger Delta Region. Both remote sensing and social survey methods were used to assess the impacts of oil exploration activities around the Tsekelewu community. Landsat data between 1984 and 2011 were used for spatiotemporal change in the environment around the community while mixed method approaches were used to collect social data. The results show that several mangrove forest areas were degraded around Tsekelewu during the 1980s and 1990s while the vegetation appeared regenerated during the 2000s, although, at a very slow rate. The rate of regeneration noted from 1999 to 2011 has not fully compensated for the mangrove loss that occurred during the 1980s and early 1990s. After 15 years of uncontrolled forest destruction, little vegetation regeneration, the area was taken over by brackish water mangrove.

There are several techniques are implemented for the land use and land cover classification in different land use and land cover. The all techniques for land use and land cover classification are divided in supervised and unsupervised classification. So, here in this paper the decision tree and k-nearest neighbor based land use and land cover classification techniques are implemented. The proposed techniques are implemented using the scikit-learn data mining package for python. The scikit-learn data mining package is for python language and it consist of the different tools related to data mining which are also very easy to implement in python. The implemented algorithm used the LISS-III multispectral satellite image of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane region for land use and land cover area classification in different classes i.e. forest, water, mangroves and development areas.																			978-9-3805-4419-9				2016							1277	1280										WOS:000388117501072

With the evolution and development of sensors providing satellite image, resolution of object captured enhanced with advance image processing techniques. In forestry, satellite image has been widely used for resources management, planning, monitoring, predicting, etc. However, the uses of satellite image are reported to be moderate and sometimes poor for mangrove forests due to homogenous species existed in salty and inundation areas.

The objective aim of this research is to map out the distribution of the mangrove density using Landsat imageries and GIS technique. Landsat imageries data Path/Row: 123/062 acquired in July 24th 2014 were used in this research. The mangrove and other land cover delineation was conducted with visual interpretation by using standard false color composite of Landsat band 564. The mangrove density was assessed using the vegetation index method, particularly through the NDVI formula with the range value from -1 to 1. The study found that the mangrove density could be classified into three classes i.e spares (NDVI range: -1 - 0.33; equal with < 1,000 Trees/Ha), moderate (NDVI range: 0.33-0.42; equal with >= 1,000 to < 1,500 Trees/Ha), and dense (NDVI range: 0.42-1; equal with >= 1,500 Trees/Ha).

The tin mining area refers to unconventional mining, which is a tin mining activity using simple mechanical instrument. Tin mining activity has been long existed in Bangka Belitung, conducted legally and illegally. Tin mining activity makes coastal supporting ecosystems such as mangrove cannot play their role normally. One of the regency in Bangka Belitung, which its coastal area is affected by unconventional mining, is South Bangka. The aim of this study is to monitor and measure the mangrove density changes. This research use Landsat data acquisition from year 1997, 2009 and 2014 through NDVI analysis. The result shows that tin mining activity in South Bangka coastal area causes reduction in mangrove density. The field studies indicated that 4 types of mangrove was found. The types of mangrove are Avicennia marina, Sonneratia caseolaris, Rhizopora mucronata, and Xylocarpus granatum. Mangrove management is needed in order to maintain the quality of coastal ecosystem. Moreover, the regulation and monitoring of the mining activity should be issued by the government to support environmental sustainability. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the use of ALOS AVNIR-2 (AVNIR-2) image data for LAI estimation in mangrove environment through semi-empirical analysis, and compared and contrasted the results with different mangrove environmental settings and vegetation structures at sites in tropical Karimunjawa Island (KI, Indonesia) and sub-tropical Moreton Bay (MB, Australia). We used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy to estimate LAI in both sites. The results indicated that the regression analyses showed significant coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.82 at KI and 0.83 at MB. The range of LAI values for KI from 0.88 to 5.33 (n = 76, mean = 2.98, SD = 1.04) and for MB from 0.26 to 3.23 (n = 120, mean = 1.97, SD = 0.45). In terms of site comparison, we found that the results of LAI estimation from field measurement and remote sensing data varies across sites; the Karimunjawa Island mangroves had a comparatively wider range and variation of LAI values than the Moreton Bay mangroves. This difference was attributed to the difference in stand heterogeneity and species composition. Further investigation shows that mangrove LAI values are independent of the mangrove structural formation (i. e. scrub, lowclosed forest, closed forest, etc.). Instead, the LAI value depends on the local spatial variation of mangrove phenological stages and canopy cover. The findings provide an understanding of the spatial variation of mangrove vegetation structure for estimating LAI.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1413-6				2016	1755								UNSP 040005	10.1063/1.4958480								WOS:000383024100015						
S	Wagner, GM; Sallema-Mtui, R		Diop, S; Scheren, P; Machiwa, J		Wagner, Greg M.; Sallema-Mtui, Rose			The Rufiji Estuary: Climate Change, Anthropogenic Pressures, Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptive Management Strategies	ESTUARIES: A LIFELINE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN	Estuaries of the World											The Rufiji Estuary supports the largest mangrove area (48,030 ha) in Tanzania, which, together with nearby seagrass beds, numerous coral reefs and islands, form an interacting seascape that provides invaluable ecological services to the Western Indian Ocean. For centuries, the Rufiji resources have been utilized sustainably by coastal people for food, firewood and building materials. However, in recent decades, the Estuary has been severely affected by a complexity of both climate change factors and anthropogenic pressures. A WWF/GEF Coastal Resilience to Climate Change Project was conducted between 2007 and 2009, involving repeated quantitative ecological plot assessment, rapid assessment, remote sensing (based on satellite images taken in 1991 and 2000) and recording indigenous knowledge through social science methods. Change analysis showed several definite trends. Along exposed seaward edges (not sheltered by reefs or islands), there was drastic erosion and mangrove loss attributed to increased wave activity and sea level rise, with over 25 m of coastline being lost along sections of the estuary over a two-year period. Along other seaward edges, some accretion and mangrove growth occurred due to being sheltered from wave action and having adequate sediment load from Bumba channel, which has received the main flow of Rufiji since the shift of the river in 1978. The 1998 El-Nino flooding event caused drastic mangrove loss in riverine areas. On several landward edges of the delta, migration of mangroves inland was detected. Overall, however, losses of mangroves in the Rufiji were clearly greater than gains. Anthropogenic pressures include deforestation in the watershed area and large scale cutting of mangroves for timber and conversion to rice farms. Recommended mitigation and adaptive management strategies include the establishment of buffer zones, mangrove planting, awareness raising and enforcement.																	2214-1553		978-3-319-25370-1; 978-3-319-25368-8				2016							183	207		10.1007/978-3-319-25370-1_12	10.1007/978-3-319-25370-1							WOS:000382769000016						
J	Prasad, KA; Gnanappazham, L				Prasad, Kumar Arun; Gnanappazham, Lakshmanan			Multiple statistical approaches for the discrimination of mangrove species of Rhizophoraceae using transformed field and laboratory hyperspectral data	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												This study aims at discriminating eight mangrove species of Rhizophoraceae family of Indian east coast using field and laboratory spectra in spectral range (350-2500 nm). Parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were applied on spectral data in four spectral modes: (i) reflectance (ii) continuum removed, (iii) additive inverse and (iv) continuum removed additive inverse. We introduced continuum removal of inverse spectra to utilize the advantage of continuum removal in reflectance region. Non-parametric test gave better separability than parametric test. Principal component analysis and stepwise discriminant analysis were applied for feature reduction and to identify optimal wavelengths for species discrimination. To quantify the separability, Jeffries-Matusita distance measure was derived. Green (550 nm), red edge (680-720 nm) and water absorption region (1470 and 1850 nm) were found to be optimal wavelengths for species discrimination. The continuum removal of additive inverse spectra gave better separability than the continuum removed spectra.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2016	31	8					891	912		10.1080/10106049.2015.1094521								WOS:000381011900007

The Landsat 8 OLI image of an interest area in Beilunhekou National Nature Reserve was used to test the spectral metrics. The derived spectral metrics and raw band reflectance data were classified using a support vector machine classifier. Mangrove forest maps were then identified from the classified images. Identification accuracies were compared and evaluated by determining the user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), overall accuracy (OA) and by conducting McNemar's test. Results showed that the use of spectral metrics (UA = 85%, PA = 94%, OA = 95%) outperformed the use of raw band reflectance data (UA = 72%, PA = 82%, OA = 90%). McNemar's test confirmed that the spectral metrics were significantly better than the raw band reflectance data (Z = 4.63, p < 0.05). Therefore, the proposed spectral metrics could improve the accuracy of mangrove forest identification.

Satellite based sensors provide a repetitive and synoptic coverage of inaccessible/larger areas which generated a time series database useful in identification and mapping of environment and resources. These databases form a scientific tool for various stakeholders to device suitable strategies for management of coastal and marine resources. This chapter analyses the various applications of satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling on identification and mapping of mangroves, coral reefs, fishing and molluscan grounds in the coastal marine ecosystems with relevant case studies and illustrations. The mapping methods for mangroves explains the classification protocols, advantages in using different remote sensing techniques and the comparison of different mapping techniques. In case of reef mapping, the vulnerability mapping of reefs due to extreme events is also discussed. Fish movement in a dynamic environment and the mapping of these movements with the help of proxy indicators are also detailed. Molluscan mapping is done based on the biomass differences during different seasons and their physical attributes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						105	123		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_4	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800005

J	Hereher, ME				Hereher, Mohamed E.			Vulnerability assessment of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Climate changes in terms of sea level rise and global warming impose different ramifications upon the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, which extends to 1840 km and witnesses accelerated urban development. The shoreline is mostly resistant to erosion and inundation by seawater due to the inherent hard nature and the relatively higher relief. Digital elevation models reveal that only about 890 km(2) of the coast occurs below 1 m. Global warming has a more conceivable impact upon the coast as numerous coral reef ecosystems exist, and the harm is inevitable. The coastal vulnerability index indicates that about 16 % of the coast is under high vulnerability, whereas 44 % of the coast is intimately low vulnerable to climate change. Higher vulnerable coastal segments include: relatively flat and lowlands; inhabited; and/or coral-mangrove-rich shorelines. Coastal zone management and rescue plans are essential to protect coastal resources for a long-term sustainable development.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	1							30	10.1007/s12665-015-4835-3								WOS:000370239800030						
J	Wang, T; Zhang, HS; Lin, H; Fang, CY				Wang, Ting; Zhang, Hongsheng; Lin, Hui; Fang, Chaoyang			Textural-Spectral Feature-Based Species Classification of Mangroves in Mai Po Nature Reserve from Worldview-3 Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												The identification of species within an ecosystem plays a key role in formulating an inventory for use in the development of conservation management plans. The classification of mangrove species typically involves intensive field surveys, whereas remote sensing techniques represent a cost-efficient means of mapping and monitoring mangrove forests at large scales. However, the coarse spectral resolution of remote sensing technology has up until recently restricted the ability to identify individual species. The more recent development of very high-resolution spatial optical remote sensing sensors and techniques has thus provided new opportunities for the accurate mapping of species within mangrove forests over large areas. When dealing with the complex problems associated with discriminating among species, classifier performance could be enhanced through the adoption of more intrinsic features; such as textural and differential spectral features. This study explored the effectiveness of textural and differential spectral features in mapping mangrove inter-species obtained from WorldView-3 high-spatial-resolution imagery for mangrove species in Hong Kong. Due to the different arrangement of leaves, the branch density, and the average height and size of plants, we found that the differential spectral features could aid in reducing inner-species variability and increasing intra-species separation. Using a combination of textural and differential spectral features thus represents a promising tool for discriminating among mangrove species. Experimental results suggest that combining these features can greatly improve mapping accuracy, thereby providing more reliable mapping results.

J	Huang, ZH				Huang, Zhehuang			Improved Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization for Mangroves Classification	JOURNAL OF SENSORS												Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is a population based optimization algorithm inspired by social behavior of bird flocking which combines the ideas of quantum computing. For many optimization problems, traditional QPSO algorithm can produce high-quality solution within a reasonable computation time and relatively stable convergence characteristics. But QPSO algorithm also showed some unsatisfactory issues in practical applications, such as premature convergence and poor ability in global optimization. To solve these problems, an improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and implemented in this paper. There are three main works in this paper. Firstly, an improved QPSO algorithm is introduced which can enhance decision making ability of the model. Secondly, we introduce synergetic neural network model to mangroves classification for the first time which can better handle fuzzy matching of remote sensing image. Finally, the improved QPSO algorithm is used to realize the optimization of network parameter. The experiments on mangroves classification showed that the improved algorithm has more powerful global exploration ability and faster convergence speed.																	1687-725X	1687-7268					2016									9264690	10.1155/2016/9264690								WOS:000367981800001

Depletion of wild fishery stocks, rising global populations, continuing demand for food fish, and international trade has driven aquaculture's tremendous expansion during the last decades - in terms of production volume and value. Farmed aquatic products are among the most widely traded commodities in the world food economy. Aquaculture has mainly been developed in valuable fertile coastal environments and caused large-scale land use changes, destruction and loss of coastal wetlands and pollution of waters and soils. This article presents an overview of the relevance, current status and distribution of aquaculture in global and regional scales and depicts its key environmental impacts. Quantitative assessment of the spatial extent, distribution, and dynamics of aquaculture is of utmost importance for a sustainable management of our planet's land and water resources ensuring human and environmental health. The article points to the potential of remote sensing to detect, map and monitor large-scale aquaculture areas and gives a complementary review of satellite remote sensing studies addressing the observation of aquaculture including site selection, site detection and monitoring of related impacts on the environment.

J	Wicaksono, P; Danoedoro, P; Hartono; Nehren, U				Wicaksono, Pramaditya; Danoedoro, Projo; Hartono; Nehren, Udo			Mangrove biomass carbon stock mapping of the Karimunjawa Islands using multispectral remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Among vegetated coastal habitats, mangrove forests are among the densest carbon pools. They store their organic carbon in the surrounding soil and thus the sequestered carbon stays in the sediment for a long time and cannot be easily returned to the atmosphere. Additionally, mangroves also provide various important ecosystem services in coastal areas and surroundings. Accordingly, it is important to understand the distribution of biomass carbon stock in mangrove habitats in a spatial and temporal context, not only to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, but also for their sustainability. The objectives of this research are to map the mangrove carbon stock and estimate the total biomass carbon stock sheltered by mangrove forests, with the Karimunjawa Islands as a study site, using the widely available passive remote sensing system ALOS AVNIR-2. The modelling and mapping of mangrove carbon stock incorporates the integration of image pixel values and mangroves field data via empirical modelling. Vegetation indices and PC bands at different levels of radiometric corrections were all used as the input in the mangrove carbon stock modelling so that the effectiveness and sensitivity of different image transformations to particular radiometric correction levels could be analysed and understood. Afterward, the accuracy and effectiveness of each mangrove carbon stock-mapping routine was compared and evaluated. The accuracy of the best mangrove above-ground carbon stock (AGC) map modelled from vegetation index is 77.1% (EVI1, SE 5.89 kg C m(-2)), and for mangrove below-ground carbon stock (BGC) it is 60.0% (GEMI, SE 2.54 kg C m(-2)). The mangrove carbon stock map from ALOS AVNIR-2 PC bands showed a maximum accuracy of 77.8% (PC2, SE 5.71 kg C m(-2)) and 60.8% (PC2, SE 2.48 kg C m(-2)) for AGC and BGC respectively. From the resulting maps, the Karimunjawa Islands are estimated to shelter 96,482 tonnes C of mangroves AGC with a mean value of 21.64 kg C m(-2) and 24,064 tonnes C of mangroves BGC with a mean value of 5.39 kg C m(-2). Potentially, there are approximately 120,546 tonnes C of mangrove biomass carbon stock in the Karimunjawa Islands. Remote-sensing reflectance can successfully model mangrove carbon stock based on the relationship between mangrove canopy properties, represented by leaf area index (LAI) and the tree or root biomass carbon stock. The accuracy of the mangrove carbon stock map is subject to errors, which are sourced mainly from: (1) the absence of a species-specific biomass allometric equation for several species present in the study area; (2) the generalized standard conversion value of mangrove biomass to mangrove carbon stock; (3) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and mangrove LAI; (4) the relationship between mangrove reflectance and above-ground mangrove biomass and carbon stock due to its relationship with LAI; (5) the relationship between mangrove LAI and mangrove below-ground parts; (6) the inability to perform mangrove carbon stock modelling at the species level due to the complexities of the mangrove forest in the study area; (7) background reflectance and atmospheric path radiance that could not be completely minimized using image radiometric corrections and transformations; and (8) spatial displacement between the actual location of the mangrove forest in the field and the corresponding pixel in the image. The availability of mangrove biomass carbon stock maps is beneficial for carrying out various management activities, and is also very important for the resilience of mangroves to changing environments.

J	Saul, S; Purkis, S				Saul, Steven; Purkis, Sam			Semi-Automated Object-Based Classification of Coral Reef Habitat using Discrete Choice Models	REMOTE SENSING												As for terrestrial remote sensing, pixel-based classifiers have traditionally been used to map coral reef habitats. For pixel-based classifiers, habitat assignment is based on the spectral or textural properties of each individual pixel in the scene. More recently, however, object-based classifications, those based on information from a set of contiguous pixels with similar properties, have found favor with the reef mapping community and are starting to be extensively deployed. Object-based classifiers have an advantage over pixel-based in that they are less compromised by the inevitable inhomogeneity in per-pixel spectral response caused, primarily, by variations in water depth. One aspect of the object-based classification workflow is the assignment of each image object to a habitat class on the basis of its spectral, textural, or geometric properties. While a skilled image interpreter can achieve this task accurately through manual editing, full or partial automation is desirable for large-scale reef mapping projects of the magnitude which are useful for marine spatial planning. To this end, this paper trials the use of multinomial logistic discrete choice models to classify coral reef habitats identified through object-based segmentation of satellite imagery. Our results suggest that these models can attain assignment accuracies of about 85%, while also reducing the time needed to produce the map, as compared to manual methods. Limitations of this approach include misclassification of image objects at the interface between some habitat types due to the soft gradation in nature between habitats, the robustness of the segmentation algorithm used, and the selection of a strong training dataset. Finally, due to the probabilistic nature of multinomial logistic models, the analyst can estimate a map of uncertainty associated with the habitat classifications. Quantifying uncertainty is important to the end-user when developing marine spatial planning scenarios and populating spatial models from reef habitat maps.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					15894	15916		10.3390/rs71215810								WOS:000367534000005

Yet they are increasingly threatened by deforestation, conversion to agriculture and development, reducing the benefits they provide for local livelihoods, coastal protection and climate change mitigation. Accordingly, accurate estimates of mangrove area and change are fundamental for developing strategies for sustainable use, conservation and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). The Zambezi River Delta in Mozambique contains one of the largest mangrove forests in Africa, and deforestation has been reported to be substantial, however these estimates vary widely. We used Landsat imagery from 1994, 2000 and 2013, to estimate a total current mangrove area of 37,034 ha, which is a net increase of 3723 ha over 19 years. The land cover change assessment was also used to provide perspective on ecosystem carbon stocks, showing that the Zambezi Delta mangrove ecosystem acts as a large carbon sink. Our findings reinforce the importance of conducting land cover change assessments using coherent data and analytical models, coupled with field validation. Broader application of our approach could help quantify the rates of natural change from erosion and land aggradation contrasted with anthropogenic causes.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16504	16518		10.3390/rs71215838								WOS:000367534000036

Most studies attribute this purely to underlying physical templates, such as groundwater salinity gradients caused by tidal flux and topography. However, a few recent studies hypothesize that self-reinforcing feedback between vegetation and vadose zone salinity are also involved and create a bistable situation in which either halophytic dominated habitat or freshwater plant communities may dominate as alternative stable states. Here, we revisit the bistability hypothesis and demonstrate the mechanisms that result in bistability. We demonstrate with remote sensing imagery the sharp boundaries between freshwater hardwood hammock communities in southern Florida and halophytic communities such as buttonwood hammocks and mangroves. We further document from the literature how transpiration of mangroves and freshwater plants respond differently to vadose zone salinity, thus altering the salinity through feedback. Using mathematical models, we show how the self-reinforcing feedback, together with physical template, controls the ecotones between halophytic and freshwater communities. Regions of bistability along environmental gradients of salinity have the potential for large-scale vegetation shifts following pulse disturbances such as hurricane tidal surges in Florida, or tsunamis in other regions. The size of the region of bistability can be large for low-lying coastal habitat due to the saline water table, which extends inland due to salinity intrusion. We suggest coupling ecological and hydrologic processes as a framework for future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial and temporal variability in spectral-based surface energy evapotranspiration measured from Landsat 5TM across two mangrove ecotones	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Coastal mangroves lose large amounts of water through evapotranspiration (ET) that can be equivalent to the amount of annual rainfall in certain years. Satellite remote sensing can play a crucial role in identifying regional ET trends and surface energy changes after disturbances in isolated and inaccessible areas of coastal mangrove wetlands, like those found in Everglades National Park in southern Florida. Using a combination of long-term datasets acquired from the NASA Landsat 5TM satellite database and the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research project, the present study investigates how ET as well as radiation and other energy balance parameters in the Everglades mangrove ecotone have responded to multiple hurricane events and restoration projects over the past two decades. An energy balance model using satellite data was used to estimate latent heat (lambda E) in tall and scrub mangrove environments. An eddy-covariance tower and weather tower supplied long-term data of multiple environmental and. meteorological parameters that were used in calibrating and testing the modeled results from the Landsat images. Results identified significant differences in lambda E and soil heat flux measurements between the tall and scrub, and fringe and basin mangrove environments. The scrub mangrove site had the lowest lambda E rates, highest soil heat flux and lowest biophysical index (i.e., Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) values. Mangrove damage and mortality associated with two strong hurricanes decreased PVC, NDVI, and SAVI, and increased soil heat flux at the tall mangrove site located in a basin-type environment. Recovery of the spectral characteristics, energy balance parameters and lambda E following hurricane disturbance was quicker in fringe mangroves than in basin mangroves. Latent heat fluxes (lambda E) were also relatively high after each storm and may have increased as a result of increasing vapor pressure deficits. Remote sensing of the surface energy balance and lambda E of mangrove forests can help our understanding of how these environments respond to disturbances to the landscape and the effect that these changes can have on the energy and water budget. Moreover, relationships between energy and water balance components developed for the coastal mangroves of southern Florida could be extrapolated to other mangrove systems in the Caribbean to measure changes caused by natural events and human modifications.

Mapping and monitoring of land use/land cover changes in Neil Island (South Andaman) using geospatial approaches	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Present study examines the dynamics of land use/land cover changes to Neil Island, South Andaman using Remote Sensing and GIS for a period of 13 years. Geocoded satellite imageries of Landsat TM (2000) and Landsat ETM 8 (2013) were used to identify the changes between 2000 and 2013. Visual interpretation technique was carried out to identify the features from the satellite imagery along with ground truth verifications. Land use categories such as forest area, mangroves, coral reefs, sandy beach, water body and built-up land have been identified and mapped. The present status (2013) of these resources is as follows: forest area 735.17 ha (40.17%), built-up land covers 601.15 ha (32.85%), coral reef covers an area of 441.00 ha (24.10%), mangroves covers 34.03 ha (1.86%) and sandy beach covers 16.15 ha (0.88%). Forest area was the largest component of land use feature which shows a significant change from 2000 to 2013. Aerial extent of coral reef and mangroves was decreased to 9.21 ha and 2.32 ha respectively.

Oceanic and climatic drivers of mangrove changes in the Gulf of Uraba, Colombian Caribbean	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The Gulf of Uraba is the largest estuary on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The aim of this research was to analyse the oceanic, climatic and environmental variables that influence mangrove structure and composition in the gulf. Based on the availability of remote sensing, the study area was divided into western and eastern zones. The spatial pattern of environmental variables (water salinity, pH and percentage of organic matter, sand, silt and clay in the soils) and oceanic and climatic variables (winds, wave height and wave period) was analysed. The relationship of these variables with variables of vegetation structure (basal area, diameter at breast height, tree height, and abundance of seedlings of mangrove species in 1 m(2) subplots) was analysed in 27 plots of 500 m(2) containing fringe mangroves and 5 plots containing basin mangroves. Mangroves of the western zone showed a higher structural development and were dominated by Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove). This zone is supplied by fresh water and sediments, and the soils have a high content of organic matter and clay and a low degree of anthropogenic disturbance. The eastern zone was characterized by higher pore water salinity due to lower freshwater input from rivers. In this area there is a smaller impact of waves and winds, higher sedimentation rates, high anthropogenic disturbance and mangroves are dominated by Avicennia germinans (black mangrove). Although Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) did not show a particular spatial pattern, due to its tolerance to open canopy conditions it was commonly found in anthropogenically disturbed areas.

In this context, remote sensing is capable of providing information on mangrove status and changes over a large spatial extent and in a continuous manner. In this study we used Landsat satellite images to analyze the changes over a period of 25 years of mangrove areas in Iskandar Malaysia (IM), the fastest growing national special economic region located in southern Johor, Malaysia. We tested the use of two widely used digital classification techniques to classify mangrove areas. The Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) technique provided significantly higher user, producer and overall accuracies and less salt and pepper effects compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. The classified satellite images using the MLC technique showed that IM lost 6740 ha of mangrove areas from 1989 to 2014. Nevertheless, a gain of 710 ha of mangroves was observed in this region, resulting in a net loss of 6030 ha or 33%. The loss of about 241 ha per year of mangroves was associated with a steady increase in urban land use (1225 ha per year) from 1989 until 2014. Action is necessary to protect the existing mangrove cover from further loss. Gazetting of the remaining mangrove sites as protected areas or forest reserves and introducing tourism activities in mangrove areas can ensure the continued survival of mangroves in IM.

Towards an integration of scale and complexity in marine ecology	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Manipulative field experiments provide a window into the complexity of nature. Yet there is concern that we lack resolution by conducting experiments on a scale that is too small and short to include the relevant complexity of the study system. We addressed this issue by asking how and why the scale (local and global spatial extent, spatial grain, duration) and complexity (number of species, factors, treatment combinations) of experiments performed on marine hard substrata (rocky intertidal, RI; coral reef, CR; rocky subtidal, RS; mangrove root, MR) has changed by assessing 311 total experiments published since 1961 in Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field experiments include site replication, as only 34.7% of all experiments were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding of marine communities and ecosystems.

LocationThe pristine 300-km-long coast of French Guiana, South America. MethodsWe produced time series of mangrove maps using archival remote sensing images. We retrieved significant wave heights (H-S), mean wave periods (T-M) and mean wave directions ((M)) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis products. We used complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) decomposition to extract the main mode of mangrove surface area (M-S) variability and singular value decomposition (SVD) to test the relationships between M-S and H-S,T-M and (M). ResultsThe leading mode of variability extracted from the CEOF decomposition of M-S captured approximately 78% of the total auto-covariance and revealed multi-decadal fluctuations in M-S that were on the order of 10,000ha. The SVD results indicated that the multi-decadal fluctuation in M-S cross-covaried with H-S,T-M and (M) over the North Atlantic sector, particularly in the region immediately off the French Guiana coast that is remotely forced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) during the winter season. Main conclusionsWe provide evidence based on linear statistics that variations in the extent of mangroves are driven by large-scale, low-frequency changes in North Atlantic waves that are related to the NAO. Such a relationship is hypothesized to operate through wave pounding, which alters the mud substrates on which mangroves thrive and which varies with the phase of the NAO. In addition to long-term trends due to anthropogenic climate change, our results stress the importance of studying low-frequency modes of climate variability to understand changes in the extent of mangroves.

J	Aziz, AA; Phinn, S; Dargusch, P				Aziz, Ammar Abdul; Phinn, Stuart; Dargusch, Paul			Investigating the decline of ecosystem services in a production mangrove forest using Landsat and object-based image analysis	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve is widely recognised as a sustainably managed mangrove forest. However, recently evidence of multiple ecosystem services decline has emerged. The primary objective of this study was to apply remote sensing techniques to assess the impact of the silviculture in the mangrove forest reserve on the provision of ecosystem services. It applied an object-based approach to classify multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The classified images enabled the study to characterise and analyse the spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of stand age composition and structure over a 35 year period. Links were established between the classified images and the ecosystem services assessment based on the assumption that the classification results provided a reliable proxy for an indirect analysis on the temporal and spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of the mangrove forest reserve. The relationship between the potential impacts of the observed changes derived from the classified images with the data obtained from the ecosystem services assessment were analysed. The analysis showed that the fluctuation in greenwood yield was affected by varying rates of regeneration, exposure to excessive thinning and delays in harvesting. The production of blood cockles around the mudflats of the mangrove forest reserve was determined to be influenced by both timber extraction and natural coastal erosion. An undetected ecological change in the late eighties and anthropogenic disturbances were possible key factors behind the decline in the population of the Milky Stork and migratory shorebirds. The study highlights the importance of understanding and managing the trade-offs between wood production and ecosystem services in a managed mangrove forest and provides an important reference for the future management of the Matang Forest Reserve and other multiple-use wetland forests.

Low chlorophyll concentration may also indicate plant physiological stress. Compared to other terrestrial vegetation, mangrove chlorophyll variations are poorly understood. This study quantifies the spatial distribution of mangrove canopy chlorophyll variation using remotely sensed data and field samples over the Rapid Creek mangrove forest in Darwin, Australia. Mangrove leaf samples were collected and analyzed for chlorophyll content in the laboratory. Once the leaf area index (LAI) of sampled trees was estimated using the digital cover photography method, the canopy chlorophyll contents were calculated. Then, the nonlinear random forests regression algorithm was used to describe the relationship between canopy chlorophyll content and remotely sensed data (WorldView-2 satellite image bands and their spectral transformations), and to estimate the spatial distribution of canopy chlorophyll variation. The imagery was evaluated at full 2 m spatial resolution, as well as at decreased resampled resolutions of 5 m and 10 m. The root mean squared errors with validation samples were 0.82, 0.64 and 0.65 g/m(2) for maps at 2 m, 5 m and 10 m spatial resolution respectively. The correlation coefficient was analyzed for the relationship between measured and predicted chlorophyll values. The highest correlation: 0.71 was observed at 5 m spatial resolution (R-2 = 0.5). We therefore concluded that estimating mangrove chlorophyll content from remotely sensed data is possible using red, red-edge, NIR1 and NIR2 bands and their spectral transformations as predictors at 5 m spatial resolution.

Sudhakar			Geospatial monitoring and prioritization of forest fire incidences in Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Forest fire has been identified as one of the key environmental issue for long-term conservation of biodiversity and has impact on global climate. Spatially multiple observations are necessary for monitoring of forest fires in tropics for understanding conservation efficacy and sustaining biodiversity in protected areas. The present work was carried out to estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas and fire frequency using Resourcesat Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The spatio-temporal analysis shows that an area of 7514.10 km(2) (29.22 % of total forest cover) has been affected by forest fires. Six major forest types are distributed in Andhra Pradesh, i.e. semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous, dry evergreen, thorn and mangroves. Of the total forest burnt area, dry deciduous forests account for >75 %. District-wise analysis shows that Kurnool, Prakasam and Cuddapah have shown >100 km(2) of burnt area every year. The total forest burnt area estimate covering protected areas ranges between 6.9 and 22.3 % during the study period. Spatial burnt area analysis for protected areas in 2014 indicates 37.2 % of fire incidences in the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve followed by 20.2 % in the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary, 20.1 % in the Sri Venkateswara Wildlife Sanctuary and 17.4 % in the Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The analysis of cumulative fire occurrences from 2009 to 2014 has helped in delineation of conservation priority hotspots using a spatial grid cell approach. Conservation priority hotspots I and II are distributed in major parts of study area including protected areas of the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve and Gundla Brahmeswaram Wildlife Sanctuary. The spatial database generated will be useful in studies related to influence of fires on species adaptability, ecological damage assessment and conservation planning.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2015	187	10							616	10.1007/s10661-015-4821-y								WOS:000362284700011	26350795

It covers the area from the Bernam River basin in south Perak to the Linggi River basin in Negri Sembilan. The analysis of the land use change patterns and the prediction of future changes can highlight the problems of continuing current pattern of growth. Kuala Langat as the case study is located in the strategic area, because this area is identified as a Klang Valley II. The district has been experiencing rapid development, influence by some fast growing new centers like Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Klang Valley, Cyberjaya, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur mega-urban region. These have caused degradations of the natural habitats located in this area such as forests, peat swamp, mangroves and wetlands and land use changes from forest and agriculture to development areas. Also some sensitive area such as reclaimed lands, geo-disaster area, flash flood prone areas, dumping grounds and high erosion area need urgent sustainable plan for future development. Also, coastal lands are being developed very fast through establishments of residential, industrial and commercial centers. The analysis of land use changes have led to a better understanding in exploring suitable growth pattern for future development. The land use map obtained from Department of Agriculture for the year 1974 and 1981 and data of Landsat TM for the years of 1988, 1991, 1996 and 2010 obtained from the Malaysian Center for Remote Sensing were analyzed using GIS. From the investigation of land use changes detection over 35 years, the current unsustainable pattern of growth was highlighted. This emphasizes the urgent need for a sustainable development plan.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				OCT	2015	17	5					1003	1016		10.1007/s10668-014-9585-y								WOS:000361483600003

These ecotones between aquatic and terrestrial environments also provide protection from storm damage, run-off filtering, and recharge of aquifers. Many wetlands along coasts have been exposed to stress-inducing alterations globally, including dredge and fill operations, hydrologic modifications, pollutants, impoundments, fragmentation by roads/ditches, and sea level rise. For wetland protection and sensible coastal development, there is a need to monitor these ecosystems at global and regional scales. Recent advances in satellite sensor design and data analysis are providing practical methods for monitoring natural and man-made changes in wetlands. However, available satellite remote sensors have been limited to mapping primarily wetland location and extent. This paper describes how the HyspIRI hyperspectral and thermal infrared sensors can be used to study and map key ecological properties, such as species composition, biomass, hydrology, and evapotranspiration of tidal salt and brackish marshes and mangroves, and perhaps other major wetland types, including freshwater marshes and wooded/shrub wetlands.

J	Abd Rahman, A				Abd Rahman, Azimah			The Importance of Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing in Protecting Migratory Bird Habitat Population at Matang Mangrove Forest, Perak	SAINS MALAYSIANA												The arrival of migratory bird species to Matang Mangrove Forest, Perak is a unique phenomenon and has a great potential for commercialization. However, for the last ten years the arrival of migratory bird species to this area has alarmingly decline. The development around Matang Mangrove Forest was identified as the main factor of this problem. Then, the lack of management and monitoring of migratory bird species that are not systematic enough also contribute to this problem. Conventional method still practiced in survey and bird monitoring by the Department of Wild Life and National Park (PERHILITAN) for data and information recorded purposes. Therefore, this study is needed to introduce the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing technology as the main approach that can help in improving the management and monitoring of migratory birds. GIS applications were used in mapping data of study parameters that were collected using the appropriate software like ArcGIS 10.1 and remote sensing was used to model the parameter study using ERDAS Imagine 8.5 software. Six parameters was used in this study including temperature, rainfall, food, elevation, land use and land cover. Parameters modeling are able to show the distribution of migratory bird in certain location using mapping interpretation. The result of this modeling help to identify the important parameter that affect the migratory bird distribution in Matang Mangrove Forest. This information also enables DWNP to understand more about migratory bird needs in their habitat selection. Besides that, this modeling result can assist DWNP to set up an implementation strategy to protect and preserve Matang Mangrove Forest in ensuring continuous arrival of migratory bird in future.																	0126-6039					SEP	2015	44	9					1229	1239		10.17576/jsm-2015-4409-03								WOS:000364595800003

However, there are few studies that calibrate reliable statistical models for mangrove AGB. This study quantifies the differences of accuracy in AGB estimation between the results obtained with and without the consideration of species types using Worldview-2 images and field surveys. A Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP ANN) based model is developed for the accurate estimation of uneven-aged and dense mangrove forest biomass. The contributions of the input variables are further quantified using a Weights method based on BP ANN model. Two types of mangrove species, Sonneratia apetala (S. apetala) and Kandelia candel (K. candel), are examined in this study. Results show that the species type information is the most important variable for AGB estimation, and the red edge band and the associated vegetation indices from WorldView-2 images are more sensitive to mangrove AGB than other bands and vegetation indices. The RMSE of biomass estimation at the incorporation of species as a dummy variable is 19.17% lower than that of the mixed species level. The results demonstrate that species type information obtained from the WorldView-2 images can significantly improve of the accuracy of the biomass estimation.

This delta is characterized by both 'pure' and 'mixed' mangrove forest patches where photons interact with multiple species within the instantaneous field of view of the hyperspectral sensor, and multiple scattering between the vegetation canopies becomes significantly nonlinear. This paper attempts to apply the principle of multiple scattering of light in naturally occurring conditions and see how best they describe the resultant mixed spectra for certain endmember distributions. It is observed that natural forests, mixed mangrove forest in this case, are better suited for non-linear scattering models as compared to linear models. The non-linear model has successfully identified areas of interaction of mangrove mixtures such as ceriops-excoecaria-phoenix, excoecaria- avicennia alba avicennia officinalis etc. in the study area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				SEP	2015	43	3					559	569		10.1007/s12524-014-0437-x								WOS:000359730500012

Mapping mangrove changes in the Matang Mangrove Forest using multi temporal satellite imageries	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The Matang Mangrove Forest is the largest single mangrove forest in Peninsular Malaysia, covering an area of more than 40,000 ha. As a national treasure, it lies under the jurisdiction of both the federal and state authorities. Monitoring temporal changes of mangrove area on a large scale requires a more efficient tool. Remote sensing is often a reliable alternative to ground-survey methods that provides useful source of information and coverage that is timely and complete especially in mangroves areas where accessibility is difficult. In this study, status and changes of land use and land cover in the Matang Mangrove Forest during the past 18 years (1993-1999,1999 to 2011 and 1993 to 2011) were determined using multi temporal satellites, and threats to the ecosystems were also identified. Classification of land use and land cover approach was implemented using the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) along with vegetation index differencing (NDVI) technique. Classification accuracy at 85.7%, 90%, and 88.9% with Kappa statistics of 0.82, 0.88, and 0.94 respectively for 1993, 1999 and 2011 image were obtained. The overall change in the area during the 18-year period indicated the loss of mangrove area at 8017.3 ha, while 2998 ha was newly planted or rehabilitated. The present study revealed that Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata are still being preserved, accounting to more than 80%. of the total species. Temporal changes of the mangrove for the 18-year period showed that the mangroves were converted to water bodies at 31.1%, dry land forest at 30.6%, oil palm plantation at 18.9%, aquaculture at 11.1%, paddy plantation at 4.9%, horticulture at 3.1%, and urban settlement area at 0.3%. Threats towards the mangrove area were due to erosion, tree harvesting rotation, transitional forest, shrimp ponds, illegal agricultural activities and trespassing. The findings indicated an approach in collecting regular and appropriate mangrove forest area database and detection of activities that violate regulations. This will provide adequate information to the stakeholders in enhancing the management practise and for legislative purposes. Hence, combinations of these approaches has been proven to be adequate in detecting changes in the mangrove area and indicating the nature of the changes which will promote and enhance the management planning process towards sustainability of the Matang Mangrove Forest.

However, a component may also be due to factors that are commonly associated with anthropogenic climate change including higher air temperatures, variations in rainfall, increases in storm frequencies and intensities, and rising sea levels. The expected responses of mangrove to these drivers include changes in extent (latitudinal, seaward and landward), growth rates and productivity, and species composition. This paper reviews such responses and then, using examples from Australia, illustrates how these might appear within and be detected using single-date or time-series of remote sensing data acquired in different modes (e.g., aerial photography, optical and radar). In doing so, it informs countries and organisations of the potential impacts of climate change on mangrove forests and how these may be monitored using remote sensing data.																	2198-6436					SEP	2015	1	3					178	194		10.1007/s40725-015-0018-4								WOS:000218417800004

Analysis of fragmentation and disturbance regimes in south Gujarat forests, India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Forests, world over, have degraded, fragmented, and depleted as human population has swelled. In the present study, the forest fragmentation and the disturbance regimes were assessed in south Gujarat using satellite image-based forest and land use mapping followed by landscape analysis using Spatial Landscape Modelling (SPLAM) software. The on-screen visual interpretation of Resourcesat-1 LISS-III imagery facilitated in mapping of 9 forest and 12 non-forest classes. The observations revealed that 51.68 % of the forest area had low fragmentation while the rest had medium to high fragmentation. Among the vegetation types, 62.84 % of Tropical Moist Mixed Deciduous (TMMD) and 54.88 % of Tropical Mixed Dry Deciduous (TMDD) forests had low level of fragmentation whereas 15.5 % mangrove forest had high fragmentation. The study also showed that 72.53 % of the total forest area had low disturbance. High disturbance was noticed in Riverine forest (22.78 %) while TMMD forest was found to be less disturbed than TMDD forest. District-wise analysis revealed that forests of Valsad, Navsari and Bharuch were highly disturbed as well as fragmented whereas forests of The Dangs, Surat and Narmada had low disturbance and fragmentation. The study demonstrated important role of remote sensing, GIS, and SPLAM in forest/land use mapping and disturbance regimes and fragmentation status assessment.																	0564-3295					SEP	2015	56	3					275	288										WOS:000356840400001

Pollutant tracking for 3 Western North Atlantic sea grasses by remote sensing: Preliminary diminishing white light responses of Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, and Zostera marina	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Sea grasses are foundation species for estuarine ecosystems. The available light for sea grasses diminishes rapidly during pollutant spills, effluent releases, disturbances such as intense riverine input, and tidal changes. We studied how sea grasses' remote-sensing signatures and light-capturing ability respond to short term light alterations. In vivo responses were measured over the entire visible-light spectra to diminishing white-light on whole-living-plants' spectral reflectance, including 6 h of full oceanic-light fluences from 10% to 100%. We analyzed differences by various reflectance indices. We compared the sea grasses species responses of tropical vs. temperate and intertidals (Halodule wrightii, and Zostera marina) vs. subtidal (Thalassia testudinum). Reflectance diminished with decreasing light intensity that coincided with greater accessory pigment stimulation (anthocyanin, carotenoids, xanthins). Chlorophyll a and Chlorophyll b differed significantly among species (Thalassia vs. Halodule). Photosynthetic efficiency diminished at high light intensities. The NDVI index was inadequate to perceive these differences. Our results demonstrate the leaf-level utility of data to remote sensing for mapping sea grass and sea grass stress.

Mapping the spread and distribution of S. alterniflora is the first step toward understanding the factors that determine the population expansion patterns. Remote sensing is a promising tool to monitor the expansion of S. alterniflora. Twelve Landsat TM images and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to delineate the invasion of S. alterniflora from 1993 to 2009, and SPOT 6 images and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) were used to map the distribution of S. alterniflora in 2014. In situ data and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were used as supplementary data. S. alterniflora spread rapidly in Yueqing Bay over the past 21 years. Between 1993 and 2009, the area of S. alterniflora increased by 608 times (from 4 to 2432 ha). The rapid expansion of S. alterniflora covered almost all of the bare mudflats around the mangrove forests and the cultivated mudflats. However, from 2009 to 2014, the rate of expansion of S. alterniflora began to slow down in Yueqing Bay, and the total area of S. alterniflora in Yantian decreased by 275 ha. These phenomena can be explained by the landscape changes and ecological niches. Through the expansion of S. alterniflora, it was found that the ecological significance and environmental impact of S. alterniflora was different in different regions in Yueqing Bay. The conservation plans for Yueqing Bay should consider both the positive and negative effects of S. alterniflora, and the governmental policy should be based on the different circumstances of the regions.																	1932-6203					AUG 11	2015	10	8							e0135538	10.1371/journal.pone.0135538								WOS:000359353300091	26263172

How remote sensing supports mangrove ecosystem service valuation: A case study in Ca Mau province, Vietnam	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												This paper highlights the importance of using household survey and remote sensing data for the assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (fisheries and timber related products, carbon sequestration, storm protection) in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam. The results indicate that remote sensing plays an important role in ecosystem service valuation in the large areas where mangroves and aquaculture are mixed. We estimated the value of mangrove ecosystem services using market price and replacement cost approaches to determine an initial assessment of the overall contribution of mangroves to human well-being. The total estimated value was US$ 600 million/year for 187,533 ha (approximately US$ 3000/ ha/year), which is slightly smaller than the gross domestic product (GDP) of the province (US$ 0.69 billion in 2010). However, this is only a partial estimate that does not consider other services (tourism, biocliversity, cultural and social values), clue to the absence of primary data The main contribution of this study is that it is the first to combine the approaches of remote sensing and household survey for the quantification of mangrove ecosystem services in the mangrove-shrimp integrated system. Our findings indicate that the continued expansion of acivaculture has reduced the benefits to local communities provided by the mangrove ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015

Catastrophic shifts between states can be induced by gradual environmental change or by disturbance events. These feedbacks and outcomes are key to the sustainability and resilience of vegetated coastlines, especially as modulated by human activity, sea level rise, and climate change. Whereas multiple stable state theory has been invoked to model salt marsh responses to sediment supply and sea level change, there has been comparatively little empirical verification of the theory for salt marshes or other coastal wetlands. Especially lacking is long-term evidence documenting if or how stable states are established and maintained at ecosystem scales. Laboratory and field-plot studies are informative, but of necessarily limited spatial and temporal scope. For the purposes of long-term, coastal-scale monitoring, remote sensing is the best viable option. This review summarizes the above topics and highlights the emerging promise and challenges of using remote sensing-based analyses to validate coastal wetland dynamic state theories. This significant opportunity is further framed by a proposed list of scientific advances needed to more thoroughly develop the field.

FORMATION, MOVEMENT, AND RESTORATION OF DEAD INTERTIDAL OYSTER REEFS IN CANAVERAL NATIONAL SEASHORE AND MOSQUITO LAGOON, FLORIDA	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Globally, 85% of shellfish reefs have been lost during the past century. The severe loss of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica has encouraged different types of restoration efforts in the United States. In Mosquito Lagoon (ML), a shallow-water estuary on the east coast of central Florida, restoration focuses on providing additional substrate for larval recruitment via deployment of stabilized oyster shell. To assess the current number and area of natural, dead, and restored oyster reefs within ML, aerial photographs from 2009 were digitized using ArcGIS software. All reefs were screen digitized using a reef "signature" to estimate the surface area of each reef type. The maps from 2009 were then used as a guide to digitizing the historical aerial photographs (1943, 1951, 1967, 1971, 1984, 1995, and 2006). Oyster habitat within ML has decreased by almost 15 hectares between 1943 and 2009, which constitutes 24% of the 1943 lagoon-wide coverage. The impacts were greater in Canaveral National Seashore, which covers the southern ML; 40% of the oyster coverage within the park has been lost since 1943. Dead reefs were found adjacent to important boating channels. Tracked dead reefs exhibited a continuous migration into the mangrove islands located landward of the original live reefs, with some dead reefs completely washing up into the marsh. Restoration of dead reefs with stabilized oyster shells has added nearly 1 hectare of live oyster habitat to ML as of January 2009. This research demonstrates that dead reefs are increasing in number and coverage within ML, but this trend can be reversed with restoration.																	0730-8000	1943-6319				AUG	2015	34	2					251	258		10.2983/035.034.0206								WOS:000360410500006

Assessment of Egypt's Red Sea coastal sensitivity to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A coastal sensitivity index (CSI) was developed to assess the response of the Red Sea coast in Egypt to climate change in terms of sea level rise and global warming. Six different variables pertaining to the intrinsic characteristics of the coast that extends to 1200 km were utilized, notably: coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, width of the coastal plain, shoreline exposure, fauna/flora and land use. Data have been extracted, manipulated and presented using remote sensing and GIS analysis. The resulting coastal sensitivity map depicts the susceptibility levels of the Red Sea coastal plain to climate change. The most severely sensitive segments (very high CSI) account for 31 % (365 km) of the coast. They occur across unconsolidated, flat, wide, exposed, ecologically effective and/or inhabited coasts. On the other hand, the least sensitive (low CSI) coastal segments total 245 km (20 %) and are mainly rocky, steep, narrow, barren and/or inaccessible shores. Eustatic sea level rise by 1 m should inundate a coastal area of 106 km(2), whereas a sudden tsunami of 5 m height should overwhelm 724 km(2), particularly at the southern section near Shalateen. Global warming of seawater should impact the coastal zone between Hurghada and Marsa Alam (270 km long) due to the occurrence of fringing coral reef systems. The coastal sensitivity index provides a synoptic overview that could help prioritize emergency plans and protection strategies to reduce the ramifications of climate change.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2015	74	4					2831	2843		10.1007/s12665-015-4304-z								WOS:000358320700004

This methodology combines ground-based (GB) and remote sensing (RS) approaches for C stock estimation. RS based approach use Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), Light use efficiency (LUE) and Photo-synthetically Active Radiation (PAR) as the most important parameters for C stock estimation. The sensitivity of NDVI values to aerosols, water vapor and ozone was removed using the 6S radiative transfer code. The difference in NDVI values before and after atmospheric correction was assessed using student's t-test and was found to be statistically significant. The total carbon stock of the area was observed to be about 39.7188 t/ha. The bias estimation between C stock calculated using allometry and RS approaches confirmed the prediction accuracy and validated both the techniques (R (2) = 0.964 and bias = 0.915 %). The paper, thus, reports a statistically robust framework, which is a combination of the RS and GB approaches, and can be used for estimating the biomass and carbon stock of any ecosystem. This framework is especially effective where forest inventory data is unavailable, the site is geographically inaccessible or harvesting of mangroves or other trees is prohibited.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2015	35	4					695	707		10.1007/s13157-015-0660-4								WOS:000358090800007

Improved coastal wetland mapping using very-high 2-meter spatial resolution imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Accurate wetland maps are a fundamental requirement for land use management and for wetland restoration planning. Several wetland map products are available today; most of them based on remote sensing images, but their different data sources and mapping methods lead to substantially different estimations of wetland location and extent. We used two very high-resolution (2 m) WorldView-2 satellite images and one (30 m) Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image to assess wetland coverage in two coastal areas of Tampa Bay (Florida): Fort De Soto State Park and Weedon Island Preserve. An initial unsupervised classification derived from WorldView-2 was more accurate at identifying wetlands based on ground truth data collected in the field than the classification derived from Landsat 8 OLI (82% vs. 46% accuracy). The WorldView-2 data was then used to define the parameters of a simple and efficient decision tree with four nodes for a more exacting classification. The criteria for the decision tree were derived by extracting radiance spectra at 1500 separate pixels from the WorldView-2 data within field-validated regions. Results for both study areas showed high accuracy in both wetland (82% at Fort De Soto State Park, and 94% at Weedon Island Preserve) and non-wetland vegetation classes (90% and 83%, respectively). Historical, published land-use maps overestimate wetland surface cover by factors of 2-10 in the study areas. The proposed methods improve speed and efficiency of wetland map production, allow semi-annual monitoring through repeat satellite passes, and improve the accuracy and precision with which wetlands are identified.

Although they only account for 5% of the global land surface, over 550 million people live in deltas. These preferred livelihood locations, which feature flat terrain, fertile alluvial soils, access to fluvial and marine resources, a rich wetland biodiversity and other advantages are, however, threatened by numerous internal and external processes. Socio-economic development, urbanization, climate change induced sea level rise, as well as flood pulse changes due to upstream water diversion all lead to changes in these highly dynamic systems. A thorough understanding of a river delta's general setting and intra-annual as well as long-term dynamic is therefore crucial for an informed management of natural resources. Here, remote sensing can play a key role in analyzing and monitoring these vast areas at a global scale. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential of intra-annual time series analyses at dense temporal, but coarse spatial resolution for inundation characterization in five river deltas located in four different countries. Based on 250 m MODIS reflectance data we analyze inundation dynamics in four densely populated Asian river deltas-namely the Yellow River Delta (China), the Mekong Delta (Vietnam), the Irrawaddy Delta (Myanmar), and the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh, India)-as well as one very contrasting delta: the nearly uninhabited polar Mackenzie Delta Region in northwestern Canada for the complete time span of one year (2013). A complex processing chain of water surface derivation on a daily basis allows the generation of intra-annual time series, which indicate inundation duration in each of the deltas. Our analyses depict distinct inundation patterns within each of the deltas, which can be attributed to processes such as overland flooding, irrigation agriculture, aquaculture, or snowmelt and thermokarst processes. Clear differences between mid-latitude, subtropical, and polar deltas are illustrated, and the advantages and limitations of the approach for inundation derivation are discussed.

It is very important to monitor such wetlands to inform management on the status of these fragile ecosystems. This study aims to examine the applicability of TerraSAR-X quadruple polarimetric (quad-pol) synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data for classifying wetland vegetation in the Everglades. We processed quad-pol data using the Hong & Wdowinski four-component decomposition, which accounts for double bounce scattering in the cross-polarization signal. The calculated decomposition images consist of four scattering mechanisms (single, co- and cross-pol double, and volume scattering). We applied an object-oriented image analysis approach to classify vegetation types with the decomposition results. We also used a high-resolution multispectral optical RapidEye image to compare statistics and classification results with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. The calculated classification accuracy was higher than 85%, suggesting that the TerraSAR-X quad-pol SAR signal had a high potential for distinguishing different vegetation types. Scattering components from SAR acquisition were particularly advantageous for classifying mangroves along tidal channels. We conclude that the typical scattering behaviors from model-based decomposition are useful for discriminating among different wetland vegetation types.																	2072-4292					JUL	2015	7	7					8563	8585		10.3390/rs70708563								WOS:000360919900015

Distribution, Pore-Water Chemistry, and Stand Characteristics of the Mangroves of the United Arab Emirates	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Mangroves are the dominant coastal vegetation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), occupying one of the driest mangrove habitats in the world. However, published estimates of mangroves do not represent current conditions for the country as a whole. This study provides an up-to-date estimate of UAE's mangroves, summarizing their habitat characteristics, stand heights, and pore-water conditions. Estimates of mangrove cover are based upon remote sensing, aerial photointerpretation, and field verification. Our results document more mangroves than previously estimated for Abu Dhabi and the nation altogether. Mapped areas were classified into three descriptive density cover classes to facilitate interpretation of the data: low (<10%), moderate (10-75%), and high (>75%). The high-density class reflects prior national estimates for mangrove coverage (roughly 3613 ha), while moderate- and low-density classes contributed an additional 5659 ha and 4344 ha (respectively) to the national total. The largest contiguous mangrove area was 710 ha, while the smallest mapped area was 0.03 ha. Mapped mangrove habitat types included fringe, basin, and overwash, with average heights of 3.36 +/- 0.25 m and density of 61.83% +/- 5.01%. Stand height and pore-water sulfide concentrations were significantly different between habitat types, while stand density, pore-water salinity, and redox potential were highly variable. In sum, approximately 13,616 ha of mangrove area was mapped, roughly three times more than prior estimates. This is the first study in recent years to document the full areal extent of mangroves and associated stand characteristics across the seven emirates.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2015	31	4					957	963		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14-00142.1								WOS:000358027900016

In this study, sampling methodology, collection of field and laboratory spectral signatures and post-processing methodologies were investigated for developing an exclusive spectral library of mangrove species using hyperspectral spectroscopic techniques. Canopy level field spectra and leaf level laboratory spectra were collected for 34 species (25 true and 9 associated mangroves) from two different mangrove ecosystems of the Indian east coast. Post-processing steps such as removal of water vapour absorption bands, correction of drifts which occur due to the thermal properties of the instrument during data collection and smoothing of spectra for its further utilisation were applied on collected spectra. The processed spectra were then compiled as spectral library.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				MAY 28	2015	30	5					580	599		10.1080/10106049.2014.985743								WOS:000354112800007						
J	Armitage, AR; Highfield, WE; Brody, SD; Louchouarn, P				Armitage, Anna R.; Highfield, Wesley E.; Brody, Samuel D.; Louchouarn, Patrick			The Contribution of Mangrove Expansion to Salt Marsh Loss on the Texas Gulf Coast	PLOS ONE												Landscape-level shifts in plant species distribution and abundance can fundamentally change the ecology of an ecosystem. Such shifts are occurring within mangrove-marsh ecotones, where over the last few decades, relatively mild winters have led to mangrove expansion into areas previously occupied by salt marsh plants. On the Texas (USA) coast of the western Gulf of Mexico, most cases of mangrove expansion have been documented within specific bays or watersheds. Based on this body of relatively small-scale work and broader global patterns of mangrove expansion, we hypothesized that there has been a recent regional-level displacement of salt marshes by mangroves. We classified Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images using artificial neural networks to quantify black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) expansion and salt marsh (Spartina alterniflora and other grass and forb species) loss over 20 years across the entire Texas coast. Between 1990 and 2010, mangrove area grew by 16.1 km(2), a 74% increase. Concurrently, salt marsh area decreased by 77.8 km(2), a 24% net loss. Only 6% of that loss was attributable to mangrove expansion; most salt marsh was lost due to conversion to tidal flats or water, likely a result of relative sea level rise. Our research confirmed that mangroves are expanding and, in some instances, displacing salt marshes at certain locations. However, this shift is not widespread when analyzed at a larger, regional level. Rather, local, relative sea level rise was indirectly implicated as another important driver causing regional-level salt marsh loss. Climate change is expected to accelerate both sea level rise and mangrove expansion; these mechanisms are likely to interact synergistically and contribute to salt marsh loss.																	1932-6203					MAY 6	2015	10	5							UNSP e0125404	10.1371/journal.pone.0125404								WOS:000354049700066	25946132					
J	Dronova, I				Dronova, Iryna			Object-Based Image Analysis in Wetland Research: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												The applications of object-based image analysis (OBIA) in remote sensing studies of wetlands have been growing over recent decades, addressing tasks from detection and delineation of wetland bodies to comprehensive analyses of within-wetland cover types and their change. Compared to pixel-based approaches, OBIA offers several important benefits to wetland analyses related to smoothing of the local noise, incorporating meaningful non-spectral features for class separation and accounting for landscape hierarchy of wetland ecosystem organization and structure. However, there has been little discussion on whether unique challenges of wetland environments can be uniformly addressed by OBIA across different types of data, spatial scales and research objectives, and to what extent technical and conceptual aspects of this framework may themselves present challenges in a complex wetland setting. This review presents a synthesis of 73 studies that applied OBIA to different types of remote sensing data, spatial scale and research objectives. It summarizes the progress and scope of OBIA uses in wetlands, key benefits of this approach, factors related to accuracy and uncertainty in its applications and the main research needs and directions to expand the OBIA capacity in the future wetland studies. Growing demands for higher-accuracy wetland characterization at both regional and local scales together with advances in very high resolution remote sensing and novel tasks in wetland restoration monitoring will likely continue active exploration of the OBIA potential in these diverse and complex environments.																	2072-4292					MAY	2015	7	5					6380	6413		10.3390/rs70506380								WOS:000357596900028

The main goals of this research are focused on the monitoring of land cover and mangrove spatial changes particularly for the Mundra forest in the western coast of Gujarat state, India, which is famous for its unique mangrove bio-diversity. The multi-temporal Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS)-II (IRS-1B) and III (IRS 136/RESOURCESAT-1) images captured in the year 1994 and 2010 were utilized for the spatio-temporal analysis of the area. The land cover and mangrove density was estimated by a unique hybrid classification which consists of K means unsupervised following maximum likelihood classification (MLC) supervised classification-based approach. The vegetation and non-vegetation layers has been extracted and separated by unsupervised classification technique while the training-based MLC was applied on the separated vegetation and nonvegetation classes to classify them into 11 land use/land cover classes, The climatic variables of the area involves wind, temperature, dew point, precipitation, and mean sea level investigated for the period of 17 years over the site. To understand the driving factors, the anthropogenic variables were also taken into account such as historical population datasets. The overall analysis indicates a significant change in the frequency and magnitude of sea-level rise from 1994 to 2010. The analysis of the meteorological variables indicates a high pressure and changes in mangrove density during the 17 years of time, which reveals that if appropriate actions are not initiated soon, the Mundra mangroves might become the victims of climate change-induced habitat loss. After analyzing all the factors, some recommendations and suggestions are provided for effective mangrove conservation and resilience, which could be used by forest official to protect this precious ecosystem.

The results indicate that between 1986 and 2013, settlement/bare surface, mangrove forest/wetland and water body increased at 0.84% per year, 0.05% per year and 0.10% per year, respectively, while arable land/secondary vegetation and natural forest loss at 0.47% per year and 0.52% per year, respectively. This implies that intensity of change varies temporally. The implications of these changes include loss of valuable environmental goods and services, alteration of the food chain and increased impacts of climate change-related disasters. It is recommended that steps be taken to slow down the rate of land-use change in the study area to reduce its impact on the environment and social well-being.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				APR 21	2015	30	4					441	456		10.1080/10106049.2014.883435								WOS:000351063200005

This study developed and evaluated an object-based approach to understand what types of mangrove information can be mapped using different image datasets (Landsat TM, ALOS AVNIR-2, WorldView-2, and LiDAR). We compared and contrasted the ability of these images to map five levels of mangrove features, including vegetation boundary, mangrove stands, mangrove zonations, individual tree crowns, and species communities. We used the Moreton Bay site in Australia as the primary site to develop the classification rule sets and Karimunjawa Island in Indonesia to test the applicability of the rule sets. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of a conceptual hierarchical model for mapping specific mangrove features at discrete spatial scales. However, the rule sets developed in this study require modification to map similar mangrove features at different locations or when using image data acquired by different sensors. Across the hierarchical levels, smaller object sizes (i.e., tree crowns) required more complex classification rule sets. Incorporation of contextual information (e.g., distance and elevation) increased the overall mapping accuracy at the mangrove stand level (from 85% to 94%) and mangrove zonation level (from 53% to 59%). We found that higher image spatial resolution, larger object size, and fewer land-cover classes result in higher mapping accuracies. This study highlights the potential of selected images and mapping techniques to map mangrove features, and provides guidance for how to do this effectively through multi-scale mangrove composition mapping.																	2072-4292					APR	2015	7	4					4753	4783		10.3390/rs70404753								WOS:000354789300060						
J	Hamilton, SE; Lovette, J				Hamilton, Stuart E.; Lovette, John			Ecuador's Mangrove Forest Carbon Stocks: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Living Carbon Holdings and Their Depletion since the Advent of Commercial Aquaculture	PLOS ONE												In this paper we estimate the living carbon lost from Ecuador's mangrove forests since the advent of export-focused shrimp aquaculture. We use remote sensing techniques to delineate the extent of mangroves and aquaculture at approximately decadal periods since the arrival of aquaculture in each Ecuadorian estuary. We then spatiotemporally calculate the carbon values of the mangrove forests and estimate the amount of carbon lost due to direct displacement by aquaculture. Additionally, we calculate the new carbon stocks generated due to mangrove reforestation or afforestation. This research introduces time and LUCC (land use/land cover change) into the tropical forest carbon literature and examines forest carbon loss at a higher spatiotemporal resolution than in many earlier analyses. We find that 80 percent, or 7,014,517 t of the living carbon lost in Ecuadorian mangrove forests can be attributed to direct displacement of mangrove forests by shrimp aquaculture. We also find that IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) compliant carbon grids within Ecuador's estuaries overestimate living carbon levels in estuaries where substantial LUCC has occurred. By approaching the mangrove forest carbon loss question from a LUCC perspective, these findings allow for tropical nations and other intervention agents to prioritize and target a limited set of land transitions that likely drive the majority of carbon losses. This singular cause of transition has implications for programs that attempt to offset or limit future forest carbon losses and place value on forest carbon or other forest good and services.

This occurs both due to direct illumination and skyglow - scattered light in the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about the effects of artificial light on biological processes, biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. We combine intercalibrated Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) images of stable night-time lights for the period 1992 to 2012 with a remotely sensed landcover product (GLC2000) to assess recent changes in exposure to artificial light at night in 43 global ecosystem types. We find that Mediterranean-climate ecosystems have experienced the greatest increases in exposure, followed by temperate ecosystems. Boreal, Arctic and montane systems experienced the lowest increases. In tropical and subtropical regions, the greatest increases are in mangroves and subtropical needleleaf and mixed forests, and in arid regions increases are mainly in forest and agricultural areas. The global ecosystems experiencing the greatest increase in exposure to artificial light are already localized and fragmented, and often of particular conservation importance due to high levels of diversity, endemism and rarity. Night time remote sensing can play a key role in identifying the extent to which natural ecosystems are exposed to light pollution.

Land cover/land use change dynamics are derived from moderate to high spatial resolution (Landsat and SPOT) satellite imagery in six time intervals ranging from 1973 to 2011. Multi-temporal satellite images were collected, georeferenced, classified using per-pixel method, validated,and compared in post classification for the land use/land cover change detection in decades. Seven major land cover/land use classes were obtained, including cultivated lands, aquaculture ponds, mangrove forest, melaleuca forest, built up areas, bare lands, and natural water bodies. The accuracies of the land cover/land use maps for 1973, 1979, 1989, 1995, 2004, and 2011 were 81%, 82%, 86%, 87%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. The results show that the area of cultivated lands reduced over the period 1973-2011, however, it still represents the dominant land use in the case study. Aquaculture ponds were almost absent in 1973 but greatly increased from 1995 to 2004, to represent 20% of the land surface in 2011. Overall, from 1973 to 2011, bare lands, cultivated lands, mangrove forest, and melaleuca forest decreased by 104 km(2), 77 km(2), 61 km(2), and 5 km(2), respectively. In contrast, aquaculture lands and built up areas increased by 123 km(2) and 120 km(2), respectively. Temporal analysis highlights that these changes took place mostly between 1995 and 2004. This study is a first step to identify the main drivers of land use changes in this delta region, which include economical policies as well as demographic, socio-economic, and environmental changes.

J	Disperati, L; Virdis, SGP				Disperati, Leonardo; Virdis, Salvatore Gonario Pasquale			Assessment of land-use and land-cover changes from 1965 to 2014 in Tam Giang-Cau Hai Lagoon, central Vietnam	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study integrates the use of multi-source and multi-resolution remote sensing, topographic and field-based datasets to quantify land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes along a coastal stretch of Thua Thien Hue Province (central Vietnam). The LULC change analysis involves the Tam Giang-Cau Hai lagoon, the largest lagoon system in Southeast Asia, which is running nearly 70 km along the coast and having about 22,000 ha of water surface. The LULC change analysis was performed by computer-aided visual interpretation for 5 years (1965, 1989, 2000, 2006 and 2014) using satellite imagery from LANDSAT MSS, TM, ETM and 8, ASTER and SPOTS. National topographic maps were also used for the 1965 and 2000 years. To adequately represent the LULC features and peculiarities of central Vietnam coastal areas, an adapted CORINE Land Cover nomenclature was used where new 3rd and 4th level classes were adopted. Due to their intrinsic relative high spatial and radiometric resolution, SPOTS images from 2006 were assumed as a reference for interpretation keys and first delineation. Changes were mapped by editing those vectors representing features which underwent LULC change prior or after 2006. Spatial and temporal changes were analyzed by post-classification approach and validated by ground truth information. High detail object-based classification was finally performed to infer the capability of medium spatial resolution imagery for extracting cadastral scale pond maps. The accuracy of classification was checked by a polygon by polygon comparison with an existing aquaculture facility inventory. Five LULC maps were obtained by applying a legend of 21 classes including two newly defined: "Aquaculture ponds" and "Mangrove forest". The overall classification accuracy of the LULC map is 85% while the KHAT statistics 0.81 for the year 2006. Accuracy of the object-based aquaculture facilities classification is 84% or better for the SPOTS imagery and 47.9% for the ASTER imagery. The study provides a synoptic LULC representation for the largest lagoon system of Southeast Asia and delivers quantitative estimates of main changes occurred during the last 50 years. Moreover, it reveals the adaptability of the CORINE Land Cover method outside European environment. Finally, SPOTS provides good results to map aquaculture features at cadastral scale, even if in some circumstances (e.g. tidal areas), the integration with higher spatial resolution multispectral sensors should be envisaged.

This is the first spatio-temporal analysis of the large tidal weir (LTW) fishery operating on intertidal sand banks along the world's longest mangrove coast, north Brazil. Airborne synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images and aerial photos were integrated with field sampling to investigate catch and discard compositions of seven LTW during the main fishing season. LTW measurements on the SAR images were used to generate estimates on daily catch, wood extraction, and sand accumulation. In a coastal stretch of 67 km, 793 LTW were identified on SAR images from 2004, including 573 active LTW. The number of active LTW in Tapera double dagger A(0) Bay and Caet, Bay had increased from 87 in 1998 to 132 in 2004 (52% increase), and from 92 to 202 (106% increase), respectively. Sixty-five fish species from 24 families were captured in the LTW. Ariidae, Sciaenidae, Haemulidae, and Carangidae accounted for 45, 20, 10, and 7% of the total sampled catch weight of 3441 kg, respectively. The mean daily catch per LTW was 110 kg +/- 9 SE. Total discards in outer estuarine LTW were > 3 times higher than in inner estuarine LTW. All Aspredinidae, Belonidae, Tetraodontidae, and Trichiuridae, and > 75% of Auchenipteridae, Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Ephippidae, Loricariidae, Scombridae, and Soleidae were discarded. The LTW fishery apparently practices balanced harvesting; however, the massive LTW increase suggests fishing effort reduction to moderate levels. Mangrove wood extraction for LTW construction (22 835 m(3) or 855 390 trees) and sand accumulation (144 802 m(3)) likely have only local scale effects, negligible for the overall ecosystem dynamics. The study highlights the potential of SAR images for use in fisheries data collection and management of tropical coasts, emphasizing the need for integration with ground-truthing field studies.

Gonca; Balcik, Filiz Bektas; Goksel, Cigdem; Esbah, Hayriye			Forecasting land-cover growth using remotely sensed data: a case study of the Igneada protection area in Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Human activities in many parts of the world have greatly affected natural areas. Therefore, monitoring and forecasting of land-cover changes are important components for sustainable utilization, conservation, and development of these areas. This research has been conducted on Igneada, a legally protected area on the northwest coast of Turkey, which is famous for its unique, mangrove forests. The main focus of this study was to apply a land use and cover model that could quantitatively and graphically present the changes and its impacts on Igneada landscapes in the future. In this study, a Markov chain-based, stochastic Markov model and cellular automata Markov model were used. These models were calibrated using a time series of developed areas derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery between 1990 and 2010 that also projected future growth to 2030. The results showed that CA Markov yielded reliable information better than St. Markov model. The findings displayed constant but overall slight increase of settlement and forest cover, and slight decrease of agricultural lands. However, even the slightest unsustainable change can put a significant pressure on the sensitive ecosystems of Igneada. Therefore, the management of the protected area should not only focus on the landscape composition but also pay attention to landscape configuration.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2015	187	3							59	10.1007/s10661-015-4322-z								WOS:000349434900004	25647805

Extensive coastal development in many developing countries has converted mangrove forests to other land uses without regard to their ecosystem service values; thus, the ecosystem state of mangrove forests is critical for officials to evaluate sustainable coastal management strategies. The objective of this study is to investigate the multidecadal change in mangrove forests in Ca Mau peninsula, South Vietnam, based on Landsat data from 1979 to 2013. The data were processed through four main steps: 1) data preprocessing; 2) image processing using the object-based image analysis (OBIA); 3) accuracy assessment; and 4) multitemporal change detection and spatial analysis of mangrove forests. The classification maps compared with the ground reference data showed the satisfactory agreement with the overall accuracy higher than 82%. From 1979 to 2013, the area of mangrove forests in the study region had decreased by 74%, mainly due to the boom of local aquaculture industry in the study region. Given that mangrove reforestation and afforestation only contributed about 13.2% during the last three decades, advanced mangrove management strategies are in an acute need for promoting environmental sustainability in the future.

Recent advances in understanding Colombian mangroves	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Throughout the last 15 years, researchers at the National University of Colombia at Medellin have studied Colombian mangroves. Remote sensing, pollen analysis of superficial and deep sediments, Holocene coastal vegetation dynamics, sediment dating using C-14 and Pb-210, sampling in temporary plots, sampling in temporary and permanent plots, and other techniques have been applied to elucidate long- and shortterm mangrove community dynamics. The studied root fouling community is structured by several regulatory mechanisms; habitat heterogeneity increases species richness and abundance. Fringe mangroves were related to Ca concentration in the soil and the increased dominance of Laguncularia racemosa and other nonmangrove tree species, while the riverine mangroves were associated with Mg concentration and the dominance of Rhizophora mangle. The seedling and mangrove tree distributions are determined by a complex gradient of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Mangrove pollen from surface sediments and the existing vegetation and geomorphology are close interrelated. Plant pollen of mangrove and salt marsh reflects environmental and disturbance conditions, and also reveals forest types. Forest dynamics in both coasts and their sensitivity of to anthropogenic processes are well documented in the Late Quaternary fossil record. Our studies of short and long term allow us to predict the dynamics of mangroves under different scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic stress factors that are operating in Colombian coasts. Future research arises from these results on mangrove forests dynamics, sea-level rise at a fine scale using palynology, conservation biology, and carbon dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A pan tropical dataset of Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) SAR (HH) data was also acquired between 1995 and 1998. The provision of these comparable cloud-free datasets provided an opportunity for observing changes in the extent of coastal mangroves over more than a decade. Focusing on nine sites distributed through the tropics, this paper demonstrates how these data can be used to backdate and update existing baseline maps of mangrove extent. The benefits of integrating dense time-series of Landsat sensor data for both validating assessments of change and determining the causes of change are outlined. The approach is evaluated for wider application across the geographical range of mangroves in order to advance the development of JAXA's Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) program.

Mangrove shrimp farm mapping and productivity on the Brazilian Amazon coast: Environmental and economic reasons for coastal conservation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The present study evaluates the role of marine aquaculture in the conversion of mangrove forests into shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, Boone, 1931) farms using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and analyzes the productivity of the installed farms in the mangroves and adjacent coastal plateau. The extension of the shrimp ponds was quantified using satellite image analysis, and the water quality of the shrimp farms was analyzed based on measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, and salinity. The productivity of the farms was measured using biometric data. The data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. The results indicated that shrimp farms cover an area of similar to 0.8 km(2) (approximately 0.4% of Brazilian ponds), of which 29.4% are located within areas of mangroves, and 70.6% are located in the coastal plateau. Saltwater aquaculture contributed to the conversion of 0.53 km(2) of the mangroves into rearing ponds, which represents only 0.007% of the total area of the Amazonian mangroves. The installations in the mangrove presented significantly higher pH, temperature, transparency, and salinity compared with the ponds installed in the coastal plateau, although coastal plateau ponds had higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. Based on these differences, the mean sizes of the shrimp raised in the mangrove and coastal plateau ponds were 5.7 g and 4.3 g, respectively. However, the estimated value of one hectare of mangrove is much higher than its potential value in the production of shrimp. The considerable value of the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves indicates that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau is relatively less damaging in ecological and economic terms. Thus, we can consider that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau instead of in mangrove areas is less damaging to the long-term conservation of mangrove forests, which follows the management best practices established by international organizations. The coastal zone is considered a common resource that belongs to all citizens in Iberoamerican countries, and it is defined as a zone of non-building. Therefore, we conclude that mangroves are more valuable intact than converted into aquaculture ponds. Hence, aquaculture activities in the Amazon coastal plain are not sustainable from environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mani; Qamer, Faisal M.; Pengra, Bruce; Thau, David			Distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests of South Asia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Mangrove forests in South Asia occur along the tidal sea edge of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. These forests provide important ecosystem goods and services to the region's dense coastal populations and support important functions of the biosphere. Mangroves are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic stressors; however the current status and dynamics of the region's mangroves are poorly understood. We mapped the current extent of mangrove forests in South Asia and identified mangrove forest cover change (gain and loss) from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat satellite data. We also conducted three case studies in Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India), and Sundarbans (Bangladesh and India) to identify rates, patterns, and causes of change in greater spatial and thematic details compared to regional assessment of mangrove forests. Our findings revealed that the areal extent of mangrove forests in South Asia is approximately 1,187,476 ha representing similar to 7% of the global total. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2012, 92,135 ha of mangroves were deforested and 80,461 ha were reforested with a net loss of 11,673 ha. In all three case studies, mangrove areas have remained the same or increased slightly, however, the turnover was greater than the net change. Both, natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the change and turnover. The major causes of forest cover change are similar throughout the region; however, specific factors may be dominant in specific areas. Major causes of deforestation in South Asia include (i) conversion to other land use (e.g. conversion to agriculture, shrimp farms, development, and human settlement), (ii) over-harvesting (e.g. grazing, browsing and lopping, and fishing), (iii) pollution, (iv) decline in freshwater availability, (v) floodings, (vi) reduction of silt deposition, (vii) coastal erosion, and (viii) disturbances from tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Our analysis in the region's diverse socio-economic and environmental conditions highlights complex patterns of mangrove distribution and change. Results from this study provide important insight to the conservation and management of the important and threatened South Asian mangrove ecosystem.

Post-disaster assessment of impact of cyclone Lehar in South Andaman Island	CURRENT SCIENCE												Disasters are the events which devastate human lives, properties and natural ecosystems; cyclones are frequent events in tropical countries which have adverse impacts on coastal areas. The present study evaluates the impact of cyclone Lehar post-disaster in the South Andaman Island using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. Cyclone Lehar originated in the Andaman Sea and had a major impact on the South Andaman Island. Digital elevation model was used to create elevation and slope maps of the study area. These maps were used to study the impacts of floods, landslides, storm surges and runoff. Land-use and land-cover features were mapped and overlaid with this model for preparing the vulnerability map for various outcomes of the cyclone. Preliminary impact assessments were made in these identified vulnerable areas and also throughout the study area. Finally the results were interpreted with vulnerability map prepared using the GIS technique which shows that most of the affected areas are correlated with the vulnerability map. Cyclone Lehar had adverse impacts on natural ecosystems such as forests, mangroves and sandy beaches. It also damaged man-made features such as settlements, infrastructure, agricultural fields and plantations. This study proves spatial technologies are the indispensible tools for post-disaster planning and impact assessment.																	0011-3891					JAN 10	2015	108	1					85	90										WOS:000348178600019

A multidisciplinary approach based on remote sensing, fieldwork, and chemical analysis was adopted in order to identify the pressures facing the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay and subsequently evaluate its current environmental condition. The analysis focused on the 2011 to 2014 timeframe in particular. The results indicate that the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay cover currently around 11.32 square km. Two major mangrove cover changes were identified in the area during the studied period, with a net loss of around 0.675 square km happening in the interim. The analysis adopted the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to evaluate the temporal change in vegetation concentration. Moreover, the study evaluated the overall pollution condition of 19 mangrove communities in Tarut Bay to be medium based on the Pollution Load Index (PLI). Nevertheless, some of the mangrove communities in Tarut Bay are very healthy while others are very polluted and require immediate action to improve their pollution status. The findings of this work led to recommending mangrove improvement measures to address further deterioration and disappearance of mangrove communities, including the re-opening of natural inlets and avoiding residential developments on the mangrove coast.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					269	276		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-269-2015								WOS:000380531900041

The technology of satellite remote sensing plays an important role in the detection of the ecological system. Some methods, such as band combination, expert classification and fuzzy classification, have been widely used in recent years. This paper explores the application of the image classification technology in mangrove information extraction based on RGB color only, and discusses the method of parallelepiped and Meanshift clustering respectively. According to the different image characteristics, the image classification technology based on RGB color only can distinguish the different research contents in remote sensing image, which uses a computer to analyze the target object quantitatively and classifies each image pixel or region into several categories.																			978-1-4673-8660-9				2015							167	170		10.1109/CIS.2015.48								WOS:000380584700040

J	Rioja-Nieto, R; Moreno-Ruiz, JA; Gomez-Valdes, J				Rioja-Nieto, Rodolfo; Antonio Moreno-Ruiz, Juan; Gomez-Valdes, Jose			Effect of the management of a Natural Protected Area in the landscape of the mangrove forest in the Yucatan Peninsula	HIDROBIOLOGICA												Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) are one of the main conservation tools used to maintain biodiversity. Due to the limitations on the anthropogenic activities that are generally associated with these tools, it is important to determine their efficiency in order to justify and/or modify their operation. This study evaluates the effect of the management of the "El Palmar" state reserve, which was established 23 years ago, by comparing the landscape characteristics of the mangrove forest of the Natural Protected Area (NPA) and the adjacent area that has no historical conservation status. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used, as well as remote sensing techniques, based on the hierarchical analysis of quantitative characteristics of the habitat, the spectral similarity, contextual edition and the supervised classification of a multispectral Spot 5 image, to compare the area, fragmentation and compactness of ten types of mangrove habitats between the NPA and the adjacent area. The contrasted regions present the same general fragmentation pattern (p>0.05). However, when comparing the types of habitat, significant differences were observed (p<0.05) in the fragmentation, the area and the compactness of certain types of habitat. The observed differences do not indicate a clear effect of the protected area management strategies in the structure of the landscape and are possibly more related to the local conditions, ecological processes, and the natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting the management strategies of the NPA in such a manner that they have a positive effect in the integrity of the mangrove's forest.

The analysis of changes showed a loss of 509 ha of mangrove in a 17-year period and an annual deforestation rate of 1.05 %. The metrics indicate that the system was composed of 38 largest mangrove patches greater than 0.36 ha in 2011, which represents an increase of 58% regarding its size in the year 1994. The fractal dimension of 1.4 and the fragmentation rate estimated suggest that the landscape has been impacted. Altogether, the results show that, due to changes in the system, it is necessary to implement coastal management plans.																	1011-484X	2215-2563					2015		54					153	169										WOS:000372475100007

This research aimed to integrate techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system to investigate the relationship between land-use changes and coastal erosion in Phuket Island, Thailand, using multi-sensors and temporal imageries acquired during 2003-2011. Eight land-use classes including built-up, forest, mangrove forest, agriculture, aquaculture, water body, beach and other classes were classified using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Built-up area was the most increasing changed in 2009 (60.29%). The most decreasing changed in 2009 (80%) was beach area. The average erosion rate in Naiyang, Kamala, Patong, Karon, Kata, Katanoi, Naiharn and Rawai beach were 7.90, 13.70, 13.21, 4.72, 11.33, 6.73, 11.63 and 4.75 m/year, respectively. The result showed that increasing of built-up area was significantly related to increasing of coastal erosion significantly. The analytical results can be utilized for coastal managing, monitoring and planning in the future.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							4832	4835										WOS:000371696704229

Developing a sustainable satellite-based environmental monitoring system in Nigeria	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				15th SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VI	SEP 22-24, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				Increased anthropogenic activities over the year have remained a major factor of the Earth changing environment. This phenomenon has given rise to a number of environmental degraded sites that characterize the Nigeria's landscape. The human-induced elements include gully erosion, mangrove ecosystems degradation, desertification and deforestation, particularly in the south east, Niger Delta, north east and south west of Nigeria respectively, as well as river flooding/flood plain inundation and land degradation around Kainji lake area. Because of little or no effective management measures, the attendant environmental hazards have been extremely damaging to the infrastructures and socio-economic development of the affected area. Hence, a concerted effort, through integrated and space-based research, is being intensified to manage and monitor the environment in order to restore the stability, goods and services of the environment. This has justified Nigeria's investment in its space programme, especially the launch of NigeriaSat-1, an Earth observation micro-satellite in constellation with five (5) other similar satellites, Alsat-1, China DMC, Bilsat-1, DEMOS and UK DMC belonging to Algeria, China, Turkey, Spain and United Kingdom respectively. The use of data from these satellites, particularly NigeriaSat-1, in conjunction with associated technologies has proved to be very useful in understanding the influence of both natural and human activities on the Nigeria's ecosystems and environment. The results of some researches on specific applications of Nigerian satellites are presented in this paper. Appropriate sustainable land and water resources management in the affected areas, based on Nigeria's satellite data capture and integration, are also discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-854-5				2015	9644								96440Q	10.1117/12.2195625								WOS:000367470500015

A DISPARITY BETWEEN EROSIONAL HAZARD AND ACCRETION OF THE SUNDARBANS WITH ITS ADJACENT EAST COAST, BANGLADESH: A REMOTE SENSING AND GIS APPROACH	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				15th SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications VI	SEP 22-24, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				The Sundarbans, UNESCO affiliated world heritage site and world largest mangrove forest covering with (similar to 10000) km(2) along the coastal areas of Bangladesh and India. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries due to sea level rise caused by global warming. In the present situation world mangrove forest are declining at alarming rate. The extensions of this mangrove forest continuously changing with the nature of Bay of Bengal coast. This paper presents the contrast result of erosional hazard and accretion of Sundarbans with its adjacent east coast of Bangladesh. This study based on images of Landsat MSS, Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) from Landsat 8. Landsat images from 1980 to 2014 were analyzed. The result shows the net erosion rate of Sundarbans is higher than its adjacent east coast. The study area has been divided into two phases - Phase I and Phase II. Phase I represents only Sundarbans and Phase II represents adjacent east coast. These two phases has equal longitudinal distance. Many small channels and river supply water and sediment into the Sundarbans. The adjacent east coast of Sundarbans lies on the Meghana estuary that experienced with huge amount of sediment flow. The Sundarbans has been facing erosional stage with a rate of net erosion about 3 km(2)y(-1) whereas the adjacent east coast facing an accretional stage with rate of accretion about 1 km(2)y(-1). The highest erosion rate of Phase I (Sundarbans) was 10.61 km(2)y(-1) and highest erosion of Phase II adjacent east coast was 18-km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1989-1999. The highest accretion rate in the Sundarbans was 6.48 km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1999-2006 and in the Phase II, accretion rate was 16.43 km(2)y(-1) in the period of 1980-1989. The lowest erosion rate was 3 km(2)y(-1) in Phase I and 2.11 km(2)y(-1) in Phase II in the period of 1999-2006. The reworking area in phase I is about 37 km(2) and phase II is about 51 Km(2). So, water is highly active in adjacent east coast than Sundarbans. Though the mean sea level is increasing at a same rate in two different phases but the accretion and erosion rates are not same. From this study, it is established that Sundarbans has lost 113.31 km(2) of its land in the 34 years of study period whereas; adjacent east coast has gain about 35 km(2) lands. The rate of water discharges and sediment supply are not same in two different phases. It plays a vital role in erosion and accretion process. Therefore, Sundarbans are declining at frightening rate than its adjacent east coast.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-854-5				2015	9644								96441G	10.1117/12.2196386								WOS:000367470500029

Ecological comprehensive evaluation of each rural landscape types were made by establishing a comprehensive evaluation index system and model of rural landscape with Alos Remote Sensing Data in 2010 and GIS, based on the Landscape Ecology theory. The results indicated the range of the ecological comprehensive index (Ei) is 2.10-4.48. The proportion of ecological regionalization level4 and level5 accounted for more than half, level3 accounted for 1/5. In general, the condition of rural landscape in Haikou suburbs was positive; while the tropical unused grassland landscape, tropical scrub landscape, tropical settlement landscape and tropical waters landscape had a relatively negative condition; the coastal mangrove landscape and tropical farmland landscape condition hadn't threaded; the status of tropical garden landscape and tropical open forest landscape were fine. On the ground of landscape evaluation and background of the area, we put forward four types of rural tourism development modes: rural tourism for sight-seeing; rural tourism for experience; rural tourism for recreation; rural tourism for humanity; we also proposed to develop the tourism resources reasonable and to ensure the sustainable development of tourism on the premise of maintaining regional ecological balance.																			978-1-60595-218-5				2015							608	615										WOS:000352343500107

Assessment of the land use/land cover (LU/LC) and mangrove changes along the Mandovi-Zuari estuarine complex of Goa, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Land use/land cover change dynamics along the estuarine complex of Mandovi-Zuari in the coastal state of Goa, India is studied by the application of multi-temporal remote sensing data. This tropical estuarine region has faced significant changes in the last few decades due to diverse pressures from various sectors, mainly of anthropogenic origin. Spatial and temporal changes in the LU/LC classes have been evaluated using satellite datasets from Landsat MSS, TM and IRS-LISS III for the years 1973, 1989, 2001 and 2011. Considering a spectrally heterogeneous landscape of the region, the LU/LC changes are identified by using principal component analysis (PCA) as a pre-classification step, followed by the implementation of a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification called hybrid classification. The application of PCA has proved to be suitable to successfully identify discrete land surface classes for this study area. An overall accuracy of 95.56 % (kappa=0.9556), 92.93 % (kappa=0.92), 84.64 % (kappa=0.85) and 86.36 % (kappa=0.85) has been obtained for the year 2011, 2001, 1989 and 1973, respectively. The study reveals a gradual increase in built-up area due to urbanization corresponding to a decrease in agricultural land and a considerable loss in beach area. Changes in the mangroves are also assessed within this extent as Goa has significant pockets of mangroves which are located mainly along the estuarine complexes of Mandovi and Zuari (along with the Cumbarjua canal complex). The results highlight an increase in mangrove coverage within the study extent by 1,585.8 ha from 1973 to 2011. The mangrove areal extent along Mandovi has increased from 149.45 to 1,059.77 ha and from 142.95 to 676.12 ha along Zuari (including Cumbarjua canal). Increasing awareness and the steps taken by the forest department to provide suitable environment for the growth of mangroves are the main reasons for this increment.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JAN	2015	8	1					267	279		10.1007/s12517-013-1220-y								WOS:000348108300019

Distribution of Mangrove Habitats of Grenada and the Grenadines	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Mangroves of Grenada and the Grenadines represent significant habitat within the regional context of the Eastern Caribbean. Losses of mangroves through storms, development, and climate change have negative impacts on critical ecosystem services. Estimates of mangrove area exist in the literature but do not fully reflect current conditions, effects of disturbance, and results of recovery; they also do not differentiate these areas by community types. Advances in imagery and remote sensing approaches allow higher-resolution resource mapping. We used remote sensing, image interpretation, and field verification techniques to provide current estimates of the extent and distribution of mangroves. Our results provide the greatest areal total of mangroves to date. Despite loss of mangroves in the recent past, we accounted for approximately 15% more hectares than estimated in the 1990s and 28% more than predicted by hypothetical models for 2005. The discrepancies between prior and current mapped areas are likely due to differences in mapping precision and incomplete surveys that omitted the smaller Grenadine islands but also reflect actual increases in cover from natural recovery and recruitment following historic storm events. Basin mangroves represented the greatest area, while riverine and scrub contributed the least. Fringe mangroves were moderately abundant but were composed of small, isolated patches with high vulnerability to coastal storms and limited opportunity for inland retreat. Documenting the presence and distribution of mangroves, and specifically mangrove community types, will be of value to conservation, restoration, and management planning in light of predicted sea level rise and climate change effects.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2015	31	1					155	162		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00187.1								WOS:000347868900015

Costs related to these function losses can be avoided by early recognition of coastal squeeze and early action. In this research we investigate how remote sensing imagery data can contribute to early recognition of coastal squeeze. The case study is the lower Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar, a crucial agricultural zone nicknamed the 'Ricebowl of Myanmar'. The coastal zone in Myanmar is subject to climate change, urbanization, extreme weather conditions (cyclones), increase in agri-and aquaculture and (illegal) felling of mangrove. This has already led to large loss of biodiversity and increased flood risk. Remote sensing analysis based on LANDSAT imagery has been done in attempt to identify land use and coastline change.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							2356	2367										WOS:000398996202054						
J	Yuvaraj, E; Dharanirajan, K; Jayakumar, S; Saravanan				Yuvaraj, E.; Dharanirajan, K.; Jayakumar, S.; Saravanan			Geomorphic settings of mangrove ecosystem in South Andaman Island: A geospatial approach	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Mangroves are habitats in the coasts of tropics and subtropics, hence the geomorphology of the coast prevails in both the ocean and the land processes. To study the geomorphic setting of mangroves, it is necessary to explore both the topography of the land and the bathymetry of the sea. In this study, the geomorphic setting of mangroves in the South Andaman Island has been studied in detail using remote sensing and GIS technology. The ortho-rectified IRS satellite image was used to identify and to map the mangroves and the associated features using the visual interpretation technique. Using the GIS technique, topographic and bathymetric DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) were created to understand the geomorphology and its influence on the mangrove ecosystem. This DEM was interpreted with mangrove distribution and its associated features to create the DTM (Digital Terrain Model) of the mangrove ecosystem. Topography and bathymetry of the coast result in three dominant features like rivers, tides and waves, which play a role in shaping the geomorphic settings of mangroves, which are classified into five major types. In this study, it is identified that all the five categories of major geomorphic settings of the mangrove community exist in the south Andaman. In the field surveys, ground truth of topographic elevation, mangrove species, and associated coastal land cover features were identified and confirmed in these geomorphic settings. It is concluded that topography and bathymetry settings of the island play an indispensable role in this fragile mangrove ecosystem.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				DEC	2014	123	8					1819	1830		10.1007/s12040-014-0503-3								WOS:000347512600008

This study aims to identify the conditions of mangroves in a coastal lagoon south of the city of Mazatlan, Mexico, using proximal hyperspectral remote sensing techniques. The dominant mangrove species in this area includes the red (Rhizophora mangle), the black (Avicennia germinans) and the white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangrove. Moreover, large patches of poor condition black and red mangrove and healthy dwarf black mangrove are commonly found. Mangrove leaves were collected from this forest representing all of the aforementioned species and conditions. The leaves were then transported to a laboratory for spectral measurements using an ASD FieldSpec (R) 3 JR spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., USA). R-2 plot, principal components analysis and stepwise discriminant analyses were then used to select wavebands deemed most appropriate for further mangrove classification. Specifically, the wavebands at 520, 560, 650, 710, 760, 2100 and 2230 nm were selected, which correspond to chlorophyll absorption, red edge, starch, cellulose, nitrogen and protein regions of the spectrum. The classification and validation indicate that these wavebands are capable of identifying mangrove species and mangrove conditions common to this degraded forest with an overall accuracy and Khat coefficient higher than 90% and 0.9, respectively. Although lower in accuracy, the classifications of the stressed (poor condition and dwarf) mangroves were found to be satisfactory with accuracies higher than 80%. The results of this study indicate that it could be possible to apply laboratory hyperspectral data for classifying mangroves, not only at the species level, but also according to their health conditions.

Modeling soil parameters using hyperspectral image reflectance in subtropical coastal wetlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Developing spectral models of soil properties is an important frontier in remote sensing and soil science. Several studies have focused on modeling soil properties such as total pools of soil organic matter and carbon in bare soils. We extended this effort to model soil parameters in areas densely covered with coastal vegetation. Moreover, we investigated soil properties indicative of soil functions such as nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage. These properties include the partitioning of mineral and organic soil between particulate (>53 mu m) and fine size classes, and the partitioning of soil carbon and nitrogen pools between stable and labile fractions. Soil samples were obtained from Avicennia genninans mangrove forest and Juncus roemerianus salt marsh plots on the west coast of central Florida. Spectra corresponding to field plot locations from Hyperion hyperspectral image were extracted and analyzed. The spectral information was regressed against the soil variables to determine the best single bands and optimal band combinations for the simple ratio (SR) and normalized difference index (NDI) indices. The regression analysis yielded levels of correlation for soil variables with R-2 values ranging from 0.21 to 0.47 for best individual bands, 0.28 to 0.81 for two-band indices, and 0.53 to 0.96 for partial leastsquares (PLS) regressions for the Hyperion image data. Spectral models using Hyperion data adequately (RPD > 1.4) predicted particulate organic matter (POM), silt+ clay, labile carbon (C), and labile nitrogen (N) (where RPD = ratio of standard deviation to root mean square error of cross-validation [RMSECV]). The SR (0.53 mu m, 2.11 mu m) model of labile N with R-2 = 0.81, RMSECV = 0.28, and RAD = 1.94 produced the best results in this study. Our results provide optimism that remote-sensing spectral models can successfully predict soil properties indicative of ecosystem nutrient and organic matter turnover and storage, and do so in areas with dense canopy cover.

This study correlates long-term water chemistry in mangrove environments, located in Everglades National Park, with mangrove spectral reflectance measurements made at both the leaf and canopy scales. Spectral reflectance measurements were collected using a handheld spectrometer for leaf-level measurements and Landsat 5TM data for regional coverage. Leaf-level reflectance data were collected from three mangrove species (i.e., red, black and white mangroves) across two regions; a tall mangrove (similar to 18 m) and dwarf mangrove (1-2 m) region. The reflectance data were then used to calculate a wide variety of biophysical reflectance indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI, SAVI) to determine signs of stress. Discrete, quarterly water samples from the surface water, groundwater, and pore water (20 and 85 cm depths) and daily autonomous surface water samples were collected at each site and analyzed for major anions (Cl- and SO42-), cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Mangrove sites that exhibited the highest salinity and ionic concentrations in the surface and subsurface water also had the lowest near-infrared reflectance at both the leaf and satellite levels. Seasonal reflectance responses were measured in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths at both the leaf and canopy scales and were strongly correlated with nutrient and ionic concentrations in the surface and subsurface water, even though there was no significant separability between the three mangrove species. Study sites that experienced the greatest variability in surface and subsurface water ionic concentrations also exhibited the greatest fluctuations in NIR spectral reflectance. Landsat 5TM images were able to detect tall and dwarf mangroves by the differences in spectral indices (e.g., NDVI, NDWI, and EVI) because of the variability in the background conditions amongst the environments. In addition, Landsat 5TM images spanning 16 years (1993-2009) were successfully used to estimate the seasonal variability in ionic concentrations in the surface water across the Florida Coastal mangrove ecotone. This study has shown that water chemistry can be estimated indirectly by measuring the change in spectral response at the leaf- or satellite-scale. Furthermore, the results of this research may be extrapolated to similar coastal mangrove systems throughout the Caribbean and world-wide wherever red, black, and white mangroves occur.

Based on high-resolution remote sensing image data taken between 2003 and 2008, we analyzed the "source" and "sink" landscape pattern variations of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in the Jiulongjiang estuary region. The contribution to the sea and distribution of each pollutant in the region was calculated using the LCI and mGLCI models. The results indicated that an increased amount of pollutants was contributed to the sea, and the "source" area of the nitrogen NPSP in the study area increased by 32.75 km(2). We also propose a landscape pattern optimization to reduce pollution in the Jiulongjiang estuary in 2008 through the conversion of cultivated land with slopes greater than 15 degrees and paddy fields near rivers, and an increase in mangrove areas.

Examining Change Detection Approaches for Tropical Mangrove Monitoring	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												This study evaluated the effectiveness of different band combinations and classifiers (unsupervised, supervised, object-oriented nearest neighbor, and object-oriented decision rule) for quantifying mangrove forest change using multitemporal Landsat data. A discriminant analysis using spectra of different vegetation types determined that bands 2 (0.52 to 0.6 mu m), 5 (1.55 to 1.75 mu m), and 7(2.08 to 2.35 mu m) were the most effective bands for differentiating mangrove forests from surrounding land cover types. A ranking of thirty-six change maps, produced by comparing the classification accuracy of twelve change detection approaches, was used. The object-based Nearest Neighbor classifier produced the highest mean overall accuracy (84 percent) regardless of band combinations. The automated decision rule-based approach (mean overall accuracy of 88 percent) as well as a composite of bands 2, 5, and 7 used with the unsupervised classifier and the same composite or all band difference with the object-oriented Nearest Neighbor classifier were the most effective approaches.																	0099-1112	2374-8079				OCT	2014	80	10					983	993		10.14358/PERS.80.10.983								WOS:000342551800013

Effects of Land Use Changes on the Ecosystem Service Values of Coastal Wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Changes in the coastal landscape of Southern Sinaloa (Mexico), between 2000 and 2010, were analyzed to relate spatial variations in wetlands extent with the provision and economic value of the ecosystem services (ES). Remote sensing techniques applied to Landsat TM imagery were used to evaluate land use/land cover changes while the value transfer method was used to assess the value of ES by land cover category. Five wetland types and other four land covers were found as representative of the coastal landscape. Findings reveal a 14 % decrease in the saltmarsh/forested mangrove area and a 12 % increase in the area of shrimp pond aquaculture (artificial wetland) during the study period. ES valuation shows that the total value flow increased by 9 % from $215 to $233 million (2007 USD) during the 10-year period. This increase is explained as result of the high value worldwide assigned to saltmarsh. We recognize limitations in the transfer-based approach in quantifying and mapping ES values in the region, but this method provides with value estimates spatially defined, and also provides some guidance in the preliminary screening of policies and projected development in the context of data-scarce regions.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2014	54	4					852	864		10.1007/s00267-014-0332-9								WOS:000342428700016	25069582

Assessment and monitoring of deforestation from 1930 to 2011 in Andhra Pradesh, India using remote sensing and collateral data	CURRENT SCIENCE												Deforestation is one of the greatest threats to the world's forest ecosystems. The present study has utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to quantify changes in forest cover and to map patterns of deforestation in Andhra Pradesh, India during 1930-2011. Andhra Pradesh has the second largest recorded forest area and ranks sixth with an actual forest cover amongst all Indian states. Forest cover maps from seven temporal datasets were prepared based on interpretation of multi-source topographical maps and satellite data. A representative set of landscape indices has been used to study landscape-level changes over time. The mapping for the period of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2011 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 85,392, 68,063, 46,940, 45,520, 44,409, 43,577 and 43,523 sq. km of the study area respectively. The study found the net forest cover declined as 49% of the total forest area during the last eight decades. The annual rate of estimated deforestation during 2005-2011 was 0.02%. Annual rate of deforestation of teak mixed forests was relatively higher (0.76) followed by mangroves (0.58%), semi-evergreen forests (0.43%), dry deciduous forests (0.21%), moist deciduous forests (0.09%) and dry evergreen forests (0.07%) during 1975-2011. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches was 3,981 in 1930, 5,553 in 1960, 8,760 in 1975, 9,412 in 1985, 9,646 in 1995 and 10,597 in 2011, which indicates ongoing anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (sq. km) of forest decreased from 21.5 in 1930 to 12.3 in 1960 and reached 3.9 by 2011. The analysis of historical forest cover changes provides a basis for management effectiveness and future research on various components of biodiversity, climate change and accounting of carbon.																	0011-3891					SEP 10	2014	107	5					867	875										WOS:000342330900024

It is a major biodiversity hot spot of our planet. At the same time the delta is home to Africa's largest oil reserves and responsible for a skyrocketing GDP development of Nigeria since the 1970s. Nigeria ranks 13th among all oil producing countries, but oil exploitation also brought with it severe environmental degradation, leading to the delta's nomination for a place on the top 10 list of the "World's Worst Polluted Places Report" in 2013. Despite the outstanding importance of the region for Nigeria, Africa, and the international community most studies published focus mainly on topics of geology, geochemistry, and environmental toxicology. Studies employing earth observation satellite data to assess Niger Delta dynamics are rare. This paper aims at contributing to an overview of Niger Delta geography and environmental threats and challenges, as well as to an understanding of Niger Delta land surface dynamics from 1986 to 2013. Covering the complete delta, we present results of land cover change analyses, results of an assessment of coastline dynamics, as well as the manifestation of oil exploitation activity as expressed via oil access canal dredging and gas flaring, monitored within the 27 year time span investigated.

Coscinodiscus radiatus, Chaetoceros lorenzianus and the pennate diatom Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii was investigated in the context of its impact on phytoplankton and microzooplankton (the loricate ciliate tintinnids) in the coastal regions of Sagar Island, the western part of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. Both number (15-18 species) and cell densities (12.3 x 10(3) cells l(-1) to 11.4 x 10(5) cells l(-1)) of phytoplankton species increased during peak bloom phase, exhibiting moderately high species diversity (H' = 2.86), richness (R' = 6.38) and evenness (E' = 0.80). The diatom bloom, which existed for a week, had a negative impact on the tintinnid community in terms of drastic changes in species diversity index (1.09-0.004) and population density (582.5 x 10(3) to 50 x 10(3) ind m(-3)). The bloom is suggested to have been driven by the aquaculture activities and river effluents resulting high nutrient concentrations in this region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll maps have been interpreted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Landsat images from three time periods of shrimp farm development (pre-shrimp farms - 1989, development - 2001, and post-development - 2007) were analyzed using unsupervised classification algorithm. A post-classification change detection comparison approach revealed only moderate mangrove exploitation and shrimp farms, which displaced a variety of land-cover types in addition to mangroves. In some cases, there was a detectable cycle of use and replenishment of mangroves and a lack of the boom-bust cycle of shrimp farming that other parts of Thailand experienced.																	1548-1603	1943-7226				AUG	2014	51	4					403	426		10.1080/15481603.2014.936669								WOS:000340951100004

The Coleroon river flow and its effect on the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The fresh water reaching an estuary fluctuates on many scales and the fluctuation in the flow over a time period is also due to the anthropogenic activities like construction of dams, diversions and upstream withdrawals. These fluctuations may have profound effects on the estuarine ecosystem, which usually has remarkable biological productivity and diversity. A desktop analysis is carried out by compiling historical records of discharge and other hydrological information to study the dynamics of the river Coleroon, a distributary of the Cauvery River, Tamil Nadu, India. Remote sensing analysis was carried out on images ranging from the years 1977 to 2008 and the changes in the Pichavaram mangrove areas adjoining the Coleroon were studied by comparing the results with the freshwater flow into the ecosystem. Environmental flow analysis indicates that the minimum flow needed for a healthy mangrove system in Pichavaram is 750.75 cumecs; however, this is currently achieved only 12 % of the time. The reduction in freshwater flow over the years has resulted in loss of species diversity and degradation of the mangroves; this needs to be corrected immediately to conserve the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem.

Remote sensing serves as an important tool to provide up-to date baseline information which is the primary requirement for the conservation planning of mangroves. In this study, supervised classification by maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) has been used to classify LANDSAT TM and LANDSAT ETM satellite data. This algorithm is used for computing likelihood of unknown measurement vector belonging to unknown classes based on Bayesian equation. Image spectra for various mangrove species were also generated from hyperspectral image. During field visits, GPS locations of five dominant mangrove species with appreciable distribution were taken and image spectra were generated for the same points from hyperion image. The result of this classification shows that, in 1999 total mangrove forest accounted for 55.01 % of the study area which has been reduced to 50.63 % in the year 2010. Avicennia sp. is found as most dominating species followed by Excoecaria sp. and Phoenix sp. but the aerial distribution of Avicennia sp., Bruguiera sp. and Ceriops sp. has reduced. In this classification technique the overall accuracy and Kappa value for 1999 and 2010 are 80 % and 0.77, 85.71 % and 0.81 respectively.

Based on maps generated by the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO for its Spanish acronym), three land cover change indicators were estimated: net change, stability of location, and stability of residence. Analyses were made at national and regional (Northern Pacific, Central Pacific, Southern Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Yucatan Peninsula) scales, and for the 17 states presenting mangroves. At the national level during the studied period we observed a 10 % net loss of mangrove. At the state level, 13 states lost area, three gained area, and one showed no change in mangrove cover. According to the indicators of location stability and residence stability, the lowest values were recorded in four states within the Pacific Ocean coast (Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero, and Oaxaca), while the highest values corresponded to two states of the Gulf of Mexico (Tamaulipas and Tabasco). Many of the changes in mangrove cover we detected were attributed to crop and animal husbandry activities, and to anthropic infrastructure.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2014	34	4					747	758		10.1007/s13157-014-0539-9								WOS:000340097600011

Aerial photographs and visual image interpretation techniques have historically been known to be the most common approach for mapping mangroves and species discrimination. However, with the availability of increased spectral resolution satellite imagery, and advances in digital image classification algorithms, there is now a potential to digitally classify mangroves to the species level. This study compares the accuracy of mangrove species maps derived from two different layer combinations of WorldView-2 images with those generated using high resolution aerial photographs captured by an UltraCamD camera over Rapid Creek coastal mangrove forest, Darwin, Australia. Mangrove and non-mangrove areas were discriminated using object-based image classification. Mangrove areas were then further classified into species using a support vector machine algorithm with best-fit parameters. Overall classification accuracy for the WorldView-2 data within the visible range was 89%. Kappa statistics provided a strong correlation between the classification and validation data. In contrast to this accuracy, the error matrix for the automated classification of aerial photographs indicated less promising results. In summary, it can be concluded that mangrove species mapping using a support vector machine algorithm is more successful with WorldView-2 data than with aerial photographs.

The system utilizes a number of libraries, developed by the authors: The Remote Sensing and GIS Library (RSGISLib), the Raster I/O Simplification (RIOS) Python Library, the KEA image format and TuiView image viewer. All libraries are accessed through Python, providing a common interface on which to build processing chains. Three examples are presented, to demonstrate the capabilities of the system: (1) classification of mangrove extent and change in French Guiana; (2) a generic scheme for the classification of the UN-FAO land cover classification system (LCCS) and their subsequent translation to habitat categories; and (3) a national-scale segmentation for Australia. The system presented provides similar functionality to existing GEOBIA packages, but is more flexible, due to its modular environment, capable of handling complex classification processes and applying them to larger datasets.

Variability in mangrove change estimates and implications for the assessment of ecosystem service provision	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To quantify the variability in estimates of change in mangrove area for key countries throughout the tropics, and to highlight potential implications for the assessment of global mangrove ecology, function and conservation. Location Pan-tropical, covering 15 countries, and accounting for c. 67% of global mangrove area. Methods We review 314 national mangrove area estimates (authoritative statements with defined time periods) from various sources. Linear regression models of mangrove area over time were applied to various data point combinations, defined by data source. These included various FAO resources, as well as academic and government statistics and remote sensing studies. Results National trends of change in mangrove area exhibited high variability depending on which data points were modelled. Many countries showed high variability in deforestation rate when the results of all models were combined, e.g. Indonesia had an average deforestation rate of 331.65 (+/- 222.26) km2 yr-1, Nigeria lost 92.09 (+/- 188.95) km2 yr-1 and Cuba lost 34.82 (+/- 142.17) km2 yr-1. The standard deviations were large due to high variability in national estimates, and hence the number of contradictory trends that could be extracted. Conflicting trends of long-term mangrove loss and gain could be derived for eight of the 15 countries analysed, including Indonesia, Brazil and the Philippines. Main conclusions The great variability in trends of mangrove extent suggests that estimates of ecosystem functional loss, biodiversity threat assessments and science-based conservation policies will be hampered by low confidence in mangrove area dynamics. Variable and inaccurate baseline data feed into various estimates of biodiversity and ecosystem functional loss, such as IUCN Red List assessments and estimates of global carbon emissions from mangrove deforestation. We also require robust information to inform conservation actions and policies hoping to reduce functional loss. Variability has important implications for all ecosystems where statistics are required over large scales.

Regeneration of mangrove trees after the devastation of tsunami has also been identified using Remote Sensing techniques and field observations. Submergence and degradation takes place in the seaward mangroves and the landward or riverine mangroves subsequently.

The focus is the transnational region of the western coastal section of The Gambia and Senegal located between the Gambia and Casamance Rivers. Remote sensing applied to Landsat images of the interfluvial region in 1986 and 2010 indicates a 35% decline in overall mangrove coverage for the study area with sub-regions of pronounced loss. There was a 12% decline along the south bank of the lower Gambia River and a 43% decrease in coverage between the Gambian border and the Casamance River. Mangrove loss reached 92% in the northern section of Casamance south of the international border between Senegal and The Gambia. Fieldwork suggests that the mangrove decline over the study period is in part driven by the growing firewood demand of urban centers. The remote-sensing analysis, complemented by fieldwork in the region, attributes the negative trends to the Gambian demand for firewood, political instability in Casamance, and a porous international border that facilitates illegal cutting and smuggling.

Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, degradation of this system continues mainly due to anthropogenic pressure. Over the past few decades, satellite remote sensing has been used to map and monitor changes of mangrove forests worldwide. This study was aimed at characterizing the health status of the Indian mangrove on the basis of multiyear, multi-season, remote sensing data. Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) from Systeme Pour I Observation de la Terre - Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) coinciding with the stress period (March - May) for one decade (1999 - 2008) was subjected to maximum value compositing (MVC). This was used to develop a four-category health index status based on threshold values. Results showed that around 38 % and 27 % of tibial mangrove in India belonged to very-healthy and healthy categories, respectively. In general the health index was lower in western coast mangroves compared to east coast. The health index was highest for the island mangrove systems (Andaman and Nicobar), and lowest along the Gujarat coast.																	0564-3295					MAY	2014	55	2					245	253										WOS:000331430100009

The literature-adopted framework for estimating biomass uses a direct (Carbon, Hydrogen and Nitrogen (CHN) analysis), an indirect (allometry and remote sensing) and a hybrid approach. The study area has Avicennia marina as a dominant species. The carbon content was estimated using allometry and CHN analysis and further refined with GIS techniques. The Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of 1,726 trees at 49 different locations in the study area was measured for estimating total biomass. A CHN analysis of leaf and soil samples was performed to determine the carbon content and the data extrapolated using geostatistical analysis. Using allometry and a GIS hybrid approach, the estimated carbon stock was 34.14769 tons per hectare. The regression model developed may be useful for estimating the carbon stock of areas that are inaccessible for conducting allometric measurements or gathering samples for CHN analysis. The study attempts to improve the estimates of the carbon content by including geostatistical analysis as a final step for allometry and combines CHN analysis for better conversion of biomass to carbon content.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2014	34	2					379	391		10.1007/s13157-013-0505-y								WOS:000332825400017						
J	Kamal, M; Phinn, S; Johansen, K				Kamal, Muhammad; Phinn, Stuart; Johansen, Kasper			Characterizing the Spatial Structure of Mangrove Features for Optimizing Image-Based Mangrove Mapping	REMOTE SENSING												Understanding the relationship between the size of mangrove structural features and the optimum image pixel size is essential to support effective mapping activities in mangrove environments. This study developed a method to estimate the optimum image pixel size for accurately mapping mangrove features (canopy types and features (gaps, tree crown), community, and cover types) and tested the applicability of the results. Semi-variograms were used to characterize the spatial structure of mangrove vegetation by estimating the size of dominant image features in WorldView-2 imagery resampled over a range of pixel sizes at several mangrove areas in Moreton Bay, Australia. The results show that semi-variograms detected the variations in the structural properties of mangroves in the study area and its forms were controlled by the image pixel size, the spectral-band used, and the spatial characteristics of the scene object, e. g., tree or gap. This information was synthesized to derive the optimum image pixel size for mapping mangrove structural and compositional features at specific spatial scales. Interpretation of semi-variograms combined with field data and visual image interpretation confirms that certain vegetation structural features are detectable at specific scales and can be optimally detected using a specific image pixel size. The analysis results provide a basis for multi-scale mangrove mapping using high spatial resolution image datasets.																	2072-4292					FEB	2014	6	2					984	1006		10.3390/rs6020984								WOS:000336092100005

Land use Change Impacts on Heavy Metal Sedimentation in Mangrove Wetlands-A Case Study in Dongzhai Harbor of Hainan, China	WETLANDS												When human activities change land use patterns, many environment elements are being changed accordingly. Well understanding the links between various changes could help to achieve ecological protection through adjusting land use pattern. Mangrove is one of the most valuable ecosystems that have been changed dramatically during the recent decades. Based on Remote Sensing and Geography Information System, along with soil sample determination, we present a quantitative study about the correlations between land use changes and the variations in heavy metal contents in mangrove soil sediments of DongZhai Harbor in China. The results showed that the indices depicting the landscape pattern characteristics had been changed remarkably during 1988 to 2007. Meanwhile, the heavy metal contents had been increasing significantly in mangrove soil. The correlations between landscape indices and metal contents were analyzed statistically. It was found that the metal contents were proportional to the values of main indices, revealing that both the landscape fragmentation and patch shape alternation were closely related to the metal accumulation. Further analyses showed that increasing of aquaculture and residential regions could be responsible for the changes in land use patterns, which subsequently altered the distribution patterns of heavy metal sedimentation in mangrove wetlands.

Since the 1960s, remote sensing has played an important role in characterizing the marine environment, with particular emphasis on sea surface features, temperature, and salinity; mapping of shorelines, wetlands, and coral reefs; local fisheries and species movements; tracking hurricanes, earthquakes, and coastal flooding; and changes in coastal upwelling and marine productivity. This chapter reviews marine applications of remote sensing worldwide, exploring contemporary satellite systems, research themes, and analytical methods. In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, marine remote sensing has been limited to the use of large-scale daily image-gathering systems, such as CZCS, MODIS, SeaWiFS, and AVHRR, due to persistent cloud cover and constrained research budgets. Recent advances in satellite technology and availability, however, offer new opportunities for remote sensing in the Galapagos archipelago and beyond. Moderate-resolution sensors like SPOT and Landsat continue to be relevant for regional-scale evaluations of marine and coastal environments, identifying hotspots or focal areas for the use of more fine-grained imagery like QuickBird, WorldView-2, and aerial photographs. Radar systems like Aquarius and SAR show promise in new lines of oceanographic research, including sea surface salinity and the differentiation of mangrove subspecies. The use of ancillary or in situ data for calibration and validation of remotely-sensed image analysis can overcome the limitations of sensors used in bathymetric applications, while advances in cellular and GPS technology facilitate real-time reporting from citizen scientists for integrated monitoring of environmental and social change.																	2195-1055		978-3-319-02769-2; 978-3-319-02768-5				2014							109	136		10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2_6	10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2							WOS:000364124700008

These marine ecosystems contribute to the biodiversity of land and ocean habitats at various scales, acting as direct link to biogeochemical cycles of both upland and coastal regions. All of the positive and negative drivers of change of both natural and anthropogenic, within watershed and political boundaries play a role in the health and function of mangroves. As a result, they are among the most rapidly changing landscapes in the Americas; yet, the landscape scale dynamics are not well understood, difficult to measure in cloudy regions, and not operationally monitored at the global scale.

Hyperspectral band selection and Classification of Hyperion image of Bhitarkanika mangrove ecosystem, eastern India	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XVI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XVI was part of the International Symposium on Remote Sensing	SEP 22-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				Tropical mangrove forests along the coast evolve dynamically due to constant changes in the natural ecosystem and ecological cycle. Remote sensing has paved the way for periodic monitoring and conservation of such floristic resources, compared to labour intensive in-situ observations. With the laboratory quality image spectra obtained from hyperspectral image data, species level discrimination in habitats and ecosystems is attainable. One of the essential steps before classification of hyperspectral image data is band selection. It is important to eliminate the redundant bands to mitigate the problems of Hughes effect that are likely to affect further image analysis and classification accuracy. This paper presents a methodology for the selection of appropriate hyperspectral bands from the EO-1 Hyperion image for the identification and mapping of mangrove species and coastal landcover types in the Bhitarkanika coastal forest region, eastern India. Band selection procedure follows class based elimination procedure and the separability of the classes are tested in the band selection process. Individual bands are de-correlated and redundant bands are removed from the bandwise correlation matrix. The percent contribution of class variance in each band is analysed from the factors of PCA component ranking. Spectral bands are selected from the wavelength groups and statistically tested. Further, the band selection procedure is compared with similar techniques (Band Index and Mutual information) for validation. The number of bands in the Hyperion image was reduced from 196 to 88 by the Factor-based ranking approach. Classification was performed by Support Vector Machine approach. It is observed that the proposed Factor-based ranking approach performed well in discriminating the mangrove species and other landcover units compared to the other statistical approaches. The predominant mangrove species Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Cynometra ramiflora are spectral identified and the health status of these species are assessed by the selected band. Further, the performance of this band selection approaches are evaluated in multi-sensor image fusion for better mapping of mangrove ecosystems, wherein spatial resolution is enhanced while retaining the optimal number of hyperspectral bands.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-302-1				2014	9239								UNSP 923914	10.1117/12.2067483								WOS:000348312800030						
J	Wohlfart, C; Wegmann, M; Leimgruber, P				Wohlfart, Christian; Wegmann, Martin; Leimgruber, Peter			Mapping threatened dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in South-east Asia for conservation management	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Habitat loss is the primary reason for species extinction, making habitat conservation a critical strategy for maintaining global biodiversity. Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.78. We identified three hotspots in SE Asia with a total area of 156,000 km(2), and found Myanmar to have more remaining DDF than the countries in SE Asia. Our approach proved to be a reliable method for mapping DDF and other seasonally influenced ecosystems on continental and regional scales, and is very valuable for conservation management in this region.

Ancillary data including oil pipeline map and GPS of spill points were used in selecting sample sites to identify and detect polluted locations. A number of polluted and non-polluted sites were selected and vegetation spectral reflectance and indices for these sample sites were extracted from TM data of January and December 1986. A statistical T-test was used to test for significant differences between vegetation spectral reflectance and indices from polluted and non-polluted sites. The initial results from the analysis of spectral reflectance between polluted and non-polluted did not show any significant difference in all the six spectral bands with p-value >0.005. The results from analysis of various vegetation indices some did not show any significance differences between the polluted and non-polluted sites (e. g. the SRI, SAVI and EVI2). Other VIs (NDVI, MSAVI2 and ARVI2) showed significant differences between the polluted and non-polluted sites. From these preliminary results we can conclude that pollution from oil spills may result to the changes in leaf biochemistry of the Mangroves in the Niger Delta which are detectable from remote sensing data. Future work will focus on undertaking further temporal analysis of additional spill sites to determine what quantity of spilt oil arises in spectral changes of vegetation.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-058-7				2014	9121								91210D	10.1117/12.2049590								WOS:000343405500012

Application of remote sensing and GIS for detection of long-term mangrove shoreline changes in Mui Ca Mau, Vietnam	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mui Ca Mau at the southern tip of Vietnam supports a large area of mangroves and has a high value for biodiversity and scenic beauty. This area is affected by erosion along the East Sea and accretion along the Gulf of Thailand, leading to the loss of huge stretches of mangroves along the East Sea and, in some cases, loss of environmental and ecosystem services provided by mangroves. In this study, we used remotely sensed aerial (1953), Landsat (1979, 1988 and 2000) and SPOT (1992, 1995, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011) images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to quantify the rate of mangrove shoreline change for a 58 yr period. There were 1129 transects sampled at 100 m intervals along the mangrove shoreline and two statistical methods, namely end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR), were used to calculate the rate of change of mangrove shorelines and distance from 1953 to 2011. The study confirms that erosion and accretion, respectively, are significant at the East Sea and Gulf of Thailand sides of Mui Ca Mau. The East Sea side had a mean erosion LRR of 33.24 m yr(-1). The accretion trend at the Gulf of Thailand side had an average rate of 40.65 m yr(-1). The results are important in predicting changes of coastal ecosystem boundaries and enable advanced planning for specific sections of coastline, to minimize or neutralize losses, to inform provincial rehabilitation efforts and reduce threats to coastal development and human safety.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	14					3781	3795		10.5194/bg-11-3781-2014								WOS:000339895600005

To support these requirements, a component of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Kyoto and Carbon (K&C) initiative has been to design and develop capability for a Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) that routinely monitors and reports on local to global changes in the extent of mangroves, primarily on the basis of observations by Japanese L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The GMW aims are as follows: (1) to map progression of change within or from existing (e.g. Landsat-derived) global baselines of the extent of mangroves by comparing advanced land-observing satellite 2 (ALOS-2) phased array L-band SAR 2 (PALSAR-2) data from 2014 with that acquired by the Japanese earth resources satellite (JERS-1) SAR(1992-1998) and ALOSPALSAR (2006-2011); (2) to quantify changes in the structure and associated losses and gains of carbon on the basis of canopy height and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated from the shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM; acquired 2000), the ice, cloud and land-elevation satellite (ICESAT) geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS; 2003-2010) and L-band backscatter data; (3) to determine likely losses and gains of tree species diversity through reference to International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) global thematic layers on the distribution of mangrove species; and (4) to validate maps of changes in the extent of mangroves, primarily through comparison with dense time-series of Landsat sensor data and to use these same data to describe the causes and consequences of change. The paper outlines and justifies the techniques being implemented and the role that the GMW might play in supporting national and international policies that relate specifically to the long-term conservation of mangrove ecosystems and the services they provide to society.

The role of vegetation analysis by remote sensing and GIS technology for planning sustainable development: A case study for the Santos estuary drainage basin (Brazil)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The role of vegetation analysis by remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to support plans for sustainable development is discussed through a proposal of an index of ecosystem "integrity" or of regeneration capacity. The index is based on the vegetation "mass" of a given land cover type and the capacity that such mass has to contrast soil erosion. The index is therefore taking into account the effects of human activities and not merely the state of ecosystems in terms of their components. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the proposed index without RS and GIS techniques. These allow, respectively, to collect and to analyze the spatial data at relative low cost and in relatively short times. Time and money are the limiting factors for all the management plans. As an example of application, we have calculated the index for the Santos estuary drainage basin (Brazil) selected as a case study within the ECOMANAGE project funded by European Commission. The area was chosen because of its great economic importance and for relevant environmental problems (industrial pollution and urbanization pressure) that could limit the development. For estimating the relative vegetation mass, we have used the Leaf Area Index, while for the soil erosion, we have used the revised universal soil loss equation model. The maps of ecosystem integrity produced by the application of the index may be very useful to guide the planners in the development of the urbanization process that is threatening the "Mata Atlantica" and the mangrove forests.																	1126-3504	1724-5575					2014	148	3					540	546		10.1080/11263504.2014.900130								WOS:000337051500017

Despite their value, world-wide, mangroves are being rapidly degraded and deforested. Madagascar contains approximately 2% of the world's mangroves, >20% of which has been deforested since 1990 from increased extraction for charcoal and timber and conversion to small to large-scale agriculture and aquaculture. Loss is particularly prominent in the northwestern Ambaro and Ambanja bays. Here, we focus on Ambaro and Ambanja bays, presenting dynamics calculated using United States Geological Survey (USGS) national-level mangrove maps and the first localized satellite imagery derived map of dominant land-cover types. The analysis of USGS data indicated a loss of 7659 ha (23.7%) and a gain of 995 ha (3.1%) from 1990-2010. Contemporary mapping results were 93.4% accurate overall (Kappa 0.9), with producer's and user's accuracies >= 85%. Classification results allowed partitioning mangroves in to ecologically meaningful, spectrally distinct strata, wherein field measurements facilitated estimating the first total carbon stocks for mangroves in Madagascar. Estimates suggest that higher stature closed-canopy mangroves have average total vegetation carbon values of 146.8 Mg/ha (+/- 10.2) and soil organic carbon of 446.2 (+/- 36.9), supporting a growing body of studies that mangroves are amongst the most carbon-dense tropical forests.																	1999-4907					JAN	2014	5	1					177	205		10.3390/f5010177								WOS:000335820700006

However, the exceptional adaptability and reproductive ability of this species have led to its extensive dispersal into other habitats, where it has had a negative impact on native species and threatens the local mangrove and mudflat ecosystems. To obtain the distribution and spread of Spartina alterniflora, we collected HJ-1 CCD imagery from 2009 and 2011 and very high resolution (VHR) imagery from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The invasion area of Spartina alterniflora was 357.2 ha in 2011, which increased by 19.07% compared with the area in 2009. A field survey was conducted for verification and the total accuracy was 94.0%. The results of this paper show that VHR imagery can provide details on distribution, progress, and early detection of Spartina alterniflora invasion. OBIA, object based image analysis for remote sensing (RS) detection method, can enable control measures to be more effective, accurate, and less expensive than a field survey of the invasive population.																	1537-744X						2014									638296	10.1155/2014/638296								WOS:000336153300001

Mangroves facing climate change: landward migration potential in response to projected scenarios of sea level rise	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mangrove forests prominently occupy an intertidal boundary position where the effects of sea level rise will be fast and well visible. This study in East Africa ( Gazi Bay, Kenya) addresses the question of whether mangroves can be resilient to a rise in sea level by focusing on their potential to migrate towards landward areas. The combinatory analysis between remote sensing, DGPS-based ground truth and digital terrain models ( DTM) unveils how real vegetation assemblages can shift under different projected ( minimum (+ 9 cm), relative (+ 20 cm), average (+ 48 cm) and maximum (+ 88 cm)) scenarios of sea level rise ( SLR). Under SLR scenarios up to 48 cm by the year 2100, the landward extension remarkably implies an area increase for each of the dominant mangrove assemblages except for Avicennia marina and Ceriops tagal, both on the landward side. On the one hand, the increase in most species in the first three scenarios, including the socio-economically most important species in this area, Rhizophora mucronata and C. tagal on the seaward side, strongly depends on the colonisation rate of these species. On the other hand, a SLR scenario of + 88 cm by the year 2100 indicates that the area flooded only by equinoctial tides strongly decreases due to the topographical settings at the edge of the inhabited area. Consequently, the landward Avicennia-dominated assemblages will further decrease as a formation if they fail to adapt to a more frequent inundation. The topography is site-specific; however non-invadable areas can be typical for many mangrove settings.

Deforestation in the Ayeyarwady Delta and the conservation implications of an internationally-engaged Myanmar	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Myanmar is a country of huge biodiversity importance that is undergoing major political change, bringing with it new international engagement. This includes access to international markets, which will likely spur investment in export-oriented agriculture, leading to increased pressures on already threatened ecosystems. This scenario is illustrated in the Ayeyarwady Delta, the country's agricultural heartland sustaining high deforestation rates. Using the Delta as a model system, we use an integrated approach to inquire about whether and how imminent agricultural reforms associated with an internationally-engaged Myanmar could introduce new actors and incentives to invest in agricultural expansion that could affect deforestation rates. We use a novel remote sensing analysis to quantify deforestation rates for the Delta from 1978 to 2011, develop business-as-usual deforestation scenarios, and contextualize those results with an analysis of contemporary policy changes within Myanmar that are expected to alter the principal drivers of land-cover change. We show that mangrove systems of Myanmar are under greater threat than previously recognized, and that agriculture has been the principle driver of deforestation on the Delta. The centrality of agriculture to the Myanmar economy indicates that emerging policies are likely to tip the scales towards agricultural expansion, agroindustrial investment and potentially greater rates of deforestation due to the introduction of well-funded investors, insufficient land tenure agreements, and low governance effectiveness. The broad national challenge is to initiate environmental governance reforms (including safeguards) in the face of significant pressures for land grabbing and opportunistic resource extraction.

In this paper, the classification accuracy of LISS-3 (IRS-P6) optical data over Mumbai is compared with multi-frequency PolSAR data to study the synergy between both the remote sensing techniques. SVM classifier is applied on optical and PolSAR data. Before applying SVM classifier, optical data is registered with PolSAR data. The overall accuracy of optical IRS data (87.31%) is less than that of fully polarized SAR data (93.54%). Optical data cannot differentiate well between grasslands and mangroves and also saltpans and wetlands, whereas PolSAR data gave high classification accuracy. However, forest is well classified with optical data. Since the forest is on hilly area, foreshortening and layover in PolSAR data affect the classification accuracy. It is observed that the combination of both optical and PolSAR gives better results (98.62%).																	2197-4403		978-3-8007-3607-2				2014																		WOS:000369143500239

IMPROVED CLASSIFICATION OF MANGROVES HEALTH STATUS USING HYPERSPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING DATA	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Mangrove ecosystem plays a crucial role in costal conservation and provides livelihood supports to humans. It is seriously affected by the various climatic and anthropogenic induced changes. The continuous monitoring is imperative to protect this fragile ecosystem. In this study, the mangrove area and health status has been extracted from Hyperspectral remote sensing data (EO-1Hyperion) using support vector machine classification (SVM). The principal component transformation (PCT) technique is used to perform the band reduction in Hyperspectral data. The soil adjusted vegetation Indices (SAVI) were used as additional parameters. The mangroves are classified into three classes degraded, healthy and sparse. The SVM classification is generated overall accuracy of 73% and kappa of 0.62. The classification results were compared with the results of spectral angle mapper classification (SAM). The SAVI also included in SVM classification and the accuracy found to be improved to 82%. The sparse and degraded mangrove classes were well separated. The results indicate that the mapping of mangrove health is accurate when the machine learning classifier like SVM combined with different indices derived from hyperspectral remote sensing data.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						667	670		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-667-2014								WOS:000368425300103

An attempt has been made to study the length of shoreline changes along three provinces in the upper gulf of Thailand. The significant purpose is to investigate coastline length changes and to evaluate those different coastal changes at different times. Two specialties of chosen areas are the outstanding location at mouth of river in curve pattern and ecological important mangrove forest, as nominated and designated area listed in Ramsar convention, international wetlands treaty. In employing the remote sensing will help to investigate the shoreline erosion, stable or construction shoreline. Rapid and drastic shoreline changes have been compared and measured base on satellite image Landsat 5 TM on 1994, 2002 and 2007 at path129 row 051. There were geometrically co-registered and, in the process were resampled to 25m. By composing RGB band, fusion, supervised classification. By apply different theories will give different results but the similarly pattern. Training sites were selected by signature editor, area of interest, evaluate by seperabilitly and contingency. Principle component analysis (PCA) was employed as a method of change detection. This is to conclude that these shoreline areas were in erosion from natural processes and manmade activities, for example, aquaculture and agriculture expansion, such as shrimp farm. These coastal line lost were not just losing the land; it's losing the soul of the cycle of marine life, economically, and environmentally. Moreover, this project, in the future, could benefit to set the recovery buffer zone for mangrove restoration also.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1079	1083		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1079-2014								WOS:000368425300170

Coastal development, which converts mangrove forests to other land uses, has often ignored the services that mangrove may provide, leading to irreversible environmental degradation. Monitoring the spatiotemporal distribution of mangrove forests is thus critical for natural resources management of mangrove ecosystems. This study investigates spatiotemporal changes in Honduran mangrove forests using Landsat imagery during the periods 1985-1996, 1996-2002, and 2002-2013. The future trend of mangrove forest changes was projected by a Markov chain model to support decision-making for coastal management. The remote sensing data were processed through three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to correct geometric errors between the Landsat imageries and to perform reflectance normalization; (2) image classification with the unsupervised Otsu's method and change detection; and (3) mangrove change projection using a Markov chain model. Validation of the unsupervised Otsu's method was made by comparing the classification results with the ground reference data in 2002, which yielded satisfactory agreement with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and Kappa coefficient of 0.82. When examining mangrove changes from 1985 to 2013, approximately 11.9% of the mangrove forests were transformed to other land uses, especially shrimp farming, while little effort (3.9%) was applied for mangrove rehabilitation during this 28-year period. Changes in the extent of mangrove forests were further projected until 2020, indicating that the area of mangrove forests could be continuously reduced by 1,200 ha from 2013 (approximately 36,700 ha) to 2020 (approximately 35,500 ha). Institutional interventions should be taken for sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems in this coastal region.																	2072-4292					DEC	2013	5	12					6408	6426		10.3390/rs5126408								WOS:000330318900013

We combine earth-observation-based mapping at the main species level with the result of an extensive socio-economic household survey to assess the value of direct and indirect ecosystem services provided by Can Gio's mangroves. Remotely sensed optical and radar data from 2011 were used to derive the precise extent of mangrove coverage. Household survey results led to an understanding of the value placed on mangroves by different occupational groups, namely, forest managers, fisherman, shrimp farmers, and other farmers. Common to all is a lack of understanding of the value of a natural resource if no direct income is generated. At the same time, depending on occupation, a clear trend towards appreciating and understanding the importance of mangroves can be observed: it is the highest with local and migratory fisherman, followed by forest managers, while shrimp farmers have the least knowledge about mangrove benefits, and also express the least willingness to further protect them. Values derived from the household surveys as well as secondary sources in combination with remotesensing-based mapping enabled us to determine the ecosystem services value of Can Gio mangroves for selected categories of advantages.

Mangrove biomass estimation in Southwest Thailand using machine learning	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. Accurate assessments of mangrove biomass at the site-scale are lacking, especially in mainland Southeast Asia. This study assessed tree biomass and species diversity within a 151 ha mangrove ecosystem on the Andaman Coast of Thailand. High-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, medium resolution ASTER satellite elevation data, field-based tree measurements, published allometric biomass equations, and a suite of machine learning techniques were used to develop spatial models of mangrove biomass. Field measurements derived a whole-site tree density of 1313 trees ha(-1), with Rhizophora spp. comprising 77.7% of the trees across forty-five 400 m(2) sample plots. A support vector machine regression model was found to be most accurate by cross-validation for predicting biomass at the site level. Model-estimated above-ground biomass was 250 Mg ha(-1); below-ground root biomass was 95 Mg ha(-1). Combined above-ground and below-ground biomass for the entire 151-ha stand was 345 (+/- 72.5) Mg ha(-1), equivalent to 155 (+/- 32.6) Mg C ha(-1). Model evaluation shows the model had greatest prediction error at high biomass values, indicating a need for allometric equations determined over a larger range of tree sizes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

There is just one mangrove species in New Zealand, Avicennia marina var. resinifera. Our main objective was to investigate the response of mangroves to sedimentary patterns. Remote sensing and GIS was used to quantify the change in mangrove area. Vegetation and sediment characteristics were studied across seasons from December 2009 to August 2010. Comparison of digital images in 1940 and 2003 revealed that the mangrove area in our study inlet had increased by 21%. The mangroves created a rim of high fringe mangroves surrounding high-density but low height trees in the interior. The relatively low pH level and seasonally fluctuating pore water total dissolved salt (TDS) concentration reveal potentially stressful conditions in the interior mangrove zone, which may influence the forest structure in the interior. Total organic carbon (TOC), delta C-13(org) and delta N-15 along the transect indicated an increase of autochthonous organic carbon in the surface substrate landwards. The highest carbon accumulation was not observed in the fringe zone, in spite of it having the most vigorous growth of mangroves. Instead, the highest (delta C-13 value (-23.36 +/- 0.42 parts per thousand, averaged over depth) and lowest C:N ratio (13.1 +/- 2.0) in the fringe mangrove core reflected the preservation of allochthonous organic material in the fringe zone. Under the protection of seaward fringe mangroves, mangrove-derived carbon is retained and stored in the interior sediment.

To address this, we synthesized information from two perspectives: 1) at a detailed level, the immature mosquito habitat within mangroves; 2) at a more general or regional level, changes due to mangrove expansion into saltmarshes. This is a synthesis of two research projects. One showed that mosquito larval habitats in mangroves are complex, related to the detailed interactions between topography and tidal patterns and that not all parts of a mangrove forest are suitable habitat. The other, based on remote sensing and analysis of rainfall data, showed that mangrove encroachment in eastern Australia is related to both climate and human land use over several decades (1972-2004). An important question emerged: when mangroves encroach into saltmarshes will they displace saltmarsh immature mosquito habitats or will they replace them with mangrove ones? There is no simple answer: it will vary with climate change and sea level scenario and how these affect the system. We conclude that mosquito management, which is locally implemented, needs to be integrated with land use planning systems, which often operate at a more general level.																	1081-1710	1948-7134				DEC	2013	38	2					330	338		10.1111/j.1948-7134.2013.12048.x								WOS:000326923500018	24581363

Shrimp pond effluent dominates foliar nitrogen in disturbed mangroves as mapped using hyperspectral imagery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds creates fragmentation and eutrophication. Detection of the spatial variation of foliar nitrogen is essential for understanding the effect of eutrophication on mangroves. We aim (i) to estimate nitrogen variability across mangrove landscapes of the Mahakam delta using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing (HyMap) and (ii) to investigate links between the variation of foliar nitrogen mapped and local environmental variables. In this study, multivariate prediction models achieved a higher level of accuracy than narrow-band vegetation indices, making multivariate modeling the best choice for mapping. The variation of foliar nitrogen concentration in mangroves was significantly influenced by the local environment: (1) position of mangroves (seaward/landward), (2) distance to the shrimp ponds, and (3) predominant mangrove species. The findings suggest that anthropogenic disturbances, in this case shrimp ponds, influence nitrogen variation in mangroves. Mangroves closer to the shrimp ponds had higher foliar nitrogen concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.				Faculty of ITC, Dep Nat.

After its end in 1975, extensive reforestation with monocultures took place. Can Gio, one of the biggest replanted sites with about 20,000 ha of mangroves mainly Rhizophora apiculata, was declared a biosphere reserve by the UNESCO in 2000. Although this status now enables progressive forest dynamics, there are still drawbacks resulting from the unnatural character of the plantations. For example, the homogeneous size and age structure as well as the regular arrangement of the planted trees make larger forest stands more vulnerable to synchronized collapsing which can be triggered by stronger winds and storms. A transformation into a more natural forest characterized by a heterogeneous age and size structure and a mixed species composition is of urgent need to avoid a synchronized dieback. In this study we test the capability of natural canopy disturbances (e.g. lightning strikes) to facilitate this transformation. Canopy gaps created by lightning strikes were detected and quantified by remote sensing techniques. SPOT satellite images from the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 provided information about the spatial distribution, size, shape, and formation frequency of the gaps. Lightning strike gaps were identified based on their shape and size. They form small openings (mean: 0.025 ha) and their yearly probability of occurrence was determined to be approximately 0.012 per hectare. Selected gaps were surveyed in the field in 2008 to complement the remote sensing data and to provide information upon forest structure and regeneration. Simulation experiments were carried out with the individual-based KiWi mangrove model for quantifying the influence of different lightning regimes on the vertical and horizontal structure of the R. apiculata plantation. In addition, we conducted simulations with a natural and thus randomly generated forest to compare the structure of the two different cultivation types (i.e. plantation and natural forest). The simulation shows that even small disturbances can already partly buffer the risk of cohort senescence of monospecific even-aged plantations. However, after the decline of the plantation, the disturbance regime does not play an important role for further stand development. After the break-up of the initial strongly regular structure of the simulated plantation, a vertical pattern, i.e. height distribution of the trees, similar to the one of the natural forest, emerged quickly. However, the convergence for the horizontal structure i.e. the distance of trees to their nearest neighbor, took twice as long as for the vertical structure. Our results highlight the importance of small disturbances such as lightning strikes to mitigate vulnerability against synchronous windfall in homogenous forest structures. Hence, creating small openings artificially may be an appropriate management measure in areas where the frequency of natural small-scale disturbances is low. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Changes in mangrove forests around Douala, Cameroon, have been documented using aerial photography between 1974 and 2009. The distribution pattern of tree species was also assessed in 2009 following the point-centered quarter method (PCQM+) protocol. Pristine mangroves observed in 1974 had been disturbed markedly in 2003 and 2009. Some of the pre-existing mangroves were entirely replaced by settlements, road, and crops (maize, bean, banana, oil palm, green vegetables, and sugar cane plantations). From 1974 to 2003, 39.86 % of mangrove forests have disappeared; the net loss of 22.10 % occurred between 2003 and 2009 alone. Mangrove forest area had decreased 53.16 % around Douala over a 35-year period from 1974 to 2009 concurrent with a substantial increase of settlements (60 %), roads (233.33 %), agriculture areas (16 %), non-mangrove areas (193.33 %), and open water (152.94 %). Field survey showed that almost one third of the quadrants in the remaining mangrove forest were empty. The disrupted mangrove forest has an overall mean height, absolute density, and basal area of 19.80 m, 158 trees ha(-1), and 110.44 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. In comparison with scientific literature on mangrove degradation, this puts the mangroves around Douala at the top of the "peri-urban mangrove degradation" list. In addition, beyond listing of mangrove plants on the Red List of Threatened Species which will seldom lead to widely distributed species being listed, we call for the creation of a Red List of Locally Threatened Ecosystems, which in contrast is likely to list mangroves as an ecosystem under critical risk of (local) extinction in many countries around the globe, in particular, peri-urban sites.																	1559-2723					NOV	2013	36	6					1181	1192		10.1007/s12237-013-9638-8								WOS:000325099900007						
J	Zhang, XH; Tian, QJ				Zhang, Xuehong; Tian, Qingjiu			A mangrove recognition index for remote sensing of mangrove forest from space	CURRENT SCIENCE												Mangrove ecosystems, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, can provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services. At the same time, mangrove forest belongs to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and sustained a dramatic decline during the last half century. In this communication, a mangrove recognition index (MRI) has been developed for a quick monitoring of the extent and distribution of mangrove forest using remote sensing techniques. MRI is defined as broken vertical bar GVI(L) - GVI(H)broken vertical bar* GVI(L)*(WIL + WIH), where GVI and WI represent greenness vegetation index and wetness index respectively, obtained by Tasseled cap transformation. The former expresses the vegetation characteristics and the latter conveys the water information. The subscripts L and H denote low-tide level and high-tide level respectively. As a result, due to the unique near-shore wetland habitat of mangrove forest, MRI can respond sensitively its spectral signals and bigger the MRI of a pixel more likely that it belongs to mangrove forest. While MRIs of other ground covers, such as terrestrial vegetation, water, bare soil, etc. are less than that of mangrove forest. Combining multi-temporal Landsat TM images with different tide levels, the mangrove forest in Beilunhekou National Nature Reserve Area of China is used to demonstrate the usefulness of MRI.																	0011-3891					OCT 25	2013	105	8					1149	1155										WOS:000327053200026

The analysis of morphological and geobotanical units was carried out by applying processing and interpretation methods to optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, combined with data on water salinity, maximum flood height, sedimentary facies data, rainfall and river discharge. The temporal analysis of morphological and geobotanical units suggests the relative stabilization of savannah, varzea' and mangrove areas during the drier period and increasing tidal amplitude between 1987 to 1997. The wetter period and decreasing tidal amplitude between 1997 to 2008 led to an increase in the area of varzea' and lakes over savannah, and the expansion of mangroves mainly over the inundated field and tidal mud/mixed flats. Therefore, the decrease in rainfall index during the drier period is well-correlated with the reduction of the Calcoene River discharge and jointly with increasing tidal amplitude favored the increase of migration rate of the mud bank and erosion profile along the littoral. It was followed by the increase of the Calcoene River discharge and jointly with decreasing tidal amplitude during the wetter period, favoring the development of mangroves on muddy substrates near the coastline.

On account of almost persistent cloud cover in the rainy season, the application of optical remote sensing data presents a challenging exercise and demands special data processing and classification methods. An Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series is produced based on data from both platforms AQUA and TERRA, with dropouts and noise being effectively-reduced by applying an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter. Thereby, different parameterisation is applied dependent on the number of harvest cycles, which are defined by an initial harmonic analysis, based on an EVI time series of 5 years. Information on land cover is derived by a multistep unsupervised classification approach optimised for regions with frequent cloud cover, based on multispectral monthly and seasonal composites, amplitude and phase information from a 11-year EVI time series (2001-2011), and phenological metrics from 2010. Moreover, the environmental heterogenic conditions in the region are addressed by a regionally tuned clustering approach based on physiographic subregions and the use of auxiliary geodata. The results obtained demonstrate that the adapted approach performs satisfactory in terms of accuracy under given conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

R.; Kumar, Tanumi; Kundu, Nitai; Panigrahy, Sushma			Discrimination of mangrove species and mudflat classes using in situ hyperspectral data: a case study of Indian Sundarbans	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												This study attempts to assess whether canopy spectra of mangrove species and mudflat spectra recorded under field conditions contain adequate spectral information for discerning mangroves at species rank and mudflats at the class level. This article highlights the hyperspectral characteristics of canopies of 17 tropical mangrove species, belonging to nine families, creek water and four mudflat classes found in the tidal forests of Indian Sundarbans. Hyperspectral observations were recorded using a field spectroradiometer, and pre-processed and averaged reflectance values of samples were subjected to various statistically tests such as k-means cluster analysis, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), stepwise linear discrimination and factor analysis. k-means cluster analysis showed highest Euclidean distance between Rhizophoraceae and Myrsinaceae/Plumbaginaceae. ANOVA results indicated that all the canopy spectra were statistically different at all the spectral locations except one with majority of the bands exhibiting 99% confidence level, and for the mudflat classes and creek water, all bands showed p < 0.01. Discriminant analysis was performed in different combinations/cases to identify the bands for maximum separability. Optimal Wilks' Lambda (L) were achieved with two, six, four, eight, one, four, two and three for differentiating canopies of the species of Avicennia, Sonneratia, Xylocarpus, Bruguiera, Ceriops, Bruguiera and Rhizophora, all species of Rhizophoraceae, two species of Arecaceae, respectively. For mudflat classes and creek water, the best possible Wilks' Lambda were attained with four, five and two for discriminating upper, intermediate and mud lower, mud lower and water, mud upper with and without roots, correspondingly. Factor analysis was the tool used to identify the wavelengths that were uncorrelated and contained maximum information in the combination of selected wavelengths. The most significant bands for canopy discrimination were 960, 970, 1000, 1070, 1120, 1160, 2070, 2080, 2150, 2200, 2240 and 2340nm; for discrimination amongst mudflat classes and creek water, the bands were 540, 550, 730, 740, 770, 780, 880, 1190, 1290, 2010 and 2150nm. Overall, hyperspectral data showed potential for discriminating between mangrove canopies of different species and for discerning mudflat classes. The outcomes of the study also indicated the efficacy of the applied statistical tools for discrimination.																	1548-1603					AUG 1	2013	50	4					400	417		10.1080/15481603.2013.814275								WOS:000323452800003

Applications of ALOS PALSAR for monitoring biophysical parameters of a degraded black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) forest	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Within the last few decades mangrove forests worldwide have been experiencing high annual rates of loss and many of those that remain have undergone considerable degradation. To understand the condition of these forests, various optical remote sensing platforms have been used to map and monitor these wetlands, including the use of these data for biophysical parameter mapping. For many mangrove forests a reliable source of optical imagery is not possible given their location in quasi-permanent cloud cover or smoke covered regions. In such cases it is recommended that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) be considered. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationships between various ALOS-PALSAR modes, acquired from eight images, and mangrove biophysical parameter data collected from a black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forest that has experienced considerable degradation. In total, structural data were collected from 61 plots representing the four common stand types found in this degraded forest of the Mexican Pacific: tall healthy mangrove (n = 17), dwarf healthy mangrove (n = 15), poor condition mangrove (n = 13), and predominantly dead mangrove (n = 16). Based on backscatter coefficients, significant negative correlation coefficients were observed between filtered single polarization ALOS PALSAR (6.25 m) HH backscatter and Leaf Area Index (LAI). When the dead stands were excluded (n = 45) the strength of these relationships increased. Moreover, significant negative correlation coefficients were observed with stand height, Basal Area (BA) and to a lesser degree with stem density and mean DBH. With the coarser spatial resolution dual-polarization and quad polarization data (12.5 m) only a few, and weaker, correlation coefficients were calculated between the mangrove parameters and the filtered HH backscatter. However, significant negative values were once again calculated for the HH when the 16 dead mangrove stands were removed from the sample. Conversely, strong positive significant correlation coefficients were calculated between the cross-polarization HV backscatter and LAI when the dead mangrove stands were considered. Although fewer in comparison to the HH correlations, a number of VV backscatter based relationships with mangrove parameters were observed from the quad polarization mode and, to a lesser extent, with the one single VV polarization data. In addition to backscatter coefficients, stepwise multiple regression models of the mangrove biophysical parameter data were developed based on texture parameters derived from the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of the ALOS data. A similar pattern to the backscatter relationships was observed for models based on the single polarization unfiltered data, with fairly strong coefficients of determination calculated for LAI and stem height when the dead stands were excluded. In contrast, similar coefficients of determination with biophysical parameters were observed for the dual and quad polarization multiple regression models when the dead stands were both included and excluded from the analyses. An estimated mangrove LAI map of the study area, derived from a multiple regression model of the quad polarization texture parameters, showed comparable spatial patterns of degradation to a map derived from higher spatial resolution optical satellite data.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study demonstrates the capability of the hyper-dimensional remote sensing data for discriminating diversely-populated tropical mangrove species. It was found that five different tropical mangrove species of Southern Thailand, including Avicennia alba, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera parviflora, Rhizophora apiculata, and Rhizophora mucronata, were correctly classified. The selected data treatment (a well-established spectral band selector) helped improve the overall accuracy from 86% to 92%, despite the remaining confusion between the two members of the Rhizophoraceae family and the pioneer species. It is therefore anticipated that the methodology presented in this study can be used as a practical guideline for detailed mangrove species mapping in other study areas. The next stage of this work will be to exploit the differences between the leaf textures of the two Rhizophoraceae mangroves in order to refine the classification outcome.

This is true for the complex coastal region of Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the spatial variability in ecosystem fluxes from the Pacific coastal ocean, eutrophic lagoon, mangroves, and desert were studied. The Sky Arrow 650TCN environmental research aircraft proved to be an effective tool in characterizing land-atmosphere fluxes of energy, CO2, and water vapor across a heterogeneous landscape at the scale of 1 km. The aircraft was capable of discriminating fluxes from all ecosystem types, as well as between nearshore and coastal areas a few kilometers distant. Aircraft-derived average midday CO2 fluxes from the desert showed a slight uptake of -1.32 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), the coastal ocean also showed an uptake of -3.48 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and the lagoon mangroves showed the highest uptake of -8.11 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Additional simultaneous measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) allowed simple linear modeling of CO2 flux as a function of NDVI for the mangroves of the Magdalena Bay region. Aircraft approaches can, therefore, be instrumental in determining regional CO2 fluxes and can be pivotal in calculating and verifying ecosystem carbon sequestration regionally when coupled with satellite-derived products and ecosystem models.

Locating suitable mangrove plantation sites along the Saudi Arabia Red Sea Coast	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This paper describes a method to locate suitable sites for mangrove plantations along the southern Saudi Arabian Red Sea Coast based on the geological setting of the area. Geological characteristics such as soil type, geomorphology and drainage were considered as siting criteria. Satellite imagery and digital elevation models were interpreted to determine most of the parameters. The study determined that mangrove stands are primarily concentrated in the southern part of the study area and that they are sparsely found northward. Using data provided by satellite imagery, topographic maps and soil samples, the study was able to determine that three areas now barren of vegetation have the environmental elements necessary to support mangroves. One, in particular, would be especially suitable for establishing a plantation. In this paper, we describe the methods we used to make this determination and show the results of the analysis.

J	Luo, YM; Liao, MH; Yan, J; Zhang, CY; Shang, SL				Luo, Yanmin; Liao, Minghong; Yan, Jing; Zhang, Caiyun; Shang, Shaoling			Development and Demonstration of an Artificial Immune Algorithm for Mangrove Mapping Using Landsat TM	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Mangroves are valuable contributors to coastal ecosystems; knowledge of the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems is important in the context of global change. To obtain this knowledge, remote sensing is an indispensable means, yet it poses challenges since the accuracy is sometimes unsatisfactory in distinguishing mangroves from other land cover types with traditional classification methods. In this letter, we proposed a modified artificial immune algorithm (AIA), in which the antibodies represent the candidate solutions and the antigens are expressed by the fitness function. Multiclass coevolution was combined with the concept of clonal selection to ensure computation of an optimal clustering center in parallel for each land cover type. A cluster-center-oriented decimal encoding method for antibodies was adopted, and the inner class variance and the between-class difference together were used to formulate the fitness function. Furthermore, a design of the antibody solubility-based selection operator and nonuniform mutation operator was undertaken. Applying this modified AIA to a Landsat Thematic Mapper multispectral remote sensing imagery in the Zhangjiang estuary in southeastern China, we found that the AIA substantially improved classification accuracy over traditional methods, showing an overall accuracy of 90% (kappa coefficient = 0.88) and was capable to discern mangrove well (commission of 10% and omission of 22%).

Land Cover Dynamics Associated with the Spatial Changes in the Wetlands of Lagos/Lekki Lagoon System of Lagos, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Urban sprawl is one of the severe land use/land cover (LULC) change agents, especially in rapidly urbanizing developing countries such as Nigeria. Land use/land cover is among the key drivers of environmental change as it leads to dramatic changes in both landscape patterns and ecosystem functions. Lagos metropolis, the nation's economic nerve center, is on a low-lying coastal landscape endowed with lagoons, wetlands, and, other ecological assets. The Lagos/Lekki Lagoon system, with its catchments and wetlands, constitute about 71% of the state. With rapid urbanization and intense development pressure, some of the fringing wetlands and other land cover in the area have been converted to urban landscape. Just like the wetlands, the precise nature of these land cover changes is comprehensively unknown. In this ongoing study, land cover dynamics linked to the spatial changes in the wetlands fringing these lagoons are also comprehensively assessed. With low topography, high energy, and erosive coastlines, the extent of coastal erosion (1985-2009) in the area is assessed with remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) using topographic maps as baseline data. ENVI software is deployed for the processing of Landsat imageries, and unsupervised classification is used for image classification. The objective is to establish the locations and magnitude of the land cover dynamics between 1984 and 2006, ultimately leading to implications for flood risk on affected areas. Results show that as swamps decreased from 344.75 km(2) to 165.37 km(2) and mangroves decreased from 88.51 km(2) to 19.95 km(2), both between 1984 and 2006, built-up areas increased from 48.97 km(2) to 282.78 km(2) at 10.61 km(2)/y; water body decreased from 685.58 km(2) to 654.98 km(2) at -0.16 km(2)/y; bare land increased from 24.32 km(2) to 72.73 km(2) at 2.2 km(2)/y; and vegetation decreased marginally from 1369.15 km(2) to 1361.08 km(2) at -0.37 km(2)/y all between 1984 and 2006. Evidently most of the growth in built-up areas occurred in previous wetland areas and some vegetated areas. Most of the increase in built-up area occurred in the Eti-osa Local Government Area (LGA) and then in the Kosofe LGA. The decrease in the water body is attributable to anthropogenic action of reclamation and accretion arising from island formation on the Lekki Lagoon. Some of the consequences of the land cover (LC) dynamics are briefly highlighted.																	0749-0208					MAY	2013	29	3					671	679		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00038.1								WOS:000318457300016

Unmixing Analysis of a Time Series of Hyperion Images Over the Guanica Dry Forest in Puerto Rico	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												This paper presents the analysis of a time series of hyperspectral images collected with the Hyperion sensor on board EO-1 to demonstrate how hyperspectral imaging can be used for studying seasonal variations of vegetation cover over the Guanica Dry Forest in Puerto Rico. The approach is based on a local unmixing procedure that splits the hyperspectral scene into tiles and performs endmember extraction on each tile. The main assumption is that within a tile, a single spectral signature is an adequate representation of an endmember. Local endmember signatures from each tile are then clustered to extract endmember classes that better account for endmember spectral variability across the scene and provide a better global description of the full forest scene. Within a scene, abundances are computed using all extracted spectral endmembers and the abundance of an endmember class is computed as the sum of the abundances for the spectral endmembers belonging to that class. Variations in abundance maps are used to understand seasonal changes in forest cover. The procedure was performed using eleven near-cloud-free Hyperion images collected in different months in 2008. Results from the analysis agreed with published knowledge of the phenological changes for this forest. Correlation analyses with NDVI and rainfall time series are used to understand variations in coverage of certain endmember classes with weather. Mangrove was shown to be uncorrelated with rainfall, whereas the upland forest endmember was highly correlated with rain. This study shows the potential for unmixing methods to exploit hyperspectral data for temporal analysis.				; Van Bloem, Skip/C-5315-2016	Velez-Reyes, Miguel/0000-0002-6983-7250; Torres-Madronero, Maria C./0000-0002-9795-2459; Van Bloem, Skip/0000-0001-7165-6646												1939-1404	2151-1535				APR	2013	6	2	1		SI		329	338		10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2225096								WOS:000319277100009						
J	Hamilton, S				Hamilton, Stuart			ASSESSING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE IN DISPLACING MANGROVE FOREST	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												To fill a gap in the marine science literature, I calculated the amount of mangrove deforestation in tropical estuaries that is attributable to commercial aquaculture. The eight countries analyzed were Indonesia, Brazil,. India, Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Ecuador. Together these countries contain approximately 36% of the world's remaining mangrove forest. One precommercial aquaculture remote sensing survey and one current remote sensing survey were undertaken in the major mangrove holding estuaries in each nation. The time period of the analysis varied by country based on the first arrival of large-scale commercial aquaculture, with the majority of initial surveys occurring in the early to mid-1970s and all the current surveys occurring post-2004. The surveys classified the land cover of 110,557 randomly located estuarine point locations and examined the land-cover change over time for each of these discreet locations. Among the largest and most representative account of global mangrove to aquaculture conversion, this study revealed that mangrove forests have lost 51.9% of their aerial extent during the analysis period. Of the mangrove loss during this period, I estimate that commercial aquaculture accounted for 28% of total mangrove loss across all nations resulting in approximately 544,000 ha of mangrove forest converted to aquaculture. There were significant differences in mangrove loss and mangrove to aquaculture conversion from nation to nation and even within nations.

Bloom of Hemidiscus hardmannianus (Bacillariophyceae) and Its Impact on Water Quality and Plankton Community Structure in a Mangrove Wetland	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												An intense monospecies bloom of the centric diatom Hemidiscus hardmannianus (Greville) Mann. (Bacillariophyceae) occurred in the coastal waters of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India on 22 July, 2010. The species was abruptly flourished (mean density 8.86x106cells/L) resulting intense green coloration of water. The greatest impoverishment of diversity and density of phytoplankton, micro- and mesozooplankton community was observed during the bloom. The phytoplankton community showed an extreme reduction in diversity (12 species to one) and sharp decrease in standing stock (12.84x103 to 8.86x106cells/L) during this period. The late bloom condition coincided with sudden and huge arrival of a clupoid fish Hilsa ilisha which forms the most potential fisheries in Sundarban deltaic region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. The MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll and TMI satellite derived sea surface temperature and wind speed maps have been interpreted.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				APR	2013	41	4					333	339		10.1002/clen.201200012								WOS:000317288800005

Detecting large scale conversion of mangroves to aquaculture with change point and mixed-pixel analyses of high-fidelity MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mangrove forests of the tropical and subtropical regions provide critical ecosystem services, fulfill important socio-economic and environmental functions, and support coastal livelihoods. These forests are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems, both to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Yet, no map or published study exists showing detailed spatiotemporal trends of mangrove deforestation at local to regional scales. This study uses change point and mixed-pixel analyses with a time series (2000-2010) of high-fidelity imagery from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for tracking deforestation of mangroves in the Mahakam Delta of Indonesia at 250 m spatial scale and a 3-monthly temporal interval. The results show that a total of 21,000 +/- 152 ha of mangrove land in the Mahakam Delta were deforested and converted to shrimp ponds in 11 years. In 2000, the deforested lands covered 47% of the entire delta, while in 2010 it increased to 75%. Deforestation rates varied in each year, but peaked in 2002 and declined since then. The combination of high-fidelity time series data and a robust method of change detection resulted in a virtual reconstruction of 11 years of drastic land change history of the delta's mangrove areas at a consistent spatiotemporal scale. We anticipate that the methodology developed in this study will be useful to reconstruct deforestation histories of other places as well. Also, our findings can potentially be used to further explore the socioeconomic drivers of mangrove deforestation so that reliable, appropriate and sustainable methods of local and regional scale adaptation/mitigation strategies can be developed.

The impacts of shrimp farming on land use, employment and migration in Tumbes, northern Peru	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Export-oriented shrimp aquaculture appeared in the coastal landscape of Peru in the late 1970s. Its rapid development has entailed both positive and negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the newly emerging shrimp farming territory of the Tumbes river delta. Here we combine ground surveys and interviews with remote sensing analysis of the transformed environment in order to characterize and quantify the nature, origin and scale of the environmental and social impacts caused by the intrusion of aquaculture. Results show that shrimp farming has encroached on several land cover categories and converted 17% of the Peruvian mangrove. We provide an overview of the history and nature of those impacts. Minimum full-time equivalent employment, which occurred during a white-spot epidemic, was attained in 2001 with 439 full-time jobs; employment peaked in 2006, with 2660 full-time jobs. However, considering indirect benefits, remittances and the prevalence of part-time jobs, the population reliant on aquaculture probably exceeds 10,000. A geographical analysis of social networks reveals how shrimp farming draws a sustained influx of population from the Andes and how it modifies the interaction between population and the natural coastal environment. Recent sectorial improvements towards achieving a more sustainable management of the coastal resources are analysed, and additional recommendations predicated on a more integrated approach are provided.

J	Kumar, T; Panigrahy, S; Kumar, P; Parihar, JS				Kumar, Tanumi; Panigrahy, Sushma; Kumar, Prasanna; Parihar, Jai Singh			Classification of floristic composition of mangrove forests using hyperspectral data: case study of Bhitarkanika National Park, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The aim of the present work is to unveil the potential of some of the unexplored remote sensing techniques for mangrove studies. The paper deals with the classification of an Earth Observing-1 Hyperion image of the mangrove area of Bhitarkanika National Park, Odisha, India into mangrove floristic composition classes. Out of 196 calibrated bands of the image, 56 were found to be highly uncorrelated and contained maximum information; therefore, these 56 bands were used for classification. Amongst the three full-pixel classifiers tested in the investigation, Support Vector Machine produced the best results in terms of training pixel accuracy with overall precision of 96.85 %, in comparison to about 70-72.0 % for the other two classifiers. A total of five mangrove classes were obtained - pure or dominant class of Heritiera fomes, mixed class of H. fomes, mixed Excoecaria agallocha with Avicennia officinalis, mixed class of fringing Sonneratia apetala and class comprising of mangrove associates with salt resistant grasses. Post-classification field data also established the same. Pure or dominant classes of H. fomes occupied more than 50 % of the total mangrove vegetation in the forest blocks of the National Park. Spectral profile matching of image pixels with that of in-situ collected canopy reflectance profile revealed good match for H. fomes (pure or dominant stands). Red-edge index, which was a preferred criterion for matching was notably correlated in case of H. fomes and E. agallocha. The outcomes indicated the efficacy of hyperspectral canopy reflectance library for such kind of work. It is hoped that the methodology presented in this paper will prove to be useful and may be followed for producing mangrove floristic maps at finer levels.																	1400-0350					MAR	2013	17	1					121	132		10.1007/s11852-012-0223-2								WOS:000315336900011						
J	Juman, RA; Ramsewak, D				Juman, Rahanna A.; Ramsewak, Deanesh			Land cover changes in the Caroni Swamp Ramsar Site, Trinidad (1942 and 2007): implications for management	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Caroni Swamp Ramsar Site, the largest mangrove dominated wetland in Trinidad and Tobago, continues to be impacted by human activities. This study examines changes in land cover and land use from 1942 to 2007 using remote sensing technology, geographic information systems (GIS) and extensive field surveys. Land cover maps were produced for 1942, 1957, 1986, 1994, 2003 and 2007 from aerial photos and high resolution satellite imagery. Caroni Swamp's hydrology was altered in the 1920's to facilitate rice cultivation. This resulted in the formation of large tracts of freshwater marsh. From 1942 to 1957, freshwater marsh and agriculture lands increased, but after this period there was a steady decline in both, as freshwater was diverted away from the wetland and salt water intruded further inland. Although mangrove forest was cleared for built development, its coverage has consistently increased in the Swamp from 1957, with the exception of 2003 when there was a decrease by less than 100 ha. This is in contrast to most areas in the tropics where mangrove coverage continue to decline. In this case, the mangrove trees are out-competing/shading marsh vegetation, causing shift in the wetland communities. In the Caroni Ramsar Site, the natural wetland communities generally increased from 1942 to 2003, but declined in 2007, as built development more than doubled. The paper provides spatial coverage, and quantifies land cover from 1942 to 2007. It also identifies reasons for the changes in land cover and uses, and the implications for management.																	1400-0350					MAR	2013	17	1					133	141		10.1007/s11852-012-0225-0								WOS:000315336900012

In this investigation, leaf N concentration and corresponding laboratory hyperspectral data were examined for two species of mangrove (Avicennia germinans, Rhizophora mangle) representing a variety of conditions (healthy, poor condition, dwarf) of a degraded mangrove forest located in the Mexican Pacific. This is the first time leaf nitrogen content has been examined using close range hyperspectral remote sensing of a degraded mangrove forest. Simple comparisons between individual wavebands and N concentrations were examined, as well as two models employed to predict N concentrations based on multiple wavebands. For one model, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed based on known N absorption bands. For comparative purposes, a second model, based on the well-known Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR) approach, was employed using the entire dataset. For both models, the input data included continuum removed reflectance, band depth at the centre of the absorption feature (BNC), and log (1/BNC). Weak to moderate correlations were found between N concentration and single band spectral responses. The results also indicate that ANNs were more predictive for N concentration than was SMLR, and had consistently higher r(2) values. The highest r(2) value (0.91) was observed in the prediction of black mangrove (A. germinans) leaf N concentration using the BNC transformation. It is thus suggested that artificial neural networks could be used in a complementary manner with other techniques to assess mangrove health, thereby improving environmental monitoring in coastal wetlands, which is of prime importance to local communities. In addition, it is recommended that the BNC transformation be used on the input for such N concentration prediction models.

Mangrove Inventory of India at Community Level	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												Mangroves are salt tolerant plants that occur between 32A degrees N and 38A degrees S latitudes. Mangroves play an important role in stabilizing shoreline and protect the coast against storm surges and heavy tides. Though the mangrove inventory has been done earlier in India using satellite data but no systematic attempts has been made to map the mangroves at the community level for the entire country. The present paper reports the mangrove inventory at community level for India using Resourcesat-1 satellite data. State wise inventory on the mangrove area and the dominant communities are presented. Total area under mangrove based on the satellite data of 2005-2007 is 495,620 ha. West Bengal has the highest area under mangrove.																	0250-541X					FEB	2013	36	1					67	77		10.1007/s40009-012-0087-x								WOS:000315334200010

The typical mangroves of Guangxi Shankou Mangrove Reserve were taken for study objects, the standard spectrum curves of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (Linn.) Savigny, Rhizophora stylosa, Kandelia candel, Avicennia marina, Aegiceras corniculatum, Spartina anglica and mudflat were gained by denoising analysis of field-measured spectrum curves acquired by ASD FieldSpec 2. Analyzing the spectral characteristics and their differences, the authors found that the spectrum curves for various kinds of mangrove are coincident, the bands that appeared with reflection peaks and reflection valleys are basically identical, the within-class differentiated characteristics are comparatively small, the spectrum characteristics of mangroves are obviously different with Spartina anglica and mudflat. In order to gain the quantitative description for within-class differentiated characteristics of mangrove, space distance method, correlation coefficient method and spectral angle mapping method were used to calculate the within-class differentiated characteristics. The division accuracy of correlation coefficient method is higher than spectral angle mapping method which is higher than space distance method, and the result indicates that the spectrum differences of within-class mangrove and Spartina anglica are relatively small with correlation coefficients more than 0. 995, and spectrum curve angle cosine values more than 0. 95.																	1000-0593					FEB	2013	33	2					454	458		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)02-0454-05								WOS:000314675100037

Application of multi-scale remote sensing imagery to detection and hazard analysis	NATURAL HAZARDS												To both collect terrain data rapidly and save labor costs, the present study employs high-spatiotemporal-resolution imaging through Formosat-2 and aerial photography through unmanned aerial vehicles. In daily visits to the same area, images taken by Formosat-2 can be employed as data for long-term observation. Unclouded images from 2006 to 2010 processed with a false-color overlay and calculated of the normalized difference vegetation index are selected as terrain data. Aerial photos taken by unmanned aerial vehicles are utilized ground-truth data. These two types of data are analyzed to proceed with supervised classification. The results reveal that in the study area mangroves are the most exuberant in summer. The growth of mangroves in Sihcao Wetland remained in dynamic equilibrium from 2006 to 2010 without any sharp increase or decrease in quantity. This proposed method is believed to be suitable to investigate and preserve mangroves by long-term image monitoring and to avoid any unnatural influence on these conservation areas.																	0921-030X					FEB	2013	65	3					2241	2252		10.1007/s11069-012-0472-2								WOS:000313008500056

In many tropical regions, such efforts have focused largely on the use of optical data despite low capture rates because of persistent cloud cover. Recognizing the ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for providing cloud-free observations, this study investigated the use of JERS-1 SAR and ALOS PALSAR data, acquired in 1996 and 2008 respectively, for mapping the extent of mangroves along the Brazilian coastline, from east of the Amazon River mouth, Para State, to the Bay of Sao Jose in Maranhao. For each year, an object-orientated classification of major land covers (mangrove, secondary vegetation, gallery and swamp forest, open water, intermittent lakes and bare areas) was performed with the resulting maps then compared to quantify change. Comparison with available ground truth data indicated a general accuracy in the 2008 image classification of all land covers of 96% (kappa = 90.6%, tau = 92.6%). Over the 12 year period, the area of mangrove increased by 718.6 km(2) from 6705 m(2) to 7423.60 km(2), with 1931.0 km(2) of expansion and 1213 km(2) of erosion noted; 5493 km(2) remained unchanged in extent. The general accuracy relating to changes in mangroves was 83.3% (Kappa 66.1%; tau 66.7%). The study confirmed that these mangroves constituted the largest continuous belt globally and were experiencing significant change because of the dynamic coastal environment and the influence of sedimentation from the Amazon River along the shoreline. The study recommends continued observations using combinations of SAR and optical data to establish trends in mangrove distributions and implications for provision of ecosystem services (e.g., fish/invertebrate nurseries, carbon storage and coastal protection).

Under collaboration with Center of Satellite Technology, Indonesian Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN), the concept LAPAN-CRIBA micro satellite is being developed. The mission of the satellite is for land cover mapping, disaster monitoring, Cryosphere monitoring, and oceanographic monitoring. In land cover mapping, the mission is to classify the forest and non-forest area, estimation of tree trunk height, and mangrove area monitoring. The system design of the microsatellite is presented in this paper. The resulted system design shows that the satellite could perform the mission while meeting the dimensional and weight requirement of most auxilary payload launches. The design also show that the satellite will have sufficient power to operate the payload during its pass in Indonesia and Japan area, and ocasionally on other areas on non-direct downlink mode.					triharjanto, robertus/0000-0001-7958-4384																		2013							5	10										WOS:000335733900005

Despite their great value, mangroves have one of the highest rates of degradation of any global habitat, which is about 1% of the existing area per year. In fact, the socioeconomic value and ecosystem services of mangroves as a natural product are underestimated. The ecosystem services provided by mangroves are often ignored by the ongoing process of mangrove conversion. This is a major reason why conservation of this ecosystem is not a popular alternative. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in mangrove forests and valuation of their ecosystem services. SPOT 5 imageries of years 2000 and 2010 have been used for change detection analysis. The vegetation index such as NDVI and AVI and unsupervised classification technique were employed in image processing. In order to obtain the value of socioeconomic impact from the mangrove changes and biodiversity disturbances, the ecosystem service valuation (ESV) model was applied. Results show that the total value of the existing mangrove forest ecosystem service was RM1,901,859.84. The value per unit area is about RM 1,650.92 /ha. The total values of others were RM161, 33.2 (crop land) and RM3,107,500 (water bodies), respectively. It is evident that Sungai Merbok's Mangrove Forest Reserve is very important for coastal ecology, where the orientation of mangrove ecosystem is huge and serves to provide essential services for the community. It also plays a crucial role in providing ecological balance to the coastal environment.																	0302-9743		978-3-642-39643-4				2013	7972						611	622										WOS:000335143000044

This study explored the possibility of retrieving the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sodium from mangroves in the Berau Delta, Indonesia. The objectives of the study were to (1) assess the accuracy of foliar chemistry retrieval, (2) compare the performance of models based on support vector regression (SVR), i.e. E-SVR, -SVR, and least squares SVR (LS-SVR), to models based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), and (3) investigate which spectral transformations are best suited. The results indicated that nitrogen could be successfully modelled at the landscape level (R-2=0.67, root mean square error (RMSE)=0.17, normalized RMSE (nRMSE)=15%), whereas estimations of P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na were less encouraging. The developed nitrogen model was applied over the study area to generate a map of foliar N variation, which can be used for studying ecosystem processes in mangroves. While PLSR attained good results directly using all untransformed bands, the highest accuracy for nitrogen modelling was achieved using a combination of LS-SVR and continuum-removed derivative reflectance. All SVR techniques suffered from multicollinearity when using the full spectrum, and the number of independent variables had to be reduced by singling out the most informative wavelength bands. This was achieved by interpreting and visualizing the structure of the PLSR and SVR models.				Faculty of ITC, Dep Nat.

Mapping tsunami impacts on land cover and related ecosystem service supply in Phang Nga, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused damages to coastal ecosystems and thus affected the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on services provided by these ecosystems. The paper presents a case study on evaluating and mapping the spatial and temporal impacts of the tsunami on land use and land cover (LULC) and related ecosystem service supply in the Phang Nga province, Thailand. The method includes local stakeholder interviews, field investigations, remote-sensing techniques, and GIS. Results provide an ecosystem services matrix with capacity scores for 18 LULC classes and 17 ecosystem functions and services as well as pre-/post-tsunami and recovery maps indicating changes in the ecosystem service supply capacities in the study area. Local stakeholder interviews revealed that mangroves, casuarina forest, mixed beach forest, coral reefs, tidal inlets, as well as wetlands (peat swamp forest) have the highest capacity to supply ecosystem services, while e.g. plantations have a lower capacity. The remote-sensing based damage and recovery analysis showed a loss of the ecosystem service supply capacities in almost all LULC classes for most of the services due to the tsunami. A fast recovery of LULC and related ecosystem service supply capacities within one year could be observed for e.g. beaches, while mangroves or casuarina forest needed several years to recover. Applying multi-temporal mapping the spatial variations of recovery could be visualised. While some patches of coastal forest were fully recovered after 3 yr, other patches were still affected and thus had a reduced capacity to supply ecosystem services. The ecosystem services maps can be used to quantify ecological values and their spatial distribution in the framework of a tsunami risk assessment. Beyond that they are considered to be a useful tool for spatial analysis in coastal risk management in Phang Nga.																	1561-8633						2013	13	12					3095	3111		10.5194/nhess-13-3095-2013								WOS:000329062900002						
J	Jusoff, K				Jusoff, Kamaruzaman			Malaysian Mangrove Forests and their Significance to the Coastal Marine Environment	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Mangrove forests are one of the most productive and bio-diverse wetland environments on earth. Yet these unique coastal tropical forest environments are among the most threatened habitats in the world. Some key progress points in mangrove conservation, restoration, and research in Malaysia are highlighted. Based on an intensive literature review, the ecology and ecological management, distribution and areas of existing mangroves in the world and Malaysia, issues associated with mangrove conservation and restoration are discussed. Growing in the intertidal areas and estuary mouths between land and sea, mangroves provide critical habitat for diverse marine and terrestrial flora and fauna. Important for the flora and fauna is the opportunity to continue living in a sustainable environment and in suitable conditions. A potential stand is the place that obtains the possibility of germination and establishment of a plant species according to their physical, chemical, and biological demands. In many cases it is seen that because of unsuitable selection of site and species, afforestation and reforestation projects are forced to fail after spending time, cost, and labor. The population boom and rapid economic developments have greatly reduced mangrove areas in Malaysia despite the Malaysian government launching a series of programs to protect mangroves in the 1980s and establishing mangrove ecosystems as high-priority areas for improving environmental and living resource management. The issues, threats, and significant values of mangroves also were highlighted. A more systematic protection strategy using ecological engineering management-based, active restoration and rehabilitation measurements still are urgently needed in order to preserve these valuable resources in Malaysia.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2013	22	4					979	1005										WOS:000323402700001

Ecuador is no exception to this trend, with substantial mangrove deforestation across almost all regions. This paper synthesizes a literature review of Ecuadorian mangroves, a remote sensing analysis of the past and present extent of mangrove forests conducted for another paper, and ethnographic field research conducted in the major estuaries of northern Ecuador to present the role of mangrove wetlands in supporting local livelihoods in Ecuador's coastal communities. This paper takes a macro-micro approach, examining the global questions of mangroves and then discussing the micro situation of mangroves in Ecuador before moving onto estuarine specific profiles. All the major mangrove regions of northern Ecuador are examined with a particular emphasis on deforestation / reforestation trends, the estuarine specific forces driving and responding to these trends, as well as the livelihood response of the impacted communities. The research relies on the most current estimates of mangrove forests as well as historic calculations of mangrove area.

Because of the similar spectral characteristics and complex spatial structure among different mangrove communities, it is still difficult to extract accurate mangrove communities covers from the very high resolution (VHR) satellite images, based on the conventional pixel-based classification methods. Object-oriented classification methods are proposed to process VHR. images because they can incorporate as much information on spatial neighbourhood properties as possible into the classification process. On the basis of object-oriented classification method, the paper extracted the Zhangjiangkou mangrove communities using Quickbird image, through image segmentation, merge segmentation, computing and selecting attributes, K Nearest Neighbor classification, et al. Mangrove communities were eventually divided into six types, i.e. Aegiceras corniculatum, Phragmites karka, Kandelia candel, Cyperus malaccensis, Avicennia marin, Aegiceras corniculatum & Kandelia candel. The extraction accuracy is 85.7%. In this paper, through many experiments, the scale level was determined to 50, and the merge threshold was chosen as 90. In this case, the resulting segments of mangrove communities had a obvious spatial characteristics, and the boundary can be delineated well, which would be help for later information extraction. Considering mangrove communities characters, the following object attributes are generated and added : NDVI, texture, and AVGBAND. This research shows very encouraging results for the use of image segmentation and Quickbird data for mapping mangrove communities.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-544-7				2013	605-607						2274	2278		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.605-607.2274								WOS:000318958001110						
J	Vo, QT; Oppelt, N; Leinenkugel, P; Kuenzer, C				Quoc Tuan Vo; Oppelt, Natascha; Leinenkugel, Patrick; Kuenzer, Claudia			Remote Sensing in Mapping Mangrove Ecosystems - An Object-Based Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Over the past few decades, clearing for shrimp farming has caused severe losses of mangroves in the Mekong Delta (MD) of Vietnam. Although the increasing importance of shrimp aquaculture in Vietnam has brought significant financial benefits to the local communities, the rapid and largely uncontrolled increase in aquacultural area has contributed to a considerable loss of mangrove forests and to environmental degradation. Although different approaches have been used for mangrove classification, no approach to date has addressed the challenges of the special conditions that can be found in the aquaculture-mangrove system in the Ca Mau province of the MD. This paper presents an object-based classification approach for estimating the percentage of mangroves in mixed mangrove-aquaculture farming systems to assist the government to monitor the extent of the shrimp farming area. The method comprises multi-resolution segmentation and classification of SPOT5 data using a decision tree approach as well as local knowledge from the region of interest. The results show accuracies higher than 75% for certain classes at the object level. Furthermore, we successfully detect areas with mixed aquaculture-mangrove land cover with high accuracies. Based on these results, mangrove development, especially within shrimp farming-mangrove systems, can be monitored. However, the mangrove forest cover fraction per object is affected by image segmentation and thus does not always correspond to the real farm boundaries.

As such, protection of mangroves is an urgent priority. This work provides some new information on patterns of degradation in the Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, which are home to more than 35 reptile species, 120 commercial fish species, 300 bird species and 32 mammal species. Using radar imagery, we contrast and quantify the recent impacts of cyclone Sidr and anthropogenic degradation on this ecosystem. Our results, inferred from changes in radar backscatter, confirm already reported trends in coastline retreat for this region, with areas losing as much as 200 m of coast per year. They also suggest rapid changes in mangrove dynamics for Bangladesh and India, highlighting an overall decrease in mangrove health in the east side of the Sundarbans, and an overall increase in this parameter for the west side of the Sundarbans. As global environmental change takes its toll in this part of the world, more detailed, regular information on mangroves' distribution and health is required: our study illustrates how different threats experienced by mangroves can be detected and mapped using radar-based information, to guide management action.

The objective of this study was to generate the coastal and marine habitat map for the Straits of Malacca using the SPOT and Landsat data acquired at low tide in 2010 similar to 2012. Images were first processed with atmospheric and geometric correction. The hierarchical unsupervised classification and contextual editing were then used to produce the final habitat map. The WorldView2 and GeoEye data were also used for evaluating purposes in some studied area. Our classification scheme included sandy beach, mangrove forest, mud /sand flat, seagrass /algae, coral reefs, water and others. The produced habitat map provides the most up to date habitat information in the Straits of Malacca and will aid for the regional coastal ecosystems assessment as well as for future comparative study.

Comparison of Landsat image classification methods for detecting mangrove forests in Sundarbans	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote-sensing images taken from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor with a spatial resolution of 30 m were applied for mapping and inventory of mangrove forest areas in Sundarbans, on both sides of the border between Bangladesh and India. Three different classification methods - unsupervised classification with k-means clustering, supervised classification using the maximum likelihood decision rule, and band-ratio supervised classification - were tested and compared in terms of the top of the atmosphere reflectance images. Spectral signature and principal component analyses were applied to select the appropriate band combinations prior to the band ratio-supervised classification. Our results show that the band ratio method is superior to the unsupervised or supervised classification methods considering the visual inspection, producer's and user's accuracy, as well as the overall accuracy of the all the classes in the image. The best discrimination of mangrove/nonmangrove boundary can be achieved when the combinations of B4/B2 (band 4/band 2), B5/B7, and B7/B4 are employed from the ETM+ bands.

The accuracy of the object parameters was examined to determine the optimal colour and shape ratios for the hierarchical classification. At the first level of classification (mangroves from non-mangroves), the results indicate that it is possible to accurately separate mangrove areas from saltpan and water/shallow zones using both sets of SAR images for the Mabala and Yelitono islands of southern Guinea. The final accuracies, based on the most optimal object parameters, were 91.1% and 92.3% for the single-and dual-polarized data, respectively. At the second level of classification, separation among the three mangrove classes identified was most accurate when using the dual-polarized data, at an overall accuracy of only 63.4%. The three mangrove classes identified included tall red mangrove (Rhizophora racemosa), dwarf red mangrove (R. mangle and R. harisonii), and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Using the optimal combination of parameters, the extent to which a filter could be used to improve the accuracy was examined. At this level, it was determined that the dual-polarized data, filtered with a 3 x 3 Lee speckle filter and a segmentation scale of 5, resulted in an overall accuracy of 64.9%. Consequently, it is recommended that for persistently cloud-covered regions, such as Guinea, ALOS PALSAR data using an OBIA could be useful as a quick method for mapping and monitoring mangroves.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013; Kovacs, John/B-3641-2008	Kovacs, John/0000-0002-0520-3996; Flores de Santiago, Francisco/0000-0001-8813-0093												0143-1161						2013	34	2					563	586		10.1080/01431161.2012.715773								WOS:000308995800010

A multitemporal analysis of tsunami impact on coastal vegetation using remote sensing: a case study on Koh Phra Thong Island, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS												The Indian Ocean tsunami event of December 26, 2004 not only left massive casualties and economic damages, but also raised concerns about the destruction and recovery of coastal ecosystems. This work aimed to analyze the spatial patterns and temporal trajectories of vegetation damage and recovery using a multisensor multitemporal remote sensing, dataset. Using the study area of Koh Phra Thong, Thailand as a case study, we demonstrate the capabilities of remote sensing analysis in assessing the consequences of an extreme flooding event on the dynamics of coastal vegetation. Field surveys and satellite mid-resolution multispectral satellite data covering the period from February 2003 to December 2009 were used to map flooded areas and coastal vegetation loss and recovery following the tsunami. Normalized Difference Reflectance change detection was performed to map the extent of flooded areas. Vegetation Fraction Cover derived using spectral unmixing techniques was used to study the multitemporal changes in coastal vegetation after the event. Vegetation change detection techniques were applied to characterize the vegetation cover changes in two different time frames: short-term changes (from 4 days to 1 year after the event), and long-term dynamics (up to 5 years after). Estimates of vegetation change (decline, recovery, and gain) were quantified and mapped, with extreme vegetation losses found directly after the tsunami (up to 79 % in flooded areas). After 1 year, different trends had developed, indicating that recovering vegetation had reached up to 55 % of pre-tsunami land cover, but with different trajectories for each vegetation type.

We aimed at testing low-cost remote sensing sources and simple methodology for recognising the invasive species Robinia pseudacacia and thus founding a monitoring scheme. A study area with mixed wooded stands containing R. pseudacacia has been selected for this purpose in NE Slovenia. Four different sources (Landsat ETM and airborne orthophotos from summer and spring) were tested together with a filtering for forested areas. Filtering was based either on Landsat information or on a forest polygon layer as alternatives. Generalised linear models were constructed in a training window within the study area to establish a statistical rule of recognition for the species based on spectral information. Models were tested both within and outside the training window for accuracy. As means of accuracy assessment both the well-established AUC and the specially adapted Jaccard index have been applied. The best and most reliable recognition was achieved by using the spring orthophoto, in which the species was captured in flower, combined with a GIS filtering by a forest vector layer. The superiority of this combination was especially striking when tested over the full study area. The Jaccard index appeared to be more sensitive in discrimination between models. Thus we conclude that even spectrally less detailed data sources may provide a basis for successful monitoring if the phenology of the target species is also considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity richness in Nicobar Islands (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), India	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Occurrences of extreme events are likely to cause major decline in global biodiversity. In one such event, on December 26, 2004 tsunami caused extensive damage and irreparable losses to the ecology and biodiversity of low-lying areas of the countries located around the Indian Ocean region. Archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, one of the richest centre of endemism and biodiversity in the Indo-Malayan region, suffered great loss of forests and coastal biodiversity owing to its closeness to the epicenter of tsunami, i.e. just off the coast of Indonesia. There is little insight into the resilience and rate of recovery pattern of tropical coastal habitats consequent to catastrophic impacts of tsunami. It's important to study the impacts of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity in order to suggest mitigation, restoration measures and long-term conservation planning. Here we have assessed the immediate after-effects of December 26, 2004 tsunami on the forests and areas prioritized for biodiversity conservation analyzing pre and post tsunami satellite imageries. The effect of topographic patterns of Island's coastal areas and their distance from the epicenter of tsunami with respect to changes in the forests and different levels of biologically rich areas modeled for prioritization for different groups of Islands in Nicobar has been studied. Great Nicobar accounted for higher proportion of total forest area damaged and submerged in Nicobar, followed by Central Nicobar and Car Nicobar. Mangroves, littoral forest, beach forest and low land swamps and Syzygium swamps were most affected. Study brings out spatially explicit scenario of damaged, submerged and lost forest areas and corresponding area statistics, vital for understanding and mitigating medium and long term effects of tsunami an extreme event.																	0960-3115					MAY	2012	21	5			SI		1267	1287		10.1007/s10531-011-0214-x								WOS:000302570400008

In October 1983, a mangrove area of nearly 300 ha located on the southeastern coast of Brazil was impacted by a 3.5 million liter crude oil spill released by a broken pipeline. In order to assess the long-term effects of oil pollution on mangrove vegetation, we carried out a GIS-based multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs of the years 1962, 1994, 2000 and 2003. Photointerpretation, visual classification, class quantification, ground-truth and vegetation structure data were combined to evaluate the oil impact. Before the spill, the mangroves exhibited a homogeneous canopy and well-developed stands. More than ten years after the spill, the mangrove vegetation exhibited three distinct zones reflecting the long-term effects of the oil pollution. The most impacted zone (10.5 ha) presented dead trees, exposed substrate and recovering stands with reduced structural development. We suggest that the distinct impact and recovery zones reflect the spatial variability of oil removal rates in the mangrove forest. This study identifies the multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs as a useful tool for assessing a system's capacity for recovery and monitoring the long-term residual effects of pollutants on vegetation dynamics, thus giving support to mangrove forest management and conservation.

Many of these forests are identified as degraded based on observable changes in their leaves (e.g., density, size, color, etc.). Of these, color can be considered one of the most important indicators of degradation because changes in the spectral response may be indicative of changes in the leaf pigment content. In this investigation, hyperspectral laboratory techniques were applied to examine potential relationships between the mangrove leaf spectral response and three leaf pigments: chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total carotenoid content. Using an ASD spectroradiometer, the spectral reflectance of leaf samples were collected from poor condition, dwarf and healthy black (Avicennia germinans) and from healthy and poor condition red (Rhizophora mangle) mangroves located in a degraded mangrove system of the Mexican Pacific. A subset of 150 representational leaves was then used for pigment content analysis. The results indicate significant relationships between the spectral response and the levels of chlorophyll a, b, and total carotenoid content contained in the leaves. In particular, wavebands at the red edge position were shown to be the best predictors of the pigment contents. The results also indicate that vegetation indices do not necessarily improve the ability to predict these constituents. Finally, the red edge position was found to be significantly different between the healthy and poor condition mangroves (P = 0), with the healthy mangroves having longer wavelengths associated with the red edge position. c 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Identification of hot spots and well managed areas of Pichavaram mangrove using Landsat TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV: an example of coastal resource conservation along Tamil Nadu Coast, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The present work is a multi-temporal satellite based study on the spatial dynamic of an important coastal habitat, the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem, over a period of 15 years. The Pichavaram mangrove forest near Chidambaram, South India is the second largest mangrove forest in the world. Unsupervised classification, the Iterative Self Organising Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA), has been used to classify the mangrove cover into the open and dense classes. The status of the classes has been monitored using Landsat TM of 1991, 2001, and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV of 2006 satellite data. The study demonstrated that by classifying mangrove ecosystem into just the 3 classes using remote sensing data and by studying their temporal variations, it is possible to get a reasonably accurate picture of the extent and condition of the mangrove ecosystem. The total area of the Pichavaram mangrove showed a net increase of 2.51 km(2) within a span of 15 years (1991 to 2006). The hot spots that are at a risk of being degraded, and on the other hand, the mangrove areas that are well managed are identified using Geographical Information System (GIS) tools for the restoration and conservation measures.																	1400-0350					MAR	2012	16	1					1	12		10.1007/s11852-011-0162-3								WOS:000300888500001

An integrated GIS for sedimentological and geomorphological analysis of a lagoon environment. Barra de Cananeia inlet region, (Southeastern Brazil)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The aim of this work is to use GIS integration data to characterize sedimentary processes in a SubTropical lagoon environment. The study area was the Canan,ia Inlet estuary in the southeastern section of the Canan,ia Lagoon Estuarine System (CLES), state of So Paulo, Brazil (25A degrees 03'S/47A degrees 53'W). The area is formed by the confluence of two estuarine channels forming a bay-shaped water body locally called "Trapand, Bay". The region is surrounded by one of the most preserved tracts of Atlantic Rain Forest in Southwestern Brazil and presents well-developed mangroves and marshes. In this study a methodology was developed using integrated a GIS database based on bottom sediment parameters, geomorphological data, remote sensing images, Hidrodynamical Modeling data and geophysical parameters. The sediment grain size parameters and the bottom morphology of the lagoon were also used to develop models of net sediment transport pathways. It was possible to observe that the sediment transport vectors based on the grain size model had a good correlation with the transport model based on the bottom topography features and Hydrodynamic model, especially in areas with stronger energetic conditions, with a minor contribution of finer sediments. This relation is somewhat less evident near shallower banks and depositional features. In these regions the organic matter contents in the sediments was a good complementary tool for inferring the hydrodynamic and depositional conditions (i.e. primary productivity, sedimentation rates, sources, oxi-reduction rates).

Among remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar is a particularly advantageous method to monitor mangroves: images are not dependent on cloud cover and can provide information from forest understory. This article mapped mangrove forests in the southern coast of Sao Paulo State (Brazil) using frequency-based contextual classification of incoherent attributes derived from a multi-polarized Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) image. The use of 10 incoherent attributes and only 3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) vegetation indices as input for digital classification showed the best accuracies with kappa index values of 0.739 and 0.734, respectively. HH polarization and SAR vegetation indices were the attributes that contributed most to the mangrove mapping procedure. The use of L-Band SAR data was effective for mapping mangrove areas, and therefore it is recommended as a tool for coastal management.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013; Cunha Lignon, Marilia/B-8953-2012	Rocha de Souza Pereira, Francisca/0000-0002-1319-7717												2150-704X						2012	3	7					567	576		10.1080/01431161.2011.641511								WOS:000308397900003

Although frequently criticized and despite many alternatives, due to its simplicity and intuitive manner, post-classification change detection still remains one of the most applied techniques. Many studies in the field of change detection analysis acknowledge, for instance, the impact of misregistration, inconsistencies in classification schemes or differences in methods for image interpretation. However, there are additional, rarely studied influences that can cause large errors in change detection results, including integrating multi-resolution data, the adjacency effect and the minimum mapping units (MMUs) that are applied to the classification before change detection. This study demonstrates these effects for the complex land cover of the Alvarado mangrove area at the Mexican Gulf Coast, employing 10 m Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) high geometric resolution (HRG)-based and 57 m Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) classifications. As a baseline, the proportion of the fine spatial resolution classes within the coarse spatial resolution cells were derived, from which proportional change matrices were computed. The analysis employs difference measures to compare change matrices and proportional maps. The impact of various tested resampling functions was negligible if coarse resolution data were refined. For coarsening fine spatial resolution data, change matrix comparison was comparatively small but yielded differences of approximately 20% in spatially explicit measures. Incorrect positional alignment indicated differences of up to 5% in the change matrix for a misregistration of 100 m and even higher spatially explicit differences (28%). The discrepancies due to the adjacency effect were rather low. MMUs of 25 ha resulted in differences of up to 36% in the change matrix. The magnitude of the discrepancies of all studied effects depends on the class diversity in the map, and some can also be related to the difference in spatial resolution.																	0143-1161						2012	33	20					6426	6445		10.1080/01431161.2012.688148								WOS:000304593100008

Mapping coffee plantations with Landsat imagery: an example from El Salvador	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Considering the potential of shaded coffee plantations mixed with natural vegetation for promoting biodiversity conservation, this project assessed the utility of multi-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery for the characterization of natural vegetation versus coffee plantations in western El Salvador. For assembling a multi-temporal Landsat TM data set, we applied a regression analysis model to remove cloud cover and cloud shadows. Then, through a hybrid classification approach, a nine-class land use/land cover (LULC) map was generated. We identified two types of coffee plantations ('open-canopy' and 'close-canopy') along with natural forest/shrubland, mangrove, water bodies, sandy coastal soils, bare soil, urban areas and agriculture. Notwithstanding the small sample size of the accuracy data, our assessment revealed an overall accuracy of 76.7% (Kappa coefficient = 0.68), considering only the four classes with independent field data. The overall classification accuracy for distinguishing coffee plantations from non-mangrove natural forest was 81.6% and the classification accuracy for distinguishing 'open-canopy' from 'close-canopy' coffee plantations was 85.7%. We are encouraged by the results of this prototype study. They indicate that remote-sensing techniques can be used to distinguish different classes of coffee production systems and to differentiate coffee from natural forest.																	0143-1161						2012	33	1					220	242		10.1080/01431161.2011.591442								WOS:000298946600013						
J	Rahman, AF; Dragoni, D; El-Masri, B				Rahman, Abdullah F.; Dragoni, Danilo; El-Masri, Bassil			Response of the Sundarbans coastline to sea level rise and decreased sediment flow: A remote sensing assessment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Sundarbans is the world's largest remaining single block of mangrove forest, covering approximately 1 million ha (similar to 1,000 km(2)) of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta along the coastal areas of India and Bangladesh. Sea level rise and alteration of water flows of the Himalayan headwaters are among the major disturbances threatening these coastal areas. But very few studies exist on the dynamics or current status of the Sundarbans coastline. We used Landsat images spanning from 1973 to 2010, and an algorithm that we developed, to consistently estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of erosion and accretion for four different time intervals and the whole study period. Our results show that the direction and extent of erosion and accretion rates varied throughout the different periods. Erosion was the highest in the 1973-1979 interval, with 23.2 km(2) year(-1) of land loss. However, that rate substantially declined in the following periods, reaching a rate of 7-10 km(2) year(-1). Accretion showed a rate of 10 km(2) year(-1) between 1973 and 1989, but substantially declined to similar to 4 km(2) year(-1) between 1989 and 2010. Accretion rate has declined in the recent years but erosion rate has remained relatively high. As a result the delta front has undergone a net erosion of similar to 170 km(2) of coastal land in the 37 years of our study period. These numbers are significantly higher than the previously reported rates and magnitudes of erosion in this area. The methods and maps developed in this study may be helpful in management planning of this vulnerable coastline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Although remote sensing and aerial photographs can supply valuable information on land/use cover changes, they may not regularly be available for some tropical coasts (e.g., Cameroon estuary) where cloud cover is frequent. With respect to mangroves, researchers are now employing local knowledge as an alternative means of understanding forest disturbances. This paper was primarily aimed at assessing the mangrove forest products usage, along with the local people's perceptions on environmental changes, between Littoral (Cameroon estuary) and Southern (mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village) regions of Cameroon. Methods: The data from both locations were obtained through conducting household interviews and field observations. Results: In the Cameroon estuary (Littoral region), 69.23% of respondents (mostly elders) could distinguish two to four mangrove plants, whereas the informants (65.45%) in the mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village (mostly young people interviewed from the Southern region) are familiar with only one or two commonly found mangroves. Also, more respondents from the Cameroon estuary are depending on mangroves for fuelwood (Rhizophora spp.) and housing (Rhizophora spp., Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn and Nypa fruticans (Thumb.) Wurmb.) purposes, in contrast to Nyong River mouth and Mpalla village. Although local people perceived wood extraction as a greater disruptive factor, there are several causes for mangrove depletion in the Cameroon estuary. Among others, over-harvesting, clear-felled corridors, sand extraction and housing were found important. Furthermore, a decline in mangrove fauna composition (in terms of fishery products) was recorded in the Littoral as well as Southern regions. However, the causes of such perceived negative changes were not similar in both cases. Conclusions: Findings of this study highlight the need to improve sustainable management of the mangrove ecosystems through afforestation (in large impacted areas), selective removal of senescent tree stems and branches (in little damage stands), regulating sand extraction and housing activities, and creating awareness and law enforcement.																	1746-4269					DEC 6	2011	7								41	10.1186/1746-4269-7-41								WOS:000299276300001	22146073

In six quadrats of 25m x 25m each, distributed in all four Ranges, a total of eight tree species were recorded. A maximum number of five species occurred in relatively low saline sites. Tree zonation dynamics of the forests along salinity gradient revealed an increase in the number of Ceriops decandra (goran), a salt tolerant plant in the north-eastern parts of the SMF which was dominated by Heritiera fomes (sundri), a freshwater loving plant in 1960's. Highest importance value index (IVI) was recorded for C. decandra, which was present in all sites, except Moroghodra, a freshwater zone in Nalianala (Khulna) Range. Comparison of the Landsat images of Nalianala and Chandpai Ranges during 1989, 2000 and 2010 revealed a decreased tendency of dominance of H. fomes in the two Ranges but increased tendency of Bruguiera sexangula (kankra), Excoecaria agallocha (gewa) and Sonneratia apetala (keora). Total tree cover in 2010 decreased by about 3% from that of 1989. The changes in the tree composition have been attributed to increased salinity. The changes in the physiography and tree composition of the two Ranges between 2000 - 1989 were considerable.

J	Heumann, BW				Heumann, Benjamin W.			An Object-Based Classification of Mangroves Using a Hybrid Decision Tree-Support Vector Machine Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Mangroves provide valuable ecosystem goods and services such as carbon sequestration, habitat for terrestrial and marine fauna, and coastal hazard mitigation. The use of satellite remote sensing to map mangroves has become widespread as it can provide accurate, efficient, and repeatable assessments. Traditional remote sensing approaches have failed to accurately map fringe mangroves and true mangrove species due to relatively coarse spatial resolution and/or spectral confusion with landward vegetation. This study demonstrates the use of the new Worldview-2 sensor, Object-based image analysis (OBIA), and support vector machine (SVM) classification to overcome both of these limitations. An exploratory spectral separability showed that individual mangrove species could not be spectrally separated, but a distinction between true and associate mangrove species could be made. An OBIA classification was used that combined a decision-tree classification with the machine-learning SVM classification. Results showed an overall accuracy greater than 94% (kappa = 0.863) for classifying true mangroves species and other dense coastal vegetation at the object level. There remain serious challenges to accurately mapping fringe mangroves using remote sensing data due to spectral similarity of mangrove and associate species, lack of clear zonation between species, and mixed pixel effects, especially when vegetation is sparse or degraded.

Discrimination of coastal wetland environments in the Amazon region based on multi-polarized L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study assessed the use of multi-polarized L-band images for the identification of coastal wetland environments in the Amazon coast region of northern Brazil. Data were acquired with a SAR R99B sensor from the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM) on board a Brazilian Air Force jet. Flights took place in the framework of the 2005 MAPSAR simulation campaign, a German-Brazilian feasibility study focusing on a L-band SAR satellite. Information retrieval was based on the recognition of the interaction between a radar signal and shallow-water morphology in intertidal areas, coastal dunes, mangroves, marshes and the coastal plateau. Regarding the performance of polarizations, VV was superior for recognizing intertidal area morphology under low spring tide conditions; HH for mapping coastal environments covered with forest and scrub vegetation such as mangrove and vegetated dunes, and HV was suitable for distinguishing transition zones between mangroves and coastal plateau. The statistical results for the classification maps expressed by kappa index and general accuracy were 83.3% and 0.734 for the multi-polarized color composition (R-HH, G-HV, B-VV), 80.7% and 0.694% for HH, 79.7% and 0.673% for W, and 77.9% and 0.645% for HV amplitude image. The results indicate that use of multi-polarized L-band SAR is a valuable source of information aiming at the identification and discrimination of distinct geomorphic targets in tropical wetlands.

Such information is unavailable for Louisiana at sufficient spatial and thematic detail. We prepared mangrove forest distribution maps of Louisiana (prior to the oil spill) at 1 m and 30 m spatial resolution using aerial photographs and Landsat satellite data, respectively. Image classification was performed using a decision-tree classification approach. We also prepared land-cover change pairs for 1983, 1984, and every 2 y from 1984 to 2010 depicting "ecosystem shifts" (e.g., expansion, retraction, and disappearance). This new spatiotemporal information could be used to assess short-term and long-term impacts of the oil spill on mangroves. Finally, we propose an operational methodology based on remote sensing (Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER], hyperspectral, light detection and ranging [LIDAR], aerial photographs, and field inventory data) to monitor the existing and emerging mangrove areas and their disturbance and regrowth patterns. Several parameters such as spatial distribution, ecosystem shifts, species composition, and tree height/biomass could be measured to assess the impact of the oil spill and mangrove recovery and restoration. Future research priorities will be to quantify the impacts and recovery of mangroves considering multiple stressors and perturbations, including oil spill, winter freeze, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and land-use/land-cover change for the entire Gulf Coast.																	0749-0208					NOV	2011	27	6					1059	1064		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00028.1								WOS:000297278300005

Narendra			Assessment of aquaculture impact on mangroves of Mahanadi delta (Orissa), East coast of India using remote sensing and GIS	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food industries. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture worldwide has resulted in growing concerns about its impact on important ecosystems. The expansion of aquaculture farms in the coastal areas has led to conversion of mangroves, more rapidly. To assess the impact of aquaculture on mangroves, the present study has been undertaken in Mahanadi delta of Orissa, East coast of India which is famous for its distinctive mangrove ecosystem. It has undergone tremendous changes due to the development of aquaculture and agriculture activities during last two decades. For this, satellite data of different time periods (Landsat MSS of 1973, Landsat TM of 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III of 2006) were used. It was found that the delta was occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2006. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area was observed from 1973 to 2006 clearly depicts the augment of aquaculture industry. It is suggested that, regular monitoring of the mangroves and effective implementation of coastal management laws be strictly undertaken to prevent the further loss mangroves in Mahanadi delta.

J	Cardozo, FD; Shimabukuro, YE; Pereira, G; Silva, FB				Cardozo, Francielle da Silva; Shimabukuro, Yosio Edemir; Pereira, Gabriel; Silva, Fabricio Brito			Using Remote Sensing Products for Environmental Analysis in South America	REMOTE SENSING												Land cover plays a major role in many biogeochemical models that represent processes and connections with terrestrial systems; hence, it is a key component for public decisions in ecosystems management. The advance of remote sensing technology, combined with the emergence of new operational products, offers alternatives to improve the accuracy of environmental monitoring and analysis. This work uses the GLOBCOVER, the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF), MODIS Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) remotely sensed databases to analyze the biomass burning distribution, the land use and land cover characteristics and the percent of tree cover in South America during the years 2000 to 2005. Initially, GLOBCOVER was assessed based on VCF product, and subsequently used for quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of the South America fires with the fire radiative power (FRP). The results show that GLOBCOVER has a tendency to overestimate forest classes and to underestimate urban and mangroves areas. The fire quantification based on GLOBCOVER product shows that the highest incidence of fires can be observed in the arc of deforestation, located in the Amazon forest border, with vegetation cover composed mainly of broadleaved evergreen or semi-deciduous forest. A time series analysis of FRP database indicates that biomass burning occurs mainly in areas of broadleaved evergreen or semi-deciduous forest and in Brazilian Cerrado associated with grassland management, agricultural land clearing and with the deforestation of Amazon tropical rainforest. Also, variations in FRP intensity and spread can be attributed to rainfall anomalies, such as in 2004, when South America had a positive anomaly rainfall.

The effect of a protected area on the tradeoffs between short-run and long-run benefits from mangrove ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Protected areas are used to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, protected areas can create tradeoffs spatially and temporally among ecosystem services, which can affect the welfare of dependent local communities. This study examines the effect of a protected area on the tradeoff between two extractive ecosystem services from mangrove forests: cutting mangroves (fuelwood) and harvesting the shrimp and fish that thrive if mangroves are not cut. We demonstrate the effect in the context of Saadani National Park (SANAPA) in Tanzania, where enforcement of prohibition of mangrove harvesting was strengthened to preserve biodiversity. Remote sensing data of mangrove cover over time are integrated with georeferenced household survey data in an econometric framework to identify the causal effect of mangrove protection on income components directly linked to mangrove ecosystem services. Our findings suggest that many households experienced an immediate loss in the consumption of mangrove firewood, with the loss most prevalent in richer households. However, all wealth classes appear to benefit from long-term sustainability gains in shrimping and fishing that result from mangrove protection. On average, we find that a 10% increase in the mangrove cover within SANAPA boundaries in a 5-km(2) radius of the subvillage increases shrimping income by approximately twofold. The creation of SANAPA shifted the future trajectory of the area from one in which mangroves were experiencing uncontrolled cutting to one in which mangrove conservation is providing gains in income for the local villages as a result of the preservation of nursery habitat and biodiversity.																	0027-8424					AUG 23	2011	108	34					13945	13950		10.1073/pnas.1101825108								WOS:000294163500023	21873182

More recently, classification methods have used neighboring pixels to provide more information. In the present study, we used these more advanced techniques to discriminate between mangrove and non-mangrove regions in the Gulf of California of northwestern Mexico. A maximum likelihood algorithm was used to obtain a spectral distance map of the vegetation signature characteristic of mangrove areas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to this map to improve classification. Two classification thresholds were set to determine mangrove and non-mangrove areas, and two performance statistics (sensitivity and specificity) were calculated to express the uncertainty (errors of omission and commission) associated with the two maps. The surface area of the mangrove category obtained by maximum likelihood classification was slightly higher than that obtained from the land cover map generated by the ROC curve, but with the difference of these areas to have a high level of accuracy in the prediction of the model. This suggests a considerable degree of uncertainty in the spectral signatures of pixels that distinguish mangrove forest from other land cover categories.

Despite their importance, mangrove like other ecosystems is now being threatened by natural and human-induced processes that damage them at alarming rates, thereby diminishing the limited number of existing mangrove vegetation. The development of a spatial vulnerability assessment model that takes into consideration environmental and socioeconomic criteria, in spatial and non-spatial formats has been attempted in this study. According to the model, 11 different input parameters are required in modelling mangrove vulnerability. These parameters and their effects on mangrove vulnerability were selected and weighted by experts in the related fields. Criteria identification and selection were mainly based on effects of environmental and socioeconomic changes associated with mangrove survival. The results obtained revealed the dominance of socioeconomic criteria such as population pressure and deforestation, with high vulnerability index of 0.75. The environmental criteria was broadly dispersed in the study area and represents vulnerability indices ranging from 0.00-0.75. This category reflects the greater influence of pollutant input from oil wells and pipelines and minimal contribution from climatic factors. This project has integrated spatial management framework for mangrove vulnerability assessment that utilises information technology in conjunction with expert knowledge and multi-criteria analysis to aid planners and policy/ decision makers in the protection of this very fragile ecosystem.

Much of the mangrove and gei wai wetlands, however, have been lost because of intensified human activities in the past 30 years. Using five-phase remote-sensing images, we describe the recent history of the spatial-temporal dynamics for the wetlands in the bay. From 1986 to 2007, mangrove area increased from 1.8 to 4.8 km(2), while the area of gei wai decreased from 36.6 to 17.2 km(2). Reclamation of gei wai mainly occurred in western and northern Shenzhen Bay, and changed the tidal water environment. The bay has five typical mangrove communities: Avicennia marina + Kandelia candel + Aegiceras corniculatum, Kandelia candel + Aegiceras corniculatum + Acanthus ilicifolius, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza + Excoecaria agallocha, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Sonneratia apetala + Sonneratia caseolaris. The distribution of these communities and their dominant species in the bay exhibit a spatial pattern and temporal (successional) sequence. We describe a mangrove restoration program based on the mangrove successional sequence and the interaction of mangrove and gei wai in the bay. We have planned six mangrove protection and restoration projects in closed areas, semiclosed areas, and open areas to reconstruct the ecological integrity of the entire Shenzhen Bay.																	1860-1871					JUL	2011	7	2					241	250		10.1007/s11355-010-0126-z								WOS:000292218100010

They provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services contributing to coastal erosion protection, water filtration, provision of areas for fish and shrimp breeding, provision of building material and medicinal ingredients, and the attraction of tourists, amongst many other factors. At the same time, mangroves belong to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline during the last half century. International programs, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands or the Kyoto Protocol, underscore the importance of immediate protection measures and conservation activities to prevent the further loss of mangroves. In this context, remote sensing is the tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem distribution, species differentiation, health status, and ongoing changes of mangrove populations. Such studies can be based on various sensors, ranging from aerial photography to high- and medium-resolution optical imagery and from hyperspectral data to active microwave (SAR) data. Remote-sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and changes during the last two decades, which is reflected by the large number of scientific papers published on this topic. To our knowledge, a recent review paper on the remote sensing of mangroves does not exist, although mangrove ecosystems have become the focus of attention in the context of current climate change and discussions of the services provided by these ecosystems. Also, climate change-related remote-sensing studies in coastal zones have increased drastically in recent years. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and sound summary of all of the work undertaken, addressing the variety of remotely sensed data applied for mangrove ecosystem mapping, as well as the numerous methods and techniques used for data analyses, and to further discuss their potential and limitations.																	2072-4292					MAY	2011	3	5					878	928		10.3390/rs3050878								WOS:000306749500004

Mesquite encroachment impact on southern New Mexico rangelands: remote sensing and geographic information systems approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) invasion can negatively impact grazing capacity, spatial livestock distribution, and forage production in Chihuahuan Desert rangelands. High spatial resolution remote sensing data can be used to develop maps of shrub encroachment for arid rangelands. The objective of this study was to map changes in honey mesquite abundance and to evaluate honey mesquite impacts on perennial grass production at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center in south-central New Mexico using high resolution satellite imagery. The project employed QuickBird ortho-ready satellite imagery with spatial resolution of 2.4 m in multispectral bands and panchromatic resolution of 0.6 m for the study area on May 19, 2009. We used a maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm to distinguish honey mesquite from other land cover categories. We then measured grass production (kg/ha) in May, 2009 on 10 permanent, evenly spaced key areas in each pasture. We identified 12x60 m plots from the classified map and used these to calculate honey mesquite canopy cover on the 40 transects across the study area. Areas classified as dominated by honey mesquite estimated from image analyses encompassed 143, 50, 92, and 136 hectares in pastures 1, 4, 14, and 15, respectively. Regression analyses showed that increasing levels of honey mesquite canopy cover corresponded to lower perennial grass forage production (r(2) = 0.73, n = 40). Our findings indicate that classification of high-resolution satellite imagery is a very useful tool for mapping invasive shrubs and determining their influence on forage production in desert landscapes.

We employed a hybrid supervised and unsupervised image classification technique on a total of 128 Landsat scenes gathered between 1999 and 2004, and validated the results using existing geographic information science (GIS) datasets, high resolution imagery, and published literature. We also draw a comparative analysis with the mangrove forests inventory published by the Food and Agriculture Association (FAO) of the United Nations. Our estimate shows a total of 623755 hectares of mangrove forests in the Pacific region; an increase of 18% from FAO's estimates. Although mangrove forests are disproportionately distributed toward a few larger islands on the western Pacific, they are also significant in many smaller islands.

Study on the utility of IRS 1D LISS-III data and the classification techniques for mapping of Sunderban mangroves	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangrove conservation and management is a stupendous task chiefly due to the inaccessibility and the hostile substrate conditions. Remote sensing technology serves as an important tool in providing fast, accurate and up-to-date baseline information on the status of mangroves. It is almost impossible to carry out conventional field surveys in these swampy areas. The present study aims at the classification and mapping of the mangroves in Sunderban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in the West Bengal province of India using IRS 1D LISS-III satellite data. Different classification approaches, viz., on-screen visual interpretation, supervised and unsupervised classifications were tried. The study showed that four mangroves classes, viz., Avicennia, Phoenix, mixed mangroves, and mangrove scrub and eight non-mangrove classes could be delineated using all the three approaches. All the mangrove and non-mangrove classes were field verified and the overall accuracy as well as user's and producer's accuracies for each category were determined. It was observed that among the three approaches, on-screen visual interpretation yielded higher classification accuracy (91.67%) compared to supervised (79.90%) and unsupervised classifications (71.08%). The results obtained through on-screen visual interpretation showed that all mangrove categories together cover 23.21% of the total geographical area of SBR, of which the mixed mangrove category covers maximum area (18.31%). Among the non-mangrove classes, the waterbody occupies largest area (35.36%) followed by agriculture (34.51%).

Holistic Approach to Mitigate the Pollution Impacts in the Coastal Ecosystem of Thailand Using the Remote Sensing Techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												A study of substantial anthropogenic related pollution in the Coastal Samut Prakam Province (Thailand) was carried out focusing on the Bang Pu Nature Reserve (remnant mangrove wetland) using a remote sensing (geospatial) technique. Statistical regression models were developed between biochemical parameters of sample point and related reflectance data obtained from satellite imagery (Landsat TM). Change detection showed a significant increase in various water bodies over a period of a decade and significant increase in analyzed pollutant levels. The paper highlights the advantages of baseline data obtained and its significance towards a holistic approach to mitigating coastal pollution combining sustainable conservation and enhanced nature education through a significant ecosystem bio-diversification. Within the framework of the approach a buffering zone based on a constructed freshwater-fed wetland is to be introduced to serve as an effective pollution mitigating area serving the local community which is in serious need of such an environmental vehicle.																	1735-6865					SPR	2011	5	2					297	306										WOS:000288692100005

Use of Multi-Sensor Data to Identify and Map Tropical Coastal Wetlands in the Amazon of Northern Brazil	WETLANDS												Recognizing and mapping wetlands in the Amazon coastal from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is critical to understand coastal evolution. Multispectral optical images are obtained only during the dry season, while SAR images can be acquired throughout the year, but present low spectral resolution. The aim of this paper was to investigate the use of remote sensing images, which allowed the accurate identification and mapping of coastal environments based on the complementary information provided by the synergism of multisensory data and supervised classifications with statistical validation from the overall accuracy and Kappa index. The mapping of these environments was based on the supervised classification of Landsat ETM+ images and ETM+-SAR product, which permitted the identification of eight classes: coastal plateau, mangroves, floodplain + freshwater marshes, tidal sandflats + sandbars + ebb-tidal delta, macrotidal beaches, water, frontal dunes + paleodunes + interdunes + mobile dunes, and salt marshes. Overall accuracy and Kappa indices for the classification maps of the wetland study area were 93.3% and 0.909 for Landsat ETM+ and 93.8% and 0.917 for the ETM+-SAR product. This indicates that the integrated product provides additional information, which permits the more efficient identification and mapping of tropical coastal wetlands.

J	Heumann, BW				Heumann, Benjamin W.			Satellite remote sensing of mangrove forests: Recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves are salt tolerant woody plants that form highly productive intertidal ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, including fisheries, deforestation continues to be a major threat due to pressures for wood and forest products, land conversion to aquaculture, and coastal urban development. Over the past 15 years, remote sensing has played a crucial role in mapping and understanding changes in the areal extent and spatial pattern of mangrove forests related to natural disasters and anthropogenic forces. This paper reviews recent advancements in remote-sensed data and techniques and describes future opportunities for integration or fusion of these data and techniques for large-scale monitoring in mangroves as a consequence of anthropogenic and climatic forces. While traditional pixel-based classification of Landsat, SPOT, and ASTER imagery has been widely applied for mapping mangrove forest, more recent types of imagery such as very high resolution (VHR), Polarmetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR), hyperspectral, and LiDAR systems and the development of techniques such as Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA), spatial image analysis (e.g. image texture), Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR), and machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated the potential for reliable and detailed characterization of mangrove forests including species, leaf area, canopy height, and stand biomass. Future opportunities include the application of existing sensors such as the hyperspectral HYPERION, the application of existing methods from terrestrial forest remote sensing, investigation of new sensors such as ALOS PRISM and PALSAR, and overcoming challenges to the global monitoring of mangrove forests such as wide-scale data availability, robust and consistent methods, and capacity-building with scientists and organizations in developing countries.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2011	35	1					87	108		10.1177/0309133310385371								WOS:000287779900005

Remote Sensing for Mapping RAMSAR Heritage Site at Sungai Pulai Mangrove Forest Reserve, Johor, Malaysia	SAINS MALAYSIANA												The Sungai Pulai Mangrove Forest Reserve (SPMFR) is the largest riverine mangrove system in Johore. In 2003 about 9,126 ha of the Sungai Pulai mangrove was designated as a RAMSAR site. RAMSAR sites are wetland areas that are deemed to have international importance and are included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance. The,SPMFR plays a significant socio-economic role to the adjacent 38 villages. Satellite remote sensing is a useful source of information where it provides timely and complete coverage for vegetation mapping especially in mangroves where the accessibility is difficult. This study was carried out to identify and map land cover types using SPOT-4 imagery at the Sungai Pulai-RAMSAR site and its surrounding areas. Through unsupervised classification technique a total of seven classes of land cover type were mapped, where about 90% mapping accuracy was gained from the accuracy assessment. Later, vegetation densities were classified into five levels namely very high, high, medium, low and very low based on crown density scale using vegetation indices model such as NDVI, AVI and OSAVI. Results from NDVI and OSAVI model were almost similar but AVI model detected more on medium vegetation which did not show the real ground condition. The study concludes that SPOT-4 imagery was able to discriminate mangrove area clearly from other land covers type. Vegetation indices model can be used as a tool for mapping vegetation density level in the SPMFR and its surrounding area. Therefore VI's models from remote sensing are useful to monitor and manage the mangrove forest for sustainable management and preserve the SPMFR as a RAMSAR site in Peninsular Malaysia.																	0126-6039					FEB	2011	40	2					83	88										WOS:000287821400001

Mangrove reforestation as a mesotidial coastal protection and clean develepment mechanism on Macau-Serra oil field, Potiguar Basin, Northeast Brazil. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1268 - 1271. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Mangrove ecosystem changes are commonly mentioned among a variety of coastal effects caused by climate change and human intervention. On the Rio Grande do Norte northern coast of Brazil intense sediment transport, is controlled by a high dynamic energy factors. This causes widespread erosion and shoreline morphological instability. Through the observation of wetland natural deposits, it was possible to make a physicochemical characterization which indicated over an area of approximately 0.89 km(2) appropriated to reforestation with local mangrove. To assess the amount of atmospheric carbon sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem, following the principles of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an inventory was conducted based on geoprocessing and ground accuracy techniques, especially regarding the structural characterization of the mangrove areas. With this approach a mangrove planting project is planned to stabilize a tidal channel northwest of Ponta do Tubarao Island. This is expected to reduce the energy of the channel which is responsible for the currently intense erosion and migration of the channel over the oil field infrastructure. Remote sensing, GIS and DGPS were used to compare the current and past mangrove cover, allowing plausible projections for the future impacts and changes in that region. Currently 7.1% of the mangrove forests of the studied area is dead or suffering ongoing breakdown.																	0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1268	1271										WOS:000302825000048

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1336 - 1339. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Environmental maps showing marine ecosystems are very useful for providing baseline information for coastal management. The cartographic information of this kind of thematic map should explore the real scenario to understand the ecosystems. In this particularly case of Brazil, with continental extension there is a potential for impacts from activities developed near the shoreline, among which as an example are those related to the oil industry. The cartographic documents can be used for environmental analyses and management and should contain relevant information about coastal zones. Two methods are applied for the production of the cartographic documents. The first one used traditional methods of interpretation, manual vectorization, generalization and edition. And the second used a supervised classification technique to obtain information of the pre-selected classes like hydrograph, vegetation, mangrove, main roads, and urban zones. In this regard high resolution images are important for update and get more detail information of an estuary. The materials used for experimental tests were high resolution satellite images with spatial resolution of 0.60m. This contribution makes the assessment of both techniques showing the maps and a list of advantages and disadvantages. The results of the study provide users the option to visualize a classified image that contains more detailed information than the traditional maps and also the results are important in a case of environmental management.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 344 - 348. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208. The current paper examines the growth and spatio-temporal variation of mangrove forests in response to depositional processes and different salinity conditions. Data from mangrove vegetation structure collected at permanent plots and satellite images were used. In the northern sector important environmental changes occurred due to an artificial channel producing modifications in salinity. The southern sector is considered the best conserved mangrove area along the coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Landsat TM5 images from 1997 and 2010 were processed using Geographical Information Systems. Supervised classifications complemented by visual interpretations and ground truth were used to map mangrove areas in both periods. In each permanent plot, all plants were identified and tree diameter, height, and incidence of associated species were recorded. Mean height, basal area dominance, and stem density were also assessed. In the southern sector of the study area, digital image analysis revealed shoreline progradation and mangrove establishment. These sites have demonstrated both vegetation growth and extension. In the northern sector, the satellite image analysis revealed an increase of depositional areas. An important number of associated freshwater plants were observed, inhibiting the establishment of mangrove seedlings or growth of saplings. Despite the high sedimentation rate, which enables mangrove colonization, the low salinity exerts indirect negative influence on mangrove development, considering that it creates good conditions to macrophytes reproduction. Coastal planning requires that the spatial differences be recognized as unique sub-systems due to the hydrodynamic complexity. Both on-the-ground monitoring of the vegetation structure and space-borne remote sensing are important tools to support coastal zone management.

Due to complexities in water clarity and attenuation of spectral reflection with water depth, this study focused on visual interpretation of IKONOS satellite images in an effort to ascertain the general nature of bottom types. Development of a seafloor topology for a portion of the Key West National Wildlife Refuge in Monroe County, Florida (between Key West, Florida, and the Dry Tortugas) resulted in 96 mapping units. The natural complexity of this environment required classification units that were defined by numeric codes that were keyed to a classification system developed for this area. These units, defined in a stepwise procedure, were predicated on the geomorphologic base, context of the geomorphological zone, biological cover, and percentage of that cover. The GIS attribute table, built with a multi-discipline interpretation in mind, was constructed to allow end user flexibility when extracting the information related to major biological cover, detailed geological cover, etc. Suffixes were added to further interpret areas with diverse biological cover. The IKONOS satellite images were found to be useful tools for mapping coastal marine environments at a nominal scale of 1:6000.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		731	735										WOS:000302824900149

Geoinformatics in mangrove monitoring: damage and recovery after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Phang Nga, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, it has been proven that mangrove ecosystems provide protection against coastal disasters by acting as bioshields. Satellite data have been effectively used to detect, assess, and monitor the changes in mangroves during the pre- and post-tsunami periods. However, not much information regarding mangrove restoration or reforestation is available. Rather than undertaking time-consuming fieldwork, this study proposed using geoinformatic technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) to monitor the mangrove recovery. The analysis focused only on the tsunami-impacted mangrove areas along the western coast of the Tai Muang, Takuapa and Khuraburi Districts of Phang Nga Province, southern region of Thailand. The results consisted of 2 parts, first: the supervised classification of main land uses, namely forest, mangrove, agricultural land, built-up area, bare soil, water body, and miscellaneous covers in ASTER images, was conducted using the maximum likelihood method with higher than 75% for overall accuracy. Once the confusion between classes was improved in post-processing, the accuracy of mangrove class was greater than 85% for all dates. The results showed that the mangrove area in 2005 was reduced by approximately 5% (1054.5 ha) from 2003 due to the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Although the recovery program (replacing the same species of dead mangrove trees, mainly the Rhizophora apiculata Bl and Rhizophora mucronata Poir, in situ) had started by mid-2005, the areas gradually decreased to approximately 7-8% in 2006 and 2010 compared with the reference year of 2003. Second, the recovery trend was observed in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) fluctuation curve and the supporting field survey data. The recovery patterns were summarized into 2 categories: (i) gradually recovery, and (ii) fluctuating recovery. The gradually recovery category that implied the homogeneous pattern or uniform reforestation was observed in the seriously damaged area where most of the mangrove trees were swept away during the tsunami. This pattern covered approximately 50.35% of the total reforested area. The NDVI time series of the uniform or homogeneous reforested mangrove at the sampled plots has gradually increased after 2005. The fluctuating recovery category that implied the heterogeneous pattern or non-uniform reforestation was observed in partially damaged areas where some of the mangrove trees were swept away and broken but still some trees were remained in the area. The heterogeneous patterns covered approximately 49.65% of the total reforested area.

Hyperspectral remote sensing of salinity stress on red (Rhizophora mangle) and white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves on Galapagos Islands	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Mangroves are an assemblage of salt-tolerant woody hydrophytes that are the foundational species along tropical and subtropical coastlines, estuaries, lagoons and rivers. Once covering 75% of the world's tropical and subtropical coastlines, mangrove forests have been declining rapidly throughout the world in the last few decades. Monitoring and modelling mangrove forest growth are critical for their conservation. Salinity is one of the primary limiting factors for mangrove forest growth. In this letter, we report the potential of using hyperspectral remotely sensed data collected in the field for monitoring the photosynthesis rate of red (Rhizophora mangle) and white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves with regard to salinity gradient. Using photochemical reflectance index (PRI) as proxy for photosynthetic rate, PRI for both species are strongly related to salinity gradient, indicating the potential of monitoring mangrove forest growth on a regional scale using hyperspectral remote sensing.

Monitoring brackishwater aquaculture development using multi-spectral satellite data and GIS - a case study near Pichavaram mangroves south-east coast of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Satellite data of Landsat TM, IRS 1B LISS II, IRS 1C LISS III and IRS 1D LISS III were used to monitor aquaculture development and its spatial distribution in Cuddalore District, south-east coast of India. Analysis of satellite images using image processing software ERDAS Imagine 9.0 and Geographic Information System (GIS) software Arc GIS 9.0 indicated that the area under aquaculture was 6.91 ha in 1987, gradually increasing to 67.71 ha in 1994, and reaching a maximum of 380.19 ha in 1998. There was a little shrimp culture development (6.14 ha) from 1998 to 2005 because of risk of White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), epizootics and constraints related to social and environmental concerns raised against shrimp farming. Shrimp farms initially started in the marsh areas close to creeks and then moved inland towards agricultural and fallow lands. Farms developed in clusters along the creeks without affecting mangrove reserve forests between 1988 and 2005 and about 177.02 ha agriculture land including 234.25 ha fallow lands were converted for aquaculture farming. Shrimp culture was abandoned in 109.47 ha and 15.13 ha of agricultural land previously converted to aquaculture farms, was reconverted for agriculture. The present study shows that remote sensing data and GIS are useful tools in assessing and monitoring the development of aquaculture for larger areas and suggests that national level planning using multi-spectral satellite data can be used to assess the existing land use and the potential for sustainable use of coastal resources.																	0970-6011					JAN-MAR	2011	58	1					85	90										WOS:000290290100014

Out of 1471 ha of total reserved forest area, mangroves occupy 906 ha. The remote sensing maps show that there was a loss of 471 ha from 1970 to 1991 and a gain of 531 ha in 2011. Nearby 20 hamlets depend on mangroves for their livelihood. A village survey conducted at Pichavaram shows that more than 90% of the local community is well aware of the prevailing species, their importance especially after the 2004 tsunami and the impact of management practices, increased rainfall and contribution of local community in the recent increased area of mangroves. The same can be noticed from the high-resolution IKONOS image showing the artificial canal network in the restored region and from rainfall records.																	1010-6049						2011	26	6					475	490		10.1080/10106049.2011.591943								WOS:000208631700005

Status and distribution of mangrove forests of the world using earth observation satellite data	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Our scientific understanding of the extent and distribution of mangrove forests of the world is inadequate. The available global mangrove databases, compiled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved. Here, we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive. Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth-sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance. Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map 'true mangroves'. Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75% of world's mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9% are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generally confined to the tropical and subtropical regions and the largest percentage of mangroves is found between 5 degrees N and 5 degrees S latitude. Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3% smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created.

Production of global land cover data - GLCNMO	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												Global land cover is one of the fundamental contents of Digital Earth. The Global Mapping project coordinated by the International Steering Committee for Global Mapping has produced a 1-km global land cover dataset - Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations. It has 20 land cover classes defined using the Land Cover Classification System. Of them, 14 classes were derived using supervised classification. The remaining six were classified independently: urban, tree open, mangrove, wetland, snow/ice, and water. Primary source data of this land cover mapping were eight periods of 16-day composite 7-band 1-km MODIS data of 2003. Training data for supervised classification were collected using Landsat images, MODIS NDVI seasonal change patterns, Google Earth, Virtual Earth, existing regional maps, and expert's comments. The overall accuracy is 76.5% and the overall accuracy with the weight of the mapped area coverage is 81.2%. The data are available from the Global Mapping project website (http://www.iscgm.org/). The MODIS data used, land cover training data, and a list of existing regional maps are also available from the CEReS website. This mapping attempt demonstrates that training/validation data accumulation from different mapping projects must be promoted to support future global land cover mapping.																	1753-8947						2011	4	1					22	49	PII 922128429	10.1080/17538941003777521								WOS:000285198200003

The present study was conducted to assess the mangrove vegetation at Tumpat based on ground-truth and remote sensing measurements. The mangroves are composed of several species including Nypa fruticans, Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia alba, Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, in order of dominance. The point-centred quarter method (PCQM) was used to estimate the stem density (number of stems/0.1 ha) and basal area (m(2)/0.1 ha) at selected sites on the ground. Recent high-resolution multispectral satellite data (QuickBird 2006, 2.4 m spatial resolution of the multispectral image) were used to produce land-use/cover classification and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) mapping for the delta. The area statistics reveal that mangroves occupy 339.6 ha, while coconut plantation dominates the vegetation (715.2 ha), followed by settlements (621.6 ha), sandbar (148.4 ha), agriculture (89 ha) and aquaculture (42.7 ha). Although the relationship between the spectral indices and dendrometric parameters was weak, we found a very high significance between the (mean) NDVI and stem density (p - 1.3 x 10(-8)). The sites with young/growing and also mature trees with lush green cover showed greater NDVI values (0.40-0.68) indicating healthy vegetation, while mature forests under environmental stress due to sand deposition and/or poor tidal inundation showed low NDVI values (0.38-0.47) and an unhealthy situation. Overall, a combination of ground survey and remote sensing provided valuable information for the assessment of mangrove vegetation types (i.e. young/growing or mature forest) and their health in Tumpat, Kelantan Delta.

This study focuses on testing the predictions made 10 yr ago concerning the evolution of a mangrove forest in Galle-Unawatuna, Sri Lanka. The very high resolution (VHR) ground inventory revealed that the adult mangrove species composition is dominated by Rhizophora apiculata, Excoecaria agallocha, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula, with a total density of 216 to 267 stems 0.1 ha(-1) and a basal area of 1.19 to 1.44 m(2) 0.1 ha(-1). However, both young and juvenile vegetation in most sectors were dominated solely by B. gymnorrhiza (128 to 869 stems and 356 to 1482 propagules 0.1 ha(-1)). The recent decadal changes between 1994 and 2004 observed through IKONOS imagery and ground truthing confirmed many of the predictions and showed dynamic shifts in young/adult vegetation of B. gymnorrhiza. Although dominance of R. apiculata and E. agallocha has been seen to alternate over decades (1956 to 2004), the emerging growth of B. gymnorrhiza might cause yet another transition of this mangrove area into a Bruguiera-dominated forest in the near future, resulting in the conclusion that the 'moving mosaic' pattern of mangrove species distribution at Galle-Unawatuna still persists. We maintain that this mangrove forest is probably one of the most dynamic in the world in terms of species turnover. To our knowledge, the present study represents one of the few long-term field-based monitoring research projects on mangroves using VHR remote sensing and VHR fieldwork at decadal intervals, and is probably the only study testing forest development predictions made in the past.

Regina N.; Kurokura, Hisashi			Practical techniques for mapping small patches of mangroves	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Practical mapping methods employing GPS field surveys and manual image analyses with affordable software were used to assess two mangrove sites in Aklan Province, NE Panay Island, central Philippines. The Jawili mangroves, absent from current maps, actually included 21.5 ha with 24 true mangrove species. On the other hand, the Batan Estuary mangroves, shown to be 4244 ha in available topographic maps, revealed only 406 ha of scattered patches. Actual mangrove data on specific areas worldwide is limited, especially in the Philippines where available maps show discrepancies from actual mangrove distribution. Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide promising results but require expensive setup, particularly for small areas. Therefore, financially limited users need affordable and rapid mapping alternatives. The practical techniques presented here can be immediately implemented at minimal cost and can produce useful estimates of actual mangrove area, fundamental for coastal management. Basic principles used here also have potential applications in other systems and locations. When resources are available though, additional confirmation and precise mapping are also further recommended.

The IBC is an area prone to oil spills resulting from the processes of transportation, storage, and tank cleaning. The present study aimed to map the different physical environments adjacent to this complex and the socioeconomic profile of the local population that would be most vulnerable to this type of disaster. Vulnerability studies are essential as one of the first step in the development of an integrated coastal zone management. The variables analyzed in this study included geomorphological units, and the income, education, and dependence on fishing of the local population. The estimate of the vulnerability index was based on the relationships between these variables, which were used to generate a vulnerability map using GIS and the interpretation of high-resolution remote sensing, showing the areas of highest priority for intervention in the case of oil spills. The analysis of the natural and socioeconomic environments indicated that the areas of highest vulnerability correspond to the mangroves and the Vila Nova and Alto da Esperanca neighborhoods, respectively. These neighborhoods have a direct relationship with fishing, and low levels of both income and education. By contrast, the lowest vulnerability was attributed to the coastal plateau and the central Anjo da Guarda neighborhood, which is occupied by residents with relatively high income and education, who do not depend on fishing.

J	Ravindranath, NH; Murthy, IK				Ravindranath, N. H.; Murthy, I. K.			Greening India Mission	CURRENT SCIENCE												The Government of India has announced the Greening India Mission (GIM) under the National Climate Change Action Plan. The Mission aims to restore and afforest about 10 mha over the period 2010-2020 under different sub-missions covering moderately dense and open forests, scrub/grasslands, mangroves, wetlands, croplands and urban areas. Even though the main focus of the Mission is to address mitigation and adaptation aspects in the context of climate change, the adaptation component is inadequately addressed. There is a need for increased scientific input in the preparation of the Mission. The mitigation potential is estimated by simply multiplying global default biomass growth rate values and area. It is incomplete as it does not include all the carbon pools, phasing, differing growth rates, etc. The mitigation potential estimated using the Comprehensive Mitigation Analysis Process model for the GIM for the year 2020 has the potential to offset 6.4% of the projected national greenhouse gas emissions, compared to the GIM estimate of only 1.5%, excluding any emissions due to harvesting or disturbances. The selection of potential locations for different interventions and species choice under the GIM must be based on the use of modelling, remote sensing and field studies. The forest sector provides an opportunity to promote mitigation and adaptation synergy, which is not adequately addressed in the GIM. Since many of the interventions proposed are innovative and limited scientific knowledge exists, there is need for an unprecedented level of collaboration between the research institutions and the implementing agencies such as the Forest Departments, which is currently non-existent. The GIM could propel systematic research into forestry and climate change issues and thereby provide global leadership in this new and emerging science.																	0011-3891					AUG 25	2010	99	4					444	449										WOS:000281638200021						
J	Castro, DF; Rossetti, DD; Pessenda, LCR				Castro, Darcilea Ferreira; Rossetti, Dilce de Fatima; Ruiz Pessenda, Luiz Carlos			Facies, delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N analyses in a late Quaternary compound estuarine fill, northern Brazil and relation to sea level	MARINE GEOLOGY												The present work integrates sedimentary facies, C-14 dating, delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N with geologic and geomorphologic data available from literature. The aim was to characterize the depositional settings of a late Quaternary estuary in northeastern Marajo Island and analyze its evolution within the context of relative sea level fluctuations. The data derive from four continuous cores along a proximal-to-distal transect of a paleoestuary, previously recognized using remote sensing information. Fifteen sediment samples recorded ages ranging from 42,580 +/- 1430 to 3184 +/- 37 C-14 yr B.P. Fades analysis indicated fine- to coarse-grained sands with parallel lamination or cross stratification, massive or laminated muds and heterolithic deposits. delta C-13 (-28.1 parts per thousand to -19.7 parts per thousand, mean = -23.0 parts per thousand), delta N-15 (+ 14.8 parts per thousand to + 4.7 parts per thousand, mean = + 9.2 parts per thousand) and C/N (14.5 to 1.5, mean = 7.9) indicate mostly marine and freshwater phytoplankton sources for the organic matter. The results confirm a large late Quaternary paleoestuary in northeastern Marajo Island. The distribution of delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N, together with fades associations, led to identify depositional settings related to fluvial channel, floodplain, tidal channel/tidal flat, central basin, tidal delta, and tidal inlet/sand barrier. These deposits are consistent with a wave-dominated estuary. Variations in stratigraphy and geochemistry are controlled by changes in relative sea level, revealing a main transgression from an undetermined time around 42,000 C-14 yr B.P. and 29,340 (+/- 200) C-14 yr B.P., which is synchronous to the overall drop in sea level after the last interglacial. Following this period, and probably until 9110 +/- 37 C-14 yr B.P., i.e., during a time interval encompassing two glacial episodes including the Last Glacial and the Younger Dryas, there was a pronounced drop in sea level, recorded by the development of a major erosional discontinuity due to valley re-incision. Sea level rose again until 5464 +/- 40 C-14 yr B.P, just before the main worldwide mid-Holocene transgressive peak. Mid to late Holocene coastal progradation ended the Marajo paleoestuarine history, and promoted the establishment of continental conditions throughout the island. The divergence comparing the Marajo sea level behavior with the eustatic curve allows hypothesizing that post-rifting tectonics along the Brazilian Equatorial margin influenced the sedimentary evolution of the studied paleoestuary. Considering that sedimentary facies in estuarine settings are highly variable both laterally and vertically, the present integration of facies with isotope and elemental analyses was crucial to provide a more precise interpretation of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene Marajo paleoestuary, and analyze its sea level history within the eustatic and tectonic context.

J	Ruiz-Luna, A; Escobar, AC; Berlanga-Robles, C				Ruiz-Luna, Arturo; Cervantes Escobar, Aimee; Berlanga-Robles, Cesar			Assessing Distribution Patterns, Extent, and Current Condition of Northwest Mexico Mangroves	WETLANDS												This study contributes to the worldwide effort to update the status of mangroves, assessing a large mangrove distribution area in Mexico by analyzing Landsat MSS from the early 1970s and TM imagery from 2005. Four states (Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Nayarit) integrate the northwest region of Mexico, where the mangrove area was estimated to be around 180,000 ha on both dates, with a reduction of about 2% by 2005. Nayarit by itself had a large decrease (> 10,000 ha), while the other states increased their mangrove extent from 4 to 15%. However, this increase was probably a consequence of improved satellite capabilities in 2005 rather than mangrove expansion. Mangrove condition, measured through a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was categorized into four types based in the index value distributions. Type 1, representing the poorest condition, included values below the first quartile (Q(1)), while Type 4, the best condition, was indicated by values above Q(3). One of the intermediate categories (Type 3) was dominant, accounting for > 40% of the total mangrove surface in both the 1970s and 2005. Mangrove systems in northwest Mexico have different conditions of stress, and thus different management strategies should be identified to preserve and maintain those systems.

Specifically, the mangroves of the estuarine islands of Mabala and Y,litono were classified using satellite and airborne optical remote sensing data. Mangroves were mapped according to four classes: tall red (Rhizophora racemosa), medium red (R. racemosa), dwarf red (R. mangle and R. harisonii), and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). Producer's and user's accuracies for the mapping of mangrove from non-mangrove areas were both 98%. When separating amongst the mangrove classes most of the confusion resulted from the medium red mangrove class. Of the 10,442 ha of mangrove mapped, approximately 30% were classified as riverine, dominated by tall R. racemosa. The remaining mangrove areas were dominated by dwarf mangrove of either Rhizophora or A. germinans. Biophysical parameter data collected from 56 transects varied considerably amongst the classes. For the tallest mangrove class, the mean values of height, DBH, estimated LAI, stem density and basal area recorded were 13 m, 15.1 cm, 4.3, 838 stems/ha, and 25.9 m(2)/ha, respectively. In contrast, for A. germinans, values of 3 m, 4.6 cm, 1.5, 2,877 stems/ha, and 6.0 m(2)/ha were calculated, respectively.

J	Knudby, A; LeDrew, E; Brenning, A				Knudby, Anders; LeDrew, Ellsworth; Brenning, Alexander			Predictive mapping of reef fish species richness, diversity and biomass in Zanzibar using IKONOS imagery and machine-learning techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During the last three decades, the large spatial coverage of remote sensing data has been used in coral reef research to map dominant substrate types, geomorphologic zones, and bathymetry. During the same period, field studies have documented statistical relationships between variables quantifying aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Although the results of these studies are ambiguous, some habitat variables have frequently been found to correlate with one or more aspects of the fish community. Several of these habitat variables, including depth, the structural complexity of the substrate, and live coral cover, are possible to estimate with remote sensing data. In this study, we combine a set of statistical and machine-learning models with habitat variables derived from IKONOS data to produce spatially explicit predictions of the species richness, biomass, and diversity of the fish community around two reefs in Zanzibar. In the process, we assess the ability of IKONOS imagery to estimate live coral cover, structural complexity and habitat diversity, and we explore the importance of habitat variables, at a range of spatial scales, in the predictive models using a permutation-based technique. Our findings indicate that structural complexity at a fine spatial scale (similar to 5 to 10 m) is the most important habitat variable in predictive models of fish species richness and diversity, whereas other variables such as depth, habitat diversity, and structural complexity at coarser spatial scales contribute to predictions of biomass. In addition, our results demonstrate that complex model types such as tree-based ensemble techniques provide superior predictive performance compared to the more frequently used linear models, achieving a reduction of the cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error of 3-11%. Although aerial photographs and airborne lidar instruments have recently been used to produce spatially explicit predictions of reef fish community variables, our study illustrates the possibility of doing so with satellite data. The ability to use satellite data may bring the cost of creating such maps within the reach of both spatial ecology researchers and the wide range of organizations involved in marine spatial planning.

Since the seventies, part of the main infrastructure for country's oil extraction is located in this area. Its high biodiversity has motivated different type of studies including deforestation processes and land use planning. In this work we used satellite image analysis to determine land cover changes in the area from 1974 to 2001. Our results indicate that tropical forest and mangroves presented the most extensive losses in its coverage. In contrast, urban areas and induced grassland increased considerably. In 2001 more than half of the ecosystem area showed changes from its original land cover, and a third part of it was deteriorated. The main causes of deforestation were both the increase in grassland and the growth of urban areas. However, deforestation was attenuated by natural reforestation and plant canopy recovery. We conclude that the introduction of cattle and urban development were the main causes for the land cover changes; however, the oil industry activity located in the ecosystem, has promoted indirectly to urban growth and rancher boom.

The present study was conducted using remote sensing methods and a geographical information system with the aim of quantifying the participation of this activity in the reduction of the mangrove areas along the northern coast of the State of Pernambuco (northeast, Brazil), where shrimp farming has been implanted in last recent years. From 1973 to 2005, there was reduction of about 2.052 ha of mangrove, 197 ha of which were converted into shrimp ponds. Thus, the real contribution of shrimp farming to this reduction was just 9.6% of the total area. Other anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture, urban expansion and tourism, contributed greatly to the reduction in the mangrove areas along the northern coast of the State of Pernambuco.

Coastal Vulnerability Assessment for Orissa State, East Coast of India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal areas of Orissa State in the northeastern part of the Indian peninsula are potentially vulnerable to accelerated erosion hazard Along the 480-km coastline, most of the coastal areas, including tourist resorts, hotels, fishing villages, and towns, are already threatened by recurring storm flood events and severe coastal erosion The coastal habitats, namely the largest rookeries in the world for olive Ridley sea turtles (the extensive sandy beaches of Gahirmatha and Rushikulya), Asia's largest brackish water lagoon (the "Chihka"), extensive mangrove cover of Bhitarkanika (the wildlife sanctuary), the estuarine systems, and deltaic plains are no exception The present study therefore is an attempt to develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the maritime state of Orissa using eight relative risk variables Most of these parameters are dynamic in nature and require a large amount of data from different sources In some cases, the base data is from remote sensing satellites, for others It is either from long-term in situ measurements or from numerical models Zones of vulnerability to coastal natural hazards of different magnitude (high, medium, and low) are identified and shown on a map In earlier studies, tidal range was assumed to include both permanent and episodic inundation hazards However, the mean of the long-term tidal records tends to dampen the effect of episodic inundation hazards such as tsunamis For this reason, in the present study, tsunami run-up has been considered as an additional physical process parameter to calculate the CVI Coastal regional elevation has also been considered as an additional important variable This is the first such study that has been undertaken for a part of the Indian coastline The map prepared for the Orissa coast under this study can be used by the state and district administration involved in the disaster mitigation and management plan																	0749-0208					MAY	2010	26	3					523	534		10.2112/09-1186.1								WOS:000277947000014

Christopher; Lee, Rosalynn; Vahatalo, Anssi; Zepp, Richard G.; Bartels, Erich			Production of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from mangrove leaf litter and floating Sargassum colonies	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) strongly absorbs solar radiation in the blue-green and serves as the primary attenuator of water column ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). CDOM interferes with remote sensing of ocean chlorophyll and can control UV-R-induced damage to light-sensitive organisms including corals. We used laboratory incubations to evaluate CDOM production from senescing Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) leaf litter (yellow, orange, and brown) and floating Sargassum colonies. Mangroves exist at the land-ocean interface near coral reefs in sub-tropical and tropical regions while floating Sargassum colonies tend to congregate in sub-tropical ocean gyres. CDOM production (similar to 48 h) from mangrove leaves collected during a dry period in June 2004 (0.17 +/- 0.11 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) was lower than production from leaves collected during a wet period in September 2003 (0.57 +/- 0.42 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) suggesting that CDOM production from leaf litter fluctuates in response to environmental factors. CDOM production was greatest for the mid-senescence orange leaves and lowest for the severely senesced brown leaves in both experiments. Along the sub-tropical Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem, the primary source of CDOM is discharge from the shallow seagrass-dominated Florida Bay as evidenced by a strong correlation between field CDOM measurements and previously reported Florida Bay discharge volumes. However, field observations provide evidence that large expanses of red mangroves throughout the Keys could be important CDOM sources to the region's coral reefs during periods of reduced Florida Bay discharge. Floating Sargassum colonies also readily produced CDOM in laboratory incubations, but at much more variable rates than mangrove leaves. However, our calculations indicate that large mats of floating Sargassum could provide important CDOM quantities to oligotrophic oceanic waters including the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic.

R. China	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The spectral characteristics of mangroves on the Beihai Coast of Guangxi, P. R. China are acquired on the basis of spectral data from field measurements. Following this, the 3-layer reverse-conversing neural networks (NN) classification technology is used to analyze the Landsat TM5 image obtained on January 8, 2003. It is detailed enough to facilitate the introduction of the algorithm principle and trains project of the neural network. Neural network algorithms have characteristics including large-scale data handling and distributing information storage. This research firstly analyzes the necessity and complexity of this translation system, and then introduces the strong points of the neural network. Processing mangrove landscape characteristics by using neural network is an important innovation, with great theoretical and practical significance. This kind of neural network can greatly improve the classification accuracy. The spatial resolution of Landsat TM5 is high enough to facilitate the research, and the false color composite from 3-, 4-, and 5-bands has a clear boundary and provides a significant quantity of information and effective images. On the basis of a field survey, the exported layers are defined as mangrove, vegetation, bare land, wetlands and shrimp pool. TM satellite images are applied to false color composites by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands, and then a supervised classification model is used to classify the image. The processing method of hyper-spectrum remote sensing allows the spectral characteristics of the mangrove to be determined, and integrates the result with the NN classification for the false color composite by using 3-, 4-, and 5-bands. The network model consists of three layers, i.e., the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. The input layer number of classification is defined as 3, and the hidden layers are defined as 5 according to the function operation. The control threshold is 0.9. The training ratio is 0.2. The maximum permit error is 0.08. The classification precision reaches 86.86%. This is higher than the precision of maximal parallel classification (50.79%) and the spectrum angle classification (75.39%). The results include the uniformity ratio (1.7789), the assembly ratio (0.6854), the dominance ratio ( - 1.5850), and the fragmentation ratio (0.0325).

J	Rakotomavo, A; Fromard, F				Rakotomavo, Andriamparany; Fromard, Francois			Dynamics of mangrove forests in the Mangoky River delta, Madagascar, under the influence of natural and human factors	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Mangroves in Madagascar cover 327 000 ha to 340 300 ha. Several authors have Studied these mangroves, but we do not yet have a complete knowledge of these ecosystems. The present study is an attempt to respond to this concern by analyzing dynamics and changes in the extent of the mangrove forest in the Mangoky delta (SW Madagascar) between 1951 and 2000. The comparison between base maps and Landsat TM images shows that the mangrove area remained relatively stable, even increasing slightly (+189 ha) between 1951 and 1979. From 1979 to 1994, its area decreased from 21 426 ha to 11 706 ha (-9720 ha). It then increased again (+84 ha) between 1994 and 2000. The balance was a decrease of 41.74% between 1951 and 2000. These figures may be compared with national (-15% in 56 years) and world (-35% for the last 20 years) statistics. Three main reasons are given to explain these changes: (1) the hydrological and sedimentological behavior of the Mangoky River; (2) the mechanism of plant succession, which depends on tides and on the characteristics of the substratum and (3) human activities and logging, which have increased since the 1980s in the Mangoky delta.

Spatial analysis of anthropogenic disturbances in mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.																	0255-660X					MAR	2010	38	1					67	83		10.1007/s12524-010-0013-y								WOS:000281393500007

The regional land use is dominated by sugarcane cultivation, beef grazing and urban uses. The high nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fluxes from these land uses via river runoff produced a massive phytoplankton bloom in the GBR lagoon, which, after 9 days, had spread 150 km offshore. The plume and algal bloom surrounded inner-shelf reefs of the GBR such as Brampton Island Reef and its spread was tracked with a variety of satellite sensors including MODIS, SeaWiFS and Landsat over the 9-day period. The ability to be able to access imagery from a large number of satellite sensors allowed almost daily estimates of the extent of plume to be made, despite periods of cloud. Analysis of water samples from the plume revealed elevated (2-50 times higher) concentrations of Chlorophyll a (and hence phytoplankton biomass), up to 50 times higher than in non-flood conditions, nutrients (2-100 times higher) and herbicide residues (10-100 times higher) compared with GBR lagoon waters in non-discharge conditions. The concentration data from the samples and estimated exposure periods from the satellite images allowed estimates of the exposure of GBR marine ecosystems (coral reefs, the pelagic community, seagrass beds and mangrove forests) to the terrestrial contaminants to be made.

Using remote sensing to assess tsunami-induced impacts on coastal forest ecosystems at the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The December 2004 tsunami strongly impacted coastal ecosystems along the Andaman Sea coast of Thailand. In this paper tsunami-induced damage of five different coastal forest ecosystems at the Phang-Nga province coast is analysed with a remote sensing driven approach based on multi-date IKONOS imagery. Two change detection algorithms, change vector analysis (CVA) and direct multi-date classification (DMC), are applied and compared regarding their applicability to assess tsunami impacts. The analysis shows that DMC outperforms CVA in terms of accuracy (Kappa values for DMC ranging between 0.947 and 0.950 and between 0.610-0.730 for CVA respectively) and the degree of detail of the created change classes. Results from DMC show that mangroves were the worst damaged among the five forests, with a 55% of directly damaged forest in the study area, followed by casuarina forest and coconut plantation. Additionally this study points out the uncertainties in both methods which are mainly due to a lack of ground truth information for the time between the two acquisition dates of satellite images. The created damage maps help to better understand the way the tsunami impacted coastal forests and give basic information for estimating tsunami sensitivity of coastal forests.																	1561-8633						2010	10	4					729	745		10.5194/nhess-10-729-2010								WOS:000277185000012

Classification of four satellite (SPOT) images from the years 1987, 1995, 2004 and 2006 and field ground truth data from 2004 and 2005 were used for map generation. The results show major changes in the western area of the SAL, with large area increases of rice fields, dry land agriculture, aquaculture and rural areas, and decreases in mangrove cover, mud flat and lagoon area. In the eastern area, minor decreases in mangrove area and increase in aquaculture, rural and industrial areas were also observed. Changes are due to the filling of the lagoon with riverine sediments derived from the hinterland and to mangrove conversion and resources exploitation. The results of this study provide basic information which is required for developing measures towards a sustainable management and conservation of the SAL.																	1436-3798					DEC	2009	9	4					235	243		10.1007/s10113-008-0072-6								WOS:000272047100002

Evaluating the condition of a mangrove forest of the Mexican Pacific based on an estimated leaf area index mapping approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Given the alarming global rates of mangrove forest loss it is important that resource managers have access to updated information regarding both the extent and condition of their mangrove forests. Mexican mangroves in particular have been identified as experiencing an exceptional high annual rate of loss. However, conflicting studies, using remote sensing techniques, of the current state of many of these forests may be hindering all efforts to conserve and manage what remains. Focusing on one such system, the Teacapan-Agua Brava-Las Haciendas estuarine-mangrove complex of the Mexican Pacific, an attempt was made to develop a rapid method of mapping the current condition of the mangroves based on estimated LAI. Specifically, using an AccuPAR LP-80 Ceptometer, 300 indirect in situ LAI measurements were taken at various sites within the black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) dominated forests of the northern section of this system. From this sample, 225 measurements were then used to develop linear regression models based on their relationship with corresponding values derived from QuickBird very high resolution optical satellite data. Specifically, regression analyses of the in situ LAI with both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the simple ration (SR) vegetation index revealed significant positive relationships [LAI versus NDVI (R (2) = 0.63); LAI versus SR (R (2) = 0.68)]. Moreover, using the remaining sample, further examination of standard errors and of an F test of the residual variances indicated little difference between the two models. Based on the NDVI model, a map of estimated mangrove LAI was then created. Excluding the dead mangrove areas (i.e. LAI = 0), which represented 40% of the total 30.4 km(2) of mangrove area identified in the scene, a mean estimated LAI value of 2.71 was recorded. By grouping the healthy fringe mangrove with the healthy riverine mangrove and by grouping the dwarf mangrove together with the poor condition mangrove, mean estimated LAI values of 4.66 and 2.39 were calculated, respectively. Given that the former healthy group only represents 8% of the total mangrove area examined, it is concluded that this mangrove system, considered one of the most important of the Pacific coast of the Americas, is currently experiencing a considerable state of degradation. Furthermore, based on the results of this investigation it is suggested that this approach could provide resource managers and scientists alike with a very rapid and effective method for monitoring the state of remaining mangrove forests of the Mexican Pacific and, possibly, other areas of the tropics.

Land Use Dynamics in a Marine Protected Area System in Lower Andaman Coast of Thailand, 1990-2005	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study has depicted a scenario on assessing spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in and adjacent to marine protected areas (MPA) in a study site in Thailand. The measurement of landscape stability and its implications for protection and conservation of coastal resources are emphasized in this study. The methods employed include interpretation and analysis of satellite images, aerial photographs, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Image analysis and GIS techniques have been used extensively, and a site-specific geospatial database was developed accordingly. Initial temporal changes inside and outside protected areas are captured from visual interpretation of three time series satellite images, where an increase of aquaculture ponds and abandoned areas is clearly visible. The output changes derived from the image differencing techniques demonstrated considerable changes in the whole study area as well as inside the protected area boundary during 1976 to 1990. Compared to the earlier time (1976-1990) the changes during 1990 to 2005 are found to be less extensive. Although the existing marine protected areas were declared earlier than the 1990s, the changes are still found inside the protected area boundary during 1990-2005. The result shows significant increases in agriculture areas, including aquaculture development, which are, however, less inside the protected areas than the buffer areas. While mangrove areas have noticeable negative changes, an increase in Malalueca forest areas is interesting. In the discussion, a quantitative comparison of legislative boundary and buffer effects on protecting land use and land cover is illustrated. In light of existing ecological context and socioeconomic activities, observations are made on agents of change and resource use conflicts.																	0749-0208					SEP	2009	25	5					1082	1095		10.2112/08-1058.1								WOS:000270369500002

Despite the ecological, environmental, and economic importance of mangroves, they are declining at an alarming rate worldwide, mostly as a result of human activities. 2. Along the eastern African coast, Mozambique has the largest mangrove area. Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in the area, and people harvest mangrove vegetation for tannins, fuel wood, traditional medicine, boat-building, carpentry, and crafting. 3. Landsat 5 TM imagery was used to map the distribution of trans-boundary mangrove areas along the Mtwara-Quirimbas Complex. Results for 1995 and 2005 are presented for the entire coastline and in more detail for the Ruvuma estuary, Quiterajo, Ibo/Quirimba islands, and Pemba Bay. Results were validated with a ground-truthing excursion in 2006, showing an overall thematic accuracy of 73%. 4. Total estimated area of mangrove was 357 km(2) in 1995 and 368 km(2) in 2005, with the small net gain of 3% corresponding to a total gain of 32 km(2) and a total loss of 21 km(2) over this decade. 5. Results suggest that although Landsat TM imagery can be effective in mapping mangrove distribution, caution must be used in inferring its ecological condition.

J	Lee, TM; Yeh, HC				Lee, Tsai-Ming; Yeh, Hui-Chung			Applying remote sensing techniques to monitor shifting wetland vegetation: A case study of Danshui River estuary mangrove communities, Taiwan	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The purpose of this study is to apply different remote sensing techniques to monitor shifting mangrove vegetation in the Danshui River estuary in Taipei, Taiwan, in order to evaluate a long-term wetland conservation strategy compromising between comprehensive wetland ecosystem management and urban development. In the Danshui estuary, mangrove dominated by Kandelia candel is the major vegetation, and a large area of marsh with freshwater grasses has been protected in three reserves along the river shore. This study applied satellite imagery from different remote sensors of various resolutions for spectral analysis in order to compare shifting wetland vegetation communities at different times. A two-stage analytical process was used for extracting vegetation area and types. In the first-stage, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was adopted to analyze SPOT, Landsat, and QuickBird imagery to obtain the spatial distribution of vegetation covers. In the second stage, a maximum likelihood classification (MLC) program was used to classify mangrove and non-mangrove areas. The results indicated that the spatial distribution of mangroves expanded 15.18 and 40 ha in two monitoring sites in 10 years, demonstrating the success of establishing reserves for protecting mangrove habitats. The analytical results also indicated that satellite imagery can easily discern the difference in characteristics between imagery of mangrove and other vegetation types, and that the logistical disadvantages of monitoring long-term vegetation community changes as well as evaluating an inaccessible area may be overcome by applying remote sensing techniques.

Evaluating AISA plus Hyperspectral Imagery for Mapping Black Mangrove along the South Texas Gulf Coast	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove wetlands are economically and ecologically important ecosystems and accurate assessment of these wetlands with remote sensing can assist in their management and conservation. This study was conducted to evaluate airborne ATSA+ hyperspectral imagery and image transformation and classification techniques for mapping black mangrove populations on the south Texas Gulf coast. AISA+ hyperspectral imagery was acquired from two study sites, and both minimum noise fraction (MNF) and inverse MNF transforms were performed. Four classification methods, including minimum distance, Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, and spectral angle mapper (SAM), were applied to the noise-reduced hyperspectral imagery and to the band-reduced MNF imagery for distinguishing black mangrove from associated plant species and other cover types, Accuracy assessment showed that overall accuracy varied from 84 percent to 95 percent for site 1 and from 69 percent to 91 percent for site 2 among the eight classifications for each site. The MNF images provided similar or better classification results compared with the hyperspectral images among the four classifiers. Kappa analysis showed that there were no significant differences among the four classifiers with the MNF imagery, though maximum likelihood provided excellent overall and class accuracies for both sites. Producer's and user's accuracies for black mangrove were 91 percent and 94 percent, respectively, for site 1 and both 91 percent for site 2 based on maximum likelihood applied to the MNF imagery. These results indicate that airborne hyperspectral imagery combined with image transformation and classification techniques can be a useful tool for monitoring and mapping black mangrove distributions in coastal environments.																	0099-1112					APR	2009	75	4					425	435		10.14358/PERS.75.4.425								WOS:000264992100009

This study carried out in parts of the coast of southwestern Nigeria utilized topographic base maps and two-time Landsat TM imageries to assess the trend in land cover changes and ecosystems degradation for the three time periods 1965, 1986 and 2001. Remote sensing, geographic information systems and landscape pattern analysis were employed for data processing and analysis. The focus of the analysis was on land cover change, land degradation, and changes in landscape pattern resulting from interplay of natural and anthropogenic drivers. The results show increased trend in human-induced land cover change with concomitant severe negative impacts on ecosystems and livelihoods. About 98,000ha (30% of the area) was seriously degraded as at 2001. About 33,000ha (10%) was under permanent saline water inundation with about 21 communities already dislocated. Loss of fragile ecosystems including marshland (from 7.7% in 1965 to 1% in 2001) and mangrove (from 14.6% in 1965 to 3.1% in 2001) was intense, while over 300 ponds/small lakes which are important for the local fishing economy have disappeared. About eighteen communities were also dislocated by erosion in a section around the southeastern parts of the coastline. Landscape metrics generated, suggested increased ecosystems perturbation and landscape fragmentation. The paper also discussed the implications of these rapid changes for ecosystems stability, food security and sustainable rural livelihoods in the area.																	0141-6707					MAR	2009	47						30	38		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2008.01047.x								WOS:000263035500006

Morphology and modern sedimentary deposits of the macrotidal Marapanim Estuary (Amazon, Brazil)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The northern Brazilian coast, east of the Amazon River is characterized by several macrotidal estuarine systems that harbor large mangrove areas with approximately 7600 km(2). The Marapanim Estuary is influenced by macrotidal regime with moderate waves influence. Morphologic units were investigated by using remote sensing images (i.e., Landsat-7 ETM+, RADARSAT-1 Wide and SRTM) integrated with bathymetric data. The modern sedimentary deposits were analyzed from 67 cores collected by Vibracore and Rammkersonde systems. Analysis of morphology and surface sedimentary deposits of the Marapanim River reveal they are strongly influenced by the interaction of tidal, wave and fluvial currents. Based on these processes it was possible to recognize three distinct longitudinal facies zonation that revels the geological filling of a macrotidal estuary. The estuary mouth contain fine to medium marine sands strongly influenced by waves and tides, responsible for macrotidal sandy beaches and estuarine channel development, which are characterized by wave-ripple bedding and longitudinal cross-bedding sands. The estuary funnel is mainly influenced by tides that form wide tidal mudflats, colonized by mangroves, along the estuarine margin, with parallel laminations, lenticular bedding, root fragments and organic matter lenses. The upstream estuary contains coarse sand to gravel of fluvial origin. Massive mud with organic matter lenses, marks and roots fragments occur in the floodplain accumulates during seasonal flooding providing a slowly aggrading in the alluvial plain. This morphologic and depositional pattern show easily a tripartite zonation of a macrotidal estuary, that are in the final stage of filling. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS AND PATTERN OF HURRICANE IMPACT AND CIRCULATION ON MANGROVE FORESTS OF THE EVERGLADES	WETLANDS												The Everglades ecosystem contains the largest contiguous tract of mangrove forest Outside the tropics that were also coincidentally intersected by a major Category 5 hurricane. Airborne videography was flown to Capture the landscape patient and process of forest damage in relation to storm trajectory and circulation. TWO aerial video transects, representing different topographic positions, were used to quantify forest damage from video frame analysis in relation to prevailing wind force, treefall direction, and forest height. A hurricane simulation model wits applied to reconstruct wind fields corresponding to the ground location of each video frame and to correlate observed treefall and destruction patterns with wind speed and direction. Mangrove forests within the storm's eyepath and ill the right-side (forewind) quadrants suffered whole or partial blowdowns, while left-side (backwind) sites South of the eyewall zone incurred moderate canopy reduction and defoliation. Sites along file coastal transect sustained substantially more storm damage than sites along the inland transect which may be attributed to differences in stand exposure and/or Mature. Observed treefall directions were shown to be non-random and associated with hurricane trajectory and simulated forewind azimuths. Wide-area sampling using airborne videography provided an efficient adjunct to limited ground observations and improved our spatial understanding of how hurricanes imprint landscape-scale patterns of disturbance.																	0277-5212					MAR	2009	29	1					44	53		10.1672/07-233.1								WOS:000265294500006						
J	Lan, TD				Lan, Tran Dinh			Assessment of some marine ecosystems using sustainable utilization indicators in Hai Phong-Quang Ninh coastal area, Vietnam	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												This study is aimed at analyzing key indicators for the evaluation of changes and tendencies of sustainable utilization and management in some marine ecosystems in the coastal waters of Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area. To complete this study, the methods employed consisted of the application of remote sensing data and geographic information systems to extract information on spatial distribution of mangrove and tidal flat ecosystems, as well as on the reclamation area for human development and indicator investigation and analysis, using remote sensing extracted and field survey monitored data with Microsoft Excel (MS Excel). Applying indicators for sustainable utilization and management of marine ecosystems, developed in recent studies for the Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area, demonstrated changes and trends in significant ecosystems, such as coral reefs and mangroves. The outcomes showed that from 1998 to 2003, living coral cover was reduced by 20% on average in the Ha Long Bay area and by 13% in Cat Ba (Hang Trai - Dau Be), and projected that living coral cover would be reduced by a further 10% to 50% by 2010. The number of coral species was much reduced by 15% to 72% in the Ha Long - Cat Ba area. Mangrove area also decreased between 1995 and 2004, particularly after 2000, and is projected to be only 10,000 ha in 2010 in Quang Ninh. Marine ecosystems in the coastal waters of Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area have degraded significantly, particularly coral reefs, mangroves and tidal flats.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2009	12	3					243	248		10.1080/14634980903140364								WOS:000270156100003

Buffering functions of mangroves in the 2004 tsunami	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The complex nature of coastal ecosystems and their protection require a deeper understanding of land cover change and dynamics. Although a number of ecological studies have been conducted to realise this important objective, little information is available regarding the quantification of this land cover change. The role of mangroves as living barriers was under appreciated prior to the 2004 tsunami event. In this paper, we investigate the buffering functions of mangroves in the 2004 tsunami by employing the methodology developed in our companion paper. We focus more on mangrove distribution patterns in different buffer zones before and after the 2004 tsunami. The presence of mangroves before and after the event was statistically significant for the North (chi(2) = 154.08, p <= 0.001) and Upper South (chi(2) = 62.25, p <= 0.001). We observed positive linear relationships suggesting a loss of mangrove resulted into a gain of barren and sand land cover as a result of a devastating impact from the 2004 tsunami event. There are pockets of inland tsunami inundations and penetrations in the North and Upper-South in part owing to the river mouth profiles and dense mangrove trees. Although the North and Upper South Regions of the study area with large mangrove forest areas suffered slight damages, these regions put up a strong buffer against the tsunami suggesting that mangrove forests play a significant role in shoreline protection.																	1753-8947						2009	2	3					257	274		10.1080/17538940902870668								WOS:000270090300004

Reply to 'Using remote sensing to assess the protective role of coastal woody vegetation against tsunami waves'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In a recent paper in the International Journal of Remote Sensing, Olwig et al. [28 (2007) 3153-3169] present a comprehensive, geographic information system (GIS)-based description of the spatial distribution of damage from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami relative to coastal vegetation in Tamil Nadu, India, and conclude that '...mangrove forests and coastal shelterbelts provided protection from the [t]sunami.' In this comment, we demonstrate that the complex spatial pattern of damage makes their observational approach unable to substantiate this claim. Contrary to the authors' assertions, other factors known to affect tsunami inundation, such as elevation, near-shore bathymetry and patterns of land use, are shown to vary across their study site so as to create the appearance of a mitigating effect by vegetation on inundation and damage. We show that without explicitly quantifying and controlling for these confounding factors, it cannot be ascertained, even in principle, whether vegetation did ameliorate tsunami damage. We conclude with a call for analyses that can simultaneously assess the role of the discernibly manifold factors generating the pattern of inundation and damage of the 2004 tsunami.

These marine plant species are concentrated in specific tidal zones along sheltered intertidal coastlines in association with estuaries and lagoons; mangroves fringe the coastline encroaching into the lower intertidal region, whereas seagrasses populate the adjacent deeper water. In most cases, the distribution of mangroves and seagrasses does not overlap. It is important to monitor the geographic extent and health of mangrove forests and seagrass beds, which serve as an important habitat for juvenile marine species. Remote-sensing data for the Khor A1 Bazam area in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi, UAE, covering the years of 1994, 2000, and 2003, were used to determine the change in mangrove and seagrass cover. Since 1994, there has been an increase in mangrove cover, likely because of plantation activity, the closure of nearby shipyards, and an increase in public awareness regarding mangrove preservation. Although more difficult to determine, a combination of remote sensing and ground-truthing indicates that the seagrass beds within the study area have likely increased in real extent over the same time period.																	0749-0208					JAN	2009	25	1					48	56		10.2112/07-0867.1								WOS:000262698900005

Multi-Sensor Data Fusion for Geomorphological and Environmental Sensitivity Index Mapping in the Amazonian Mangrove Coast, Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				This research emphasizes the potential of space-borne optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for coastal geomorphological and environmental sensitivity index (ESI) mapping for oil spill in the macrotidal Amazon Region. Optical (Landsat-5 TM) and SAR (RADARSAT-1 Wide 1) imageries were evaluated regarding geomorphological information content. Particular interest was placed on the Selective Principal Component-SAR (SPC-SAR) product, an alternative scheme for the fusion of TM bands with Wide Mode data through the combination of Principal Component and Intensity-Hue-Saturation Transforms. TM images have contributed to enhance vegetation and sedimentary environments based on the optical response, while Wide Mode data has allowed enhancing differences between inundation frequency and distinct moisture content. Results of this investigation have revealed significant geomorphological information with 12 units mapped in the study area. The lowest ESI was assigned to cliffs (ESI 1) and the highest was marsh and mangroves, respectively (ESI 10A, 10C). The SPC-SAR product represents a powerful toot for geomorphological mapping, providing relevant information about geobotany, emerge and submerge coastal geomorphology. An annual monitoring of both natural and human-induced changes would provide information for the construction of multi-temporal ESI maps to oil spills in different seasons and tidal cycles in the Amazon coastal zone.

Mapping the condition of mangroves of the Mexican Pacific using C-band ENVISAT ASAR and Landsat optical data	CIENCIAS MARINAS												To determine whether spaceborne C-band SAR data Could be used alone, or in conjunction with optical data, for accurately mapping mangrove forests of the Mexican Pacific, four scenes of dual-polarized ENVISAT ASAR data, at two incidence angles, were collected for the Teacapan-Agua Brava-Las Haciendas estuarine-mangrove complex. Several combinations of these ASAR data were classified to determine the most optimal arrangement for mangrove mapping. In addition, corresponding Landsat TM data were classified using the same training sites. The overall accuracy in mapping these mangroves did improve when more than one polarization mode was employed. In general, the higher incidence angle data (similar to 41 degrees vs similar to 23 degrees) provided better results. In all circumstances, the optical data alone provided higher classification accuracies. Wlien contained as one mangrove class, the highest overall accuracy achieved using the ASAR data was 54% as compared to 76% for the optical data. When considering four separate mangrove classes, representing the four conditions typical of this system (dead, poor condition, healthy, tall healthy), overall accuracies dropped to 45% and 63%, respectively. With the limited penetration of C-band into canopies, it was difficult to separate healthy and tall healthy mangrove from palm and other terrestrial forests using the ASAR data. In addition to confusion amongst the four mangrove classes, the dead mangrove stands created considerable misclassification as they were readily misidentified with water and saltpan areas in the optical data and with agricultural lands in the ASAR data procedure. Given the advantage of ASAR For identifying dead stands from open water and saltpan, these data Were then used in conjunction with the optical data to reduce the misclassification of these areas.

Two subsets of the satellite image were extracted and used as test sites. Supervised and unsupervised image analysis techniques were used to classify the imagery. For the supervised classification of site 1, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 82.1% and a user's accuracy of 95.8%, whereas for the unsupervised classification, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 100% and a user's accuracy of 60.9%. In the supervised classification of site 2, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 91.7% and a user's accuracy of 100%, whereas in the unsupervised classification, black mangrove had a producer's accuracy of 100% and a user's accuracy of 85.7%. These results indicate that QuickBird imagery combined with image analysis techniques can be used successfully to distinguish and map black mangrove along the south Texas Gulf Coast.																	0749-0208					NOV	2008	24	6					1582	1586		10.2112/07-0987.1								WOS:000261266700023

This study was combined with detailed sedimentologic analysis of continuous cores, which provided a record of depositional settings developed in this area through the Holocene. The results revealed well-preserved, meandering to anastomosed drainage networks of wide palaeochannels that were superimposed by a narrower palaeochannel system. In both cases, the sedimentary record consists of sands, heterolithic deposits and muds, locally rich in plant debris. The strata are organized into fining upward successions that reach approximately 18 m thick in the wide channels and 4 m thick in the narrow channels. Sedimentary features suggestive of a coastal location for the wider palaeochannels and reworking of sediments by tidal currents include the prevalence of well to moderately sorted, rounded to sub-rounded, fine- to medium-grained sands displaying foreset packages separated by mud couplets, suggestive of tidal cycles. The data presented herein point to a rise in relative sea level reaching the Lake Arari area during the early to late/mid Holocene. This event was followed by a relative sea level drop. Tectonics seem to have contributed to an overall lowering in relative sea level in the study area since the mid-Holocene, which does not follow the same pattern recorded in other areas along the northern Brazilian coast.

J	Conchedda, G; Durieux, L; Mayaux, P				Conchedda, Giulia; Durieux, Laurent; Mayaux, Philippe			An object-based method for mapping and change analysis in mangrove ecosystems	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Object-based methods for image analysis have the advantage of incorporating spatial context and mutual relationships between objects. Few studies have explored the application of object-based approaches to mangrove mapping. This research applied an object-based method to SPOT XS data to map the land cover in the mangrove ecosystem of Low Casamance, Senegal. In parallel, the object-based method was tested to analyse the changes in the mangrove area between 1986 and 2006. The object-based method for mangrove mapping applied a multi-resolution segmentation and implemented class-specific rules that incorporate spectral properties and relationships between image objects at different hierarchical levels. The object-based approach for change analysis conducted the segmentation on the multi-date composite of the 1986 and 2006 images and applied a nearest neighbour classifier. The object-based method clearly discriminated the different land cover classes within the mangrove ecosystem. The overall accuracy of the land cover classification was 86%, the overall kappa value was 0.83 and the user's accuracy of the 'mangroves' class was higher than 97%. The estimated area of manoroves was 76,550 hectares in 2006. This result is an important update reference for mangrove studies in Senegal and the proposed method may represent a valid instrument for similar exercises in other regions. The image-to-image, object-based approach to change analysis clearly captured the fragmented and scattered pattern of change that prevails in the study area. The user's accuracy of the increase and decrease classes of transition produced results better than 85%. The overall accuracy. however, is lower due to the method's difficulties in detecting the small areas of change. To have conclusive evidence for the suitability of this method for change analysis of mangrove forest, this object-based approach should be tested in mangrove ecosystems where changes have different spatial patterns and modifications are more evident. Between 1986 and 2006, a small increase in the mangrove area was observed in Low Casamance. This was probably due to improved rainfall conditions after the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s. The pattern of change detected with the object-based approach corresponds to natural transitions and Suggests that anthropogenic influence was limited.

Yet, through retrospective research scientists can approach and understand ecosystem changes. This contributes to the fundamental understanding of both human-induced and natural dynamics in ecosystems worldwide. This also holds for fast changing coastal areas with mangrove ecosystems, which are important for biodiversity, for coastal protection, and for the daily livelihood of millions of people in tropical coastal developing countries. In addition, retrospective research generates a basis for predictions that can be used early on to protect an ecosystem. In attempting to protect ecosystems from adverse human-induced change and destruction, and to manage them for sustainability, scientists are only beginning to investigate and understand natural ecosystem dynamics. It is important and advisable to gather, combine and analyse all possible data that allow a researcher to look back in time. This paper reviews the available retrospective methods, and highlights the transdisciplinary way (i.e. combination between basic and applied sciences on one hand, and social and human sciences on the other) in which retrospective research on a scale between months and centuries can be carried out, but it also includes methods on larger scales that may be marginally relevant. The paper particularly emphasizes the lack of transdisciplinary (not interdisciplinary) integration between sciences in retrospective research on mangrove forests in the past. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Coastal residents who use mangroves and their resources may have considerable botanical and ecological knowledgeable about these forests. A wide variety of forest products are harvested in mangroves, especially wood for fuel and construction, tannins and medicines. Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm protection. The overlapping of marine and terrestrial resources in mangroves creates tenure ambiguities that complicate management and may induce conflict between competing interests. Mangroves have been cut and cleared extensively to make way for brackish water aquaculture and infrastructure development. More attention is now given to managing remaining forests sustainably and to restoring those degraded from past use. Recent advances in remotely sensed, geo-spatial monitoring provide opportunities for researchers and planners to better understand and improve the management of these unique forested wetlands.

Inter sensor comparison between RESOURCESAT LISS III, LISS IV and AWiFS with reference to coastal landuse/landcover studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Coastal zone assumes importance due to high productivity of ecosystems, man-made developmental activities, natural hazards and dynamic nature of the coast. As costal ecosystems are unique and fragile, understanding the impact of developmental activities on the sustainability of the coastal zone is very important. Remote sensing, because of repetitive and synoptic nature is an ideal tool for studying this. Time series data analyses for monitoring coastal zone require different type of sensors. Present study deals with atmospheric correction of satellite data, reflectance, selection of coastal features like, mudflat, mangroves, vegetated dune, coastal water, etc. and their inter-comparison using different sensor data of RESOURCESAT sensors. Reflectance values give better separateability for various coastal features in comparison to DN values.

Remote sensing can be used to obtain mangrove distribution information. However, serious confusion in mangrove classification using conventional methods can develop because some types of land cover (e.g., agricultural land and forests) have similar spectral behaviors and distribution features to mangroves. This paper develops a decision-tree learning method for integrating Landsat TM data and ancillary GIS data (e.g., DEM and proximity variables) to solve this problem. The analysis has demonstrated that this approach can produce superior mangrove classification results to using only imagery or ancillary data. Three temporal maps of mangroves in the Pearl River Estuary were obtained using this decision-tree method. Monitoring results indicated a rapid decline of mangrove forest area in recent decades because of intensified human activities.

A systematic method for 3D mapping of mangrove forests based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data, ICEsat/GLAS waveforms and field data: Application to Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta, Colombia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mangrove forests are found within the intertropical zone and are one of the most biodiverse and productive wetlands on Earth. We focus oil the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) in Colombia, the largest coastal lagoon-delta ecosystem in the Caribbean area with an extension of 1280 kin 2, where one of the largest mangrove rehabilitation projects in Latin America is currently underway. Extensive man-made hydrological modifications in the region caused hypersaline soil (>90 g kg(-1)) conditions since the 1960s triggering a large dieback of mangrove wetlands (similar to 247 km(2)). In this paper, we describe a new systematic methodology to measure mangrove height and aboveground biomass by remote sensing. The method is based on SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data, ICEsat/GLAS waveforms (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) and field data. Since the locations of the ICEsat and field datasets do not coincide, they are used independently to calibrate SRTM elevation and produce a map of mangrove canopy height. We compared height estimation methods based on waveform centroids and the canopy height profile (CHP). Linear relationships between ICEsat height estimates and SRTM elevation were derived. We found the centroid of the canopy waveform contribution (CWC) to be the best height estimator. The field data was used to estimate a SRTM canopy height bias (-1.3 m) and estimation error (rms = 1.9 m). The relationship was applied to the SRTM elevation data to produce a mangrove canopy height map. Finally, we used field data and published allometric equations to derive an empirical relationship between canopy height and biomass. This relationship was used to scale the mangrove height map and estimate aboveground biomass distribution for the entire CGSM. The mean mangrove canopy height in CGSM is 7.7 m and most of the biomass is concentrated in forests around 9 m in height. Our biomass maps will enable estimation of regeneration rates of mangrove forests under hydrological rehabilitation at large spatial scales over the next decades. They will also be used to assess how highly disturbed mangrove forests respond to increasing sea level rise under current global climate change scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Remote sensing of aquatic vegetation: theory and applications	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Aquatic vegetation is an important component of wetland and coastal ecosystems, playing a key role in the ecological functions of these environments. Surveys of macrophyte communities are commonly hindered by logistic problems, and remote sensing represents a powerful alternative, allowing comprehensive assessment and monitoring. Also, many vegetation characteristics can be estimated from reflectance measurements, such as species composition, vegetation structure, biomass, and plant physiological parameters. However, proper use of these methods requires an understanding of the physical processes behind the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and vegetation, and remote sensing of aquatic plants have some particular difficulties that have to be properly addressed in order to obtain successful results. The present paper reviews the theoretical background and possible applications of remote sensing techniques to the study of aquatic vegetation.

T.			Airborne laser scanning quantification of disturbances from hurricanes and lightning strikes to mangrove forests in Everglades National Park, USA	SENSORS												Airborne light detection and ranging ( LIDAR) measurements derived before and after Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma ( 2005) were used to quantify the impact of hurricanes and lightning strikes on the mangrove forest at two sites in Everglades National Park ( ENP). Analysis of LIDAR measurements covering 61 and 68 ha areas of mangrove forest at the Shark River and Broad River sites showed that the proportion of high tree canopy detected by the LIDAR after the 2005 hurricane season decreased significantly due to defoliation and breakage of branches and trunks, while the proportion of low canopy and the ground increased drastically. Tall mangrove forests distant from tidal creeks suffered more damage than lower mangrove forests adjacent to the tidal creeks. The hurricanes created numerous canopy gaps, and the number of gaps per square kilometer increased from about 400 similar to 500 to 4000 after Katrina and Wilma. The total area of gaps in the forest increased from about 1 similar to 2% of the total forest area to 12%. The relative contribution of hurricanes to mangrove forest disturbance in ENP is at least 2 times more than that from lightning strikes. However, hurricanes and lightning strikes disturb the mangrove forest in a related way. Most seedlings in lightning gaps survived the hurricane impact due to the protection of trees surrounding the gaps, and therefore provide an important resource for forest recovery after the hurricane. This research demonstrated that LIDAR is an effective remote sensing tool to quantify the effects of disturbances such as hurricanes and lightning strikes in the mangrove forest.

The southern part of the coast has a narrow shelf, but the north Orissa coast has an extended continental shelf. The coastline is bestowed with six major estuaries, India's second largest mangrove forest (Bhitarkanika Sanctuary), Asia's largest brackish water coastal lagoon (Chilika), extensive sandy beaches rich in heavy minerals, the world's largest rookery for the Olive Ridley sea turtle (Gahirmatha sandy beach within Bhitarkanika sanctuary), and two species of horseshoe crabs. In the last few decades there has been tremendous pressure on the coastal zone for the development of fisheries, aquaculture, ports, harbours, and urban settlements. These developments have led to environmental changes, some of which are irreversible, and thus have become issues of concern for the public as well as the state government. Some of the important environmental changes taking place, and which seriously affect the economy of the region, are tropical cyclones and associated storm surges, floods, decline in mangrove forests, accelerated shoreline changes, and transformation of the coastal lagoon ecosystem. This paper documents different coastal environmental features and their changes, observed during the last few decades through secondary data, field surveys, and remote sensing observations, and suggests a framework for a coastal zone management programme in the state.																	0749-0208					MAR	2008	24	2B		S			13	27		10.2112/04-0255.1								WOS:000254445500002						
J	Tian-Hong, L; Peng, H; Zhi-Jie, Z				Tian-hong, Li; Peng, Han; Zhi-jie, Zhao			Impact analysis of coastal engineering projects on mangrove wetland area change with remote sensing	CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING												In the past decades, two large scale coastal engineering projects have been carried out in the Deep Bay surrounded by Shenzhen City and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. One project is Shenzhen River channel regulation and the other is the sea reclamation along the seashore on the Shenzhen side. The two projects are very close to the two national nature reserves, specifically Futian in Shenzhen and Mai Po in Hong Kong, which are important wetland ecosystems worldwide. This paper aims to identify and monitor the mangrove wetland changes with time series of Landsat Thematic Mapper images pre and post to the two engineering projects being launched. Coupled analysis of the image interpretation results and tidal data acquired at the same time in the context of the two works reveals that the mangrove wetland area has increased from year 1989 to 1994, and has changed little from year 1994 to 2002. Binary coding is applied to reveal the distribution image of mangrove at each phase, and the coding image shows that the construction of the two coastal engineering projects has caused frequent changes in mangrove spatial distribution. The study also shows that the change is not significant regarding to the precision of the method and the natural evolution of mangrove wetland, and the projects do not cause apparently influences upon the two national mangrove conservation zones at least for the research time period.																	0890-5487						2008	22	2					347	358										WOS:000257775200015

Assessing the impact of the 2004 tsunami on mangroves using remote sensing and GIS techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												While tsunami characteristics and effects are not fully understood in the countries around the Indian Ocean, there are reports suggesting that mangroves, acting as a barrier, significantly reduce the devastation caused by the waves. This study proposes a creative approach to investigating the impact of the 2004 tsunami on mangrove vegetation. The approach involves a combination of Geographic Information System (GIS) proximity analyses and change detection methods in remote sensing to delineate multiple buffer distances from the coastline into four homogeneous subregions. The changes in land cover are then assessed in these subregions before and after the tsunami event. The proposed approach provides a more reliable and accurate means than conventional methods to evaluate spatial patterns of damaged areas through different land characteristics along the coastline. There are major damages to land cover, representing an average of 26.87% change, in those geographic locations with low mangrove coverage that are in close proximity to the coastline in all four subregions, whereas less damage is apparent in locations with high mangrove coverage, representing an average of only 2.77% change. The optimum distance between 1000 and 1500 m of mangrove buffer would be favourable and most effective for reducing the damage by potential tsunami waves. The findings support the need for mangrove replantation and management in the future and may serve as a prototype for studying impacts of tsunamis in other affected countries.

The results indicate that polarization and, to a lesser extent, incident angle play a significant role in the ability to estimate both leaf area index and mean tree height. No significant linear coefficients of determination were observed between the recorded parameters and the backscatter coefficient from any of the copolarized scenes. With regards to leaf area index, r(2) values of 0.82 and 0.73 were calculated for the cross-polarized data at two incident angles. For mean tree height, the linear coefficient of determination was much higher for the smaller incident angle data than for the larger incident angle data. No significant relationships were identified for stem density, basal area, or mean diameter at breast height. It is postulated that the inability of the copolarized ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar data to differentiate between dead mangrove stands and healthy ones is the result of equally high backscatter resulting from strong scattering from trunk-ground double bounce and crown volume, respectively.

Narendra			Mapping, monitoring and conservation of Mahanandi wetland ecosystem, Orissa, India using remote sensing and GIS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Mangrove forests are important component of coastal wetland ecosystems, depleting rapidly from nature due to anthropogenic pressure. The present study deals with periodic assessment and monitoring of the mangroves of Mahanadi delta, Orissa using remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. Satellite data of Landsat PASS for 1973, Landsat TM for 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III for 2004 were used to find out the changes that occurred in mangrove and other land cover categories during last 30 years. It was found that the delta is occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2004. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area clearly depict high anthropogenic activities by local villagers. A significant increase of 726 ha plantations illustrates plantation activities taken up by the Orissa Forest Department to protect the coastal shoreline.																	0369-8211						2008	78						81	89										WOS:000262100200008

Change detection studies of Sagar Island, India, using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite 1C Linear Imaging Self-Scan Sensor III data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coastal zone of Sagar Island, India, is subjected to various cyclic and random processes that continuously modify the region. The shoreline and land-use/land cover changes have been studied using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite 1C (IRS IC) linear imaging self-scan sensor (LISS) III satellite data from 1998 and 1999. A comparison between a topomap of 1967 and satellite data of 1999 established that during these years about 29.8 km of coastline was eroded, whereas the accretion is only 6.03 km(2). A comparison of satellite data from 1998 and 1999 showed that the island had undergone severe erosion of about 3.26 km(2), while the accretion was just about 0.08 k m(2). Change detection studies based on land-use patterns of the region revealed that the areal extent of mangrove vegetation of the island during 1998 and 1999 was 2.1 km(2) and 1.3 km(2), respectively. The areal extent of agricultural fields during these periods was 130.4 km(2) and 118.6 km(2), respectively. These results can be used to develop an index for temporal land-use changes in the region as an aid to quantify the extent and nature of the development change and to understand the surrounding environment, which in turn may help the planning agencies to develop sound and sustainable land-use practices.

The application of satellite data for the quantification of mangrove loss and coastal management in the Godavari estuary, East Coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The mangrove formations of Godavari estuary are due to silting over many centuries. The estuary covers an area of 62,000 ha of which dense Coringa mangrove forest spread in 6,600 ha. Satellite sensor data was used to detect change in the mangrove cover for a period of 12 years (1992-2004). It was found that an area of about 1,250 ha of mangroves was destroyed by anthropogenic interference like aquaculture, and tree felling etc. It was found that mangrove's spectral response/digital number (DN) value is much lower than non-mangrove vegetation such as plantation and paddy fields in SWIR band. By taking this as an advantage, spectral data was utilized for clear demarcation of mangroves from nearby paddy fields and other vegetation. Simpson's diversity index, which is a measure of biodiversity, was found to be 0.09, showing mangroves dominance. Ecological parameters like mud-flats/swamps, mangrove cover alterations, and biodiversity status are studied in detail for a period of 12 years. The increase in mangrove front towards coast was delineated using remote sensing data. The major advantages of remote sensing data is monitoring of change periodically. The combination of moderate and high-resolution data provided detailed coastal land use maps for implementing coastal regulation measures. The classification accuracy has been achieved is 90%. Overall, simple and viable measures are suggested based on multi-spectral data to sustain this sensitive coastal ecology.

Impact of solid shrimp pond waste materials on mangrove growth and mortality: a case study from Pak Phanang, Thailand	HYDROBIOLOGIA												One of the most serious threats to tropical mangrove ecosystems caused by shrimp farming activities is the poor management of pond waste materials. We hypothesise that mangroves can tolerate chemical residues discharged from shrimp farms and can be used as biofilters, but the capability of mangroves to cope with solid sediments dredged from shrimp ponds is limited. Our study in Pak Phanang, Thailand, confirmed that the excess sediments discharged from nearby shrimp ponds reduced mangrove growth rates and increased mortality rates. A series of transformed multi-temporal satellite images was used in combination with the field data to support this claim. In addition, a comparison between four dominant mangrove species revealed that Avicennia marina could tolerate sedimentation rates of > 6 cm year(-1), while Bruguiera cylindrica tolerated sedimentation rates of 5 cm year(-1) (total sediment depth = 25 cm) before dying, while Excoecaria agallocha and Lumnitzera racemosa performed intermediate. This outcome implied that in our situation A. marina and to lesser extent E. agallocha and L. racemosa could be more effective as biofilters than B. cylindrica, as they may survive the sedimentation longer in the disposal areas. Further studies on the impact of sedimentation and chemical pollution of shrimp farm wastes on mangrove mortality and growth are required.				Faculty of ITC, Dep Nat.

An integrated study for the assessment of tsunami impacts: A case study of South Andaman Island, India using remote sensing and GIS	COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The December 26, 2004 tsunami has caused extensive damage in the Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India, affecting 115.36 km of coastline. In order to identify the impacts of tsunami in South Andaman of the Andaman Islands, the study has been carried out using satellite data for pre-tsunami (Feb. 2003) and post-tsunami (March 2005). This paper provides an assessment of damages caused by tsunami and suitable resettlement places for the people using remote sensing and GIS technology. Assessment of tsunami inflicted damage to island ecosystems assumes greater importance owing to their life-sustaining and livelihood support abilities. Apart from the reparation caused to life and property, significant damage has afficted the ecosystem, which will have long lasting effects. The tsunami-induced damage to coastal ecosystems was studied based on coastal landuse, geomorphology and coastal critical habitat for South Andaman Island using remote sensing and GIS. An area of 3,366 ha of land area was affected by tsunami. Within the coastal ecosystem, coral reef and mangrove were also severely affected. The study of landforms shows that the land is submerged. The severity of damages and their consequences suggest the need for a definite restoration ecology programme.

We assessed the potential of Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) to estimate mangrove forest biomass from very high resolution (VHR) IKONOS images. The FOTO method computes texture indices of canopy grain by performing a standardized principal component analysis (PCA) on the Fourier spectra obtained for image windows of adequate size. For two distinct study sites in French Guiana, FOTO indices derived from a I m panchromatic channel were able to consistently capture the whole gradient of canopy grain observed from the youngest to decaying stages of mangrove development, without requiring any intersite image correction. In addition, a multiple linear regression based on the three main textural indices yielded accurate predictions of mangrove total aboveground biomass. Since FOTO indices did not saturate for high biomass values, predictions were furthermore unbiased, even for levels above 450 t of dry matter per hectare. Maps of canopy texture (with RGB coding) and biomass were then produced over 8000 ha of unexplored, low accessibility mangrove. Applying the FOTO method to the 4 m near-infrared channel yielded acceptable results with some limitations for characterization of juvenile mangrove types. We finally discuss the influence of technical aspects pertaining to VHR images and to FOTO implementation (especially the size of the window used to compute Fourier spectra) and we evoke the interesting prospect of broad regional validity offered by the method to characterize high biomass tropical forest from standardized measures of canopy grain.

J	Seto, KC; Fragkias, M				Seto, Karen C.; Fragkias, Michall			Mangrove conversion and aquaculture development in Vietnam: A remote sensing-based approach for evaluating the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Remote sensing data have been proposed as a potential tool for monitoring environmental treaties. However, to date, satellite images have been used primarily for visualization, but not for systematic monitoring of treaty compliance. In this paper, we present a methodology to operationalize the use of satellite imagery to assess the impact of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The approach uses time series analysis of landscape pattern metrics to assess land cover conditions before and after designation of Ramsar status to monitor compliance with the Convention. We apply the methodology to two case studies in Vietnam and evaluate the success of Ramsar using four metrics: (1) total mangrove extent; (2) mangrove fragmentation; (3) mangrove density; and (4) aquaculture extent. Results indicate that the Ramsar Convention did not slow the development of aquaculture in the region, but total mangrove extent has remained relatively constant, primarily due to replanting efforts. Yet despite these restoration efforts, the mangroves have become fragmented and survival rates for replanting efforts are low. The methodology is cost effective and especially useful to evaluate Ramsar sites that rely mainly on self-reporting methods and where third parties are not actively involved in the monitoring process. Finally, the case study presented in this paper demonstrates that with the appropriate satellite record, in situ measurements and field observations, remote sensing is a promising technology that can help monitor compliance with international environmental agreements.

Nevertheless, class information that has been used in the existing research for testing the performance of the GA-based band selector is broad (i.e. Anderson's level I or 11). This means that each class possesses distinct spectral characteristics from one another, and it is relatively easy for the band selector to find spectral bands that maintain high spectral separability between classes. None of the existing studies has tested the band selector on class information that possesses very similar spectral characteristics (e.g. species-level data). A question therefore remains if the band selector can deal with such complexity. As a result, the key hypothesis of this research is that the GA-based band selector can be used for selecting a meaningful subset of spectral bands that maintains spectral separability between species classes. The testing data in use are very high-dimensional, spectrometer records that comprise 2151 bands of leaf spectra of 16 tropical mangrove species. The results turned out that the GA-based band selector was able to cope with spectral similarity at the species level. It meaningfully selected spectral bands that related to principal physio-chemical properties of plants, and, simultaneously, maintained the separability between species classes at a high level.

The acidic nature of the estuary soils (pH 5.8-6.2) along with redox potential -120mV favours high methane emissions. The samples collected from the edge of the estuary have shown 0.12-0.15% of Fe2+ wherein ambient methane concentrations were 4.8-5.6 ppmv. It was observed that the anoxic condition with high available iron in the soil improves anaerobic decomposition of organic matter to produce methane. The litter production from nearby mangrove vegetation in the estuary is approximately 22,000 tons/ annum is a causative factor for higher methane emissions. Remote sensing data was used and developed thematic maps for spatial and temporal distribution of methane using geographical information system. The seasonal trend showed high ambient concentration of methane in winter season, which is mainly due to high moisture content, (OH) radical and lower temperature. The results suggest that high organic matter (2.5-4.2%) along with soil conditions in the estuary are influencing for higher methane emissions, while in paddy fields the available organic matter for methanogenesis is limited.

Monitoring mangrove forest dynamics of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India using multi-temporal satellite data from 1973 to 2000	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Mangrove forests in many parts of the world are declining at an alarming rate - possibly even more rapidly than inland tropical forests. The rate and causes of such changes are not known. The forests themselves are dynamic in nature and are undergoing constant changes due to both natural and anthropogenic forces. Our research objective was to monitor deforestation and degradation arising from both natural and anthropogenic forces. We analyzed multi-temporal satellite data from 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s using supervised classification approach. Our spatiotemporal analysis shows that despite having the highest population density in the world in its periphery, areal extent of the mangrove forest of the Sundarbans has not changed significantly (approximately 1.2%) in the last -25 years. The forest is however constantly changing due to erosion, aggradation, deforestation and mangrove rehabilitation programs. The net forest area increased by 1.4% from the 1970s to 1990 and decreased by 2.5% from 1990 to 2000. The change is insignificant in the context of classification errors and the dynamic nature of mangrove forests. This is an excellent example of the co-existence of humans with terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal life. The strong commitment of governments under various protection measures such as forest reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and international designations, is believed to be responsible for keeping this forest relatively intact (at least in terms of area). While the measured net loss of mangrove forest is not that high, the change matrix shows that turnover due to erosion, aggradation, reforestation and deforestation was much greater than net change. The forest is under threat from natural and anthropogenic forces leading to forest degradation, primarily due to top-dying disease and over-exploitation of forest resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment and monitoring of mangroves of Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, Orissa, India using remote sensing and GIS	CURRENT SCIENCE												The present study deals with periodic assessment and monitoring of the mangroves of Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, Orissa, India using remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques. Satellite data of Landsat MSS for 1973, IRS-1A LISS II for 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III for 2004 along with other spatial and non-spatial data were used to find out the changes that occurred in mangrove and other land-cover categories during the last 30 years. It was found that the sanctuary is occupied by agriculture (51.76%), followed by dense mangrove (21.77%), water bodies (20.19%) and open mangrove (2.73%). A loss of 1534 ha mangrove area and an increase of 2436 ha agriculture area clearly depict anthropogenic activities by local villagers. A significant increase of 270 ha plantations illustrates plantation activities taken up by the Orissa Forest Department to protect the coastal shoreline.																	0011-3891					MAY 25	2007	92	10					1409	1415										WOS:000248643600029

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) L-band Phased Array Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), launched successfully in January 2006, will provide new data sets for coastal ecosystems mapping and change monitoring at local to global scales. 2. To evaluate L-band capability for mangrove applications, data acquired by the NASA airborne SAR (AIRSAR) and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1 SAR) over sites in Australia, French Guiana and Malaysia were used to demonstrate benefits for mapping extent and zones, retrieving biomass and structural attributes (e.g. height), and detecting change. 3. The research indicates that mapping is most effective where mangroves border non-forested areas and where differences in structure, as a function of species, growth stage and biomass distributions, occur between zones. 4. Using L-band SAR, biomass can be retrieved up to similar to 100-140 Mg ha(-1) although retrieval is complicated by a noticeable decrease in L-band backscattering coefficient within higher (similar to > 200 Mg ha(-1)) biomass stands, particularly those with extensive prop root systems. 5. Change detection through multi-temporal comparison of data proved useful for mapping deforestation/regeneration and mangrove dynamics associated with changing patterns of sedimentation. 6. The research highlights the likely benefits and limitations of using ALOS PALSAR data and supports JAXA's Kyoto & Carbon (K&C) Initiative in promoting the use of these data for regional mangrove assessment.

Vinu			Applications of remote sensing and GIS for sustainable management of shrimp culture in India	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												This paper briefly describes the status of shrimp culture development in India, discusses its ecological and socio-economic impacts and recommends measures to achieve long term sustainability using advanced tools like remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). It highlights a selected number of remote sensing case studies on applications of remote sensing and GIS for sustainable management of shrimp culture. This paper addresses the potential capabilities of evolving satellite remote sensing technology and GIS for the sustainable management of shrimp culture through the analysis of various dataset depicting the criteria of sustainability. The need for accurate prediction of water quality parameters within the context of sustainable shrimp culture demands the application of advanced methods like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with remote sensing and GIS. These are essential in the spirit of sustainable development and management, particularly in developing countries, which are often more vulnerable to environmental degradation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

New mangrove ecosystem data along the UAE coast using remote sensing	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					1st International Conference on the State of the Gulf Ecosystems	MAR 05-07, 2006	Al Ain, U ARAB EMIRATES					Characteristics of mangrove communities along the Gulf Coast of the UAE were explored using high-resolution satellite data Terra ASTER imageries in the common visible and near infra-red bands. Mangrove stands in three geographically distinctive sites, Khor Kalba, Khor Umm Al-Quwain and Al Dabbiya, were studied through spatial data and ground verification surveys. Mangroves in the UAE appear in patchy and scattered patterns, occupying about 40 km(2) of the coastal zone, half of which are located in Abu Dhabi in sheltered lagoons. The remaining areas are linear communities fringing tidal waterways distributed along intertidal zones. Their distribution is limited however, by aridity and site topography. Despite similarities in substrate conditions, differences in climatic and vegetation characteristics between the three sites indicate that growth conditions seem to be more favourable at Khor Kalba with the higher winter temperatures and higher annual rainfalls. Nine main units were recognized on the colour composite image of the Terra ASTER space data; dense vegetation, scattered vegetation, algal deposits, dry sand, sabkhas, settlements, recent deposits and turbid water, shallow water and deep water. Radiance did not allow for the separation of mangrove areas from inland vegetation through the supervised classification. Confusion was also encountered between different soil classes ( e. g. wet soils) and settlements or roads. It is concluded, therefore, that satellite data such as SPOT and Terra ASTER can be effectively analyzed through visual interpretations supported by local digital enhancement.																	1463-4988						2007	10	3					309	319		10.1080/14634980701512525								WOS:000249606800009						
J	Guo, W; Li, SH; Mao, L; Yin, Y; Zhu, DK				Guo Wei; Li Shu-heng; Mao Liang; Yin Yong; Zhu Da-kui			A model for environmental impact assessment of land reclamation	CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING												Land reclamation is a complex marine environmental engineering and has a huge impact on social, economic, and physical environment. Reclamation environmental impact assessment (REIA) is also a complicated project, including the assessment of social economic background, ocean engineering, coastal geomorphology, sediment transportation, marine hydrodynamics and marine ecosystem and so on. Nowadays, a large number of land reclaimed projects have been carried out or in the process of construction along the coastal zone, thus, it is necessary to build up a framework on REM to evaluate and quantify the environmental changes, to contribute to reclamation program, to reduce marine environmental disasters, and to sustain development of coastal zone. This article focuses on the research of RELA framework theory and puts forward a REIA model on land reclaimed evaluation, at the same time, applies this assessment system in Shenzhen City, which is a highly developed coastal city with an expectation of land reclamation. By use of the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, along with the topographic map and in situ survey in reclamation area, it concludes that the area of 2680 hectares in total has been reclaimed in Shenzhen city by the end of the year 2000. Thus, reclamation is usually applied to meet the needs for infrastructure, such as harbors, industries and highways in Shenzhen City. However, some serious negative impacts have been created to the coastal environment shown clearly in the following aspects. Firstly, it caused the dramatic changes of tidal flat and channels along the western coast, made this area more unstable, which is threatening the function of the harbor in this area. Secondly, Tidal prism has decreased rapidly. During the 20 years of reclamation, the tidal prism has been reduced by 20% similar to 30% along the western coast in the Lngdingyang Estuary, and 15.6% in the Shenzhen Bay. As a result, the velocity of the tidal current has also declined, and the direction of the tidal current has changed, which is harmful to the dilution and diffusion process of the contaminants. Thirdly, it has threatened the eco-environment finally., More than 147 hectares of mangrove area along the coast of Shenzhen Bay, accounting for 48.8% of the total mangrove reserve area in this region, has been reclaimed only during the short period from 1988 to 2000. Thus, the biodiversity is decreasing, and more and more plants and animals are disappearing. Based on the above analyses of the environmental impacts, strategies and suggestions for the future reclamation in this area have been put forward in order to support the sustainable development of the coastal zone.																	0890-5487						2007	21	2					343	354										WOS:000247856500014						
J	Thu, PM; Populus, J				Thu, Phan Minh; Populus, Jacques			Status and changes of mangrove forest in Mekong Delta: Case study in Tra Vinh, Vietnam	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Because shrimp culture in the Mekong Delta develops rapidly, it has negatively impacted the environment, socio-economics and natural resources. In particular, mangrove forests have been altered by the shrimp culture. The area of mangrove forests in the region has been reduced and this is seen especially in Tra Vinh province. The results obtained from GIS (Geography Information System) and RS (Remote Sensing) show the status of mangrove forests in Tra Vinh province in 1965, 1995 (Northeastern part of Tra Vinh Province) and 2001. In 1965, the area of mangrove forests was 21,221 ha making up 56% of total land-use, while in 2001 it was 12,797 ha making up 37% of total land-use. Also based on GIS analysis, over the 36 years (1965-2001), the total coverage of mangrove forests have decreased by 50% since 1965. However, the speed of mangrove forest destruction in the period from 1965 to 1995 was much less than that in the period from 1995 to 2001. The average annual reduction in mangrove forest coverage in the first period (1965-1995) was 0.2% whereas it was 13.1% in the later period (1995-2001). For the long time, mangrove deforestation has been caused by war, collection of firewood and clearing for agriculture, and recently, shrimp farming has significantly contributed rate of mangrove destruction.

Urban radiation balance of two coastal cities in a hot and dry environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Four Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) satellite scenes of Dubai and Abu Dhabi with channels from the visible-near infrared (VNIR) to the thermal infrared (TIR) were analysed to show variations in surface temperature, albedo, emissivity and net radiation in different urban and rural classes. For a better understanding of the spatial coherences of surface properties a land use classification was derived. The different classes were then spatially and temporally compared. The investigations show in the daytime a distinct surface cool island for Dubai and surface cool areas at Abu Dhabi city and its surrounding mangrove areas. Net radiation is mainly controlled by the albedo. The albedo in urban areas is lower than in their surrounding desert environments, therefore the net radiation is higher in the urban areas. The surface temperatures behave contrary to the net radiation and are higher in land use classes, where water is available.

Using remote sensing to assess the protective role of coastal woody vegetation against tsunami waves	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper describes how remote sensing techniques were used to study the effect of mangroves and other woody coastal vegetation as a protective measure against the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Remote sensing made it possible to compare pre- and post-Tsunami images of large areas. A study site was selected based on medium resolution Landsat imagery and existing topographic maps. Selection criteria included substantial damages reported, presence of woody vegetated and non-vegetated shorelines, homogeneous bathymetry and good coverage of pre- and post-Tsunami satellite imagery. The Pichawaram mangrove, Tamil Nadu, India, matched these criteria. Pre- and post-Tsunami Ikonos and QuickBird images were compared through the visual interpretation of pre-Tsunami coastal vegetation and post-Tsunami damage. The results were validated in the field. The analysis showed that mangrove forests and coastal shelterbelts provided protection from the Tsunami. This was concluded from analysing the spatial distribution of damage relative to woody vegetation along the coast as well as transects detailing the amount of damage behind the coastline and the coastal woody vegetation.																	0143-1161						2007	28	13-14					3153	3169		10.1080/01431160701420597								WOS:000247469000020

Regression and analytical models for estimating mangrove wetland biomass in South China using Radarsat images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove wetlands have been rapidly diminishing because of human pressures worldwide. The Guangdong Province in South China, which has the largest area of mangrove wetlands in the nation, is under severe threat as a result of rapid urbanization and economic development. In this paper, comparisons were made between optical Landsat TM images and Radarsat fine-mode images for estimating wetland biomass. Regression and analytical models were used to establish the relationships between remote sensing data and wetland biomass. The optimal parameter values for the analytical model were determined using genetic algorithms. Experiments indicate that the models using Radarsat fine-mode images have significant accuracy improvement in terms of Root Mean-Square Error (RMSE) whereas the use of the single Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) may produce serious errors in biomass estimation. The Radarsat images can obtain more accurate trunk information about mangrove forests because of higher resolution and side-looking geometry. The use of genetic algorithms can help to decompose backscatter into vegetation and soil backscattering, which is very useful for ecological modelling.

Environment sensitivity mapping and vulnerability modeling for oil spill response along the Sao Paulo state coastline	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coastal zone of Sao Paulo is characterized by a number of fragile ecosystems such as sandy beaches, estuaries, rocky shores, mangroves and the presence of one of the largest ports of South America (Santos Port) located in the central portion of this coastline. Further to the north there is a crude oil terminal called TEBAR, in front of Sao Sebastiao Island. Both areas have been threatened by oil spills with a known history of accidents dating back to the 70's. Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps are an integral component of oil spill contingency planning and emergency response, and it has become a powerful tool to reduce the environmental consequences of oil spills, helping prioritize the placement and allocation of resources during cleanup efforts. This paper presents the results on how digital image products and geodatabase modeling can be used to derive ESI maps and vulnerability scenarios. The model uses query tools built in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to access physical, biological and human-use attributes and indicates relative contamination risk. An approach based on conceptual modeling of climatological processes (atmospheric front passage vs. fair weather) and morphology of the coastline is used to generate specific vulnerability scenarios. The vulnerability scenarios have been successfully validated with a historical database of recorded oil spills, indicating the usefulness of remote sensing data and GIS in contingency planning and assessment of oil spill effects on a tropical environment.

Monitoring of coastal dynamics in French Guiana from 16 years of SPOT satellite images	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Guianas coast, northwest of the mouth of the Amazon river, experiences a very strong supply of muddy sediment that entails major coastal modifications at seasonal to annual timescales. Mud supply is predominantly in the form of mud banks migrating alongshore from the Amazon to the Orinoco. In this paper, focus is placed on the geomorphic change that has affected the 60 km stretch of coastline between Cayenne and Kourou (French Guiana) from 1986 to 2002. The remote sensing analysis demonstrates an overall erosion of 60 km(2) of sea-front mangrove swamps. Anew mud bank migrating towards Kourou since 1991 has led to a significant reduction in erosion and has even enabled the commencement of mangrove colonization. Aspatio-temporal matrix applied to both the vegetated and inter-tidal parts of the mud bank highlights the interplay between mud bank migration and mangrove colonization.				gratiot, nicolas/G-8071-2016													0749-0208					WIN	2006					39		1502	1505										WOS:000202961500054

Remote sensing and GIS integration for modelling the Paranagua estuarine complex -Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Before implementation hydrodynamical and ecological models in estuarine systems it is necessary a set of morphological and hydrological information at different spatial scales. The quality of this information will affect directly the model quality. A classification with three hierarchical levels was done for the Paranagua Estuarine Complex focusing on both the morphological and hydrological characteristics. This classification allowed a physical characterization in different spatial scales, which is necessary for the watershed and coastal waters zonation, as well as the application of models, at each level. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were used to extract features from Landsat ETM such as the coastline, the upper limit of wetlands; the vegetated flooded area, composed basically of mangroves and salt marshes on upper areas; and mud flats. The top level in the hierarchy is the Paranagua Estuarine Complex as a whole. The next level consists in a division of the system in five sections, and in the last hierarchy level seven sub-estuaries were delimited. Attributes were obtained for all the units defined in each hierarchy level, such as area, perimeter, depth (when available), water body area (without wetlands), wetlands area, tidal flat, drainage area, drainage density, hydraulic gradient and river discharge (when available).

A post-classifier for mangrove mapping using ecological data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												A global decline in tropical mangrove forests is one of the most serious problems of the world's coastal ecosystems. This problem results in an increasing demand of detailed mangrove maps at the species level for monitoring mangrove ecosystems and their diversity. Consequently, this research is the first to investigate the unexplored potential of exploiting mangrove-environment relationships for improving the quality of the final mangrove map at the species level. The relationships between mangroves and the surrounding environmental gradient were incorporated into the mapping process via a typical Bayesian probability model. The Bayesian model functioned as a post-classifier to improve the quality of an already-produced mangrove map. The environmental gradient in use was a GIS layer of soil pH data. Despite the remaining confusion between R. mucronata and S. easeolaris, it was found that the investment of the integration of soil pH into the mapping process paid off as it significantly increased the mapping accuracy from 76.04% to 88.21%. It is anticipated that the methodology presented in this study may be used as a guideline for producing mangrove maps at a finer level.

J	Dahdouh-Guebas, F; Koedam, N				Dahdouh-Guebas, F; Koedam, N			Empirical estimate of the reliability of the use of the Point-Centred Quarter Method (PCQM): Solutions to ambiguous field situations and description of the PCQM plus protocol	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This paper reports problems associated to the use of the Point-Centred Quarter Method (PCQM), as well as their possible solutions. Problematic settings in the application of the PCQM are amongst others due to the presence of multiple-stemmed trees (MST), to ambiguous settings for measuring the sampling point to nearest tree distance or the tree diameter, both of which may result in erroneous estimation of silvimetric variables and parameters. The analysis is based on a database of effective individual tree records including distances, diameters, and heights measured in the field in a Sri Lankan mangrove forest between 1997 and 2002, and randomly compiles a series of records that were used as PCQM sampling points. Various structural forest parameters were calculated, with particular emphasis on density and basal area. After proving that multiple- and single-stemmed trees have different silvimetric characteristics, we adopted an empirical approach to demonstrate the classical PCQM protocol applied to MST generates significantly different densities (overestimation) and basal areas (underestimation) depending on which stems are considered for measurement, and we suggest an adapted PCQM+ protocol (measurement of central stem instead of nearest stem). We test both protocols in two mangrove assemblages (one composed of Excoecaria agallocha only, and an Excoecaria agallochalRhizophora apiculata mixed forest) with MST proportions varying between 0% and 100%, at 5% intervals. The results indicated that the classical PCQM protocol generates density and basal area results that are strongly correlated with the MST proportion in the assemblage (p < 0.001), whereas the PCQM+ protocol shows a robustness with no such correlations for density. For basal area the results of the PCQM+ protocol showed a weak correlation with the MST proportion, and regression-ANCOVA results indicated that they were significantly different from those of the highly sensitive PCQM protocol (p < 0.001). Finally, we conclude by writing out the entire PCQM+ protocol, elaborating on the solutions to other common problems related to ambiguous settings for the consideration of stems or the measurement of their diameter (aerial roots, split trunks, dwarf growth, horizontally developing stems, boundary of an individual in MST, selectively cut trees or tree parts, very sparse assemblages, use of PCQM for remote sensing ground-truth), and by nevertheless highlighting the potential of the PCQM/PCQM+ approach. Although we used a mangrove forest data set, the PCQ-Method and our suggestions are widely applicable to other forest types. In addition, this paper is accompanied by the first interface that automatically processes standard PCQM-related data (regardless of forest type) to generate common silvimetric or forestry parameters elaborated in this paper, and it is freely available in Appendix C and from http://www.vub.ac.be/APNA/staff/FDG/pub/pub.html.

Remote sensing analysis identified predisaster mangrove change and postdisaster structural damage and landscape changes. Field data from five sites (20 villages), gathered via the VIEWS (TM) data collection system, validated and supplemented this analysis. Key informants at several of these villages were also interviewed. A preliminary comparison of villages that otherwise faced similar tsunami exposure suggests that the presence of healthy mangroves did afford substantial protection. Village performance in mangrove conservation and management efforts, and thus the presence of healthy forests, is influenced by both social capital and the design of external aid delivery programs.																	8755-2930					JUN	2006	22			3			S863	S887		10.1193/1.2201971								WOS:000251517100044

During the past three decades, these mangrove areas have been reduced to about 50% with less than 10% left on the east coast. Coastal erosion and accretion occur irregularly along the coast but an intensification of erosion has been noticed during the past decade. This study assessed the relationship between mangrove presence and changes in coastal area. Mangrove colonization rates were assessed using in situ transects and remote sensing time series. Both methods led to comparable estimates ranging between 5 and 40 m y(-1). Quantitative data on changes of coastal segments along southern Thai coastlines as well as available possible factors responsible for these changes were compiled. Overall, net erosion prevailed (1.3 +/- 0.4 m y(-1)). The Gulf of Thailand coastline in the East of the country was found to be most dynamic: change occurred along more coastal segments than in the West (43% vs. 16%). Rates of erosion and accretion were also higher, 3.6 versus 2.9 m y(-1) and 2.6 versus 1.5 m y(-1), respectively. Total area losses accounted for 0.91 km(2) y(-1) for the Gulf coast and 0.25 km(2) y(-1) for the West. Coasts with and without mangroves behaved differently: in the presence of mangroves less erosion was observed whilst expansion occurred at particular coastal types with mangrove existence, i.e. river mouths and sheltered bays. Possible underlying causes were examined using multivariate analysis. Eroded areas were found to increase with increased area of shrimp farms, increased fetch to the prevailing monsoon, and when dams reduced riverine inputs. Notably, however, in areas where erosion prevailed, the presence of mangroves reduced these erosion rates. Mangrove loss was found to be higher in the presence of shrimp farms and in areas where mangrove forests used to be extensive in the past. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the development of this activity induces changes that potentially have negative impacts on the environment, one of which is wetland deterioration. This paper describes the use of a proposed change detection methodology in the assessment of mangrove forest alterations caused by aquaculture development, as well as the effectiveness of the measures taken to mitigate deforestation in the district of Giao Thuy, Vietnam, between 1986, 1992 and 2001. Geometric and radiometric corrections were applied to Landsat images prior to identifying changes through comparison of unsupervised classifications. Changes were afterwards validated using a thresholding method based on Tasselled Cap feature image differencing and a rule-based feature selection matrix. The matrix is used to identify the feature that is most efficient at detecting the presence of change between given land-cover classes. The proposed approach aims to minimize commission errors in the post-classification change detection process. The results suggest that 63% of mangrove areas apparent in 1986 had been replaced by shrimp ponds in 2001. Between 1986 and 1992, 440 ha of adult mangrove trees had disappeared, whereas the mangrove extent increased by 441 ha between 1992 and 2001. This recovery is attributed to reforestation projects and conservation efforts that promoted natural regeneration.

It is necessary to evaluate land use - land cover (LULC) changes to develop efficient management strategies. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate and quantity Abu Dhabi coastal zone LULC changes from 1972 to 2000 using multi-temporal LANDSAT satellite data and digital change detection techniques. Supervised classification Coupled with expert Visual interpretation techniques were used to produce LULC classified images with an accuracy of 88%. Change detection process was achieved by applying post-classification comparison techniques in ENVI software. From this study it has been observed that the important coastal landuse types of Abu Dhabi coast i.e. wetlands and woody Vegetation (Mangrove, represented by a single species, Avicennia marina) have been reduced drastically in their extent due to reclamation, dredging, tipping and other anthropogenic activities along the coastal zone. However, it has been observed that there is rapid increase in the man-made plantation and managed vegetation from 1990 to 2000 due to the Abu Dhabi government initiation. This Study has given good insight into Abu Dhabi coastal zone changes during last 3 decades.				CHEN, YU/F-8600-2011	Yagoub, M.

Capacity building in tropical coastal resource monitoring in developing countries: A re-appreciation of the oldest remote sensing method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Long-term decadal retrospection in spatio-temporal imagery analyses can only be carried out using aerial photographs, which are still the most detailed remotely sensed data available. Visual interpretation of such imagery is most efficient and inexpensive in the light of ecosystem monitoring research in developing countries, which are often unable to cope with the development or the cost of acquisition of commercial space-borne imaging (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird). In this light, the present paper explicitly analyses the methodological use of image attributes of air-borne imagery from mangrove forests, and investigates the consistency and constraints of mangrove image attributes in visually interpreted air-borne imagery. Six image attributes are analysed, and their application is illustrated using various mangrove sites in Kenya and Sri Lanka. Comparison of identification keys reveals that minor attributes such as 'ecological position' are informative, and that image attributes for a particular species or genus are apparently less plastic and more widely applicable than formerly assumed. Emphasis on compulsory fieldwork is made and constraints related to reflection and interference, amongst others, are discussed.

In addition, the vegetation can change over time as landforms can accrete or erode, which is a direct response to coastal sedimentary processes. This demonstrates that significant changes can occur on short time scales and mangroves provide an excellent register of these modifications. Therefore, mangrove morphology and sedimentation are good indicators of interactions between relative sea level changes, coastal processes and sediment supply. These interactions are responsible for landward migration of the shoreline (erosion) and seaward migration of the shoreline (accretion), which is possible to detect from multi-date satellite data and field observations. Mangroves are one of the best geo-indicators in global coastal change research and they are an excellent procedure to detect and quantify coastal modifications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the water requirements of the environment, as stated in the Tripartite Interim Agreement (TIA) signed by the three riparian countries in Johannesburg in 2002, Mozambique needs to monitor the ecological state of the river, including the estuary. A monitoring system has to be established that can evaluate the environmental fresh water requirements based on appropriate indicators that reflect the health of the Incomati estuary. The estuary of the Incomati has important ecological functions but it also is an important socio-economic resource. Local communities depend on the estuary's natural resources. Modifications of the river flow regime by upstream developments impact on the productivity of the estuary, diminishing fish and shrimp production, reducing biomass of natural vegetation such as grasses, reeds and mangroves and increasing salt intrusion. A decrease in estuary productivity consequently affects the incomes and living conditions of these communities. Based on an understanding of the effects of different pressures on the estuary ecosystem some indicators for monitoring the environmental state of the estuary are suggested, including the extent and vitality of mangrove forests. This latter indicator is further elaborated in the paper. Remote sensing techniques were used to identify and quantify mangrove forests in two selected areas of the estuary (Xefina Pequena Island and Benguelene Island). Five satellite images covering a period of 20 years (1984-2003) showed that the area covered by non-degraded mangroves significantly decreased on both islands, by 25% in Xefina Pequena Island and 40% in Benguelene Island. Moreover, the study of biomass reflection using NDVI also showed a significant decline in biomass densities over the last 20 years. Possible causes of these changes are reviewed: natural rainfall trends, modifications of the river flow regime, and increasing harvesting levels of mangrove woods. The findings presented in this paper show that mangrove forests are relevant indicators of the state of the estuary. which can be assessed by means of remote sensing techniques. Follow-up research is required that will establish the relative importance of the causal factors on the vitality of the estuarine mangrove forests. It is concluded that remotely sensed images may provide important data for an environmental monitoring system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, cloud free satellite images on the scale of 1 : 50,000. from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite IRS-ID and IRS-IC were used. The iotal area of mangroves in Mumbai suburban region has been estimated to be 56.40 km(2) (including mud flats) with dense mangroves contributing 45.4% to the total. During 1990 to 2001, a total mangrove area of 36.54 km(2) was lost, indicating a 39.32% decrease in the area of mangroves. It has been observed that the quantitative degradation of mangrove vegetation is largely due to burgeoning population pressure, construction and development activities, conversion to agricultural land and fish farms besides the effect of industrial effluents. Avicennia marina was found to be the most dominant mangrove species.

Punta Mala Bay was chosen for this study, due to its social importance and its biological significance, as it is one of the few mangrove areas left around Panama City. Fieldwork confirmed the importance of Laguncularia racemosa in the bay, which formed nearly monospecific stands with a large number of seedlings indicating that the forest was rejuvenating. The mangrove was mapped from 1980 to 2002 using digitised aerial photographs and a GIS was used to determine the location and rates of mangrove growth and loss before and after the construction of a road and water treatment works in 1998. The land use maps were produced with an overall accuracy of 83.8%. The user's accuracy of the maps for L. racemosa dominated stands was 89.7%, although the producer's accuracy was lower due to the omission of seedlings on intertidal areas. It was found that the mangrove was spatially dynamic and had grown substantially in the bay at a rate ranging from 6 to 215% per year until the construction commenced. Between 1997 and 2002 there were 100% loss of mangrove in some areas due to the coastal development. The resilience of the dominant species L. racemosa at this locality was shown by the continued growth of two mangrove zones during the construction period 1997-2002, with one zone increasing in area by 61%. The pioneering ability of L. racemosa after disturbance was demonstrated by the development of two new mangrove zones of 498 and 1254 m(2) on bare intertidal areas after construction finished. Future mapping and fieldwork could provide information on the development of mangrove communities and their response to reoccurring human impacts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Local ethnobotanical uses of the mangrove forest and local perceptions about the status and recent development of the mangrove forest cover are also analyzed. The results of interviews with 54 inhabitants of four fishing villages in the study area indicated that, overall, Laguncularia racemosa is the most frequently used species in this region of the Mexican Pacific coast, where it serves as firewood and a construction material, particularly for walls and fences. The next-ranked species were Avicennia germinans, which is used for tea, and Rhizophora mangle, which is used for tanning; both these species also serve medicinal purposes. There was a discrepancy between the assessment of actual changes in the mangrove cover and what people perceived them to be. These findings are discussed from a socioeconomic ( utilization) and an ecological ( functionality) point of view and in relation to the use of remote sensing as a tool. The utilization pattern is also discussed against the background of mangrove cover variation.

Adverse impacts on terrestrial and oceanic environments often compound in the intertidal area, where mangrove forest ecosystems thrive. In tropical coastal areas of many developing countries where people depend on wood and other mangrove forest products and services, forest degradation leads to socioeconomic problems. At the same time, increasing freshwater needs in these areas are expected to cause additional problems [3-5]. On the basis of remote sensing and ground truthing complemented by colonial archival material from the Dutch East India Company (1602-1800), we report that changes to the historic system of inland freshwater management have increased dramatically in recent times. Hydrological changes, such as interbasin transfers, have resulted in a qualitative ecological and socioeconomic degradation in three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka. Variations in river hydrology have caused changes in the areas suitable as mangrove habitat and, thus, have resulted in an altered distribution. However, increases in mangrove area can mask the degradation of the site in terms of floristic composition, significance of the species, and biodiversity (this effect is termed "cryptic ecological degradation"). It is important that such changes be carefully monitored to ensure biological and socioeconomic sustainability.

ZONING AND MONITORING DOMINANT MANGROVE COMMUNITIES OF A PART OF THE MARINE NATIONAL PARK, GULF OF KACHCHH	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Mangroves of the Marine National Park constitute the second largest patch of mangroves in Gujarat, extending up to 11,000 ha, comprising six species of mangroves. Earlier studies carried out using remote sensing data pertained to baseline data generation and mapping and monitoring the mangroves (density-wise) of the Park from 1975 to 1993. Using IRS 1C/1D LISS III data (1998-2001) supported by ground data, the distribution of different mangrove communities in the Park has been attempted. Amongst various image-processing techniques, band ratioing followed by supervised classification gave the best result (classification accuracy was 92%). Avicennia community is the most dominant community accounting for more than 70% of the area. The Rhizophora community occupies the inward margins of the creeks and the Ceriops community is present in the interior regions. The ecotone between the marsh and mangrove communities has been identified as the transitional mangroves (Avicennia alba, Sueada), representing the transition from the less saline mangrove to the highly saline marsh community. The zoning of the mangroves has also helped in assessing the diversity of the region. Based on the richness of species, three areas, namely Bhains Bid, North-east Dide Ka Bet and South-east Chhad Island have been identified as highly diverse (most suitable area for preservation).

Remotely sensed images from close to 1990 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor and 2000 Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor and geographic information system (GIS) technologies are applied to discern changes in land cover and land use along the mainland Tanzania coast. Change detection results show that urban land area has increased dramatically. Mangrove forest area declined modestly, but field verification shows severe deterioration of their conditions near urban areas. While the area of dense woodland decreased, the area of open woodland and the area of woodland interspersed with agriculture increased.

Excluding the dead areas, an overall estimated mangrove LAI value of 1.81 was ascertained for the 71 km 2 of mapped mangrove forest. Although the results do suggest the technique as a very rapid and effective method for monitoring the condition of mangroves at the species level, potential limitations are also discussed.

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential distance of dispersal of Rhizophora mangle propagules by comparing deposition density with landscape characteristics of mangrove forests. Propagule density was estimated at various distances to mangrove sources (R. mangle) on beaches in southwestern Florida in both high-and low-energy environments, either facing open gulf waters vs. sheltered, respectively. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems were used to identify source forests and to determine their landscape characteristics (forest size and distance to deposition area) for the regression analyses. Our results indicated that increasing density of propagules stranded on beaches was related negatively to the distance of the deposition sites from the nearest stands of R. mangle and that deposition was greatly diminished 2 kin or more from the source. Measures of fragmentation such as the area of the R. mangle forests were related to propagule deposition but only in low-energy environments. Our results suggest that geographic models involving the colonization of coastal mangrove systems should include dispersal dynamics at mid-range scales, i.e., for our purposes here, beyond the local scale of the forest and up to 5 kin distant. Studies of mangrove propagule deposition at various spatial scales are key to understanding regeneration limitations in natural gaps and restoration areas. Therefore, our study of mid-range propagule dispersal has broad application to plant ecology, restoration, and modeling.

For each plot, two values of LAI were calculated to represent approximate half radii (180) ground coverage of 8 m and 15 m. The location of each plot was recorded at sub-meter accuracy using an Ashtech SCA-12 GPS. Using a geometrically corrected IKONOS satellite image, the mean values for both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the simple ratio (SR) vegetation indices were also calculated for each plot. Regression analyses of the in situ LAI with both vegetation indices revealed significant positive relationships (LAI versus NDVI at 8 m (R(2) = 0.71); LAI versus NDVI at 15 m (R(2) = 0.70); LAI versus SR at 8 m (R(2) = 0.73); LAI versus SR at 15 m (R(2) = 0.72)) at the 8 m and 15 m plot sizes. Standard errors, derived from the testing of the regression models with a random sample, revealed little difference between the models. Moreover, F-tests of the residual variances also indicated no significant difference between the SR and NDVI models at both plot sizes. Consequently, the results indicate that each model could be used to successfully predict LAI. It is thus suggested that high spatial resolution IKONOS data can be employed as a valuable tool for monitoring LAI in less than ideal mangrove forests (i.e. disturbed stands). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Its purpose is the storage and evaluation of the heterogeneous datasets of the interdisciplinary scientific research program MADAM (Mangrove Dynamics and Management), which aims to develop recommendations for a tailored integrated coastal management scheme for the mangrove ecosystem at Braganca (North Brazil). The article describes the integration of remote sensing data, aerial photographs, as well as point data provided by fieldwork from different scientific fields. Using various innovative processing techniques and different scale-resolution levels, an assessment of temporal-spatial changes of the mangrove peninsula and the adjacent rural socioeconomic impact area, the type of mangrove structure, as well as a land-use cover analyses was undertaken. The definition of the spatial level of detail was found to be a major issue in the development of the GIS, as well as during the processing and analysis procedures. A division between strong and weak patterns in the mangrove ecosystem could be made, which implies different management measures and sets of specific interdisciplinary studies and monitoring at hierarchical scales.

A correspondence function is established between in situ optical data and SPMC measurements obtained from three coastal surveys on the Kaw River, the Mahury estuary, and the adjacent continental shelf, respectively. This function is applied to SPOT satellite images to estimate SPMC distributions near the sea surface on five dates between 1998 and 2001. Two typical situations have been observed: the mud suspensions are generally confined near the coast by a strong north-westward coastal current, while in one case (SPOT scene of 2 July 200 1) the turbid plumes, probably resulted from the wave action on the mud banks, are directed seaward. SPMC varies from more than 300 mg l(-1) adjacent to the intertidal zone to a few mg l(-1) offshore. Turbid plumes are observed downstream, with regard to the Guyana Current, of small islands along the coast. Mud undulations are observed on the emergent surface of the mudflats, parallel to the crest waves and characterized by a wavelength of 200-1000 m. These structures are interpreted to form by wave action on the soft mudflat surface. Mangrove colonization of the mudflat follows these primary topographic structures. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Remote sensing estimates of sediment yield from mangrove shoreline erosion by wave attack during the similar to 30-year periods when offshore Amazon mudbanks are not adjacent to a 30-40 km long section of the shoreline are 6-23 million tons year(-1). Be-7, Cs-137, and Pb-210 inventories in sediment cores from inner (< 5 m water depth) mudbank areas suggest the mangrove erosion occurs primarily during the January-April period of high wave energy, and is responsible for the bulk of sediment deposition on the leading edge of the mudbank. Remote sensing estimates of shoreline accretion associated with onshore flux of sediment from a mudbank are also large (8-26 million tons year(-1)). Radiotracer-generated strata age relationships indicate that the lower intertidal zone of the leading (depositional) edge of the mudbank is a relict surface, suggesting the offshore mudbank is decoupled from the shoreline. Water column profiles and radiochemical signatures point to fluid mud suspensions (10-400 g l(-1)) as the primary mechanism for delivering sediment across the relict intertidal zone to create the accretion at the shoreline. If the estimates of sediment volume involved in shoreline accretion and erosion in the studied area are extrapolated along the entire 1400-km-long Guianas coastline possessing offshore mudbanks, the annual exchange of sediment to and from the mangrove fringe is at least equivalent to the average input of new sediment from the Amazon.

A case study based on remote sensing data analyses and field surveys	MARINE GEOLOGY					Symposium on the Guiana Coast and Other Mangrove-fringed Shorelines held at the 8th French Sedimentological Congress	NOV, 2001	Orleans, FRANCE	Assoc French Sedimentologists				The mobile mud banks, several kilometres wide and about 30 km long, which form the sedimentary environment of the coast of the Guianas are a consequence of the huge particulate discharge of the Amazon. These mud banks shift towards the northwest, influenced by the combined action of accretion and erosion, a process also affected by periodic variability. Because of this movement, the coastline is unstable and continuously changing. Such changes determine the structure and composition of mangrove forests, the only type of vegetation adapted to this dynamic environment. The objectives of this study were to identify coastal changes that took place over the last 50 years, and to relate them to natural processes of turnover and replenishment of mangrove forests. These objectives have been achieved through a combination of remote sensing techniques (aerial photographs and SPOT satellite images) and field surveys in the area of the Sinnamary Estuary, French Guiana. Ground data were collected in representative mangrove forest stands, chosen as a function of their growth stages and their structural features, from pioneer and young stages to adult, mixed and declining formations. The coastline changes and the mangrove dynamics over the 1951-1999 period are analyzed through production of synthetic digital maps, showing an alternation of net accretion (1951-1966) and erosion periods (1966-1991), followed by the present accretion phase. Based on this structural, functional and historic, information, a global scenario of mangrove forest dynamics is proposed, including a model of forest development, forest gap processes and sedimentological dynamics. The results of this research are discussed within the context of regional (coastal Amazonian area) and global climate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bird, M; Chua, S; Fifield, LK; Teh, TS; Lai, J				Bird, M; Chua, S; Fifield, LK; Teh, TS; Lai, J			Evolution of the Sungei Buloh-Kranji mangrove coast, Singapore	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The mangroves from Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to Kranji Dam represent the largest intact mangrove forest left on mainland Singapore. Mangroves colonized the area around 6820 BP, as sea level rose following the last glacial maximum and a variable thickness of Holocene sands, muds and peats (generally similar to1 to >3.8 m thick) were deposited over the pre-transgression land surface. An analysis of a time series of photographs covering the period from 1946 to 2001 has revealed major changes in the distribution of mangroves in the area resulting from development-induced changes in the local hydrodynamic regime and clearance for aquaculture. Mangroves covered 117.3 ha in the study area in 1946 and were actively advancing over the coastal mudflats until 1980. Despite the addition of 6.24 ha from mangrove colonization, the total area covered by mangroves was reduced by similar to50% by 1980 due to clearance for aquaculture. Following 1980, a reduction in sediment supply possibly due to the construction of the Kranji Dam, immediately cast of the study area, led to the initiation of erosion along much of the coastline, with the mangrove fringe having retreated by up to 50 m in 2001. Establishment of the wetland reserve in 1992 enabled the partial regeneration of mangroves in the area to 86.8 ha, 25% less than in 1946. Three areas of undisturbed old growth mangroves >55 years in age have been identified and are considered to be of high conservation value. Two of these areas are within the current boundaries of the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but are located along coastal areas that are undergoing severe erosion. The third area is located in the south of the study area, protected from coastal erosion, but outside the current nature reserve boundary and hence is susceptible to loss as a result of future development. This third area is possibly the oldest undisturbed fragment of mangrove forest on mainland Singapore. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on on-screen visual interpretation techniques various land use and land cover classes have been mapped and classified. An attempt has been made to analyse changes in the mangrove forest cover from 1994 to 2001 using IRS-IB LISS-II and IRS-1D LISS-III data. An increase in the mangrove vegetation in the important estuaries has been found during 1994 and 2001. During this period, the mangrove forest increased by 44.90 per cent as a result of increased protection and consequent regeneration. Plantation of mangrove species has been raised in 876 ha (1985 to 1997) by the State Forest Department.																	0255-660X					JUN	2004	32	2					167	174		10.1007/BF03030873								WOS:000208265500005						
J	Lass, LW; Prather, TS				Lass, LW; Prather, TS			Detecting the locations of Brazilian pepper trees in the everglades with a hyperspectral sensor	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Brazilian pepper is a small evergreen tree that forms dense colonies. It was introduced for horticultural use in the United States in the early 1800s and was widely distributed in Florida in the late 1920s. Previous remote-sensing projects to detect Brazilian pepper achieved moderate success and warranted additional research using a hyperspectral sensor. Detection with remote sensing is desirable because complete access to ground survey crews is not practical. The western half of the Everglades National Park was imaged at a 5-m spatial resolution with a hyperspectral sensor by Earth Search Sciences Inc. of Kalispell, MT, on December 12, 2000, and January 10, 2001. The sensor has 128 channels and spectral resolution between 450 and 2,500 nm. The purpose of this research was to develop spectral reflectance curves for Brazilian pepper and establish the accuracy of classified images. Classified images showed that a hyperspectral sensor could detect a "pure" Brazilian pepper pixel representing the center of an infestation but not "mixed" Brazilian pepper pixels at the sparsely populated edges. To define the sparse populations, images were classified using a spatial buffer (15- to 100-m radius) based on a low-omssional error image. A 25-m buffer reduced the amount of commissional error for Brazilian pepper in mangrove-dominated forest to 8.2% and buttonwood-dominated forest to 0%. Wider buffers did not significantly improve image accuracy when compared with the 25-m buffer distance. Results indicate that removal crews using hyperspectral images will be able to reliably find the colonies of Brazilian pepper but will not be able to use the images to find isolated scattered trees.

The land-water interface comprising of coastal zone is modified all the time by oceanic currents, waves and tidal oscillations. The sediments are brought into the creeks from the erosion prone open coast beaches as well as through small rivers and inlets, and dispersed and deposited along the coast. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) due to its repetitive, multi-spectral and synoptic nature provides a unique view to recognize various features on land and sea. SRS techniques can be of great help in collection of continuous wave currents, wind, tides, suspended matter, shallow water area, wetlands, mangroves, mudflats and other coastal features and coastal changes, like land accretion or erosion. Therefore, a study has been undertaken to monitor geomorphological changes along the coast of Karachi using multi-temporal Landsat MSS and TM data from 1978 to 1998. SRS data were processed using interactive digital image processing/enhancement techniques like colour enhancement, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and by Colour draping techniques and different enhanced products of the area have been prepared. The multi-temporal PC analysis results were integrated with each other and with navigational map of the area by GIS technique. The geomorphological changes occurring at the middle part of the coast of Karachi along Bundal and Buddo Islands and in Korangi-Phitti Creek area were delineated. The integrated techniques applied on multi-temporal SRS data in this study were found very useful for monitoring and mapping the land accretion and erosion processes. The analyses provided the old as well as the most recent data base of coastal environmental conditions of the study area, which may led for better understanding of coastal processes and help for planning reclamation work in this area.

We present a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the degradation of vegetation structure and dynamics of mangrove communities over a period of 25 yr, using aerial photography in a geographical information system (GIS), combined with ground-truth data for different vegetation layers, and with faunal and environmental factors. Retrospective analysis and understanding of current practices were aided by interviews with Gazi village elders and by field observations of mangrove tree stumps. GIS-based vegetation maps were combined with data obtained using the point-centred quarter method (PCQM), an accuracy analysis was performed, and forestry parameters were derived from the resultant PCQM data. In addition to general human-induced degradation of vegetation structure and floristic composition of the seaward mangrove zone, a particular sandy beach is expanding at the expense of mangrove, whereas the back mangrove zone has undergone minor changes. Aerial photographs of 1992 and current field data show an apparent zonation of 6 different monospecific or mixed mangrove communities, with a high importance of Rhizophora mucronata in each community and each vegetation layer. Retrospective vegetation structure was combined with correspondence analyses on the PCQM data derived for adult, young and juvenile trees in order to make predictions. Present dynamics initiated by anthropogenic degradation of mangroves continues, even though human impact has diminished. We predict that under a 'no impact scenario', the sandy ridge will continue to expand, that this will speed up under a 'mangrove cutting scenario', and that a scenario altering the complex topography will lead to a major re-organisation of the mangrove and terrestrial vegetation structure.

The spatial information on LFs is first extracted in the coherence image, where they are wider and more visible: water regions (in particular thin internal channels) are dark areas (low coherence) due to the temporal decorrelation of backscattering signals in these and surrounding regions, whereas conventional vegetation regions are brighter areas (high coherence). These approximate locations of Us are further refined by using the edge map coming from a semantic fuzzy fusion of the coefficient of variation (CV) and the ratio of local means (RLM) measured in the amplitude image. The final detection of LFs is then. performed by merging the two fuzzy inputs: the spatial information and the edge location map. The membership degree statistics of CV and RLM semantic fusion measures are introduced in order to illustrate the location detection ability. The originality of this method in comparison with conventional approaches is in the fusion scheme that follows the interpreter behavior by using first the coherence image for a fuzzy detection where thin Us are more visible, but have low location accuracy, and then the amplitude image where they are poorly visible, but with higher location accuracy, to obtain improved results. A quantitative performance evaluation is also presented. The method has been applied on real interferometric SAR images from European Remote Sensing satellites over the western part of Cameroon.																	0196-2892					NOV	2003	41	11	1				2540	2556		10.1109/TGRS.2003.818383								WOS:000186572100012

This study indicates that remote sensing data can be used as a monitoring tool to assess the effectiveness of restoration and conservation programmes of the mangrove wetland, where direct and regular physical monitoring is difficult due to marshy nature of the soil and presence of numerous tidal creeks and canals.																	0011-3891					SEP 25	2003	85	6					794	798										WOS:000185811100024

In this investigation, a RADARSAT1-1 C-HH SAR image acquired in 1998 was used for coastal mapping and land-cover assessment in the Braganca area, in the northern Brazil. The airborne GEMS 1000 X-HH radar image acquired in 1972 during the RADAM Project was also used for evaluating coastal changes occurring over the last three decades. The research has confirmed the usefulness of RADARSAT-1 image for geomorphological mapping and land-cover assessment, particularly in macrotidal man-rove coasts. It was possible to map mangroves, salt marshes, chenier sand ridges, dunes, barrier-beach ridges, shallow water morphologies and different forms of land-use. Furthermore, a new method to estimate shoreline changes based on the superimposition of vectors extracted from both sources of SAR data has indicated that the shoreline has been subjected to severe coastal erosion responsible for retreat of 32 km(2) and accretion of 20 km(2) resulting in a mangrove land loss of almost 12 km(2). In an application perspective, orbital and airborne SAR data proved to be a fundamental source of information for both geomorphological mapping and monitoring coastal changes in moist tropical environments.

J	Cohen, MCL; Lara, RJ				Cohen, Marcelo C. L.; Lara, Ruben J.			Temporal changes of mangrove vegetation boundaries in Amazonia: Application of GIS and remote sensing techniques	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The present work analyses a 25-year time series of radar and satellite images, and identifies areas with losses and gains of vegetation coverage along similar to 166 kmof Para's coastline (North Brazil) and in the inner parts of the Braganca peninsula. The geomorphology of this region has significantly changed in recent years. A result of these changes has been a retreat of the mangrove vegetation along the coastline, mainly due to landward sand migration, which covers the mudflat and asphyxiates the vegetation. Image analysis suggests that the loss of vegetation coverage has been the dominating process in the last 25 years, occurring on similar to 42% of the Braganca coastline and adjacent areas. Vegetation has remained stable along similar to 39% of the coastline, while mud sedimentation has allowed mangrove development along similar to 19% of it. On the other hand, during this period of time, mangroves have invaded 3.4 km(2) (similar to 38%) of the elevated herbaceous flats in the highest sectors of the Braganca peninsula. Despite other possible causes for mangrove death along the coastline, such as littoral drift currents or cyclical changes in coastal sediment dynamics, the invasion of mangrove into herbaceous elevated flats in the central peninsula cannot be attributed to these factors.

This process typically uses correction techniques to remove the influence of the water column on bottom reflectance, and to enable the accurate correction of the imagery for varying bathymetry. Such correction measures depend on reliable estimates of water column light attenuation. An investigation into the spatial variation in attenuation in a typical tropical region was undertaken. Measurements of gross spatial variations in downwelling attenuation around San Andres and Old Providence islands in the western Caribbean were made using a PAR sensor. Measurements of specific attenuation were also made for blue, green and red light using filters fitted to the sensor. High spectral resolution attenuation measurements were also made using a spectro radiometer. Results showed a four-fold variation in light attenuation in shallow littoral regions alone. Spectral attenuation measurements suggested that this variation was largely the result of scattering by particulate matter rather than varying concentrations of dissolved yellow substances. These findings suggest that the results of studies where single measurements of 'average' attenuation have been used to depth-correct remotely sensed imagery should be interpreted with a high degree of caution. The paper goes on to show that simple models can be empirically obtained where attenuation can be spatially predicted with confidence, based on the variables of water depth, distance to and size of mangrove beds, and distance to and size of towns. The models obtained showed high statistical significance, with 89% and 78% of the spatial variation in attenuation explained for San Andres and Old Providence, respectively. It is postulated that the use of such approaches for the estimation of attenuation will lead to more accurate depth correction and hence improved interpretation of remotely sensed imagery for littoral regions.

J	Held, A; Ticehurst, C; Lymburner, L; Williams, N				Held, A; Ticehurst, C; Lymburner, L; Williams, N			High resolution mapping of tropical mangrove ecosystems using hyperspectral and radar remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove ecosystems are in serious decline around the world and various initiatives are underway to assess their current coverage and loss in cover. These ecosystems occur as thin strips along coastlines or rivers and, due to the strong environmental gradients present, mangroves show high spatial variability along short transects. Remote sensing tools that offer high spatial resolution mapping and high information content are needed to provide good differentiation of the various mangrove zones and types. The added complexities of tropical atmospheric conditions provide further challenges in terms of the selection of sensors and image analysis methodologies. This paper explores the possibility of combining a high spatial/spectral resolution scanner, 'Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager' (CASI), with the airborne National Aeronautics & Space Administration's polarimetric radar, 'AlRSAR', for mapping and monitoring of mangrove estuaries. The Daintree River estuary in far North Queensland, Australia was chosen for this study due to its diversity of mangrove species. Imagery acquired by both the CASI airborne scanner (14 bands, 2.5 m pixel) and the AIRSAR (L- and P-band polarimetry, C-band interferometry, 10 in pixel) has been used to produce detailed maps of the mangrove zones in the estuary. The advantages and difficulties associated with multi-source data integration are investigated in this paper. While radar provides general structural information in relation to mangrove zonation, high-resolution hyperspectral scanners allow for finer-detailed analysis and green-biomass information. Classifications (maximum likelihood) of both the individual and integrated datasets are performed, with the latter producing more accurate results. Application of a hierarchical neural network classification is also explored, where the more general mangrove zones are separated first based on structural information, then species or specie-complexes are extracted in subsequent levels using spectral differences.

J	Shen, RP; Kheoruenromne, I				Shen, RP; Kheoruenromne, I			Monitoring land use dynamics in Chanthaburi Province of Thailand using digital remotely sensed images	PEDOSPHERE												A comprehensive method of image classification was developed for monitoring land use dynamics in Chanthaburi Province of Tailand. RS (Remote Sensing), GIS (Geographical Information System), GPS (Global Positioning System) and ancillary data were combined by the method which adopts the main idea of classifying images by steps from decision tree method and the hybridized supervised and unsupervised classification. An integration of automatic image interpretation, ancillary materials and expert knowledge was realized. Two subscenes of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images of bands 3, 4 and 5 obtained on December 15, 1992, and January 17, 1999, were used for image processing and spatial data analysis in the study. The overall accuracy of the results of classification reached 90%, which was verified by field check. Results showed that shrimp farm land, urban and traffic land, barren land, bush and agricultural developing area increased in area, mangrove, paddy field, swamp and marsh land, orchard and plantation, and tropical grass land decreased, and the forest land kept almost stable. Ecological analysis on the land use changes showed that more attentions should be paid on the effect of land development on ecological environment in the future land planning and management.																	1002-0160					MAY	2003	13	2					157	164										WOS:000186055900008

The coastal zone evolution is related to a submerging coast, coupled with falling relative sea level from 5,100 years B.P. and muddy flat progradation from riverine sediment supply. The Ajuruteua Beach has a flat, linear and elongated form and is bounded by ebb-tidal deltas. Based on relative tidal level, the barrier-beach ridge Was subdivided in three zones: supratidal zone, where are found dunes and berm, intertidal zone (high, mean and low intertidal zone) and subtidal zone. The Ajuruteua shoreline is subject to two distinct coastal processes and can be subdivided in two sectors: (1) Northwestern (NW) Sector, very vulnerable to shoreline recession with rates. of 2.21 m/month; and (2) Southeastern (SE) Sector, which remains stable or with shoreline accretion with rates of +1.46 m/month. The present beach use is marked by building displacement from shoreline to coastal dunes due owing severe coastal erosion in, the NW Sector. The risks of coastal hazards are related to shoreline change rating and the NW Sector is considered as a high risk area, while the SE Sector is considered as a moderate risk area. The coastal land use has not been regulated, and is occurring an unsustainable exploitation of the, natural landscape. In response to this beach settlement, the natural process of shoreline retreating has been an emergent coastal problem.

The resulting habitat loss highlighted the need for a comprehensive assessment of the extent, characteristics and use of the country's remaining mangrove. This paper reports on the resulting study, and confirms the presence of three true mangroves-Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa, plus one mangrove associate-Conocarpus erectus. Twenty different sub-communities are distinguished on the basis of physiographic setting, vegetation structure and species composition. Of these, Rhizophora scrub is the most widespread, accounting for over 60% of the country's mangrove habitats. True forest sub-communities account for only 10%, the remainder comprises thickets or hypersaline supra-tidal savannas. GIs analysis of 1990 remote sensing data reveals that Belize's mangroves covers 78,511 ha, equivalent to 3.4% of the country's land area and approximately 2% of the mangrove remaining in the Americas. Through the examination of early aerial photos, historical records and ground conditions, it is estimated that about 98% of Belize's original mangrove cover (80,016 ha) remained at this time. However, more recent mapping for the Belize City area, using 1992 aerial photos, reveals that a further 519 ha has been cleared, a 0.7% reduction in the national total in just two years. The main geographical factors controlling the distribution of mangroves in Belize are the presence of the barrier reef, the coastline's shallow gradient and the narrow tidal range. Mangrove distribution is further influenced by local subsidence, geomorphology, drainage, hinterland soils and past hurricane tracks. How much mangrove cover Belize may support in the future is thought to largely depend on two factors-hurricane activity and human influence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Diaz, BM; Blackburn, GA				Diaz, BM; Blackburn, GA			Remote sensing of mangrove biophysical properties: evidence from a laboratory simulation of the possible effects of background variation on spectral vegetation indices	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A physical scale model of a mangrove canopy over different backgrounds was used in the laboratory to investigate the relationships between a number of spectral vegetation indices and LAI and percent canopy cover and the sensitivity of these indices to variations in background reflectance properties. High spectral resolution reflectance data were acquired from the experimental canopy and these were used to simulate the response in the red and NIR wavebands of the Landsat TM sensor. These data were then used to calculate NDVI, RVI, DVI, PVI, SAVI, SAVI(2), and TSAVI. Three derivative-based indices (1DL_DGVI, 1DZ_DGVI and 2DZ_DGVI) that measure the amplitude of the chlorophyll red edge were also calculated. Based on the correlation coefficients for both LAI and percent canopy cover, the effects of background variations were most pronounced for NDVI, SAVI and TSAVI, whereas SAVI(2) and RVI were moderately affected. The least affected spectral indices were DVI, PVI, 1DL_DGVI, 1DZ_DGVI and 2DZ_DGVI. The DVI appears to be the optimal spectral vegetation index for estimating the biophysical properties of mangroves which have variable background conditions because it had robust linear relationships with LAI and percent cover and it can be easily derived from commonly available broad band remotely sensed data.

J	Ruiz-Luna, A; Berlanga-Robles, CA				Ruiz-Luna, A; Berlanga-Robles, CA			Land use, land cover changes and coastal lagoon surface reduction associated with urban growth in northwest Mexico	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Coastal land use and land cover changes, emphasizing the alterations of coastal lagoons, were assessed in northwest Mexico using satellite imagery processing. Supervised classifications of a Landsat series (1973 - 1997) and the coefficients Kappa (K) and Tau (tau), were used to assess the area and verify the accuracy of the classification of six informational classes ( urban area, aquatic systems, mangrove, agriculture, natural vegetation, and aquaculture). Pixel-by-pixel change detection among dates was evaluated using the Kappa Index of Agreement (KIA). Besides the overall estimation of the aquatic systems class, variations in the three lagoons present in the study area were analyzed individually. Measures of agreement between the classification and reference data indicate that the accuracy for the classification ranked from moderate to high (K = 0.76 +/- 0.07; tau = 0.77 +/- 0.06). From 1973 to 1997 urban area has doubled, growing to the north and the northeast, extending mainly over natural vegetation and agricultural land. La Escopama and El Sabalo, two of the lagoons studied, reduced their size to less than half that estimated in 1973, but the main estuarine system in the study area, Estero de Urias - El Infiernillo, has maintained its area without noticeable changes. However, the surrounding landscape in Estero de Urias - Infiernillo is changing from natural vegetation and agriculture to urban land use. Consequently, to limit as much as possible changes in the area to natural causes, some management measures must be considered to design urban development plans and to recover and preserve the natural areas, on a broad scale rather than a local spatial scale.

J	Rankey, EC				Rankey, EC			Spatial patterns of sediment accumulation on a Holocene carbonate tidal flat, northwest Andros Island, Bahamas	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												To characterize spatial patterns of sedimentation and analyze the morphology of part of the modern tidal flats of northwest Andros Island in the Bahamas, this study integrated remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and carbonate sedimentology. The fundamental data are a Landsat TM image that has been classified to create a thematic map of eight subfacies, interpreted to represent a distinct tidal-flat subenvironment such as adjacent marine, exposed levee-beach ridge, pond, and algal marsh. Spatial statistics of the thematic map characterize the patterns of sediment accumulation. Quantitative analysis highlights several interesting results concerning subfacies character and distribution: (1) of the eight mapped subfacies, low algal marsh is most widespread, representing 27.5% of the total area, whereas exposed levee-beach ridge is the least widespread, accounting for 10% of the area; (2) the patches of different subfacies have different shape complexities, with low algal marsh, high algal marsh, and mangrove ponds being the least complex and exposed levee-beach ridge being the most complex; (3) Markov chain analysis suggests that lateral transitions between different subfacies are highly ordered; and (4) frequency distribution of subfacies patch area and lacunarity (gap size distribution) data exhibit power law relationships over several orders of magnitude, consistent with fractal characteristics. The fractal nature of patch size and gaps between facies illustrate that on this tidal flat neither the size nor the spatial distribution of subfacies has a characteristic scale. This statistical behavior is consistent with the presence of self-organization, or emergence of pattern in the absence of a template or external forcing. The statistical self-organization on the tidal flat is the cumulative expression of local processes, but it becomes apparent only through analysis of the whole system. These results are inconsistent with models suggesting that tidal flats include a migrating complex of randomly distributed, randomly sized subenvironments. Ancient successions that include random patterns may reflect the more pronounced influence of forces external to the sedimentary system, instead of an absence of those forces.

J	Almeida-Guerra, P				Almeida-Guerra, P			Use of SPOT images as a tool for coastal zone management and monitoring of environmental impacts in the coastal zone	OPTICAL ENGINEERING												Modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors leading toward the achievement of serious plans regarding coastal management. A multitemporal analysis of land use in certain areas of the Colombian Caribbean Coast is described. It mainly focuses on environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation of mangroves due to shrimp farming. Selection of sensitive areas, percentage of destroyed mangroves, possible endangered areas, etc., are some of the results of this analysis. Recommendations for a coastal management plan in the area have also resulted from this analysis. Some other consequences of the deforestation of mangroves in the coastal zone and the construction of shrimp ponds are also analyzed, such as the increase of erosion problems in these areas and water pollution, among others. The increase of erosion in these areas has also changed part of their morphology, which has been studied by the analysis of SPOT images in previous years. A serious concern exists about the future of these areas. For this reason new techniques like satellite images (SPOT) have been applied with good results, leading to more effective control and coastal management in the area. The use of SPOT images to study changes of the land use of the area is a useful technique to determine patterns of human activities and suggest solutions for severe problems in these areas.

J	Rankey, EC; Morgan, J				Rankey, EC; Morgan, J			Quantified rates of geomorphic change on a modern carbonate tidal flat, Bahamas	GEOLOGY												Comparison of aerial photographs and ultrahigh-resolution remote sensing data reveals changes in the geomorphology of a modern carbonate tidal flat. In the 58 yr between acquisition of the two data sets, several tidal channels have extended headward more than 100 m, channel bars have stabilized, the shoreline has eroded as much as 50 m, the inland algal marsh locally has prograded as much as 90 m, and many mangrove ponds have increased in size. These changes over the known time interval allow quantification of the rates of these geomorphic processes and suggest rates of migration of landforms to several meters per year. Some observed rates appear to be different than rates averaged over the past several thousand years, however, possibly because of changes in storm activity or circulation patterns. These data illustrate the dynamic nature of the entire coastal tidal-flat system, not just the shoreline, and reflect the system's response to factors including relative rises in sea level.

A minimum of 25 sample points, in which the vegetation was described and environmental factors (salinity, light intensity, land/water ratio, abundance of herbivorous crabs and snail abundance) were measured or estimated, were taken on each site. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to summarize the data bulk, to investigate the vegetation dynamics (e. g., comparability of species distribution in the three vegetation layers), and/or to link the vegetation data to the environmental factors. Results showed that species clusters were relatively easy to delineate, whether mangrove zonation was present or not. Among the environmental factors, the abundance of propagule predators (mostly sesarmid crabs) contributed significantly to the variation in vegetation and could be an explanatory parameter for the observed vegetation data in a majority of sites. In the site where it was not, the most important factor in the ordination was the land/water ratio, which is important at the ecological level as well (link between water level and vegetation dynamics). However, none of the environmental factors could successfully explain the total variability in the vegetation data suggesting that other, more determining factors exist. Our results further provide information on the dynamic or non-dynamic nature of a forest and on its ability to rejuvenate, and may contribute to appropriate forestry management guidelines in the future.

Six land-use classes were used as direct indicators of the landscape condition. Mangrove, lagoon, saltmarsh, dry forest, secondary succession, and agriculture were the categories selected to evaluate the changes by comparing four thematic maps (from 1973 to 1997). The accuracy of the classification (only in the 1997 scene) was calculated from an error matrix, using the overall accuracy assessment (70%) and the Kappa coefficient (0.61). Both values indicate that the agreement in the classification was moderate, but better than one obtained by chance. The analytical comparison of data sets (1973 vs. 1986, 1986 vs. 1990, and 1990 vs. 1997) was done by using a change detection matrix and the Kappa coefficient. Agreement between data sets varied from 61% to 68%, all moderate but enough to determine the general trends of change in the system. These are mainly typified as loss of natural cover (especially dry forest) and the fragmentation of the landscape, with agricultural activities and their subsequent effects (secondary succession, modification of drainage patterns) the main transforming agents.

These banks are composed of fine clay sediments originating from the Amazon River. In November 1998, field work was carried out on the Mahury River to measure the water colour and the concentration of suspended particles in surface water. An increase of the remote sensing reflectance due to high concentration of mineral particles was observed. The Mahury River survey (November 1998). together with an oceanographic survey onboard the ANTEA vessel (PRECHICO cruise, April 1999), enabled us to identify several classes of remote sensing reflectance spectra characterizing the continental shelf between Cayenne and the Brazil frontier: (1) light blue waters above the shelf break: (2) low salinity dark brown waters above the continental shelf. originating from the Amazon River (3) green waters above the 20-m isobath and (4) beige waters close to the coast and in the rivers mouths. The normalized water leaving radiances (nLw) computed from these spectra in the spectral bands of SeaWiFS are examined. The standard OC2 performs poorly in retrieving chlorophyll front the reflectance data because of the relatively high suspended particulate matter concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Land cover maps from 1956 and 1998 were co-registered and rasterized to the same spatial resolution in a geographic information system (GIS) and the land cover classes of both maps aggregated to a new common legend. Classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper images and field checking were used to generate the 1998 map. Comparisons between the two dates indicate that major changes have occurred in the Cacheu area, both in the extent and the spatial distribution of some vegetation classes, with decreases in areas of mangrove, dry forest and palm grove, and large increases in mudflats and savanna. In Orango, changes are less extensive, but the onset of some of the trends verified in Cacheu can be identified. The results are interpreted, taking into account land use practices in the two study regions, and will hopefully become a management and conservation tool for the local park authorities.

New figures have been given for the mangroves of each concerned country especially for Myanmar. The present ecological status of mangrove ecosystems in the three major deltas, the Godavari, the Ganges and the Irrawaddy are totally distinct. In the Godavari delta (India) mangroves are receding in area and biomass; in the Ganges, the Sunderbans (India and Bangladesh) are evolving very slowly in size but an important species substitution is in progress; in the Irrawaddy (Myanmar) mangroves are in continuous decline. The present distribution and status of each mangrove type is the result of direct and indirect anthropic factors, Conversion to agriculture, reafforestation, fishponds constructions, forest exploitation are now easily detected from space. Conversely, indirect impacts, such as freshwater diversion or chemical pollution, cannot be monitored with sensors operating in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum.																	0379-5136					MAR	2002	31	1					9	20										WOS:000179482500001

The study indicates that there are at present 20 identified `mangrove species' (major and minor components) and at least 18 mangrove associates' along the south-western coast of the island, and addresses the importance of clearly defining these terms. Incorrect identifications in the past have adversely affected interpretation of species composition in the framework of biogeography, remote sensing and biological conservation and management.

Large database on spatial extent of mangroves and their condition has been created on 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scale using IRS data (the database provides information for the first time on the mangrove areas of the entire Indian coast). Based on this study, it was observed that the Kori creek, Gujarat, has large area under mangroves. The repetitive nature of the data has helped in monitoring vital and critical areas, periodically. In one such study, on the Marine National Park, in the Gulf of Kachchh, mangrove areas were monitored for the last 25 years. The degradation of mangroves continued up to 1985 and the condition significantly improved due to the adoption of conservation measures. This has helped in planning various management actions to conserve this vital ecosystem. IRS data have been used in identifying dominant plant communities in many mangrove areas such as Bhitarkanika, Coringa, Mandovi estuary in Goa and the Gulf of Kachchh, etc, This is a unique approach for providing spatial information at plant community level and can be seen as a first step towards bio-diversity assessment. Along with the mangroves, seaweed, seagrass beds and dune vegetation have also been mapped with reasonable accuracy. With the better sensors planned for future, remote sensing-based information is going to be one of the major inputs in the preparation of management action plans.																	0379-5136					DEC	2001	30	4					195	213										WOS:000173106900001

The Gulf of Fonseca has higher temperature and solar radiation, and lower precipitation, which can explain the higher structural development and species mixing of the Sierpe-Terraba mangrove. In the latter the transition between species or between heights in the same species is clear. The automatic classification made by the Geographic Information System (IDRISI) fits well the field mangrove distribution, but it was necessary to regroup some subdivisions that represent the same land use as identified by transects and an aerial video. Mixed species and clouds produced less satisfactory results in Sierpe-Terraba indicating a need for better satellite image resolution.																	0034-7744					DEC	2001	49			2			331	340										WOS:000177446100033	15264547

This data source is now more accessible because of improvements in digitizing technology. Internet file transfer, and availability of image processing software. We present three examples of conservation-related projects that benefited from the use of astronaut photographs. First, NASA scientist requested that astronauts photograph the area of the controversial Isahaya Bay reclamation project in Japan. Japanese researches used photograph from before and after the reclamation as a tool for communication with the public about the effects of tidal-flat loss. The newly acquired images and the availability of high-resolution digital images from NASA archives provided timely public information on the observed changes. Second, we digitally classified and analyzed a Space Shuttle photograph of Chobe National Park in Botswana to identify the locations of woodlands affected by elephants. Field validation later confirmed that area identified on the image showed evidence of elephant damage. Third, we used a summary map from intensive field surveys of seagrasses in Shoalwater Bay, Australia, as reference data for a supervised classification of a digitized photograph taken from orbit. The classification distinguished seagrasses, sediments and mangroves with accuracy approximating that in studies using other satellite remote-sensing data. Astronaut photographs are in the public domain, and the database of nearly 400,000 photographs from the late 1960s to the present is available as a single searchable location on the Internet (http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop). These photographs can be used by conservation biologists as a source of general information about the landscaped and for quantitative mapping.

It is important, therefore, that fishery managers obtain accurate estimates of the extent of these habitats. This study investigated three methods of estimating the linear extent and area of mangroves ( commercially available topographic data, aerial photographs and Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery) in two regions in northern Australia: the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf ( in particular, the Berkeley and Lyne Rivers) with typically narrow fringes of mangroves (<50 m wide), and the Embley River on Cape York Peninsula, with much broader mangrove stands (50-1000 m wide). Ground-truthing verified that aerial photographs provided the most accurate estimates of extents of mangroves in all rivers, because of their high spatial resolution (2 m). Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery gave good estimates of the area of habitats, but, because of the 30 m pixel resolution, it underestimated the linear extent in places where the mangrove fringe was narrow. Topographic data gave good estimates of the extent of mangroves where the forests were more extensive and less linear in shape, but were very poor otherwise at this scale. These findings have implications for the use of remote sensing techniques in ecological studies in these regions.

J	Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R				Chauvaud, S; Bouchon, C; Maniere, R			Thematic mapping of tropical marine communities (coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves) using SPOT data in Guadeloupe Island.	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												In the framework of a comprehensive study of the coastal marine ecosystems of Guadeloupe Island (French West Indies), a remote sensing survey of marine communities was conducted in the Bay of the Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin. Pictures of SPOT satellite were used. At first sight, XS data from SPOT did not seem to be well adapted to extract information from deepest underwater areas. In the present study, a method for analysis of XS data was developed, which increases tenuous spectral differences associated to very low intensity signals. This technique led to a better distinction of objects, even the deepest ones. Reference surfaces were then identified in the field and a reliable supervised classification was conducted, which reflected the high diversity of ecological themes (up to 32) of the area to 20 m depth. A total of 23 700 ha of biota was clearly identified. Mangrove covered up to 2 700 ha. Submerged areas were constituted of 15 700 ha of soft bottoms and 3 800 ha of hard substrate bottoms. On the coral reefs, flourishing coral communities accounted only for 113 ha (11.2%). This result enhances the alarming situation of these communities in Guadeloupe. Finally, seagrass beds took up to 8 200 ha (i.e. 42% of the total sublittoral area, 58% of soft bottom substrates). This ecosystem revealed to be of primary importance within the studied area and particular attention was paid to seagrass beds of Thalassia rest testudinum. Twelve themes were retained to describe them, based on the coverage rate of the substratum by the plants and the type of the sediment colonised. The final document expresses well the high complexity of the studied area. This map constitutes a reference of the present status of the coastal benthic communities of the 'Grand Cul-de-Sac Marin' and can be useful for scientists and the administrative managers of that area.

Aerial photographs constitute a most valuable tool to study the dynamics of mangrove forests on a typology basis. They usually constitute the only retroactive basis of comparison to actual mangrove vegetation data. In the present study the dynamics of a mangrove area in southern Sri Lanka, namely Galle (06 degrees 01'N, 80 degrees 13'E), was investigated using sequential aerial photographs (1956, 1974 and 1994). To identify species or genera from aerial photographs a reliable determination key based on photographic features is needed. For the purpose of this study, a key proposed by Verheyden et al. (submitted) was used. Identification of species and genera from aerial photographs and a study of vegetation dynamics revealed that four sectors, each characterized by a particular vegetation dynamic, could be identified. Characteristic changes in these sectors consisted of either minor changes in composition, mangrove area increase or decrease, or major structural change. Furthermore, the results show that a dynamic interaction between mangroves and Cocos nucifera stands exists in the area. Ground truthing in each of the mangrove sectors confirmed the aerial photography interpretations. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of field data on adult, young and juvenile trees result in a prediction of a transition of the Excoecaria dominated mangrove to a Bruguiera dominated one in one part, and an evolution towards a terrestrial vegetation elsewhere. These results point at fundamental floristic and structural changes in the mangroves of Galle, in a time scale of decades, both when comparing to the past and when predicting the future.

Videography, a cheap, simple and flexible airborne remote sensing technique, was used for derivation of relief. A hand-held Hi 8 camera and a small aeroplane were used to collect video data of a 1300 m x 320 m strip of beach and foredune area on Ameland (the Netherlands). Simultaneously, the ground control points (GCPs) were measured with laser electronic distance measurement (EDM) equipment. A series of overlapping frames was grabbed, contrast-stretched and corrected for interlacing effects. The resulting images were processed with software that has some photogrammetric capabilities, R-WEL's Desktop Mapping System (DMS). The images and the positions of the GCPs enabled computation of the camera orientation, and allowed for image rectification and stereo correlation. Stereo pairs form the basis for anaglyphs, which give a perception of height. In addition, the parallax in the stereo pairs allows a derivation of quantitative height information. Some of the derived height values are, however, incorrect. This was due to inaccuracies in the camera technology and the use of photogrammetric software that was not designed principally to process video imagery.

This system produces false color imagery similar to that of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bands 5,4,3. Imagery from this system was useful for differentiating among a variety of land-use types including plant species, soil surface conditions, and water. Computer analysis of the imagery showed that many of the ecological variables could be quantified. An accuracy assessment performed on the classified image showed an overall accuracy of 82.4%. The imagery was also useful for interpreting the coarser resolution TM. Ground radiometric reflectance measurements were made of various ecological parameters to assist in interpreting the imagery.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	1999	15	4					1145	1150										WOS:000083470300026

Ground truth data were used to assess vegetative change occurring in the 20 years since the report of Judd et al, (1977) on the vegetation of South Padre Island. Estimates of total cover by ground truth and remote sensing techniques were similar (2.45% difference) on South Padre Island. Thus, airborne multispectral digital videography is an effective technique for assessing changes in total vegetative cover of Texas barrier islands. This technique will be an effective tool for documenting changes in total cover on barrier islands due to natural perturbations such as hurricanes and human disturbances including vehicular traffic. Imagery obtained at altitudes of 200 m or greater did not permit discrimination of dominant species in each of an island's topographic zones. However, acquisition of imagery at a time of the year when dominant species are in specific phenological stages, such as flowering, and at a lower altitude may facilitate their recognition. Comparison of data from a single trans-island transect in 1997 with data from three trans-island transects and 18 transects across the foreshore, backshore, and primary dunes in 1977 suggests that there has been a marked decrease in species richness of the backshore and primary dune zones of South Padre Island. There also was a change in dominant species in the backshore zone. These changes in species richness and dominance may be largely attributable to vehicular traffic in these zones.																	0038-4909					SEP	1999	44	3					261	271										WOS:000082891200003						
J	Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD				Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD			The cost-effectiveness of remote sensing for tropical coastal resources assessment and management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Although coastal habitat mapping is expensive, remote sensing is a more cost-effective technique than alternative field-survey methods (where effectiveness is defined as overall map accuracy), Satellite imagery is suitable for coarse detail habitat mapping where overall accuracies of c. 70% can be achieved but is inadequate for fine detail mapping, achieving c. 40% accuracy. Four types of cost are encountered when undertaking remote sensing: (1) set-up costs, (2) field survey costs, (3) image acquisition costs and (4) the time spent on analysis of field data and processing imagery. The largest of these are set-up costs such as the acquisition of hardware and software which may comprise 48-78% of the total cost of the project depending on specific objectives. For coarse-detail habitat mapping with satellite imagery, the second highest cost is field survey which can account for c. 20% of total costs and >80% of total costs if a remote sensing facility already exists. Field survey is a vital component of any habitat mapping programme and may constitute c. 70% of project duration. For mapping small coastal areas (<60 km in any direction) in coarse detail, SPOT XS is the most cost-effective satellite sensor but for larger areas Landsat TM is the most cost-effective and accurate sensor: Detailed habitat mapping should be undertaken using digital airborne scanners or interpretation of colour aerial photography (API). The cost of commissioning the acquisition of such imagery can be high [pound 15000-pound 27000 (US$24000-$43000) even for small areas of 150 km(2)] and may constitute 27-40% of total costs (64-75% if set-up costs are excluded). Acquisition of digital airborne imagery is more expensive than the acquisition of colour aerial photography but is offset against the huge investment in time required to create maps from API. If habitat maps are needed urgently, API may be prohibitively time-consuming. For small areas of say 150 km2, a map could be created within 25 days using CASI but might take six times longer to create using API. We estimate that API is only cheaper if the staff costs for API are considerably less than pound 80 day(-1). As the scope of the survey increases in size, the cost of API is likely to rise much faster than that arising from digital airborne scanners. If the costs of API and digital airborne scanners are similar; the latter instruments should be favoured because they are likely to yield more accurate results than API. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

To this end, the area was mapped using SPOT-XS data, which made it possible to define the main ecodynamic tendencies of the mangroves before the development of the rearing ponds. The aim was then to implement fast, precise and reliable mapping methods, making it possible to follow mangrove alterations resulting from these aquaculture activities. Analysis of the radiometric behaviour of the various plant formations of the marsh, based on SIR-C radar data, revealed that the discrimination between these formations is easier when the frequency used is low and the polarization is crossed. Thematic analysis using textural classification was carried out with the L-band and polarization VH. The results generated are promising insofar as the mapping of mangroves is concerned with a fast treatment time and acceptable precision of the results.

In areas subject to humid tropical climate, such as the West Indies, cloud coverage often disturbs image acquisition by orbital imagery. Moreover, as these tropical coastal ecosystems, i.e., coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds, are intricate and geographically complex, high resolution data must be used to accurately restore these features. Digitized aerial photographs meet these requirements by providing higher-resolution images than orbital remote sensing devices. This paper reports on the method applied to map coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds in the Bay of Robert in Martinique Island (French West Indies) by digitizing true-colour aerial photographs. But, as these photographs present two drawbacks, i.e., they are not geographically oriented and their margins are distorted, a reference map was used to design a rectification model. Aerial photographs were first subjected to true-colour digitization. After separation of the red, green and blue bands, an unsupervised classification was achieved, then various masks each corresponding to a given range of depths were built and applied to the initial image. The new images obtained were analysed. Great care was taken in the selection of training sites to gather the pixels characterized by a high spectral similarity which corresponded to precise themes. After ground identification, these training sites enabled a supervized classification to be established, then a confusion matrix was built. The final map consisted of 31 themes. Each theme was related to a particular feature of the benthic communities. The error matrix and subsequent field samplings confirmed the reliability of the final map. In addition to their use in ecosystem studies, e.g., calculation of surface areas; biocoenosis distribution, etc., these thematic maps are of overriding importance for the management of coastal areas.																	0143-1161					DEC	1998	19	18					3625	3639		10.1080/014311698213858								WOS:000077774800010

Synoptic and repetitive coverage provided by orbiting satellites have opened up immense possibilities in terms of resource mapping, monitoring and management. The present study deals with the application of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies in the study of coastal ecology with special reference to mangroves. The coastal wetland ecology of Muthupet and Pichavaram has been studied by considering the changes in wetlands. Wetland maps were prepared on 1 :25,000 scale using high resolution SPOT (for the year 1989) and IRS LISS II data (for the years 1990,and 1996), Changes in coastal wetland ecology were studied by integrating remote sensing data with GIS. In Muthupet, about 86.77 m(2) of the mangrove forest have been reduced over a period of 7 years (1989 to 1996). Digital analysis of 1986 Landsat TM and 1993 IRS LISS II data showed that 0.36 km(2) area of mangrove in Pichavaram was lost over a period of 7 years. Ground-based spectral measurements of different mangrove species using field spectroradiometer showed highest spectral radiance between 0.7 and 1.1 mu m using radiometer of MSS bands and highest spectral reflectance in 0.69-0.86 mu m regions of IRS and TM band which could be used in identifying mangrove forest from other vegetation. In Andaman and Nicobar islands the total mangrove area is about 762 km(2) and degradation occurred only in very small pockets (up to 2.379 km(2)).																	0011-3891					AUG 10	1998	75	3					236	244										WOS:000075560000021

For the first time, the deltaic complex of Mahajamba bay has been surveyed, using SPOT 1 and SPOT 2 imagery. An intensive field survey together with complete aerial coverage at a scale of 1:40 000 were used for the validation of the digital classification. The accuracy of cartographic products and of vegetation changes is closely related both to the adopted image processing methods and to the season of satellite data acquisition. The main input of the present contribution is to provide precise descriptions and mapping of the mangroves in Madagascar using high resolution remote sensing technology to assess conspicuous changes. Some conspicuous limitations of satellite data have also been noted.

The examination of black and white aerial photographs of the forest in 1966, 1974, 1989 and 1995, and satellite images in 1985, 1990 and 1994 revealed that the mangrove forest located in the eastern bank of the bay was progressing over the mud flat. The rare of progression was estimated, from examination of changes in the position of the forest edge with time in the series of images, to average 38.6 m year(-1) over the 28-year interval encompassed by the images. Mangrove progression rates were fastest between 1966 and 1974 and slowest between 1974 and 1985, remaining uniform at about 30 m year(-1) thereafter. The in situ examination of vegetation along transects in the area of fastest mangrove progression showed an average progression rate of 53.12 +/- 5.86 m year(-1), quite similar to the estimate (48.4 m year(-1)) derived from remote sensing techniques for the area where the transects were surveyed. Avicennia alba was found to dominate the vegetation at the progressing edge of the mangrove, followed by Sonneratia caseolaris, with Rhizophora apiculata being present only occasionally. The fast colonization of A. alba over the mud flat was supported by a large export flux of mangrove propagules from the channels draining the mangrove forest, which averaged 3715 +/- 920 and 1900 +/- 808 fruits day(-1) in each of the channels examined. Extrapolation of the long-term mean mangrove progression rate observed along the eastern bank of the Pak Phanang Bay suggested that this mangrove forest will increase by 33 ha year(-1). These results provide evidence that natural mangrove colonization can be a rapid process if sufficient propagules of the pioneer species (A. alba and S. caseolaris) are available, and point, therefore, to alternative management plans to promote and enhance natural colonization processes.

The aims of this work are to describe the plant composition and structure of mangrove in the study area, and to evaluate the deforestation level and its amplitude by means of a retrospective analysis of the cover and distribution area of mangrove species using a LandsatTM image, aerial photographs and oblique video. Mangrove of the study area is dominated by Laguncularia racemosa with the average importance value of 158.18 and 400 ha of plant cover, followed by Avicennia germinans, with an average importance value of 138.52 and 324 ha of plant cover. Mangrove showed seven height and five diametrical classes that include the two dominant species. L. racemosa was the dominant species in six of the eight compass lines. The highest absolute frequencies for both dominant species were found in the second height class frequency, and the first diametric class frequency. Cover area and distribution of mangrove in the study area were mapped using a LandsatTM5 image(April 1993). A supervised classification was applied using the maximum likelihood algorithm, considering ten initial classes. This classification was evaluated by obtaining a classification error matrix and by assessing its accuracy. The mangrove vegetation area reported before, considering the same area for image analysis, resulted to be overestimated in 56% regarding the value obtained in our photointerpretation (1065 ha). From the latter mangrove area, the current cover is 724 ha, which represents a decrease of 32% in a 23-yr period.

It also shows how Geographic Information Systems, combined with remote sensing analysis, have the potential to assist in minimizing disease risk. Examples are used from subtropical Queensland, Australia, where the salt marsh mosquito, Aedes vigilax, and the freshwater species, Culex annulirostris, are vectors of human arbovirus diseases such as Ross River and Barmah Forest virus disease. Culex annulirostris is also implicated in the transmission of Japanese Encephalitis. Mapping the breeding habitats of the species facilitates assessment of the risk of contracting the diseases and also assists in control of the vectors. First, it considers a simple risk model that is applied to data for the city of Brisbane in southeast Queensland. This is then linked to computer-aided analysis of remotely sensed data to map potential ephemeral freshwater breeding sites of Cx. annulirostris. This has the potential to guide control at critical times, for example after heavy summer rainfall or when there is an outbreak of Ross River virus disease. Second, the use of color infrared aerial photography is used to identify the specific parts of the salt marsh in which larvae and eggs of Ae. vigilax are found. Finally. we explore novel ways to map the detailed pattern of water under mangrove forest canopy to identify where mosquitoes are breeding and as an aid to planning modification. For each we discuss the limitations and advantages and the possibilities for combining methods and/or using a single method for multiple objectives.

Landsat TM, SPOT XS and CASI data of mangroves from the Turks and Caicos Islands, were classified using each method. All classifications of SPOT XS data failed to discriminate satisfactorily between mangrove and non-mangrove vegetation. Classification accuracy of CASI data was higher than Landsat TM for all methods, and more mangrove classes could be discriminated. Merging Landsat TM and SPOT XP data improved visual interpretation of images, but did not enhance discrimination of different mangrove categories. The most accurate combination of sensor and image processing method for mapping the mangroves of the eastern Caribbean islands is identified.

However, they have not been used in remote sensing studies of mangrove areas which have traditionally utilised the latter two approaches. High resolution (1 m) multispectral imagery of mangroves in the Turks and Caicos Islands was collected using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Hierarchical agglomerative clustering with group-average sorting identified six mangrove classes which were used to direct a supervised classification (overall accuracy 78.2%). Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated from CASI data: linear regression models were used to predict leaf area index and percent canopy closure from NDVI. LAI and canopy closure data, estimated from field measurements for a set of sites different to those used to derive the regression models, were used to test the accuracy of LAI and canopy closure prediction. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of accuracy sites at which the LAI or percent canopy closure value (as estimated from field measurements) lay within the 95% confidence interval for the predicted value. Accuracy was high: 94% for LAI and 80% for canopy closure. The superior spatial and spectral resolution of CASI allows mangrove areas to be assessed to a greater level of detail and accuracy than with satellite sensors. Some logistics for planning CASI campaigns are discussed.

Natural experiments with model systems can be a powerful complement to direct, manipulative experiments, especially where the processes that regulate biodiversity have no more than modest direct impacts on ecosystem function. Mangrove ecosystems on continental land masses and isolated islands offer unusual potential as natural experiments for biodiversity and ecosystem function studies, largely because sites with similar physical environments can have clear contrasts in the diversity of the dominant autotrophs. These contrasts provide a starting point for exploring the role of species diversity of higher plants in modulating biogeochemical functions (e.g. production, nutrient cycling), ecological functions (e.g. habitat for organisms in different tropic levels), and anthropogenic functions (e.g. maintenance of fisheries, management of sediments), on a range of time scales.

There is no standard image processing method that can be applied for the identification and delineation of coastal ecosystems. From a spectral point of view, it is practically impossible to characterize each of the sixty species of trees and shrubs that constitute the mangroves of the world. Nevertheless, some possibilities exist to map at global and at local scales mangrove areas from satellite products, combining several space data sets, interpretation of aerial photographs and ground surveys. The monitoring of mangroves can be considered as operational at a local level using remote sensing techniques, whereas monitoring of these ecosystems at global or at regional levels has not yet been achieved.																	1323-1650						1998	49	4					287	296		10.1071/MF97153								WOS:000076623200002

NDVI values were used to predict LAI with this model and a thematic map of LAI produced from satellite data for the whole Bank. Mangrove LAI ranged between 0.8 and 7.0, with a mean of 3.96, LAI data, estimated from in situ measurements of canopy transmittance for a set of sites independent of those used to derive the LAI/NDVI model, were used to test the accuracy of this image. Accuracy was defined as the proportion of accuracy sites at which the LAI value (as estimated from field measurements) lay within the 95% confidence interval for the predicted value of LAI. The accuracy of this map was high (88%) and the mean difference between predicted and measured LAI was low (13%). Remote sensing is thus demonstrated as a powerful tool for estimating the spatial distribution of LAI for whole mangrove ecosystems. This information can be obtained rapidly compared to alternative methods of measuring LAI and can minimise the logistical and practical difficulties of fieldwork in inaccessible mangrove areas.

Field surveys during the flights recorded biophysical data and water depth in 11 marsh sites containing communities of three principal emergent macrophytes: Cladium jamaicense, Typha domingensis, and Eleocharis cellulosa. The only major seasonal change was in flooding. Seasonal changes in polarimetric backscatter magnitude (HH, VV, and CS=(HV+ VH)/2) and phase [\H-V phase difference\ = PD) were extracted for a stable evergreen mangrove forest calibration site, which confirmed that the absolute calibration of the Yucatan imagery exceeded: the SIR-C system calibration. We estimate that seasonal changes of greater than or equal to 2dB in backscatter magnitude and greater than or equal to 10 degrees in phase (PD) are significant in our data. Seasonal changes in L- and C-band magnitude and phase were extracted from the 11 marshes, and significant changes above the calibration limit were noted. Increased flooding in the mac-shes was detected by: 1) an increase in backscatter magnitude in marshes with tall, dense cover; 2) a decrease in backscatter magnitude in marshes with short, sparse cover and 3) an increase in PD in all types of marshes. Magnitude increases result from an increase in double-bounce interactions between the emergent vegetation and water surface, whereas decreases result from an increase in forward scattering off the open water. Average PD values increase owing to an absolute or relative increase in double- compared with single-bounce interaction. Changes from dry or partially flooded to completely flooded as well as increases in water depth, could be detected by most of the polarimetric parameters, but changes from dry to partially flooded could not. C-band PD (CPD) was the radar parameter most sensitive to flooding. CPD changed significantly for all eleven marshes, followed by L-band PD (LPD) and LVV (nine marshes) and LHH, LCS, and CVV (seven marshes). CHH detected significant changes in five marshes but produced changes of +/-1.8-1.9 dB (just below our estimated calibration limit) in. four others. An evaluation of current spaceborne radars indicates that a combination of the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1,2) and Radarsat radars could detect seasonal flooding in a wide variety of marsh ecosystems, excluding partial flooding and flooding in small patches of short, sparse vegetation.

J	Everitt, JH; Judd, FW; Escobar, DE; Davis, MR				Everitt, JH; Judd, FW; Escobar, DE; Davis, MR			Integration of remote sensing and spatial information technologies for mapping black mangrove on the Texas gulf coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Black mangrove [Auicennia germinans (L.) L.] occurs at several locations along the Texas gulf coast. A hard freeze in December 1989 severely damaged this species, but the extent of damage has not been determined. Airborne color-infrared (CIR) video imagery was used with global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies for distinguishing and mapping the current distribution of black mangrove. Black mangrove populations could be easily distinguished on CIR video imagery. The integration of a GPS with the video imagery permitted latitude/longitude coordinates of black mangrove populations to be recorded on each image. The GPS coordinates were entered into a GIS to map black mangrove populations along the Texas coast. Major black mangrove concentrations near Port Isabel-South Bay and Port Aransas on the lower and lower-mid Texas coast, respectively, had fully recovered from the freeze. A remnant population of an historical black mangrove concentration on the upper-mid Texas coast near Port O'Connor, that was devastated by a 1983 freeze, was severely damaged and reduced in number by the 1989 freeze. The integration of videography, GPS, and GIS are valuable tools that can enable coastal resource managers to develop regional maps showing the distribution of black mangrove over large areas.																	0749-0208					WIN	1996	12	1					64	69										WOS:A1996TW33400007						
J	Blasco, F; Saenger, P; Janodet, E				Blasco, F; Saenger, P; Janodet, E			Mangroves as indicators of coastal change	CATENA												In view of the unique biological characteristics of mangroves, it is interesting to assess the extent to which these ecosystems can be used as indicators of coastal change or sea-level rise. From recent studies of mangrove mortality at several locations (including Guiana, Gambia, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, India and Bangladesh), it appears that these coastal ecosystems are so specialized that any minor variation in their hydrological or tidal regimes causes noticeable mortality. Each species of mangrove (but particularly those belonging to the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Sonneratia, Heritiera and Nypa) occurs in ecological conditions that approach its limit of tolerance with regard to salinity of the water and soil, as well as the inundation regime. If the duration of daily immersion were to be modified by tectonic, sedimentological or hydrological events, the species either readjusts to the new conditions or succumbs to unsuitable conditions. Consequently, the use of remote sensing data for mangrove ecosystems offers excellent potential as a tool for monitoring coastal change.																	0341-8162					OCT	1996	27	3-4					167	178		10.1016/0341-8162(96)00013-6								WOS:A1996VP34000002						
J	Ramsey, EW; Jensen, JR				Ramsey, EW; Jensen, JR			Remote sensing of mangrove wetlands: Relating canopy spectra to site-specific data	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing was examined as a tool to describe the spectral and structural changes within and between mangrove species and community types. To accomplish this goal, high-resolution canopy reflectance spectra were obtained at 21 mangrove sites in southwest Florida. This was in addition to leaf spectra, canopy closure, height, and species composition from a number of these sites. High relative variability typified measurements of canopy reflectance spectra, canopy height, and percent species composition, while leaf reflectance variances within species (black or red, about 0.04 to 0.06 percent) were higher than between species (about 0.02 percent). A transformed canopy closure variable - Leaf Area Index (LAI) - was low with little variance, and it was significantly correlated to canopy height but not to species composition. Mean reflectances were generated for the blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength regions from the obtained canopy reflectance spectra by using either user-defined bandwidths or bandwidths defined for the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, Thematic Mapper, and XMS (SPOT) sensors. Results from these sets of reflectances in combination with correlation analyses suggest blue and red reflectances were redundant as were SPOT panchromatic and green reflectances and all normalized difference vegetation indexes derived for each set of NIR and red reflectances. Eighty-four percent of the LAI variance was explained by using any generated normalized difference vegetation index; however, species composition was not correlated to any combination of reflectance bands or vegetation index.

Monitoring before and after modification was done using field and remote sensing techniques. Images from large scale colour infrared aerial photography were analysed to evaluate impacts of the modification. Analysis was by subtracting and classifying digitized images taken before and after modification. The resulting 'difference type images' showed the types of change and their nature. These images indicated also the spatial extent of the changes. The site has become wetter as a result of increased tidal flushing, indicated by reduced spectral values. The area modified has changed less than the adjacent mangrove inlet which floods the area. Mangroves have increased in size and spatial extent, with increased spectral values generally. The changes are consistent with reported mangrove changes in other local areas and thus are unlikely to be a direct effect of runnelling.

To appreciate the importance of tropical forests as carbon sinks, published data on carbon storage in tropical forest biomass, soil and litter were reviewed and synthesized. The data showed that: 1) in the seventies, the total area of tropical forests of the world stood at about 1,628 x 10(6) hectares, of which about 58% or 1,043.90 x 10(6) hectares was contributed by tropical closed moist forests, and the remaining 42 % by savanna-type dry forests. 2) Of the ca. 1,043.90 x 10(6) hectares of tropical closed moist forests, about 53.8% are located in Central and South America, 28% in Asia and Oceania, and 18.2% in Africa. 3) Total storage of organic carbon (approximately equal to 50% of organic matter) amounted to 393.50 x 10(9) tonnes, with vegetation accounting for 58%, soil 41%, and litter 1%. Approximately 50% of the total storage was contributed by tropical moist and rain forests. 4) Total litter, production tropical forests was estimated at about 6.15 x 10(9) tonnes (Carbon), of which about 53% of was produced by tropical dry and moist rain forests, with the tropical moist rain forests accounted for about 30%. Turnover time of litter in tropical forests was less than 1.0 year. 5) The rates of gross primary production in tropical forests ranged from 9.5 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year in subtropical dry forests to 100 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year in tropical moist rain forests; and that of net production from 5.5 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year (Subtropical dry forests) to 36.0 tonnes (Carbon)/ha/year (lowland tropical moist forests) In conclusion, it may be restated that based on rather limited available data, tropical forests, particularly the undisturbed moist and rain forests, play an important role as carbon sinks in the global carbon cycle. These forests store about 46% of the world's living terrestrial carbon pool and about 11.55% of the world's soil carbon pool. Thus, any form of destruction (burning) or reduction in area of these forests will lead to a substantial increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Notwithstanding this, it should be stressed that more accurate and up to date studies, using remote-sensing techniques and ground surveys to establish the actual area of the remaining tropical forests and at the rate of which these forests are being eliminated annually are urgently needed. Equally wanting are in situ measurements of the rate of primary production and respiration of each of the forest types prevailing in tropical regions of the world.

The most rapid emissions of >500 nmol m-2 h-1 occurred in red mangrove-dominated sites that were adjacent to open seawater and contained numerous crab burrows. Poorly drained red mangrove sites exhibited lower fluxes of approximately 60 nmol m-2 h-1 which were similar to fluxes from the black mangrove areas which dominated the marine-influenced wetland sites in the Everglades. DMS was the dominant organo-S gas emitted especially in the freshwater areas. Spectral data from a scene from the Landsat thematic mapper were used to map habitats in the Everglades. Six vegetation categories were delineated using geographical information system software and S gas emissions were extrapolated for the entire Everglades National Park. The black mangrove-dominated areas accounted for the largest portion of S gas emissions to the area. The large area extent of the saw grass communities (42%) accounted for approximately 24% of the total S emissions.

Background information on the areal extent and status of these mangroves is limited and makes their protection and management difficult. A model study has been carried out on the Mida Creek mangroves based on a double sampling approach starting with SPOT multispectral satellite imagery followed by ground checks to provide information on species composition, density and distribution of mangroves. The utilization of mangroves and uses around and within the mangroves were determined. During this study, seven mangrove species were identified in Mida Creek, namely: Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba, Xylocarpus granatum and Lumnitzera racemosa. This report briefly outlines the present utilisation of mangrove species. It is recommended that a multidisciplinary management plan be developed in order to conserve and manage the mangroves of Kenya on a sustainable yield basis.																	0018-8158					NOV 20	1992	247	1-3					29	36		10.1007/BF00008202								WOS:A1992KJ25300005

L.] populations on the lower Texas gulf coast. Video imagery of black mangrove sites was obtained in December 1989. Results showed that black mangrove populations had a distinct red signature on the CIR video imagery that could be separated from other vegetation, soil, and water. Computer-based image analyses of the imagery showed that black mangrove populations could be quantified. Airborne video data provides a near-real-time tool for distinguishing and delineating black mangrove communities and should be useful for assessing damage to populations following catastrophic weather events such as freezes and tropical storms. Aerial surveys are also less costly to conduct with video than with photography.																	0749-0208					FAL	1991	7	4					1169	1173										WOS:A1991GF13000016
