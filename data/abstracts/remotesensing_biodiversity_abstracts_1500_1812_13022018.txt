Landscape maps of Jinta oasis were compiled by using GIS based on Landsat TM data of 1990 and 2000. Landscape indexes for evaluating fragmentation are patch area, patch density, corridor density and split index. Results indicated many difference. First, between the years 1990 and 2000, the landscape fragmentation in Jinta oasis decreased slightly. Second, the area of the matrix decreased at the class level. The landscape fragmentation of the matrix (bare soil) increased as a result of increased influence of human activities on matrix and was opposite to the irrigated farmland whose area is larger and more aggregated in 2000 than in 1990. Third, dense corridor system is one of the most prominent characteristics of the arid regions. It is one of the key factors resulting in the landscape fragmentation; especially the fragmentation within the same patch types. The corridor density of irrigated farmland, residential area and forestland were quite large in Jinta oasis both in 1990 and 2000. The pattern of Jinta oasis is characterized by agricultural oasis embedded in Gobi and in the desert, where the ecosystem was disturbed strongly by the intense human activities.				westgis.CAREERI, SCI paper/O-2255-2013; Li, Xin/F-7473-2011; Mingguo, Ma/A-8087-2013	westgis.CAREERI, SCI paper/0000-0001-5298-1494; Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818; 												0943-0105					APR	2008	54	3					629	636		10.1007/s00254-007-0830-7								WOS:000253570800018

However, its usefulness may depend on the species, habitat Studied, spatial resolution and extent. We used a high spatial and spectral remote sensing image to locate and delineate small amphibian breeding sites in a Mediterranean ecosystem (Donana National Park). We also evaluated its usefulness in detecting habitat heterogeneity (number and evenness of different radiometric zones) within ponds and its relationship to amphibian species richness. Furthermore, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were used to evaluate the usefulness of high-resolution remote-sensing data to model amphibian distribution at species level (presence/absence data), both when used alone or as a complement to field data. Amphibian species richness correlated positively with habitat heterogeneity when we discriminated a low number of potential different zones within ponds (four vs nine). For most species, remote-sensing data improved on amphibian distribution models built from field data but were of limited utility when used alone. In consequence, although remote-sensing data could be used for the preliminary identification of ponds supporting high species richness, we recommend initial assessment of its utility for identifying species-specific breeding sites before conducting survey programmes based on it.

Biogeographers have a long-standing interest in measuring patterns of species occurrence and distributional movements and an interest in modelling species distributions and patterns of diversity. Much progress has been made in identifying plant species from space using high-resolution satellites (QuickBird, IKONOS), while the measurement of species movements has become commonplace with the ARGOS satellite tracking system which has been used to track the movements of thousands of individual animals. There have been significant advances in land-cover classifications by combining data from multi-passive and active sensors, and new classification techniques. Species distribution modelling has been growing at a striking rate and the incorporation of spaceborne data on climate, topography, land cover, and vegetation structure has great potential to improve models. There have been significant advances in modelling species richness, alpha diversity, and beta diversity using multisensors to quantify land-cover classifications and landscape metrics, measures of productivity, and measures of heterogeneity. Remote sensing of nature reserves can provide natural resources managers with near real-time data within and around reserves that can be used to support conservation efforts anywhere in the world. Future research should focus on incorporating recent spaceborne sensors, more extensive integration of available spaceborne imagery, and the collection and dissemination of high-quality field data. This will improve our understanding of the distribution of life on earth.

J	Huang, HM; Zhang, LQ; Guan, YJ; Wang, DH				Huang, Hua-Mei; Zhang, Li-Quan; Guan, Yu-Juan; Wang, Dong-Hui			A cellular automata model for population expansion of Spartina alterniflora at Jiuduansha Shoals, Shanghai, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Biological invasion has received considerable attention recently because of increasing impacts on local ecosystems. Expansion of Spartina alterniflora, a non-native species, on the intertidal mudflats of Jiuduansha Shoals at the Yangtze River Estuary is a prime example of a spatially-structured invasion in a relatively simple habitat, for which strategic control efforts can be modeled and applied. Here, we developed a Cellular Automata (CA) model, in conjunction with Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems, to simulate the expanding process of S. alterniflora for a period of 8 years after being introduced to the new shoals, and to study the interactions between spatial pattern and ecosystem processes for the saltmarsh vegetation. The results showed that the CA model could simulate the population dynamics of S. alterniflora and Phragmites australis on the Jiuduansha Shoals successfully. The results strongly support the hypothesis of space pre-emption as well as range expansion with simple advancing wave fronts for these two species. In the Yangtze River Estuary, the native species P. australis shares the same niche with the exotic species S. alterniflora. However, the range expansion rate of P. australis was much slower than that of S. alterniflora. With the accretion of the Jiuduansha Shoals due to the large quantity of sediments deposited by the Yangtze River, a rapid range expansion of S. alterniflora is predicted to last for a long period into future. This study indicated the potential for this approach to provide valuable insights into population and community ecology of invasive species, which could be very important for wetland biodiversity conservation and resource management in the Yangtze River Estuary and other such impacted areas.

J	Prates-Clark, CD; Saatchi, SS; Agosti, D				Prates-Clark, Cassia Da Conceicao; Saatchi, Sassan S.; Agosti, Donat			Predicting geographical distribution models of high-value timber trees in the Amazon Basin using remotely sensed data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Species distribution models were developed for three high economic value timber trees (Calophyllum brasiliensis, Carapa quianensis and Virola surinamensis) that are heavily harvested in the Amazon Basin. A combination of habitat measurements extracted from remote sensing data (MODIS, QSCAT and SRTM) and bioclimatic surfaces was examined to ascertain the most influential factors determining the occurrence of these tree species. The prediction of species' occurrence rates was tested separately for each species distribution model and the results were examined for their ability to accurately map the spatial distribution of these tree species. By evaluating the omission and commission rates we concluded that species distribution models based on remote sensing data contributed significantly in quantifying environmental properties used to summarize the ecological niche of each tree species. Specific vegetation characteristics (such as percentage of tree cover, vegetation moisture and roughness, annual NDVI and mean LAI during the dry LAI) showed the dependence of these species' occurrence in more densely vegetated forests. Areas with high leaf area (even during the dry months) and areas with high vegetation moisture were predicted as potential species habitat for C. brasiliensis. The density vegetation during the dry season and vegetation phenology were strongly correlated with climate differences, such as variations in air temperature and precipitation seasonality for V surinamensis. Lower elevation areas with more exuberant vegetation and a high greenness index were among the most important factors accounting for the geographical distribution of C. guianensis. Species distribution models are increasingly important in many fields of research and conservation. The potential of remotely sensed data to monitor environmental changes in tropical areas, along with the understanding of ecosystem function, are both critical for conservation of biodiversity and the long-term process of sustaining ecosystems.

The Absence of environmental planning in the process of land use development may cause many significant negative impacts on biodiversity, ecological value, and the general environmental conditions, and therefore, reducing such negative impacts will improve land use development. The first part of this sequel of two papers, which is part of a sustainable land use development research program, aims at designing a spatial framework to improve land use planning and development in an environmental context. The research program deals with the problem of land use planning and development in an and coastal area under environmentally sensitive conditions. The study area is El-Daba'a region, located in the northwestern coast of Egypt, which can be described as a wild area. The approach used in this paper consists of studying the spatial ecological characteristics of El-Daba'a region using different spatial data including maps and Landsat remote sensing data. These data are used to create a series of superimposed informative layers managed by a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the spatial ecological characteristics of the study area. The developed GIS allows decision makers to handle large amounts of information simultaneously such as geology, geomorphology, land cover, wild life and many other different information layers. The system is designed to help decision makers to organize, relate, analyze, and visualize the ecological data and information in the study area. The developed GIS system might be used to determine the probable effects of building a nuclear power station on the ecosystem.																	1015-4442					MAR-JUN	2008	26	1-2					95	106										WOS:000260151400010

In this case study, we describe and analyze a method to quantify agroecosystem health through a combination of geographically referenced data at various spatial scales. Six key variables were hypothesized to provide a minimum set of conditions required to quantify agroecosystem health: soil health, biodiversity, topography, farm economics, land economics, and social organization. Each of these key variables was quantified by one or more attributes of a study area near Wooster, Ohio. Data sources included remote sensing, digital elevation models, soil maps, county auditor records, and a structured questionnaire of landowners in the study area. These data were combined by an analytical hierarchy process to yield an agroecosystem health index. The two steps in the process were first to combine the data at the pixel scale (30 m(2)) into key variables with normalized values, and then to combine the key variables into the final index. The analytical hierarchy process model was developed by panels of experts for each key variable and by participants in the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's Agroecosystems Management Program for the final agroecosystem health index value. Observed spatial patterns of the agroecosystem health index were then analyzed with respect to the underlying data. Consistent with our hypothesis and the definition of agroecosystems, spatial patterns in the agroecosystem health index were an emergent property of combined socioeconomic and biophysical conditions not apparent in any of the underlying data or key variables. The method proposed in this study permits estimation of agroecosystem health as a function of specific underlying conditions, which combine in complex ways. Because values of the agroecosystem health index and the data underlying them can be analyzed for a particular landscape, the method proposed could be useful to policy makers, educators, service agencies, organizations, and the people who live in the area for finding opportunities to improve the health of their agroecosystem.

This study complements the extensive research on land cover conversion in the region by investigating a subtle but important aspect of forest modification. We examine changes in the spatial characteristics of milpa cultivation plots in the swidden landscape of Peto municipality in Yucatan state from 1988 to 2003 using remote sensing. We also test the hypothesis that milpa clearings create a discernible edge effect in terms of forest structure. Results indicate that spatial patterns of milpas have changed over time. The amount of milpa/forest linear interface increased over the study period. Both satellite-based vegetation indices and field-based canopy cover measurements indicated that forest buffering milpa clearings had significantly lower biomass than background forest, despite that the background forest is itself a mosaic of successional forest stages. In contrast, there was no difference in stand basal area for milpa edge forest and background forest. Multivariate models demonstrated that the milpa edge indicator was the most important variable in explaining differences of vegetation indices for milpa edges and background forest compared with other factors that create edges in the landscape. Models were relatively effective in explaining mean values of vegetation indices; but they performed poorly in terms of explaining measures of forest vegetation heterogeneity. Comparing model results from each date suggests that the importance of milpa edges decreases over time, possibly as a function of the accumulated land use history as milpas rotate through the forest matrix. Evidence supports the notion that the effects of milpa land use extend beyond the clearing itself and into adjacent forest. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Birds as agents of seed dispersal in a human-dominated landscape in southern Costa Rica	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Birds play vital roles as seed dispersers helping to maintain and restore plant communities. With restoration increasingly key to global conservation, it is important to understand the landscape attributes and bird community characteristics that most influence avian seed dispersal in human-altered landscapes. We examined bird community structure and seed-dispersal patterns in agricultural countryside in Costa Rica that is typical of much of the Neotropics. Contrary to expectations, bird abundance, not richness, best predicted the richness of bird-dispersed seeds. Neither forest patch size or proximity, nor total tree cover, influenced seed dispersal. The richness and abundance of dispersed seeds, however, was strongly correlated with "wetness," a remotely-sensed metric of vegetation, at several scales. These results suggest that in this human-dominated tropical region: (1) bird abundance, not species richness or size, may drive seed dispersal, and (2) remote-sensing combined with field verification can detect landscape elements that are helpful for maintaining the option of bird-mediated reforestation.

J	Cakir, G; Sivrikaya, F; Keles, S				Cakir, Guenay; Sivrikaya, Fatih; Keles, Sedat			Forest cover change and fragmentation using Landsat data in Macka State Forest Enterprise in Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring forest cover change and understanding the dynamic of forest cover is increasingly important in sustainable development and management of forest ecosystems. This paper uses remote sensing (RS) techniques to monitor forest cover change in Macka State Forest Enterprise (MSFE) located in NE of Turkey through 1975 to 2000 and then analyses spatial and temporal changes in forest cover by Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and FRAGSTATS (TM). Forest cover changes were detected from a time series of satellite images of Landsat MSS in 1975, Landsat TM in 1987, and Landsat ETM+ in 2000 using RS and GIS. The results showed that total forest area, productive forest area and degraded forest area increased while broadleaf forest area and non forest area decreased. Mixed forest and degraded forest increased during the first (1975-1987) period, but decreased during the second (1987-2000) period. During the whole study period, the annual forestation rate was 152 ha year(-1), equivalent to 0.27% year(-1) using the compound-interest-rate formula. The total number of patches increased from 36,204 to 48,092 (33%), and mean size of forest patch (MPS) decreased from 2.8 ha to 2.1 ha during a 25 year period. Number of smaller patches (patches in 0-100 ha size class) increased, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. While total population increased from 1975 to 2000 (3.7%), rural population constantly decreased. The increase of forest areas may well be explained by the fact that demographic movement of rural areas concentrated into Macka City Center. These figures also indicated that decrease in the rural population might likely lead to the release of human pressure to forest areas, probably resulting in a positive development of forest areas.

David; Mayaux, Philippe			Using remote sensing to inform conservation status assessment: Estimates of recent deforestation rates on New Britain and the impacts upon endemic birds	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Remote sensing is increasingly used by policy-makers and conservationists to identify conservation priorities and changes in land cover. This is particularly important in the biodiverse tropics, where there are often few field data. Conservation action is often directed towards areas containing globally threatened species, but there have been few attempts to improve assessments of species' extinction risk through remote sensing. Here, in a novel approach we use deforestation estimates, measured through satellite imagery, to assess the conservation status of an entire endemic avifauna, based on IUCN Red List criteria. The island of New Britain, east of New Guinea, is of very high global conservation importance, and home to 37 endemic or restricted-range bird species. Analysis suggests 12% of forest cover was lost between 1989 and 2000, including over 20% of forest under 100 m altitude, with substantial areas cleared for commercial oil palm plantations. Application of the IUCN Red List criteria to these new data on area of remaining forest and rates of deforestation indicates that many species are more threatened than previously realised, with the total number of threatened or near threatened species increasing from 12 to 21. Thus, this study highlights the urgency of establishing and effectively managing protected areas in suitable lowland forests of New Britain. More broadly, it demonstrates another potential of remote sensing to assist strategic conservation decisions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Testing predictions of beetle community patterns derived empirically using remote sensing	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Patterns generated from ecological surveys are rarely tested in similar habitats to assess the accuracy of predictions. Testing empirically derived predictions provides a strong tool for establishing the consistency of general patterns in ecology. We test the consistency of beetle community associations with habitat complexity in open canopy forests and make both community and morphospecies-level comparisons with results from a previous study. We use Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVIs) from remote sensing as a surrogate for habitat complexity. The positive relationships between NDVIs and site-based beetle species richness and abundance were consistent in open canopy forests both south and north of Sydney, Australia. NDVIs were also useful for predicting differences in beetle composition in open canopy forests. Taxon-specific responses to NDVI differences in 'southern forests' were very similar to responses in 'northern forests', most likely reflecting beetle trophic roles. This study shows that NDVIs can be used as rapid biodiversity indicators, when integrated with identified faunal responses to vegetation structure, provided that the lower vegetation strata may be measured by remote sensing.

Predicting tree diversity across the United States as a function of modeled gross primary production	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												At the regional and continental scale, ecologists have theorized that spatial variation in biodiversity can be interpreted as a response to differences in climate. To test this theory we assumed that ecological constraints associated with current climatic conditions (2000-2004) might best be correlated with tree richness if expressed through satellite-derived measures of gross primary production (GPP), rather than the more commonly used, but less consistently derived, net primary production. To evaluate current patterns in tree diversity across the contiguous United States we acquired information on tree composition from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program that represented more than 174000 survey plots. We selected 2693 cells of 1000 km 2 within which a sufficient number of plots were available to estimate tree richness per hectare. Our estimates of forest productivity varied from simple vegetation indices indicative of the fraction of light intercepted by canopies at 16-d intervals, a product from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer), to 8- and 10-d GPP products derived with minimal climatic data (MODIS) and SPOT-Vegetation (Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre), to 3-PGS (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth with Satellites), which requires both climate and soil data. Across the contiguous United States, modeled predictions of gross productivity accounted for between 51% and 77% of the recorded spatial variation in tree diversity, which ranged from 2 to 67 species per hectare. When the analyses were concentrated within nine broadly defined ecoregions, predictive relations largely disappeared. Only 3-PGS predictions fit a theorized unimodal function by being able to distinguish highly productive forests in the Pacific Northwest that support lower than expected tree diversity. Other models predicted a continuous steep rise in tree diversity with increasing productivity, and did so with generally better or nearly equal precision with fewer data requirements.

The analysis covered two periods: 1949-1972 and 1972-2006 using remote sensing techniques. For the year 2001, we mapped the patterns of distribution of secondary forests dominated by the most abundant exotic tree species (Ligustrum lucidum). Based on land-cover maps, we estimated sediment yield as an index of watershed condition. Urban area was growing during the whole study period. Between 1949 and 2006, forest area increased approximately 1400 ha, mostly over abandoned agriculture and grasslands; this expansion was accelerated between 1972 and 2006. Increased forest cover resulted in a reduction in erosion and sediment yield that was disproportionately large, as most new forests are located in areas of steep slopes and high rainfall. By 2001, Ligustum-dominated forests had expanded to more than 500 ha, in the southern portion of the sierra only. Overall, the analysis quantifies a process of Neotropical peri-urban forest transition, likely associated with socioeconomic changes related to population urbanization, that promotes improvements of some environmental services, such as watershed and biodiversity conservation. However, natural communities are strongly affected by past land use and neighboring urban areas, which have promoted a growing importance of exotic species with mostly unknown ecological consequences.

The role of GIS in Digital Earth education	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												A growing number of educators worldwide have become convinced that geotechnologies - including geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and remote sensing - are key technologies to prepare students to be tomorrow's decision makers. Grappling with local, regional, and global issues of the 21(st) century requires people who think spatially and who can use geotechnologies. Some educators teach geotechnologies as a discipline, emphasising skills. Other educators use geotechnologies as a tool to teach content, such as geography, history, environmental studies, Earth Science, biology, mathematics, economics and other disciplines. Issues such as traffic, population growth, urban sprawl, energy, water, crime, human health, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture are growing in complexity, exist at every scale and increasingly affect people's everyday lives. Each of these issues has a spatial component. Drivers for geotechnology education include educational content standards, constructivism, the school-to-career movement, active learning, citizenship education, authentic practice and assessment, interdisciplinary education, community connections and a sustained, increasing demand for GIS professionals. Digital Earth is an ideal framework for contextualising domains of inquiry. The Digital Earth community can have a significant impact on the growth of geotechnologies in education, and conversely, the growth of geotechnologies in education and society can foster the forward movement of Earth systems concepts.

Refining forest classifications in the western Amazon using an intra-annual multitemporal approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Seasonal dynamics in the north-eastern Peruvian Amazon were assessed within a multitemporal LULC framework informed by Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery of the study area for 2001 that coincided with seasonal flooding dynamics. Three images (12 March, 31 May, and 20 September 2001) were classified separately using a hybrid classification method that combined unsupervised and supervised techniques, and attributed with a classification scheme consisting of 18 LULC classes. A multitemporal classification that included 25 LULC classes was created from the three single-date classifications using a panel analysis technique. While some of the classes describe LULC 'changes' (land-use and land-cover change (LULCC)) that were stable over time (e.g. low sediment water during March, May, and September 2001), others were complex and included multiple trajectories of change. Panel analysis extracts pixel histories of change over three or more observations as a trend or trajectory, rather than segmenting those changes into piecemeal periods as normally done with from-to change detection. This technique was then assessed by testing hypothesized forest trajectories of LULCC. Traditional quantitative accuracy assessment techniques are less appropriate for panel analysis, and so a qualitative accuracy assessment was performed to evaluate the validity of the multitemporal classification. This study suggests that there may not be one typical year-round behaviour for seasonal environments, and that population-environment interaction studies would benefit from incorporating this knowledge into future research. This analysis further demonstrates the effectiveness of a multitemporal remote-sensing approach for gauging landscape fluctuations in seasonal environments.

Assessing the impact of the 2004 tsunami on mangroves using remote sensing and GIS techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												While tsunami characteristics and effects are not fully understood in the countries around the Indian Ocean, there are reports suggesting that mangroves, acting as a barrier, significantly reduce the devastation caused by the waves. This study proposes a creative approach to investigating the impact of the 2004 tsunami on mangrove vegetation. The approach involves a combination of Geographic Information System (GIS) proximity analyses and change detection methods in remote sensing to delineate multiple buffer distances from the coastline into four homogeneous subregions. The changes in land cover are then assessed in these subregions before and after the tsunami event. The proposed approach provides a more reliable and accurate means than conventional methods to evaluate spatial patterns of damaged areas through different land characteristics along the coastline. There are major damages to land cover, representing an average of 26.87% change, in those geographic locations with low mangrove coverage that are in close proximity to the coastline in all four subregions, whereas less damage is apparent in locations with high mangrove coverage, representing an average of only 2.77% change. The optimum distance between 1000 and 1500 m of mangrove buffer would be favourable and most effective for reducing the damage by potential tsunami waves. The findings support the need for mangrove replantation and management in the future and may serve as a prototype for studying impacts of tsunamis in other affected countries.

Accurate prediction of bird species richness patterns in an urban environment using Landsat-derived NDVI and spectral unmixing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Urban landscapes are expanding rapidly and are reshaping the distribution of many animal and plant species. With these changes, the need to understand and to include urban biodiversity patterns in research and management programmes is becoming vital. Recent studies have shown that remote sensing tools can be useful in studies examining biodiversity patterns in natural landscapes. The present study aimed to explore whether remote sensing tools can be applied in biodiversity research in an urban landscape. More specifically, the study examined whether the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and linear spectral unmixing of urban land cover can predict bird richness in the city of Jerusalem. Bird richness was sampled in 40 1-ha sites over a range of urban environments in 329 surveys. NDVI and the per cent cover of built-up area were strongly and negatively correlated with each other, and were both very successful in explaining the number of bird species in the study sites. Mean NDVI in each site was positively correlated with the site bird species richness. A hump-shaped relationship between NDVI and species richness was observed (when calculated over increasing spatial scales), with a maximum value (Pearson's R=0.87, p0.001, n=40) at a scale of 15ha. We suggest that remote sensing approaches may provide planners and conservation biologists with an efficient and cost-effective method to study and estimate biodiversity across urban environments that range between densely built-up areas, residential neighbourhoods, urban parks and the peri-urban environment.

Large fires as agents of ecological diversity in the North American boreal forest	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The present study undertook a hierarchical analysis of the variability within and among some individual fire events in the boreal ecozones of Canada and Alaska. When stratified by ecozone, differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of wildfires were observed in the Canadian Large Fire Data Base that reflect climatic, terrain and land-use differences across the country. Remote-sensing data collected before and after boreal forest fires permitted a rigorous analysis of the variability in burn severity within individual fire events, and the identification of certain fire-prone and more fire-resistant land-cover types. The occurrence of fire skips or islands was related to the distribution of those cover types, resulting in proportionally more unburned area within the perimeter of a burn for larger fires. Differences in burn severity led to differences in post-burn vegetation response of tree, shrub and moss layers that can persist for decades or even centuries. As a result, there can be considerable variability in the survival, density and distribution of residual biota and organic materials. This variability creates a range of post-fire vegetation patterns and contributes much to the habitat diversity of boreal landscapes.

Coral reef communities, habitats, and substrates in and near sanctuary zones of Ningaloo Marine Park	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												As Australia's longest fringing reef, Ningaloo Reef lies close to the mainland of northwest Australia in an area of high tourism potential. The establishment of sanctuary zones in and around the northern Ningaloo Marine Park has necessitated improvements in understanding of the biodiversity and distribution of habitats and substrates in the reef lagoon, its seaward barrier, and the adjacent shelf environments. Using a combination of video transects in forereef-to-shelf environments, global positioning system-controlled ground-truthing of colour satellite images, and aerial photography for shallow lagoon settings, 16 habitat types were identified and mapped regionally. Lagoon substrates described in previous reconnaissance were mapped here in greater detail, and some of the first data on poorly known forereef and shelf communities have been analysed from the video transects. There is a strong correlation between reef morphology, inherited substrate type, and coral communities across reef lagoons and their associated barriers, where an energy gradient controlled by wave-driven and tidal circulation in reef flat and lagoon environments is reflected in the distribution and cover of robust to more delicate coral communities. Morphological controls are less distinct in island-associated habitats, where increased turbidity, differing wave energy, and more variable topography result in higher substrate variability and increasing soft coral communities. The data obtained in this study provide a background for management of biodiversity and monitoring of future impacts in some of the sanctuary zones likely to experience increased use in the northern Ningaloo Reef.

Evolutionary consequences of human disturbance in a rainforest bird species from Central Africa	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY					International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human-Altered Environments	FEB 08-10, 2007	Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA		Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles			Relatively little attention has been directed towards understanding the impacts of human disturbance on evolutionary processes that produce and maintain biodiversity. Here, we examine the influence of anthropogenic habitat changes on traits typically associated with natural and sexual selection in the little greenbul (Andropadus virens), an African rainforest bird species. Using satellite remote-sensing and field survey data, we classified habitats into nonhuman-altered mature and human-altered secondary forest. Mature rainforest consisted of pristine rainforest, with little or no human influence, and secondary forest was characterized by plantations of coffee and cacao and high human impacts. Andropadus virens abundance was higher in secondary forest, and populations inhabiting mature rainforest were significantly larger in wing and tarsus length and bill size; characters often correlated with fitness. To assess the extent to which characters important in sexual section and mate choice might be influenced by habitat change, we also examined differences in plumage colour and song. Plumage colour and the variance in plumage luminance were found to differ between forest types, and song duration was found to be significantly longer in mature forest. The possible adaptive significance of these differences in traits is discussed. Despite relatively high levels of gene flow across habitats, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that a small proportion of high-F(ST) loci differentiated mature from secondary forest populations. These loci were significant outliers against neutral expectations in a simulation analysis, suggesting a role for divergent selection in differentiation across habitats. A distance-based redundancy analysis further showed that forest type as defined by remote-sensing variables was significantly associated with genetic dissimilarities between habitats, even when controlling for distance. The observed shifts in morphology, plumage and song were consistent with divergent selection on heritable variation, but a role for plasticity cannot be ruled out. Results suggest that anthropogenic habitat changes may have evolutionary consequences, with implications for conservation and restoration.

A recent contribution by Walker et al. (2006, New Zealand Journal of Ecology 30: 169-177) described losses of indigenous vegetation between 1996/97 and 2001/02 (some 17 000 ha) based on an analysis of changes in the Land Cover Database, LCDB1 and LCDB2, respectively. We agree that the general approach of using these and other spatial datasets appears to be appropriate to investigate changes in land cover and the types of land uses that are responsible, but we would like to offer some comments to aid with the interpretation of this and other studies that use LCDB comparisons and similar techniques. Using aerial photography, satellite imagery, site visits, and other methods, we evaluated a stratified sample of 67 of the 449 polygons that were indicated to have changed from the most affected indigenous classes ('Tall Tussock Grassland', 'Manuka and/or Kanuka', and 'Broadleaved Indigenous Hardwoods') to the exotic forest classes 'Afforestation (not imaged)'and 'Afforestation (imaged, post LCDB 1)'. Our assessment of the entire area of each of these polygons covered 56.6% of the total area that was identified to have changed, and this revealed an error rate of c. 70% for this particular comparison of LCDB1 and LCDB2 data. This indicates the accuracy of such analyses may be too low to be meaningful and requires verification of the data that are primarily based on remote sensing, even when the overall aggregate accuracy is very high. In addition, we comment on the relative merits of different land uses in relation to the conservation of indigenous biodiversity, particularly the contributions of low-producing exotic grassland and exotic plantation forests. This is important because much indigenous biodiversity remains in exotic forests and embedded indigenous remnants, and the current clearing of potentially over 100 000 ha of such land for exotic pasture will cause significant losses of indigenous biodiversity.

J	Rocchini, D				Rocchini, Duccio			Effects of spatial and spectral resolution in estimating ecosystem alpha-diversity by satellite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing represents a powerful tool to derive quantitative and qualitative information about ecosystem biodiversity. In particular, since plant species richness is a fundamental indicator of biodiversity at the community and regional scales, attempts were made to predict species richness (spatial heterogeneity) by means of spectral heterogeneity. The possibility of using spectral variance of satellite images for predicting species richness is known as Spectral Variation Hypothesis. However, when using remotely sensed data, researchers are limited to specific scales of investigation. This paper aims to investigate the effects of scale (both as spatial and spectral resolution) when searching for a relation between spectral and spatial (related to plant species richness) heterogeneity, by using satellite data with different spatial and spectral resolution. Species composition was sampled within square plots of 100 m(2) nested in macroplots of 10,000 m(2). Spectral heterogeneity of each macroplot was calculated using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: a Quickbird multispectral image (4 bands, spatial resolution of 3 m), an Aster multispectral image (first 9 bands used, spatial resolution of 15 m for bands 1 to 3 and 30 m for bands 4 to 9), an ortho-Landsat ETM+ multispectral image (bands 1 to 5 and band 7 used; spatial resolution, 30 m), a resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ image. Quickbird image heterogeneity showed a statistically highly significant correlation with species richness (r=0.69) while coarse resolution images showed contrasting results (r=0.43, r=0.67, and r=0.69 considering the Aster, Landsat ETM+, and the resampled 60 m Landsat ETM+ images respectively). It should be stressed that spectral variability is scene and sensor dependent. Considering coarser spatial resolution images, in such a case even using SWIR Aster bands (i.e. the additional spectral information with respect to Quickbird image) such an image showed a very low power in catching spectral and thus spatial variability with respect to Landsat ETM+ imagery. Obviously coarser resolution data tend to have mixed pixel problems and hence less sensitive to spatial complexity. Thus, one might argue that using a finer pixel dimension should inevitably result in a higher level of detail. On the other hand, the spectral response from different land-cover features (and thus different species) in images with higher spectral resolution should exhibit higher complexity. Spectral Variation Hypothesis could be a basis for improving sampling designs and strategies for species inventory fieldwork. However, researchers must be aware on scale effects when measuring spectral (and thus spatial) heterogeneity and relating it to field data, hence considering the concept of scale not only related to a spatial framework but even to a spectral one.

J	Barrios, E				Barrios, Edmundo			Soil biota, ecosystem services and land productivity	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												The soil environment is likely the most complex biological community. Soil organisms are extremely diverse and contribute to a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential to the sustainable function of natural and managed ecosystems. The soil organism community can have direct and indirect impacts on land productivity. Direct impacts are those where specific organisms affect crop yield immediately. Indirect effects include those provided by soil organisms participating in carbon and nutrient cycles, soil structure modification and food web interactions that generate ecosystem services that ultimately affect productivity. Recognizing the great biological and functional diversity in the soil and the complexity of ecological interactions it becomes necessary to focus in this paper on soil biota that have a strong linkage to functions which underpin 'soil based' ecosystem services. Selected organisms from different functional groups (i.e. microsymbionts, decomposers, elemental transformers, soil ecosystem engineers, soil-borne pest and diseases, and microregulators) are used to illustrate the linkages of soil biota and ecosystem services essential to life on earth as well as with those associated with the provision of goods and the regulation of ecosystem processes. These services are not only essential to ecosystem function but also a critical resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. Research opportunities and gaps related to methodological, experimental and conceptual approaches that may be helpful to address the challenge of linking soil biodiversity and function to the provision of ecosystem services and land productivity are discussed. These include: 1) integration of spatial variability research in soil ecology and a focus on 'hot spots' of biological activity, 2) using a selective functional group approach to study soil biota and function, 3) combining new and existing methodological approaches that link selected soil organisms, the temporal and spatial dynamics of their function, and their contribution to the provision of selected 'soil based' ecosystem services, 4) using understanding about hierarchical relationships to manage soil biota and function in cropping systems, 5) using local knowledge about plants as indicators of soil quality, remote sensing and GIS technologies, and plant-soil biota interactions to help understand the impacts of soil biota at landscape scale, and 6) developing land quality monitoring systems that inform land users about their land's ecosystem service performance, improve capacities to predict and adapt to environmental changes, and support policy and decision-making.

Many studies in this endeavor reported that the rate of forests degradation is posing a severe threat to the landscape and existing biodiversity in the Himalayas. Currently there many conservation approaches exists and of them four are widely recognized (1) Conservation through traditional religious beliefs "traditional conserved forests" (TCF); (2) Conservation through governmental planning and schemes "government conserved forests" (GCF); (3) Conservation through creation of protected areas (PAF); and (4) Conservation through community efforts "community conserved forests" (CCF). Our hypothesis in this direction says that all the conservation approaches lead to same results concerning to forest conservation. To testify our hypothesis we have studied the forests of each conservation regimes and evaluated them based on the identified indicators. We have done empirical studies and following the cloud-free satellite data were used for last three decades (such as Multi-Spectral Scanner, Linear Imaging and Self Scanning, and Enhanced Thematic Mapper ) to study a change in vegetation dynamics of the mountain forests in multi-temporal dimension. Our research concluded that community conservation approach have greater significance for biodiversity conservation and management in the Himalayan region. Here we support the model of CCF for forest ecosystem conservation, alongside the sustainable livelihood of the mountain societies. But every conservation regimes has its own importance in viewpoint of the particular objectives. Therefore, we suggests advancement and revision of PAF and GCF however, some elements of CCF can be introduced in TCF for making up it more sound in view of rapid socio-economic and cultural changes taking place in the communities.

Total species density as well as that of tree, shrub and vine species were identified from 141 sampling quadrats (16543 individuals sampled). Spatial prediction of plant diversity was performed using universal kriging. This approach considered the linear relationship between plant species density and reflectance values of Thematic Mapper (TM), as well as the spatial dependence of the observations. We explored the linear relationships between spectral properties of TM bands and the species density of trees, shrubs and vines, using regression analysis. We employed Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to select a set of candidate models. Based on Akaike weights, we calculated model-averaged parameters. Linear regression between number of species and reflectance values of TM bands yielded regression residuals. We used variogram analysis to analyze the spatial structure of these residuals. Results show that accounting for spatial autocorrelation in the residual variation improved model R-2 from 0.57 to 0.66 for number of all species, from 0.58 to 0.65 for number of tree species, from 0.26 to 0.41 for number of shrub species and from 0.13 to 0.17 for species density of vines. The empirical models we developed can be used to predict landscape-level species density in the Yucatan Peninsula, helping to guide and evaluate management and conservation strategies.

J	Zhang, C; Guo, X				Zhang, Chunhua; Guo, Xulin			Measuring biological heterogeneity in the northern mixed prairie: a remote sensing approach	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN												Biological heterogeneity, defined as the degree of dissimilarity between biological variables (e.g., biomass, green vegetation and Leaf Area Index [LAI]), is one of the most important and widely applicable concepts in ecology due to its close link with biodiversity. To investigate grassland biological heterogeneity, we selected three transects extending from upland to valley grasslands at Grasslands National Park (GNP), Canada, representing the northern mixed grassland. For the purposes of our analysis, three types of data were collected: remote sensing ground level hyperspectral data, biological data (LAI, biomass, and vegetation cover) and environmental data (soil moisture, organic content, and bulk density). Methodologically, field-level remote sensing data were used to calculate spectral vegetation indices. These indices, plus the biological variables, were then used in regression analyses with the goal of assessing the feasibility of using remote sensing data to study biological heterogeneity. The results indicate that it is feasible to use ground-level remote sensing data to represent biological variables. These indices can explain about 40-60 percent of the biological variation. Semivariogram analyses were further applied on these data to investigate their range of spatial variation. Spatial variations in the mixed grassland for LAI, total biomass, green cover and spectral vegetation indices range from 31 to 120 metres, with the majority occurring around 50-60 metres. Therefore, the most appropriate spatial resolution for detecting variation from upland to valley grasslands is 10-20 metres.

J	Stocks, A; McMahan, B; Taber, P				Stocks, Anthony; McMahan, Benjamin; Taber, Peter			Indigenous, colonist, and government impacts on Nicaragua's Bosawas reserve	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We studied the impacts of colonists, two groups of indigenous residents (Miskitu and Mayangna), and management by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) on the forest of the Bosawas International Biosphere Reserve. Indigenous people and colonists subsist on the natural resources of the reserve, and MARENA is responsible for protecting the area from colonization and illicit exploitation. Using geostatistical procedures and Landsat images at three different time periods, we compared per capita deforestation and boundary stabilization in areas with colonists and areas with indigenous peoples. We also examined whether the Mayangna deforested less than the Miskitu and whether the Nicaraguan government has effectively defended the Bosawas boundary against the advance of the agricultural frontier. In addition, we analyzed the current distribution of land uses within the reserve and its contiguous indigenous areas with a supervised classification of current land cover. Indigenous demarcations protected the forest successfully, whereas the Bosawas boundary itself did not inhibit colonization and consequent deforestation. Indigenous farmers deforested significantly less per capita than colonists, and the two indigenous groups in Bosawas did not differ significantly in their effects on the forest. Our results show that indigenous common-property institutions and indigenous defense of homeland have been powerful factors in protecting the forests of Bosawas and that the difficult evolution of a nested cross-scale governance system in Bosawas-under pressure from indigenous peoples-is probably the key to the forest's survival thus far.																	0888-8892					DEC	2007	21	6					1495	1505		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00793.x								WOS:000251764200019	18173473

Spatial predictability of juvenile fish species richness and abundance in a coral reef environment	CORAL REEFS												Juvenile reef fish communities represent an essential component of coral reef ecosystems in the current focus of fish population dynamics and coral reef resilience. Juvenile fish survival depends on habitat characteristics and is, following settlement, the first determinant of the number of individuals within adult populations. The goal of this study was to provide methods for mapping juvenile fish species richness and abundance into spatial domains suitable for micro and meso-scale analysis and management decisions. Generalized Linear Models predicting juvenile fish species richness and abundance were developed according to spatial and temporal environmental variables measured from 10 m up to 10 kin in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. The statistical model was further spatially generalized using a 1.5-m resolution, independently created, remotely sensed, habitat map. This procedure revealed that : (1) spatial factors at 10 to 100-m scale explained up to 71% of variability in juvenile species richness, (2) a small improvement (75%) was gained when a combination of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales was used and (3) the coupling of remotely sensed data, geographical information system tools and point-based ecological data showed that the highest species richness and abundance were predicted along a narrow margin overlapping the coral reef flat and adjacent seagrass beds. Spatially explicit models of species distribution may be relevant for the management of reef communities when strong relationships exist between faunistic and environmental variables and when models are built at appropriate scales.

Monitoring of environmental parameters for CO2 sequestration: a case study of Nagpur City, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Carbon dioxide concentration is an index of total amount of combustion and natural ventilation in an urban environment and therefore required more careful attention for assessment of CO2 level in air environment. An attempt was made to monitor CO2 levels in ambient air of Nagpur city at industrial, commercial and residential sites. In addition to this a remote sensing studies and biotic survey for floral biodiversity were carried out to study the green cover at respective sampling locations. The observations showed that the largest amount of CO2 occurred at night due to absence of photosynthesis and lowest concentration of CO2 was observed in the afternoon due to photosynthesis at its maximum level. The most pollution tolerant species found in Nagpur city are having higher Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) value, which acts as a natural sink for CO2 sequestration. In case of commercial site the CO2 level is highest (366 ppm) because of lowest vegetation and vehicular pollution. The generation of database of CO2 concentration and floral biodiversity along with percentage of green cover helps to formulate the strategy for prevention of global worming phenomenon.

J	Munroe, DK; Nagendra, H; Southworth, J				Munroe, Darla K.; Nagendra, Harini; Southworth, Jane			Monitoring landscape fragmentation in an inaccessible mountain area: Celaque National Park, Western Honduras	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Many protected areas across the world are in locations marginal for human uses. Debate remains about the impact of these parks on land-cover change, which may be confounded by the role played by the biophysical landscape. To test whether parks limit landscape fragmentation due to their designated protection or biophysical location, one must control for features that render the park inaccessible. We examine the effect of Celaque National Park, Honduras, on landscape fragmentation from 1987 to 2000 using remote sensing, GIS and landscape pattern analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance and covariance were conducted to examine differences in landscape fragmentation within the park and the surrounding landscape adjusting for differences in accessibility. Indicators of patch fragmentation were significantly correlated with slope, elevation and distance to roads. Different management categories within the park were found to have significant differences in land-cover change and landscape fragmentation, and the impact of management category was even more significant after accounting for the differences in accessibility that exist across these zones. Thus, the park boundaries have been important in mediating land-cover change pressures, even after accounting for the substantial differences in the accessibility of forestland for conversion to agricultural land use.

If satellite-derived vegetation indices can provide us with accurate predictions of richness and rarity in an area, they can serve as an excellent tool in diversity and conservation research, especially in inaccessible areas. The increasing availability of high-resolution satellite images is enabling us to study this question more carefully. We sampled plant richness and rarity in 34 quadrats ( 1000 m(2)) along an elevation gradient between 300 and 2200 m focusing on Mount Hermon as a case study. We then used 10 Landsat, Aster, and QuickBird satellite images ranging over several seasons, going up to very high resolutions, to examine the relationship between plant richness, rarity, and vegetation indices calculated from the images. We used the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI), one of the most commonly used vegetation indexes, which is strongly correlated to primary production both globally and locally ( in more seasonal and in drier and/or colder environments that have wide ranges of NDVI values). All images showed a positive significant correlation between NDVI and both plant species richness and percentage tree cover ( with R-2 as high as 0.87 between NDVI and total plant richness and 0.89 for annual plant richness). The high resolution images enabled us to examine spatial heterogeneity in NDVI within our quadrats. Plant richness was significantly correlated with the standard deviation of NDVI values ( but not with their coefficient of variation) within quadrats and between images. Contrary to richness, relative range size rarity was negatively correlated with NDVI in all images, this result being significant in most cases. Thus, given that they are validated by fieldwork, satellite-derived indices can shed light on richness and even rarity patterns in mountains, many of which are important biodiversity centres.				levanoni, oded/D-3095-2013; Kark, Salit/C-6795-2016; Levin, Noam/D-2180-2013; Kark, Salit/I-7123-2013	Kark, Salit/0000-0002-7183-3988; Levin, Noam/0000-0002-9434-7501; Kark, Salit/0000-0002-7183-3988; Levanoni, Oded/0000-0003-0257-8693												1366-9516					NOV	2007	13	6					692	703		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2007.00372.x								WOS:000250297300005						
J	Tian, GJ; Yang, ZF; Zhang, YQ				Tian, Guangjin; Yang, Zhifeng; Zhang, Yaoqi			The spatio-temporal dynamic pattern of rural residential land in China in the 1990s using landsat TM images and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Through interpreting Landsat TM images, this study analyzes the spatial distribution of rural settlements in China in 2000. It calculates rural residential land percentage for every 1-km(2) cell. The entire country is divided into 33 regions to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamic patterns of rural residential land during the 1990s. According to the remote sensing survey, the rural residential land increased by 7.88 x 10(5) ha in the 1990s. The increment of rural residential land was 0.55 million ha in 1990-1995 and 0.23 million ha in 1995-2000. In 1990-1995, rural residential land increased dramatically in the eastern regions such as the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and North China Plain, accounting for 80.80% of the national growth; the expansion in the western regions was much more moderate. In 1995-2000, the expansion of rural residential land in eastern regions slowed, accounting for only 58.54% of the increase at the national level, whereas the expansion in the western regions accelerated. Rapid rural residential development resulted from increasing home construction and the limited control on rural land. The great regional disparity reflected the regional economic development and land-use policy change. Our finding shows that nearly 60% of the rural residential area came from cropland.

The application of satellite data for the quantification of mangrove loss and coastal management in the Godavari estuary, East Coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The mangrove formations of Godavari estuary are due to silting over many centuries. The estuary covers an area of 62,000 ha of which dense Coringa mangrove forest spread in 6,600 ha. Satellite sensor data was used to detect change in the mangrove cover for a period of 12 years (1992-2004). It was found that an area of about 1,250 ha of mangroves was destroyed by anthropogenic interference like aquaculture, and tree felling etc. It was found that mangrove's spectral response/digital number (DN) value is much lower than non-mangrove vegetation such as plantation and paddy fields in SWIR band. By taking this as an advantage, spectral data was utilized for clear demarcation of mangroves from nearby paddy fields and other vegetation. Simpson's diversity index, which is a measure of biodiversity, was found to be 0.09, showing mangroves dominance. Ecological parameters like mud-flats/swamps, mangrove cover alterations, and biodiversity status are studied in detail for a period of 12 years. The increase in mangrove front towards coast was delineated using remote sensing data. The major advantages of remote sensing data is monitoring of change periodically. The combination of moderate and high-resolution data provided detailed coastal land use maps for implementing coastal regulation measures. The classification accuracy has been achieved is 90%. Overall, simple and viable measures are suggested based on multi-spectral data to sustain this sensitive coastal ecology.

Object-based classification of ikonos imagery for mapping large-scale vegetation communities in urban areas	SENSORS												Effective assessment of biodiversity in cities requires detailed vegetation maps. To date, most remote sensing of urban vegetation has focused on thematically coarse land cover products. Detailed habitat maps are created by manual interpretation of aerial photographs, but this is time consuming and costly at large scale. To address this issue, we tested the effectiveness of object-based classifications that use automated image segmentation to extract meaningful ground features from imagery. We applied these techniques to very high resolution multispectral Ikonos images to produce vegetation community maps in Dunedin City, New Zealand. An Ikonos image was orthorectified and a multi-scale segmentation algorithm used to produce a hierarchical network of image objects. The upper level included four coarse strata: industrial/commercial (commercial buildings), residential (houses and backyard private gardens), vegetation (vegetation patches larger than 0.8/1ha), and water. We focused on the vegetation stratum that was segmented at more detailed level to extract and classify fifteen classes of vegetation communities. The first classification yielded a moderate overall classification accuracy (64%, k = 0.52), which led us to consider a simplified classification with ten vegetation classes. The overall classification accuracy from the simplified classification was 77% with a k value close to the excellent range (k = 0.74). These results compared favourably with similar studies in other environments. We conclude that this approach does not provide maps as detailed as those produced by manually interpreting aerial photographs, but it can still extract ecologically significant classes. It is an efficient way to generate accurate and detailed maps in significantly shorter time. The final map accuracy could be improved by integrating segmentation, automated and manual classification in the mapping process, especially when considering important vegetation classes with limited spectral contrast.

BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Protected areas are crucial for Amazonian nature conservation. Many Amazonian reserves have been selected systematically to achieve biodiversity representativeness. We review the role natural-scientific understanding has played in reserve selection, and evaluate the theoretical potential of the existing reserves to cover a complete sample of the species diversity of the Amazonian rainforest biome. In total, 108 reserves ( 604,832 km(2)) are treated as strictly protected and Amazonian; 87 of these can be seen as systematically selected to sample species diversity ( 75.3% of total area). Because direct knowledge on all species distributions is unavailable, surrogates have been used to select reserves: direct information on some species distributions ( 15 reserves, 14.8% of total area); species distribution patterns predicted on the basis of conceptual models, mainly the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, ( 5/ 10.3%); environmental units ( 46/ 27.3%); or a combination of distribution patterns and environmental units ( 21/ 22.9%). None of these surrogates are reliable: direct information on species distributions is inadequate; the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis is highly controversial; and environmental classiWcations do not capture all relevant ecological variation, and their relevance for species distribution patterns is undocumented. Hence, Amazonian reserves cannot be safely assumed to capture all Amazonian species. To improve the situation, transparency and an active dialogue with the scientific community should be integral to conservation planning. We suggest that the best currently available approach for sampling Amazonian species diversity in reserve selection is to simultaneously inventory indicator plant species and climatic and geological conditions, and to combine Weld studies with remote sensing.

AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Forest structure and habitat complexity have been used extensively to predict the distribution and abundance of insect assemblages in forest ecosystems. We tested empirically derived predictions of strong, consistent relationships between wasp assemblages and habitat complexity, using both field assessments and vegetation indices from remote sensing as measures of habitat complexity. Wasp samples from 26 paired 'high and low' complexity sites in two forests approximately 70 km apart, were compared with normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) derived from multispectral videography of the survey sites. We describe a strong unequivocal link between habitat complexity and wasp communities, the patterns holding over coarse and fine landscape scales. NDVIs were also excellent predictors of habitat complexity and hence wasp community patterns. Sites with greater NDVIs consistently supported a greater abundance and species richness, and a different composition of wasps to sites with low NDVIs. Using vegetation indices from remote sensing to gauge habitat complexity has significant potential for ecosystem modelling and rapid biodiversity assessment.

This study draws on multiple sources of data from remote sensing, together with ground observations and water sampling, to distinguish floodplain ecosystems in the Madre de Dios River, a tributary of the Amazon River in Peru. This remote tropical river meanders across sub-Andean alluvial deposits in a tectonically active region and creates floodplain surfaces of varying ages, including terraces that are above the reach of present-day river floods. Data from Landsat ETM+(optical multispectral), JERS-1 (L-band radar), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (C-band interferometric Digital Elevation Models) were integrated in an object-oriented image analysis approach to distinguish five classes of floodplain vegetation. Vegetation classes generally correspond with successional age and reflect the activity of the riverine meander belt. Stage data for the river show erratic fluctuations and an annual range exceeding 8 m, but the maximum depth of floodplain inundation varied from > 1 m close to the river to approximately 0.1 m on more elevated ten-aces. The major ion composition of standing waters on the floodplain during the dry season indicated the importance of emergence of local groundwater in maintaining saturated soils, particularly further from the river, where backswamp vegetation is distinct and includes palm swamps. Thus, a hydrological continuum exists from deep but sporadic river inundation near the river to constant soil saturation by groundwater emergence in distal backswamps, reflecting the geomorphological origin and age of the floodplain deposits. This hydrogeomorphic continuum results in fundamental ecological differences. The exceptionally rich biodiversity of the sub-Andean region may be ascribed in part to the enhanced biodiversity associated with fluvial geomorphological features, and, thus, conservation planning must account for the diverse landforms created by fluvial dynamics.

Habitat modeling for Amaranthus pumilus: An application of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Anthropogenic management of dynamic ecosystems has led to decline of species dependent on processes that maintain suitable habitat, particularly on barrier islands. By evaluating environmental variables over large geographic areas, remote-sensing data and geographic information systems (GIS) hold increasing promise for management of these unique habitats and their species associates. We used light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to extract habitat variables for Amaranthus pumilus, a federally threatened flowering annual of the Atlantic barrier islands. We asked: (1) can habitat variables for A. pumilus be extracted from remote-sensing data, and (2) can these variables be used to model suitable habitat? We extracted topographic habitat variables for naturally occurring plants and evaluated habitat using multiple statistical techniques and other published model performance measures. We found that elevation was the most limiting topographic variable controlling the occurrence of Amaranthus pumilus. The most occurrences fell with in a 1.23 m range relative to local mean high water. Additionally, we used digital imagery collected concurrently with the LIDAR data to assess the role of vegetation cover in A. pumilus distribution. The occurrence of seabeach amaranth in previous years also was factored into the models. The models performed well, predicting 460%-100% of the plant occurrences using as little as 2% of the habitat. Amaranthus pumilus can potentially serve as a conservation "umbrella" for coastal biodiversity. The methods presented here for identification of A. pumilus habitat, using GIS and model construction of potential habitat, can be applied to other species of concern, including nesting shorebirds and sea turtles.																	0749-0208					SEP	2007	23	5					1193	1202		10.2112/04-0334.1								WOS:000249619100014

Bird distributions relative to remotely sensed habitats in Great Britain: Towards a framework for national modelling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper develops a comprehensive and objective picture of bird distributions relative to habitats across Britain. Bird species presence/absence data from an extensive field survey and habitat data from the remotely sensed UK Land Cover Map 2000 were analysed in 36,920 tetrads (2km x 2km) across Britain (a 65 % sample of Britain's c. 240 000 km(2). Cluster analysis linked birds to generalised landscapes based on distinctive habitat assemblages. Maps of the clusters showed strong regional patterns associated with the habitat assemblages. Cluster centroid coordinates for each bird species and each habitat were combined across clusters to derive individualised bird-habitat preference indices and examine the importance of individual habitats for each bird species. Even rare species and scarce habitats showed successful linkages. Results were assessed against published accounts of bird-habitat relations. Objective corroboration strongly supported the associations. Relatively scarce coastal and wetland habitats proved particularly important for many birds. However, extensive arable farmland and woodland habitats were also favoured by many species, despite reported declines in bird numbers in these habitats. The fact that habitat-specialists do not or cannot move habitat is perhaps a reason for declining numbers where habitats have become unsuitable. This study showed that there are unifying principles determining bird-habitat relations which apply and can be quantified at the national scale, and which corroborate and complement the cumulative knowledge of many and varied surveys and ecological studies. This 'generality' suggests that we may be able, reliably and objectively, to integrate and scale up such disparate studies to the national scale, using this generalised framework. It also suggests the potential for a landscape ecology approach to bird-habitat analyses. Such developments will be important steps in building models to develop and test the sustainable management of landscapes for birds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hefin; Sousa, Jose Paulo			Scale-specific correlations between habitat heterogeneity and soil fauna diversity along a landscape structure gradient	OECOLOGIA												Habitat heterogeneity contributes to the maintenance of diversity, but the extent that landscape-scale rather than local-scale heterogeneity influences the diversity of soil invertebrates-species with small range sizes-is less clear. Using a Scottish habitat heterogeneity gradient we correlated Collembola and lumbricid worm species richness and abundance with different elements (forest cover, habitat richness and patchiness) and qualities (plant species richness, soil variables) of habitat heterogeneity, at landscape (1 km(2)) and local (up to 200 m(2)) scales. Soil fauna assemblages showed considerable turnover in species composition along this habitat heterogeneity gradient. Soil fauna species richness and turnover was greatest in landscapes that were a mosaic of habitats. Soil fauna diversity was hump-shaped along a gradient of forest cover, peaking where there was a mixture of forest and open habitats in the landscape. Landscape-scale habitat richness was positively correlated with lumbricid diversity, while Collembola and lumbricid abundances were negatively and positively related to landscape spatial patchiness. Furthermore, soil fauna diversity was positively correlated with plant diversity, which in turn peaked in the sites that were a mosaic of forest and open habitat patches. There was less evidence that local-scale habitat variables (habitat richness, tree cover, plant species richness, litter cover, soil pH, depth of organic horizon) affected soil fauna diversity: Collembola diversity was independent of all these measures, while lumbricid diversity positively and negatively correlated with vascular plant species richness and tree canopy density. Landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity affects soil diversity regardless of taxon, while the influence of habitat heterogeneity at local scales is dependent on taxon identity, and hence ecological traits, e.g. body size. Landscape-scale habitat heterogeneity by providing different niches and refuges, together with passive dispersal and population patch dynamics, positively contributes to soil faunal diversity.

This study is designed to evaluate the consequences of human and natural impacts on changes in secondary forest succession land cover from 1972 to 2002 in the Artvin Forest Planning Unit, in NE Turkey. This paper also contributes to the development of a framework for effective conservation of biodiversity through,forest management plans by using successional stages and land cover types. Secondary forest succession stages and land cover types were determined according to Clementsian theory and mapped with Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) technologies through aerial photos and high resolution satellite images (IKONOS). The results indicated that the forest area in 1972 and 2002 was 88% and 80%, and the number of forest patches were 106 and 222, respectively. While the total road length in the Forest Planning Unit (FPU) was 67.7 km in 1972, it was 130.0 km in 2002, an increase of 62.3 km. Results shou, that urbanisation, industrial development and darn construction, together with unregulated forestry activities with clear-cut as well as insect outbreaks, affected the secondary forest succession and fragmented the forest ecosystem in the study area. Determining the secondary forest succession in detail is necessary for the sustainable management of such fragmented forest areas and for the preparation of biodiversity-friendly integrated forest management plans.

A spatial analysis of cumulative habitat loss in Southern California under the Clean Water Act Section 404 program	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Habitat loss is the leading cause of biodiversity reduction in the world today, with wetlands having experienced especially large losses in the United States and elsewhere. Using remote sensing and GIS techniques, this study quantified cumulative habitat loss in two Southern California watersheds associated with Clean Water Act Section 404 permits, primarily for developments, issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1984 to 2002. While the majority of habitat loss occurred outside of explicitly 404-authorized developments, non-explicitly authorized development represented a substantial fraction of observed habitat loss. The spatial distribution of habitat loss and 404 permits were analyzed statistically. In almost all cases, percent habitat loss was significantly correlated with variables representing 404 authorizations. These correlations may indicate the presence of incidental authorizations, suggesting that 404 authorizations within the study area may have indirectly facilitated nearby development (i.e., growth-inducing impacts). This study expanded the use of remote sensing, GIs, and spatial statistics for the purpose of regulatory-driven cumulative impact assessment. Until resource agencies quantify cumulative impacts in a spatially explicit manner and analyze those data statistically, there can be little rigorous scientific basis for formulating regulatory or policy decisions regarding cumulative impacts.

J	Suess, K; Storm, C; Zimmermann, K; Schwabe, A				Suess, Karin; Storm, Christian; Zimmermann, Kai; Schwabe, Angelika			The interrelationship between productivity, plant species richness and livestock diet: a question of scale?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: What relationship exists between productivity, plant species richness and livestock diet? Are the results dependent on scale? Location: A sheep-grazed Koelerio-Corynephoretea sandy habitat of the northern upper Rhine (Germany) as a low productivity model system. Methods: The investigation was carried out for three years at a fine scale (2 m(2)) and for two years at a broad scale (79 m(2)). Productivity was measured by means of weighed above-ground phytomass for fine scale and colour-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs of the same system for fine and broad scales. For both scales, total numbers of vascular plant species and numbers of endangered vascular plant species were extracted from current vegetation releves. Additionally, we obtained data on livestock diet (grazed phytomass, crude protein content). Results: Statistical analyses show an influence of the year on all variables; relationships between variables are not significant in ever), year. Species richness and number of endangered species are negatively related to productivity at fine scale while crude protein content and grazed phytomass are positively related to productivity. At the broad scale the diversity-productivity relationship shows a 'hump' with highest species numbers in middle pioneer stages: numbers of endangered species are highest in all pioneer stages. Conclusions: We found a strong impact of scale and year on the diversity-productivity relationship. It is inappropriate to analyse only small plots (2 m(2)). and it is necessary to study different years. This vegetation complex is dependent on grazing impact; thus there is an inversely proportional relationship between nature conservation value (high diversity) and livestock nutrition.																	1402-2001					AUG	2007	10	2					169	182										WOS:000247766700003

Changes in high-altitude Polylepis forest cover and quality in the Cordillera de Vilcanota, Peru, 1956-2005	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												High-altitude Polylepis forest is distributed throughout the Andes and represents one of the most threatened Neotropical vegetation types. It is an important habitat for a range of associated endemic species and provides vital natural resources to poor highland people, but these forests are threatened by over- exploitation and land management practices. Changes to Polylepis forests over a 50-year period in the Cordillera de Vilcanota, Perfi, were examined using air photographs and extensive field observations and photographs. Structured interviews were carried out with local farmers to record their perceptions of forest change over recent decades. Only about 1% of forest patches had been lost completely during the study period. There was no significant change in forest patch size, though larger patches tended to have denser canopies. Across all altitudes, about 10% of the forest showed a significant decline in canopy density, with very little forest showing the opposite trend. The majority of local farmers who were interviewed collected fuelwood from the forests and grazed their livestock there, but recognised the degradation these activities caused to canopy density and tree size. it is likely that the degradation of these forests over time has had an adverse impact on forest dynamics, associated biodiversity, ecological function and ecosystem services. More attention should be given to measuring and monitoring habitat quality of Polylepis forest, and conservation efforts should, in part at least, be refocused on protecting and enhancing the habitat quality of extant patches. However, habitat quality is difficult to define and measure, and presents a significant challenge to scientists, conservationists and local people. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conservation management of these precious ecosystems relies on accurate and up-to-date information about ecosystem health and the distribution of species and habitats, but such information can be costly to gather and interpret in the field. Remote sensing has proven capable of collecting information on geomorphologic zones and substrate types for coral reef environments, and is cost-effective when information is needed for large areas. Remote sensing-based mapping of coral habitat variables known to influence biodiversity has only recently been undertaken and new sensors and improved data processing show great potential in this area. This paper reviews coral reef biodiversity, the influence of habitat variables on its local spatial distribution, and the potential for remote sensing to produce maps of these habitat variables, thus indirectly mapping coral reef biodiversity and fulfilling information needs of coral reef managers.

Arturo; Portillo-Quintero, Carlos; Davies, Diane			Poverty and corruption compromise tropical forest reserves	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We used the global fire detection record provided by the satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to determine the number of fires detected inside 823 tropical and subtropical moist forest reserves and for contiguous buffer areas 5, 10, and 15 km wide. The ratio of fire detection densities (detections per square kilometer) inside reserves to their contiguous buffer areas provided an index of reserve effectiveness. Fire detection density was significantly lower inside reserves than in paired, contiguous buffer areas but varied by five orders of magnitude among reserves. The buffer : reserve detection ratio varied by up to four orders of magnitude among reserves within a single country, and median values varied by three orders of magnitude among countries. Reserves tended to be least effective at reducing fire frequency in many poorer countries and in countries beset by corruption. Countries with the most successful reserves include Costa Rica, Jamaica, Malaysia, and Taiwan and the Indonesian island of Java. Countries with the most problematic reserves include Cambodia, Guatemala, Paraguay, and Sierra Leone and the Indonesian portion of Borneo. We provide fire detection density for 3964 tropical and subtropical reserves and their buffer areas in the hope that these data will expedite further analyses that might lead to improved management of tropical reserves.

The question is how forest cover is changing in different parts of the world, why some areas are more frequently disturbed, and if protected areas are effective in limiting anthropogenic forest disturbance. The Carpathians are Eastern Europe's largest contiguous forest ecosystem and are a hotspot of biodiversity. Eastern Europe has undergone dramatic changes in political and socioeconomic structures since 1990, when socialistic state economies transitioned toward market economies. However, the effects of the political and economic transition on Carpathian forests remain largely unknown. Our goals were to compare post-socialist forest disturbance and to assess the effectiveness of protected areas in the border triangle of Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine, to better understand the role of broadscale political and socioeconomic factors. Forest disturbances were assessed using the forest disturbance index derived from Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ images from 1978 to 2000. Our results showed increased harvesting in all three countries (up to 1.8 times) in 1988-1994, right after the system change. Forest disturbance rates differed markedly among countries (disturbance rates in Ukraine were 4.5 times higher than in Poland, and those in Slovakia were 4.3 times higher than in Poland), and in Ukraine, harvests tended to occur at higher elevations. Forest fragmentation increased in all three countries but experienced a stronger increase in Slovakia and Ukraine (similar to 5% decrease in core forest) than in Poland. Protected areas were most effective in Poland and in Slovakia, where harvesting rates dropped markedly (by nearly an order of magnitude in Slovakia) after protected areas were designated. In Ukraine, harvesting rates inside and outside protected areas did not differ appreciably, and harvests were widespread immediately before the designation of protected areas. In summary, the socioeconomic changes in Eastern Europe that occurred since 1990 had strong effects on forest disturbance. Differences in disturbance rates among countries appear to be most closely related to broadscale socioeconomic conditions, forest management practices, forest policies, and the strength of institutions. We suggest that such factors may be equally important in other regions of the world.

Satellite detection of bird communities in tropical countryside	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The future of biodiversity hinges partly on realizing the potentially high conservation value of human-dominated countryside. The characteristics of the countryside that promote biodiversity preservation remain poorly understood, however, particularly at the fine scales at which individual farmers tend to make land use decisions. To address this problem, we explored the use of a rapid remote sensing method for estimating bird community composition in tropical countryside, using a two-step process. First, we asked how fine-grained variation in land cover affected community composition. Second, we determined whether the observed changes in community composition correlated with three easily accessible remote sensing metrics (wetness, greenness, and brightness), derived from performing a tasseled-cap transformation on a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image. As a comparison, we also examined whether the most commonly used remote sensing indicator in ecology, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), correlated with community composition. We worked within an agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica, where the land comprised a complex and highly heterogeneous mosaic of remnant native vegetation, pasture, coffee cultivation, and other crops. In this region, we selected 12 study sites (each <60 ha) that encompassed the range of available land cover possibilities in the countryside. Within each site, we surveyed bird communities within all major land cover types, and we conducted detailed field mapping of land cover. We found that the number of forest-affiliated species increased with forest cover and decreased with residential area across sites. Conversely, the number of agriculture-affiliated species using forest increased with land area devoted to agricultural and residential uses. Interestingly, we found that the wetness and brightness metrics predicted the number of forest-and agriculture-affiliated species within a site as well as did detailed field-generated maps of land cover. In contrast, NDVI and the closely correlated greenness metric did not correlate with land cover or with bird communities. Our study shows the strong potential of the tasseled-cap transformation as a tool for assessing the conservation value of countryside for biodiversity.

Estimating species abundance in a northern temperate forest using spectral mixture analysis	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Effective, reliable methods for characterizing the spatial distribution of tree species through remote sensing would represent an important step toward better understanding changes in biodiversity, habitat quality, climate, and nutrient cycling. Towards this end, we explore the feasibility of using spectral mixture analysis to discriminate the distribution and abundance of two important forest species at the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Using hyper-spectral image data and simulated broadband sensor data, we used spectral unmixing to quantify the abundance of sugar maple and American beech, as opposed to the more conventional approach of detecting presence or absence of discrete species classes. Stronger linear relationships were demonstrated between predicted and measured abundance for hyperspectral than broadband sensor data: R-2 = 0.49 (RMSE = 0.09) versus R-2 = 0. 16 (RMSE = 0.19) for sugar maple; R-2 = 0.36 (RMSE = 0.18) versus R-2 = 0.24 (RMSE 0.33) for beech. These results suggest that spectrally unmixing hyperspectral data to estimate species abundances holds promise for a variety of ecological studies.

J	Goetz, S; Steinberg, D; Dubayah, R; Blair, B				Goetz, Scott; Steinberg, Daniel; Dubayah, Ralph; Blair, Bryan			Laser remote sensing of canopy habitat heterogeneity as a predictor of bird species richness in an eastern temperate forest, USA	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a fundamental variable indicative of species diversity, in terms of both richness and abundance. Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications.

Fish diversity in relation to landscape and vegetation in central Western Ghats, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												The Western Ghats, one of the well-known biodiversity hotspots of the world, harbours 289 species of freshwater fish of which 119 are endemic. The ecosystems in this region have been, over the past 150 years or so, experiencing tumultuous changes due to the ever-increasing human impacts. In this regard, a study was conducted in Sharavathi River, central Western Ghats to understand fish species composition with respect to landscape dynamics. The study, using a combination of remote-sensing data as well as field investigations shows that the streams having their catchments with high levels of evergreenness and endemic tree species of the Western Ghats were also richer in fish diversity and endemism, compared to those catchments with other kinds of vegetation. This illustrates that the composition and distribution of fish species have a strong association with the kind of terrestrial landscape elements and the importance of landscape approach to conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. Occurrence of endangered, endemic species and the discovery of two new species of genus Schistura reaffirm the 'hottest hotspot' status of the Western Ghats, a repository of biological wealth of a rare kind, both in its aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve resides in the center of this region as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The reserve's functions are examined in regard to land changes throughout the region, generated over the last 40 years by increasing settlement and the expansion and intensification of agriculture. These changes are documented from 1987/1988 to 2000, and their implications regarding the capacity of the reserve to protect the ecocline, forest habitats, and butterfly diversity are addressed. The results indicate that the current landscape matrix serves the biotic diversity of the reserve, with several looming caveats involving the loss of humid forests and the interruption of biota flow across the ecocline, and the amount and proximity of older forest patches beyond the reserve. The highly dynamic land cover changes underway in this economic frontier warrant an adaptive management approach that monitors the major changes underway in mature forest types, while the paucity of systematic ecological and environment-development studies is rectified in order to inform policy and practice.

Hyperspectral remote sensing of canopy biodiversity in Hawaiian lowland rainforests	ECOSYSTEMS												Mapping biological diversity is a high priority for conservation research, management and policy development, but few studies have provided diversity data at high spatial resolution from remote sensing. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy to map woody vascular plant species richness in lowland tropical forest ecosystems in Hawai'i. Hyperspectral signatures spanning the 400-2,500 nm wavelength range acquired by the NASA Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were analyzed at 17 forest sites with species richness values ranging from 1 to 17 species per 0.1-0.3 ha. Spatial variation (range) in the shape of the AVIRIS spectra (derivative reflectance) in wavelength regions associated with upper-canopy pigments, water, and nitrogen content were well correlated with species richness across field sites. An analysis of leaf chlorophyll, water, and nitrogen content within and across species suggested that increasing spectral diversity was linked to increasing species richness by way of increasing biochemical diversity. A linear regression analysis showed that species richness was predicted by a combination of four biochemically-distinct wavelength observations centered at 530, 720, 1,201, and 1,523 nm (r(2) = 0.85, p < 0.01). This relationship was used to map species richness at approximately 0.1 ha resolution in lowland forest reserves throughout the study region. Future remote sensing studies of biodiversity will benefit from explicitly connecting chemical and physical properties of the organisms to remotely sensed data.

As a result, a variety of definitions have been proposed each with varying levels of complexity and scope. While different definitions of biodiversity exist, the basic unit of measurement for the vast majority of studies is conducted at the species level. Traditional approaches to measuring species richness provide useful, yet spatially constrained information. Remote sensing offers the opportunity for large area characterizations of biodiversity in a systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive manner. Based on this review we examine the potential for a national biodiversity monitoring system for Canada driven by remote sensing, a country approaching I billion ha in area, with the aim of producing recommendations that are transferable for regional or continental applications. A combination of direct and indirect approaches is proposed, with four selected key indicators of diversity that can be derived from Earth observation data: productivity, disturbance, topography, and land cover. Monitoring these indicators through time at an ecosystem level has the potential to provide a national early warning system, indicating where areas of potential biodiversity change may be occurring. We believe the large area biodiversity monitoring system as outlined would provide an initial stratification of key areas where regional and local scale analysis can be focused, while also providing context-specific information for species collection data.

Floristic diversity and endemism in these forests appears to peak in SE Tanzania, where only a few forests have hitherto been surveyed. We carried out a digital analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to identify other potential areas of Coastal Forest in Lindi and Kilwa Districts, SE Tanzania, followed by a field survey to ground truth and fine-tune our analysis. Our analysis has identified, mapped and sub-classified all remaining areas of Coastal Forest in Lindi and Kilwa Districts, and includes the discovery of a large and hitherto undescribed area of Coastal Forest at Namatimbili, which would make it one of the largest known blocks of contiguous Coastal Forest in eastern Africa. This forest furthermore appears to be minimally impacted by human disturbance. Given the rapidly increasing threats to forested vegetation in this area, urgent efforts are required by the conservation community to ensure the immediate and continued protection of Namatimbili forest.																	0960-3115					MAY	2007	16	5					1551	1565		10.1007/s10531-006-9047-4								WOS:000246802700015

However, there is still a gap in the over-view of global patterns of species distributions. This paper reviews how remote sensing has been used to assess terrestrial faunal diversity, with emphasis on proxies and methodologies, while exploring prospective challenges for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. We grouped and discussed papers dealing with the faunal taxa mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates into five classes of surrogates of animal diversity: (1) habitat suitability, (2) photosynthetic productivity, (3) multi-temporal patterns, (4) structural properties of habitat, and (5) forage quality. It is concluded that the most promising approach for the assessment, monitoring, prediction, and conservation of faunal diversity appears to be the synergy of remote sensing products and auxiliary data with ecological biodiversity models, and a subsequent validation of the results using traditional observation techniques.

J	Dessie, G; Kleman, J				Dessie, Gessesse; Kleman, Johan			Pattern and magnitude of deforestation in the south central rift valley region of Ethiopia	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												The pattern and magnitude of deforestation that occurred from 1972 to 2000 in the south central Rift Valley of Ethiopia were analyzed using remote sensing change detection techniques. The results show that natural forest cover declined from 16% in 1972 to 2.8% in 2000. The total natural forest cleared between 1972 and 2000 amounted to 40,324 ha, corresponding to an annual loss of 1440 ha. The total loss was 82% of the 1972 forest cover and the annual loss was equivalent to 0.9% of the national figure. The forest decline in the area involved proximate causal factors as well as causal factors that are more spatially diffuse and are part of the long-term evolution of a region much larger than the study area. In order of importance, the major causes of change were small-scale agriculture, commercial logging, and commercial farms. Two major modes of change were observed: 1) internal, ie openings created by small farm plots, grazing lands, and villages; and 2) external, ie expansion of agriculture from the exterior into the forests. The main consequences of deforestation were habitat destruction and decline of water availability.																	0276-4741					MAY	2007	27	2					162	168		10.1659/mrd.0730								WOS:000247271700011

We used newly available spatial and remote sensing datasets, including spacebome optical and radar observations, and new techniques of spatial data analysis to generate subbasin (>= 100 km(2)), stream, and floodplain and wetland habitat classifications. We then generated a preliminary plan for a network of conservation areas to protect the most intact examples of representative habitat types while maximizing longitudinal and lateral connectivity. Proposed additions for freshwater conservation complement existing reserves and build on earlier conservation planning efforts for terrestrial ecosystems. In the resulting integrated plan, at least 20% of the area of each major freshwater habitat type is represented and two continuous corridors exist from the mouth of the Madre de Dios to its headwaters in the Andes. In total, we highlighted 84 currently unprotected subbasins to fulfill our representation and connectivity goals. About two-thirds of these subbasins were considered relatively undisturbed and are identified as Level I (critical management zones) or Level II (indigenous territories), whereas one-third are potentially degraded and thus were designated as Level III (threat mitigation zones). This exercise provides an example of how newly available remote-sensing datasets and analytical tools may be used to advance freshwater conservation planning, particularly in data-poor regions.

Coupling ecology and GIS to evaluate efficacy of marine protected areas in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In order to properly determine the efficacy of marine protected areas ( MPAs), a seascape perspective that integrates ecosystem elements at the appropriate ecological scale is necessary. Over the past four decades, Hawaii has developed a system of 11 Marine Life Conservation Districts ( MLCDs) to conserve and replenish marine resources around the state. Initially established to provide opportunities for public interaction with the marine environment, these MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning MPA design and function using multiple discrete sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the effficacy of existing MLCDs using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Analysis of benthic cover validated the a priori classification of habitat types and provided justification for using these habitat strata to conduct stratified random sampling and analyses of fish habitat utilization patterns. Results showed that a number of. sh assemblage characteristics (e.g., species richness, biomass, diversity) vary among habitat types, but were significantly higher in MLCDs compared with adjacent. shed areas across all habitat types. Overall. sh biomass was 2.6 times greater in the MLCDs compared to open areas. In addition, apex predators and other species were more abundant and larger in the MLCDs, illustrating the effectiveness of these closures in conserving fish populations within their boundaries. Habitat type, protected area size, and level of protection from. shing were all important determinates of MLCD effectiveness with respect to their associated. sh assemblages. Although size of these protected areas was positively correlated with a number of. sh assemblage characteristics, all appear too small to have any measurable influence on the adjacent. shed areas. These protected areas were not designed for biodiversity conservation or. sheries enhancement yet still provide varying degrees of protection for. sh populations within their boundaries. Implementing this type of biogeographic process, using remote sensing technology and sampling across the range of habitats present within the seascape, provides a robust evaluation of existing MPAs and can help to de. ne ecologically relevant boundaries for future MPA design in a range of locations.																	1051-0761					APR	2007	17	3					715	730		10.1890/06-0536								WOS:000245744500008	17494391

It is endemic to scrub habitats in southeast India which have been lost and degraded because of human land use. We used satellite images from 1991 and 2000 and two methods for classifying land cover to quantify loss of Jerdon's Courser habitat. The scrub habitats on which this species depends decreased in area by 11-15% during this short period (9.6 years), predominantly as a result of scrub clearance and conversion to agriculture. The remaining scrub patches were smaller and further from human settlements in 2000 than in 1991, implying that much of the scrub loss had occurred close to human population centres. We discuss the implications of our results for the conservation of Jerdon's Courser and the use of remote sensing methods in conservation.

J	Falcucci, A; Maiorano, L; Boitani, L				Falcucci, Alessandra; Maiorano, Luigi; Boitani, Luigi			Changes in land-use/land-cover patterns in Italy and their implications for biodiversity conservation	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Land-use/land-cover change is the most important factor in causing biodiversity loss. The Mediterranean region has been affected by antropic disturbance for thousands of years, and is, nowadays, one of the most significantly altered hotspots in the world. However, in the last years a significant increase in forest cover has been measured. These new patterns are independent from planned conservation strategies and appear to have a substantial impact on landscapes and biodiversity. We used three land-use/land-cover maps (from 1960 to 2000) covering the Italian peninsula to analyze the pattern of land-use/land-cover change. We measured an increase in forests, especially in mountains, an increase in artificial areas, especially in coastal zones, and a decrease in pastures. Intensively cultivated areas showed a limited decrease while extensively cultivated ones showed a marked decrease. In the same period mammal and bird species followed a similar pattern, with forest birds, ungulates and carnivores increasing, and typically Mediterranean species decreasing. We suggest that our results may provide important information, which could be useful for conservation planning in the entire Mediterranean hotspot. We suggest that an increasing conservation effort should be made to protect the Mediterranean-type forests and scrublands, as well as traditional agricultural practices. Moreover, future conservation efforts should consider the broad socio-political and ecological processes that are most likely to occur across the whole hotspot, especially along coastal areas, and the network of protected areas should be functionally integrated in a conservation strategy that includes the human-dominated landscape.

Numerous areas within this landscape are considered 'sacred' by the indigenous Tibetans of the region, who interact with these sites in ways potentially beneficial to conservation. Our previous remote sensing study indicated that sacred sites are found in habitats with greater species richness, diversity, and endemism than randomly selected non-sacred sites. This study examines the role of sanctity in biodiversity conservation within habitats in the Khawa Karpo region by pairing plots within the same habitats in sacred and non-sacred areas. Understory richness, diversity, cover, and number of useful species are measured; for trees, richness, diversity, cover, and density are measured. Results indicate that within habitats sanctity does not affect understory plant communities; however, within sacred areas trees are larger (p = 0.003) and forests have greater cover (p = 0.003) than non-sacred areas. Our results indicate that, whereas placement of sacred areas and preservation of vegetation cover affects useful plants, biodiversity and endemism, within habitats sacred sites preserve old growth trees and forest structure. In sum, Tibetan sacred sites are ecologically unique and important for conservation on varying scales of landscape, community, and species.																	0960-3115					MAR	2007	16	3					693	706		10.1007/s10531-005-4381-5								WOS:000244684700008						
J	Nautiyal, S; Kaechele, H				Nautiyal, Sunil; Kaechele, Harald			Adverse impacts of pasture abandonment in Himalayan protected areas: Testing the efficiency of a Natural Resource Management Plan (NRMP)	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW												The high elevational areas in the Himalayas of India are dominated by forests and alpine pastures. There are many protected areas in the region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry, the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However, the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate "is grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?".

J	Brack, CL				Brack, C. L.			National forest inventories and biodiversity monitoring in Australia	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Forests currently cover over 20% of the Australian continent and are an important resource, subject to a wide range of economic and environmental pressures. These lands support substantial numbers of forest-dependent species with national forest inventories providing important information on biodiversity. National scale information on these forests has been collected or collated since 1988 under the National Forest Inventory (NFI) programme, but substantial problems with the 'snap shot' approach have been recognized, particularly with respect to monitoring change and a consequent move towards a permanent and sample-based continental forest monitoring framework (CFMF) has been proposed. CFMF is proposed to consist of three Tiers: (1) satellite imagery of the continent to identify forest and change in forest cover; (2) systematic high-resolution remotely sensed data and (3) permanent ground points at 20 x 20 km grid interception points. The CFMF approach is in line with the international trend of national forest inventories in developed countries although the Tier 2 approach offers a useful extension. An alternative inventory approach is provided by the National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) which models the mass of carbon and nitrogen in seven separate living and dead biomass pools for any point under forest or agriculture land use since 1970. The NCAS approach allows fine spatial and temporal monitoring of changes in these carbon and nitrogen biomass pools, and predictions of changes that result from policy or management decisions. This paper briefly reviews NFI, NCAS and the proposed CFMF, with particular emphasis on issues of use and potential for monitoring biodiversity in this biologically very diverse country.

A.; Wandono, Hagnyo; Setiabudi, Firman			Three decades of deforestation in southwest Sumatra: Have protected areas halted forest loss and logging, and promoted re-growth?	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Much of the forest cover in southern Sumatra, Indonesia has been cleared since the early 1970s, but accurate estimates of the scales and rates of loss are lacking. This study combined high-quality remote sensing applications and extensive field surveys, both to provide an accurate picture of deforestation patterns across an area of 1.17 million ha in southwest Sumatra and to assess whether southwest Sumatra's Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) has halted forest loss and logging, and promoted re-growth, since its creation in 1984. Of the single large (692,850 ha) contiguous area of forest standing across our study area in 1972, nearly half (344,409 ha) has been cleared from 1972 to 2002, at an average rate per original forest cover of 1.69% y(-1). In Gunung Raya Wildlife Sanctuary (GRWS) and Hydrological Reserves (HR), forests have shrunk by 28,696 ha and 113,105 ha, at an average rate of 2.74% y(-1) and 2.13% y(-1), respectively In contrast, forests in BBSNP have reduced four times more slowly than those in GRWS and HR, and have shrunk by 57,344 ha, at an average rate of 0.64% y-. Nevertheless, the forests within BBSNP were cleared almost as rapidly during the post- establishment, as during the pre-establishment, period (0.6S% y(-1) and 0.63% y(-1), respectively) despite the introduction of protection measures during the post-establishment period, following the government's pledge to expand and protect Indonesia's network of Protected Areas (PAS) at the 1982 Bali World Parks Congress. While these protection measures failed to slow down rates of forest loss caused by agricultural encroachments they reduced large-scale mechanised logging by a factor of 4.2 and stabilized some 8610 ha of agricultural encroachments, enabling forest re-growth.

Investigating spatial structure in specific tree species in ancient semi-natural woodland using remote sensing and marked point pattern analysis	ECOGRAPHY												Remote sensing classification has the potential to provide important information, such as tree species distribution maps, to ecologists, at a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, standard classification procedures often fail to provide the high accuracies required for many ecological applications. Previously, a modified remote sensing classification technique was used to provide very high classification accuracies for one or two classes (e.g. species) of interest. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate that the output from the method can be suitable for spatial ecological analyses, and to provide a generic simulation framework for assessing the adequacy of any given remote sensing classification for such analyses. Marked point pattern analysis (MPPA) was applied to tree species distribution data obtained for sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus and ash Fraxinus excelsior from a 400 ha ancient semi-natural woodland in southern England using the modified remote sensing classification method to test several hypotheses of ecological interest relating to the spatial distribution and interaction of these species. Monte Carlo simulation methods were then used to evaluate the data and data quality requirements of the MPPA to check that the classified tree species maps for sycamore and ash were adequate. Using the combined method the spatial distributions for sycamore and ash were found to be aggregated and inter-dependent at a range of spatial scales. Together, the remote sensing classification and simulation approaches provide the basis for exploiting more fully the potential of remote sensing to provide information of value to ecologists.

J	Huang, H; Zhang, L				Huang, Huamei; Zhang, Liquan			A study of the population dynamics of Spartina alterniflora at Jiuduansha shoals, Shanghai, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study investigated the population expansion pattern of an exotic species of Spartina alterniflora for a period of 7 years, after it had been newly introduced to the neonatal shoals of Jiuduansha (GPS), in the Yangtze Estuary, Shanghai. Remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems (GIS) and global positioning systems (GPS) was used to map saltmarsh vegetation on the Jiuduansha shoals and the classifications were then checked using in situ field surveys of selected areas. The results showed that the S. alterniflora population had expanded from 55 hm(2) when first introduced in 1997, to 1014 hm(2) in 2004. The population expansion pattern of S. alterniflora on the Jiuduansha shoals was compatible with the common feature of invasions, i.e. the initial colonization, a lag time and the onset of rapid population growth and range expansion. In the first year of plantation (1997), about 35 hm(2) of S. alterniflora was successfully colonized on the Jiuduansha shoals. The period between 1998 and 2000 was characterized by a lag time, and the area of S. alterniflora increased only to 101.6 hm(2). The year 2000 marked an onset of rapid population growth and range expansion and the annual expanding rate reached 25-116%, which exceeded any of the indigenous species and indicated the strong competitive capability, rapid range expansion and wide ecological niche of S. alterniflora. The advent of remote sensing, in conjunction with geographical information systems and global positioning systems, provides a potential tool for mapping vegetation, and for monitoring population dynamics and range expansion of invasive species on a large scale. The implications for population and community dynamics, biodiversity conservation and wetland management in terms of the analysis of the sequence of events associated with the initial colonization, a lag time, rate of geographic spread and features of geographic spread of the exotic S. alterniflora and the native R australis on the Jiuduansha shoals are discussed.

However, there is still a gap in the overview of global patterns of species distributions. This paper reviews how remote sensing has been used to assess terrestrial faunal diversity, with emphasis on proxies and methodologies, while exploring prospective challenges for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. We grouped and discussed papers dealing with the faunal taxa mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates into five classes of surrogates of animal diversity: (1) habitat suitability, (2) photosynthetic productivity, (3) multi-temporal patterns, (4) structural properties of habitat, and (5) forage quality. It is concluded that the most promising approach for the assessment, monitoring, prediction, and conservation of faunal diversity appears to be the synergy of remote sensing products and auxiliary data with ecological biodiversity models, and a subsequent validation of the results using traditional observation techniques.

Thus, the definition of appropriate management regimes that maintain the multiple functions of mountain regions in a time of greatly changing climatic, economic, and societal drivers constitutes a significant challenge. Management decisions must be based on a sound understanding of the future dynamics of these systems. The present article reviews the elements required for an integrated effort to project the impacts of global change on mountain regions, and recommends tools that can be used at 3 scientific levels (essential, improved, and optimum). The proposed strategy is evaluated with respect to UNESCO's network of Mountain Biosphere Reserves (MBRs), with the intention of implementing it in other mountain regions as well. First, methods for generating scenarios of key drivers of global change are reviewed, including land use/land cover and climate change. This is followed by a brief review of the models available for projecting the impacts of these scenarios on (1) cryospheric systems, (2) ecosystem structure and diversity, and (3) ecosystem functions such as carbon and water relations. Finally, the cross-cutting role of remote sensing techniques is evaluated with respect to both monitoring and modeling efforts. We conclude that a broad range of techniques is available for both scenario generation and impact assessments, many of which can be implemented without much capacity building across many or even most MBRs. However, to foster implementation of the proposed strategy, further efforts are required to establish partnerships between scientists and resource managers in mountain areas.

The ecosystem of corals is rich in biodiversity. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for categorizing coral reefs and is the most cost - effective approach for the large - scale reef survey. The Dongsha Atoll, more than 300 km(2) with an average depth of 10 m, is located at the northern continental margin of the South China Sea. It has been abused by destructive fishing during recent decades. Three satellite imageries (Quickbird2, ETM + and SPOT5) are used to evaluate the capabilities of SPOT5 imagery to provide data that are useful for categorizing the current distribution of coral reefs therein. During the data processing, unsupervised classification functions are adopted for ETM + and SPOT5 data, while the supervised classification method is used for Quickbird2. The classes are (or not) merged into coral reef, and then will be operated by vectorization, simplification, and topological analysis. There are 1 331 coral reefs larger than 100 m(2) with a detection limit of 3 x 3 pixels at the multi - band data of Quickbird2, which is taken as the comparison baseline. The results extracted from SPOT5 and ETM images are less in number and area than those from the Quickbird2 image, whereas the results from SPOT5 data are better than those of ETM data at the silty lagoon due to its higher resolution. SPOT5 XS band 2 fails to distinguish the deep substrate inside the atoll compared with ETM data because of its poor penetration capability. Only SPOT XS band 1 cannot be used to differentiate coral reef from sand bottom. Merging the SPOT5 multi - bands data with the spatial resolution of SPOT5 pan - data and referring to ETM imagery are expected to provide an optimal satellite - based approach for mapping of coral reefs.																	0253-505X						2007	26	2					26	35										WOS:000246032600003						
J	Guo, W; Li, SH; Mao, L; Yin, Y; Zhu, DK				Guo Wei; Li Shu-heng; Mao Liang; Yin Yong; Zhu Da-kui			A model for environmental impact assessment of land reclamation	CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING												Land reclamation is a complex marine environmental engineering and has a huge impact on social, economic, and physical environment. Reclamation environmental impact assessment (REIA) is also a complicated project, including the assessment of social economic background, ocean engineering, coastal geomorphology, sediment transportation, marine hydrodynamics and marine ecosystem and so on. Nowadays, a large number of land reclaimed projects have been carried out or in the process of construction along the coastal zone, thus, it is necessary to build up a framework on REM to evaluate and quantify the environmental changes, to contribute to reclamation program, to reduce marine environmental disasters, and to sustain development of coastal zone. This article focuses on the research of RELA framework theory and puts forward a REIA model on land reclaimed evaluation, at the same time, applies this assessment system in Shenzhen City, which is a highly developed coastal city with an expectation of land reclamation. By use of the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, along with the topographic map and in situ survey in reclamation area, it concludes that the area of 2680 hectares in total has been reclaimed in Shenzhen city by the end of the year 2000. Thus, reclamation is usually applied to meet the needs for infrastructure, such as harbors, industries and highways in Shenzhen City. However, some serious negative impacts have been created to the coastal environment shown clearly in the following aspects. Firstly, it caused the dramatic changes of tidal flat and channels along the western coast, made this area more unstable, which is threatening the function of the harbor in this area. Secondly, Tidal prism has decreased rapidly. During the 20 years of reclamation, the tidal prism has been reduced by 20% similar to 30% along the western coast in the Lngdingyang Estuary, and 15.6% in the Shenzhen Bay. As a result, the velocity of the tidal current has also declined, and the direction of the tidal current has changed, which is harmful to the dilution and diffusion process of the contaminants. Thirdly, it has threatened the eco-environment finally., More than 147 hectares of mangrove area along the coast of Shenzhen Bay, accounting for 48.8% of the total mangrove reserve area in this region, has been reclaimed only during the short period from 1988 to 2000. Thus, the biodiversity is decreasing, and more and more plants and animals are disappearing. Based on the above analyses of the environmental impacts, strategies and suggestions for the future reclamation in this area have been put forward in order to support the sustainable development of the coastal zone.																	0890-5487						2007	21	2					343	354										WOS:000247856500014

Mean monthly temperature images, estimated from AVHRR, were used to calculate monthly potential evapotranspiration images. Rainfall measurements were interpolated to obtain monthly rainfall images using the spline method. Results were compared with annual water mass balance for 10 internal subbasins. Model results underestimated basin evapotranspiration in -6% and water surplus was overestimated in +12%. Annual basin evapotranspiration was 1166 mm, or 3.2 mm day(-1), with a minimum in the dry season (1.7 mm day(-1) in July) and maximum in the beginning of the wet season (4.2 mm day(-1) in October). Three distinct land cover scenarios were evaluated. Complete basin deforestation reduced basin evapotranspiration and increased water deficit and surplus in approximately 200 mm yr(-1).

Multi-dimensional vegetation structure in modeling avian habitat	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The goal of this study was to evaluate the contributions of forest and landscape structure derived from remote sensing instruments to habitat mapping. Our empirical data focused at the landscape scale on a test site in northern Michigan, using radar and Landsat imagery and bird-presence data by species. We tested the contributions of multi-dimensional forest and landscape structure variables using GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production), a representative modeling methodology used in biodiversity informatics. For our multidimensional variables, radar data were processed to derive forest biomass maps and these data were used with a Landsat-derived vegetation type classification and spatial neighborhood analyses. We collected field data on bird species presence and habitat for northern forest birds known to have a range of vegetation habitat requirements. We modeled and tested the relationships between bird presence and 1) vegetation type, 2) vegetation type and spatial neighborhood descriptions, 3) vegetation type and biomass, and 4) all variables together, using GARP, for three bird species. Modeled results showed that inclusion of biomass or neighborhoods improved the accuracy of bird habitat prediction over vegetation type alone, and that the inclusion of neighborhoods and biomass together generally produced the greatest improvement. The maps and model rules resulting from the multiple factor models were interpreted to be more precise depictions of a particular species habitat when compared with the models that used vegetation type only. We suggest that for bird species whose niche requirements include forest and landscape structure, inclusion of multi-dimensional information may be advantageous in habitat modeling at the landscape level. Further research should focus on testing additional variables and species, on further integration of newer radar and lidar remote sensing capabilities with multi-spectral sensors for quantifying forest and landscape multi-dimensional structure, and incorporating these in biodiversity informatics modeling.

They allow precise delineation of bottom habitats, thus limit the number of representative biological sampling sites. the time of expedition and its costs. Remote sensing can be applied to assess the bottom biota resources, e.g.. range of occurrence of underwater meadows or Mussel beds. The paper presents the results of studies on benthic communities carried out at three locations in the southern Baltic Sea. Remote sensing methods were used in biodiversity studies on the coastal and open-sea stony reels as well as for elaboration of assessment methods of macrophytes meadows in the Puck Bay. The results proved the efficiency of the method in biodiversity studies; however, selective algorithms for multi-species underwater meadows assessment require further development.																	0324-8828						2007	33	2					193	204										WOS:000255332500021

Remote sensing as a tool for monitoring plasticulture in agricultural landscapes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Agricultural landscapes are changing their appearance with the increasing use of man-made plastic materials in covered agriculture (plasticulture) all around the world. As these affect the landscape visually, increase pollution and decrease local biodiversity, better monitoring and planning of their uses and areas are needed. Using a field spectrometer we studied the spectral properties of a sample of polyethylene sheets and various nets used in Israel. We detected three major absorption features around 1218 nm, 1732 nm and 2313 nm. These were not affected by settling dust, whitewashing or by the underlying surface, but were not apparent in black coloured polyethylene sheets or nets. A hyperspectral AISA-ES image with a spatial resolution of I in achieved a detection accuracy of above 90% for bright sheets and nets but of only 70% for the black nets. The best spectral feature for plastic mapping was found to be that around 1732nm as it does not coincide with spectral features of other minerals, soils, vegetation or atmospheric attenuation. As most of the greenhouses patches in Israel are smaller than 3200 m, the optimal spatial resolution of a sensor for mapping them should be equal or better than 8-16 m. As a result of their low spectral and spatial resolution, Landsat images proved inadequate for mapping greenhouses, and strengthen the need of hyperspectral technology for that end.

Spectral linear mixture modelling approaches for land cover mapping of tropical savanna areas in Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												It is estimated that approximately 60% of the natural vegetative cover of the Brazilian savanna, locally known as the Cerrado and the second largest biome in South America, have already been converted. Despite this rapid conversion pace, there have only been limited attempts to operationally monitor this major farming frontier with remote sensing data. In this study, we evaluated the performance of spectral linear mixture models (SLMM) for the mapping of the major Cerrado physiognomies. Two SLMMs were considered: a general model, comprising the vegetation, soil and shade components, and a specific model, restricted to the 'true' Cerrado physiognomies. We also considered the potential effects of atmospheric contamination, and the influence of endmember sources on the fraction images derived from the general and specific models, respectively. The general model, apparently resistant to the atmosphere with respect to land cover discrimination, primarily enhanced forested domains and non-vegetated targets (water bodies and bare soils). By contrast, the specific model, regardless of the endmember source, significantly distinguished the major Cerrado physiognomies. Such contrasting and complementary behavior suggests a potential synergism between the general and specific models for the mapping and monitoring of a complex environment such as the Cerrado biome.

Classification of floodplain vegetation by data fusion of spectral (CASI) and LiDAR data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												To safeguard the goals of flood protection and nature development, a river manager requires detailed and up-to-date information on vegetation structures in floodplains. In this study, remote-sensing data on the vegetation of a seminatural floodplain along the river Waal in the Netherlands were gathered by means of a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager ( CASI; spectral information) and LiDAR ( structural information). These data were used to classify the floodplain vegetation into eight and five different vegetation classes, respectively. The main objective was to fuse the CASI and LiDAR-derived datasets on a pixel level and to compare the classification results of the fused dataset with those of the non-fused datasets. The performance of the classification results was evaluated against vegetation data recorded in the field. The LiDAR data alone provided insufficient information for accurate classification. The overall accuracy amounted to 41% in the five-class set. Using CASI data only, the overall accuracy was 74% ( five-class set). The combination produced the best results, raising the overall accuracy to 81% ( five-class set). It is concluded that fusion of CASI and LiDAR data can improve the classification of floodplain vegetation, especially for those vegetation classes which are important to predict hydraulic roughness, i.e. bush and forest. A novel measure, the balance index, is introduced to assess the accuracy of error matrices describing an ordered sequence of classes such as vegetation structure classes that range from bare soil to forest.

P.; Gill, Malcolm			Bushfires 'down under': patterns and implications of contemporary Australian landscape burning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Australia is among the most fire-prone of continents. While national fire management policy is focused on irregular and comparatively smaller fires in densely settled southern Australia, this comprehensive assessment of continental-scale fire patterning ( 1997-2005) derived from similar to 1 km(2) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery shows that fire activity occurs predominantly in the savanna landscapes of monsoonal northern Australia. Statistical models that relate the distribution of large fires to a variety of biophysical variables show that, at the continental scale, rainfall seasonality substantially explains fire patterning. Modelling results, together with data concerning seasonal lightning incidence, implicate the importance of anthropogenic ignition sources, especially in the northern wet-dry tropics and arid Australia, for a substantial component of recurrent fire extent. Contemporary patterns differ markedly from those under Aboriginal occupancy, are causing significant impacts on biodiversity, and, under current patterns of human population distribution, land use, national policy and climate change scenarios, are likely to prevail, if not intensify, for decades to come. Implications of greenhouse gas emissions from savanna burning, especially seasonal emissions of CO2, are poorly understood and contribute to important underestimation of the significance of savanna emissions both in Australian and probably in international greenhouse gas inventories. A significant challenge for Australia is to address annual fire extent in fire-prone Australian savannas.

Recent studies however found extensive loss of tropical. forest habitat around protected areas, vastly contributing to increase the levels of ecotogical. isotation. Using high-resolution satellite data we investigated the isolation trend occurring in the W-Arty-Pendjari (WAP) ecological complex in West Africa. A land-cover change analysis was performed for the period 1984-2002: savanna vegetation extension and toss were derived within the complex and in a 30 km peripheral buffer. Sample regions in the buffer were also analysed using selected spatial. indicators to quantify temporal trends in habitat fragmentation. Implications for change in relative capacity to conserve biodiversity were discussed through the calculation of the species richness capacity (SRC). More than 14.5% of savanna habitat was lost in the WAP peripheral areas, while 0.3% was converted inside the complex. The degree of fragmentation of remnant savanna habitat has also drastically increased. Despite the effectiveness of the park conservation programme, we found through the SRC approach that the WAP complex is decreasing its potential capacity to conserve species richness. This process is mainly due to the rapid and extended agricultural expansion taking place around the complex. A better understanding of the ecological dynamics occurring in the peripheral regions of reserves and the consideration of development needs are key variables to achieve conservation goals in protected areas.

Comparison of predictor sets for species richness and the number of rare species of butterflies and birds	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Accurate inventories of biota are typically restricted to few locations within an extensive region. Accordingly, effective planning must involve some form of surrogate measures coupled with spatial modelling. We conducted a simultaneous comparison of models of both species richness and the number of rare species using three types of surrogates (indicator species, vegetation composition and structure, and topoclimate) as predictors. We evaluated each type of surrogate alone and in combination with others. Location Data for our analyses were collected from 1996-2004 in three adjacent mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander and Nye counties, Nevada, USA), the Shoshone Mountains, Toiyabe Range and Toquima Range. Methods Data on species richness and species composition of butterflies and birds and measures of vegetation composition and structure were obtained in the field. Topoclimatic variables were derived by GIS from digital sources and satellite images. We used Poisson regression with Bayesian model averaging to predict species richness and the number of rare species. We compared the expected prediction success of all models on the basis of internal and external validation trials. Results Same-taxon indicator species were the most accurate predictors of species richness and of the number of rare species of butterflies and birds. Cross-taxon indicator species and topoclimate variables were reasonably accurate predictors of species richness of butterflies and birds and of the number of rare butterfly species. Although vegetation variables were more effective for predicting species richness and number of rare species of birds than of butterflies, they were the least accurate predictors overall. Main conclusions Although indicator species may provide the most accurate predictions of species richness, their practical value, like any surrogate measure, depends greatly on ecological considerations and land-use context. In general, the ability to predict numbers of rare species based on any set of candidate predictors was weaker than the ability to predict species richness, which may result from the high degree of stochasticity that often characterizes distributions of rare species. Our statistical approach for objective examination of different candidate predictors can help ensure that selection of species-richness surrogates in any system is scientifically reliable and cost-effective.

Western Indian Ocean coral communities: bleaching responses and susceptibility to extinction	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A field study of coral bleaching and coral communities was undertaken spanning 8 countries and similar to 35 degrees of latitude in 2005. This was combined with studies in southern Kenya and northeast Madagascar in 1998 and Mauritius in 2004 to develop a synoptic analysis of coral community structure, bleaching response, susceptibility of the communities to bleaching, and the relative risk of extinctions in western Indian Ocean coral reefs. Cluster analysis identified 8 distinct coral communities among the 91 sites sampled, with 2 distinct communities in northern South Africa and central Mozambique, a third in the central atolls of the Maldives, and 5 less differentiated groups, in a swath from southern Kenya to Mauritius, including Tanzania, the granitic islands of the Seychelles, northeast Madagascar, and Reunion. Massive Porites, Pavona, and Pociflopora dominated the central and northern Indian Ocean sites and, from historical records, replaced dominance by Acropora and Montipora. From southern Kenya to Mauritius, coral communities were less disturbed, with Acropora and Montipora dominating, and a mix of subdominants including branching Porites, Fungia, Galaxea, massive Porites, Pocillopora, and Synarea. The survey identified an area from southernmost Kenya to Tanzania as having the least disturbed and highest diversity reefs, and as being a regional priority for management. Taxa vulnerable to future extinction based on their response to warm water, population density, and commonness include largely low-diversity genera with narrow environmental ranges, such as Gyrosmilia interrupta, Plesiastrea versipora, PlerogyTa sinuosai and Physogyra lichtensteini.

J	Sathyendranath, S; Platt, T				Sathyendranath, Shubha; Platt, Trevor			Spectral effects in bio-optical control on the ocean system	OCEANOLOGIA												The influence of phytoplankton on the spectral structure of the submarine irradiance field is reviewed. The implications for the ocean system of the spectral response by phytoplankton to the ambient light field are discussed. For example, it provides the basis for retrieval of phytoplankton biomass by visible spectral radiometry (ocean-colour remote sensing). In the computation of primary production, the results of spectral models differ in a known and systematic manner from those of non-spectral ones. The bias can be corrected without risk of incurring additional random errors. The models in use for phytoplankton growth, whether based oil available light or absorbed light, whether expressed ill terms of chlorophyll or carbon, are shown all to conform to the same basic formalism with the same parameters. Residual uncertainty lies less with the models than with the parameters required for their implementation. The submarine light field and the spectral characteristics of phytoplankton carry latent information on phytoplankton community structure. Differences in spectral response by different functional types of phytoplankton are small but significant. Optical considerations limit the maximum phytoplankton biomass that can be sustained in a given surface mixed layer. Moreover, the upper bound on the biomass depends on the spectral response of the dominant phytoplankton taxa. As a result, an optical control exists in the mixed layer that tends to resist extreme excursions of the biomass and also to maintain biodiversity in the phytoplankton.																	0078-3234						2007	49	1					5	39										WOS:000245706300001

One of the difficulties in this process is to set and achieve management objectives, and conservation targets. A sustainable forest management concept requires that a target forest structure (the composition and the configuration) be set before developing alternative management actions for the achievement of management objectives and the conservation targets. In this respect, developing and understanding vegetation succession play important roles in setting the target forest conditions. This study was conducted in the Bulanikdere Forest planning unit (Kirklareli, Turkey) where the biodiversity-integrated multiple-use forest management planning process is conducted as part of the GEF project. The seral stages of secondary forest succession were determined according to Clements's succession theory by using 639 systematically distributed sample plots in the planning unit in 2003. The secondary forest succession was generated and mapped using a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), along with aerial photographs. The paired samples t-test was used to determine whether or not there were significant differences between estimated and calculated succession values. The difference was not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. The results indicated that the forest has developed towards the climax stage. Around 70.1% of the area is in the competition stage, while the areas in the nudation, migration, and ecesis stages account for about 2.8%. Results show that anthropogenic disturbances and harvesting techniques have been the major causes of the succession. Under a selective harvesting regime, the trees left uncut or damaged would become the main components of the subsequent forest succession. The spatial database offers excellent opportunities to understand the vegetation dynamics and to help the forest manager in deciding future forest conditions for maintaining biodiversity.

On the contrary, investigations in non-neutral dynamics have in the past been limited by the complexity arising from heterogeneous demographic behaviours and by the relative paucity of detailed observations of the spatial distribution of species diversity (beta-diversity): These circumstances prevented the development and testing of explicit non-neutral mathematical descriptions linking competitive strategies and observable ecosystem properties. Here we introduce an exact non-neutral model of vegetation dynamics, based on cloning and seed dispersal, which yields closed-form characterizations of beta-diversity. The predictions of the non-neutral model are validated using new high-resolution remote-sensing observations of salt-marsh vegetation in the Venice Lagoon (Italy). Model expressions of beta-diversity show a remarkable agreement with observed distributions within the wide observational range of scales explored (5.10(-1) m divided by 10(3) m). We also consider a neutral version of the model and find its predictions to be in agreement with the more limited characterization of beta-diversity typical of the neutral theory (based on the likelihood that two sites be conspecific or heterospecific, irrespective of the species). However, such an agreement proves to be misleading as the recruitment rates by propagules and by seed dispersal assumed by the neutral model do not reflect known species characteristics and correspond to averages of those obtained under the more general non-neutral hypothesis. We conclude that non-neutral beta-diversity characterizations are required to describe ecosystem dynamics in the presence of species-dependent properties and to successfully relate the observed patterns to the underlying processes.

Geoinformatics-based management of biodiversity from landscape to species scale - An Indian perspective	CURRENT SCIENCE												Trans-scale information on biodiversity is fast becoming the critical for policy decision and action. Remote sensing systems addressing the structure and biophysical processes have the ability to achieve a seamless scalable information scheme. Necessity of down-scaling the coarse scale database to implementation scale is quite high under current circumstances, as practical schemes/ measures to reverse the erosion of biodiversity are needed. The nesting of information required should address the landscape heterogeneity and stakeholder coflicts arising out of socio-economic dimensions. Species level distributions can be predicted based on genetic algorithm-oriented fundamental niche mapping, enabling prioritization of areas for monitoring and conservation. Geoinformatics rendering of diversity on the principles of landscape ecology, integrated with spatialized anthropogenic demand patterns can be a potential interface to resolve conflicts in stake management.																	0011-3891					DEC 10	2006	91	11					1477	1485										WOS:000243169700021

The accuracy of a supervised multispectral classification of Landsat time series data encompassing seven time steps between 1972 and 2001 is numerically assessed using ground truth reference data considering the 2001 time step. Here, buffering the forest areas by 1 km, highest user's accuracies for the forest classes 'near natural + old secondary forest' (87.50%), 'secondary forest' (80.00%) and 'bushland/shrubs' (81.08%) are revealed. Images of a spatially distributed fragmentation index derived from the land cover time series by applying a three by 3 pixel-sized moving window to determine forest pixels' adjacency, highlight trends in forest fragmentation, e.g. the splitting into two separate forests along the Yala/Ikuywa corridor. Calculations of mean fragmentation indices for the Biodiversity Monitoring Transect Analysis in Eastern Africa (BIOTA-East Africa) focus research areas are used to evaluate the fragmentation index and to demonstrate its potential to extrapolate (e.g. biological) field findings in space and time. Here we argue for a correlation of the fragmentation indices results not only with forest management regimes, but with population distribution and accessibility (e.g. by roads). A cluster analysis applying the isodata-algorithm on the classification results of all seven times steps allows for a rapid visual assessment of the distinct pattern of typical land cover development trends since 1972. This reveals that parts of Kakamega Forest have experienced severe forest loss while others, especially in the north-east, show signs of succession.																	0141-6707					DEC	2006	44	4					491	506		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00663.x								WOS:000242197900010

Kolleru Lake, India's largest fresh water body, and Ramsar site have undergone tremendous changes due to the development of aquaculture. To assess the impact of aquaculture on Kolleru, satellite data were found appropriate because of the synoptic-detailed overview and accuracy. Satellite data of IRS 1D, LISS III from 2004 and Survey of India topographic maps from 1967 were processed using image processing techniques in erdas imagine and analysed in Geographical Information System (GIS) such as arc gis 9.1. Land use map prepared from the satellite data was verified in the field using Global Positioning System to check the land and water use classes and its areal extent. It was estimated from the topographic maps of 1967 that the total lake boundary area was 180.38 km(2), in which 70.70 km(2) had water throughout the year and 100.97 km(2) had water during the rainy season. The digital image processing of 2004 satellite data revealed that Kolleru was no longer a lake and the lake area of 62.65 km(2) (34.73%) only remained in a degraded state, extensively colonized by macrophytes. The total loss of lake area was 109.02 km(2) between 1967 and 2004, in which aquaculture was developed in 99.74 km(2), which represented 55.3% of the 1967 lake area. The maximum conversion to aquaculture occurred from the lake liable to be inundated during the 1967 rainy season. The area under agriculture was 16.62 km(2) in 2004, the increase in lake area for agriculture between 1967 and 2004 being 8.22 km(2) (4.55% of lake). If human induced degradation is allowed to continue, the lake will very soon disappear. Now, the Government of Andhra Pradesh, India, has initiated schemes and laws to restore the lake to its pre-development state. Lessons learnt from the Kolleru Lake cautioned that there is a need for regular monitoring of important water resources throughout the world to protect the biodiversity of the earth.																	1355-557X					DEC 1	2006	37	16					1617	1626		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01602.x								WOS:000242197500002

Biodiversity characterization in Nubra Valley, Ladakh with special reference to plant resource conservation and bioprospecting	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Trans-Himalayan mountains, owing to harsh climatic conditions and a short growing season support low vegetation cover (< 20%), yet it is known to harbour a unique assemblage of flora and fauna which have not been systematically inventoried and documented so far. This paper deals with spatial and non-spatial information on landscape units, vegetation characteristics and plant species diversity of Nubra Valley in Ladakh, India. Based on digital - visual (on screen) interpretation of remote sensing data coupled with knowledge-based classification we delineated 19 cover classes (11 vegetation types and 8 non-vegetation categories). The vascular plants (angiosperms and gymnosperms) were systematically collected using stratified random sampling of different landscape/vegetation to characterize plant communities and assess the distribution patterns of species. The study reveals that nearly 78-80% of plant species in Nubra are restricted to the valley bottoms. In all, 414 species of vascular plants were recorded from the study area. These belongs to 56 families and 202 genera. Of these, 102 species were reported to be used in traditional system of medicine by Amchis over 80 species are largely associated with cultivated fields and human habitation. As many as 49 species were cultivated which include several varieties of crop plants especially those of barley and buckwheat. Aspects of bioprospecting and conservation of valuable species have been discussed.																	0960-3115					DEC	2006	15	13					4253	4270		10.1007/s10531-005-3578-y								WOS:000242418500013

We used a data set of approximately 13,500 specimen records compiled from both historical and contemporary collections resulting from recent intensive inventory efforts to enumerate total plant species richness and to analyze the degree of endemism within littoral forests. Change in littoral forest cover from original to current extent was estimated using geographical information systems tools, remote sensing data (satellite imagery and low-elevation digital photography), and environmental data layers. Of the original littoral forest only 10.3% remains in the form of small forest parcels, and only 1.5% of these remaining fragments are included within the existing protected-areas network. Additionally, approximately 13% of Madagascar's total native flora has been recorded from these forests that originally occupied < 1% of its total land surface, and over 25% of the 1535 plant species knownfrom littoral forests are endemic to this community Given the ongoing pressure from human settlement along Madagascar's eastern coast, protection of the remaining forest fragments is critical for their survival. Fifteen of the largest intact littoral forest fragments we identified, collectively representing 41.5% of remaining littoral forest, are among priority sites recommended to the government of Madagascar for plant conservation and incorporation into the protected-areas network.																	0888-8892					DEC	2006	20	6					1799	1803		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00562.x								WOS:000242724500030	17181815

Agricultural legacies in the great basin alter vegetation cover, composition, and response to precipitation	ECOSYSTEMS												The land-use history of an ecosystem influences current structure and possibly response to modern disturbances and stresses. In semiarid systems the nature of land-use legacies is poorly understood, confounding efforts to establish sustainable management approaches. We compare previously cultivated and non-cultivated lands in Owens Valley, California, where cultivation once extended to 34% of the valley floor but was largely discontinued by 1940, to measure the influence of past disturbance on modern vegetation. We combined historic maps of cultivated and non-cultivated land with an extensive vegetation survey, historic aerial photographs, and satellite measurements of vegetation response to precipitation variability to examine the importance of land-use history in determining the sensitivity of vegetation to annual variations in precipitation. Remote sensing analysis showed that total plant cover on previously cultivated lands was lower and fluctuations in cover were marginally more dependent on precipitation compared with plant cover on non-cultivated lands. We then compared modern plant assemblages within cultivated and non-cultivated land to determine if compositional differences could explain the current patterns of vegetation cover. We found lower species richness on previously cultivated parcels, and higher frequency and cover of perennial grasses on non-cultivated lands. Therefore, we showed differences in land-cover patterns, isolated a mechanism that could account for the differences (species differences), and developed a method for remotely analyzing land regions that have experienced historic anthropogenic disturbance.

Remote sensing technology was applied in combination with field investigations to monitor and analyze the changes in these wetlands, and a combination of fusion technologies, Landsat TM/ETM+ and IKONOS imaging, was used to investigate and map them. This study indicates that not only have wetland areas been reduced by half, but also their ecological environments have been degraded because of rapid economic development and population increase. Suggestions based on this research are made to reconstruct the ecological environment of the wetlands and return them to their previous state.																	1006-9321					DEC	2006				2			97	107		10.1007/s11431-006-8097-x								WOS:000244756700012

In this study, five species were selected to examine crown-level spectral variation within and between species using HYperspectral Digital Collection Experiment (HYDICE) data collected over La Selva, Costa Rica. Spectral angle was used to evaluate the spectral variation in reflectance, first derivative and wavelet-transformed spectral domains. Results indicated that intra-crown spectral variation does not always follow a normal distribution and can vary from crown to crown, therefore presenting challenges to statistically define the spectral variation within species using conventional classification approaches that assume normal distributions. Although derivative analysis has been used extensively in hyperspectral remote sensing of vegetation, our results suggest that it might not be optimal for species identification in tropical forestry using airborne hyperspectral data. The wavelet-transformed spectra, however, were useful for the identification of tree species. The wavelet coefficients at coarse spectral scales and the wavelet energy feature are more capable of reducing variation within crowns/species and capturing spectral differences between species. The implications of this examination of intra- and inter-specific variability at crown-level were: (1) the wavelet transform is a robust tool for the identification of tree species using hyperspectral data because it can provide a systematic view of the spectra at multiple scales; and (2) it may be impractical to identify every species using only hyperspectral data, given that spectral similarity may exist between species and that within-crown/species variability may be influenced by many factors.

Relationships between visual landscape preferences and map-based indicators of landscape structure	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												There is increasing awareness of the need to monitor trends in our constantly changing agricultural landscapes. Monitoring programmes often use remote sensing data and focus on changes in land cover/land use in relation to values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreation. Although a wide range of indicators is in use, landscape aesthetics is a topic that is frequently neglected. Our aim was to determine whether aspects of landscape content and configuration could be used as surrogate measures for visual landscape quality in monitoring programmes based on remote sensing. In this paper, we test whether map-derived indicators of landscape structure from the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes are correlated with visual landscape preferences. Two groups of people participated: (1) locals and (2) non-local students. Using the total dataset, we found significant positive correlations between preferences and spatial metrics, including number of land types, number of patches and land type diversity. In addition, preference scores were high where water was present within the mapped image area, even if the water itself was not visible in the images. When the dataset was split into two groups, we found no significant correlation between the preference scores of the students and locals. Whilst the student group preferred images portraying diverse and heterogeneous landscapes, neither diversity nor heterogeneity was correlated with the preference scores of the locals. We conclude that certain indicators based on spatial structure also have relevance in relation to landscape preferences in agricultural landscapes. However, the finding that different groups of people prefer different types of landscape underlines the need for care when interpreting indicator values. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Ullas			Prioritisation of conservation areas in the Western Ghats, India	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Areas of high conservation value were identified in the Western Ghats using a systematic conservation planning approach. Surrogates were chosen and assessed for effectiveness on the basis of spatial congruence using Pearson's correlations and Mantel's tests. The surrogates were, threatened and endemic plant and vertebrate species, unfragmented forest areas, dry forests, sub-regionally rare vegetation types, and a remotely sensed surrogate for unique evergreen ecosystems. At the scale of this analysis, amphibian richness was most highly correlated with overall threatened and endemic species richness, whereas mammals, especially wide-ranging species, were better at capturing overall animal and habitat diversity. There was a significant relationship between a remote sensing based habitat surrogate and endemic tree diversity and composition. None of the taxa or habitats served as a complete surrogate for the others. Sites were prioritised on the basis of their irreplaceability value using all five surrogates. TWO alternative reserve networks are presented, one with minimal representation of surrogates, and the second with 3 occurrences of each species and 25% of each habitat type. These networks cover 8% and 29% of the region respectively. Seventy percent of the completely irreplaceable sites are outside the current protected area network. While the existing protected area network meets the minimal representation target for 88% of the species chosen in this study and all of the habitat surrogates, it is not representative with regard to amphibians, endemic tree species and small mammals. Much of the prioritised unprotected area is under reserve forests and can thus be incorporated into a wider network of conservation areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lake Victoria is the second largest lake in the world and the largest tropical lake. Bordered by Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya, it provides a livelihood for millions of Africans in the region. However, the lake is under threat from eutrophication, a huge decline in the number of native fish species caused by several factors including loss of biodiversity, over fishing and pollution has been recently documented. Increasing usage of pesticides and insecticides in the adjacent agricultural areas as well as mercury contamination from processing of gold ore on the southern shores are currently considered among the most emergent phenomena of chemical contamination in the lake. By the application of globally consistent and comprehensive geospatial data-sets based on remote sensing integrated with information on heavy metals accumulation and insecticides exposure in native and alien fish populations, the present study aims at assessing the environmental risk associated to the contamination of the Lake Victoria water body on fish health, land cover distribution, biodiversity and the agricultural area surrounding the lake. By the elaboration of Landsat 7 TM data of November 2002 and Landsat 7 TM 1986 we have calculated the agriculture area which borders the Lake Victoria bay, which is an upland plain. This process has greatly enhanced nutrient loading to the soil, which is subsequently transported to the lake by rain or as dry fall. All the data has been insert in the Geographical information System (ARCGIS) to be upgraded and consulted. Heavy metals in fish fillets showed concentrations rather low except for mercury being higher than others as already described in previous investigations. In the same tissue, cholinesterases activity (ChE) as an indicator of insecticides exposure showed significant differences among fish species in both activity and sensitivity of selected inhibitor insecticides. This integrated approach aims at identifying and quantifying selected aquatic environmental issues which integrated with monitoring techniques such as contaminant concentrations and biological responses to insecticides exposure in fish populations will provide a scientific basis for aquatic zones management and assist in policy formulations at the national and international levels.

M.; Vlok, Jan; Thompson, Mark; Balmford, Andrew			Getting the biodiversity intactness index right: the importance of habitat degradation data	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Given high-level commitments to reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, there is a pressing need to develop simple and practical indicators to monitor progress. In this context, a biodiversity intactness index (BII) was recently proposed, which provides an overall indicator suitable for policy makers. The index links data on land use with expert assessments of how this impacts the population densities of well-understood taxonomic groups to estimate current population sizes relative to premodern times. However, when calculated for southern Africa, the resulting BII of 84% suggests a far more positive picture of the state of wild nature than do other large-scale estimates. Here, we argue that this discrepancy is in part an artefact of the coarseness of the land degradation data used to calculate the BII, and that the overall BII for southern Africa is probably much lower than 84%. In particular, based on two relatively inexpensive, ground-truthed studies of areas not generally regarded as exceptional in terms of their degradation status, we demonstrate that Scholes and Biggs might have seriously underestimated the extent of land degradation. These differences have substantial bearing on BII scores. Urgent attention should be given to the further development of cost-effective ground-truthing methods for quantifying the extent of land degradation in order to provide reliable estimates of biodiversity loss, both in southern Africa and more widely.

We explain and predict the spatial variation of alpha (i.e. within plot) and beta (i.e. between plot) tree diversity in a tropical montane landscape subjected to a high deforestation rate. A major aim is to demonstrate the potential of a method that combines data from multiple sources (field data, remote sensing imagery and GIS) to evaluate and monitor forest diversity on a broad scale over large unexplored areas. Location The study covered an area of c. 3500 km(2) in the Highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Methods We identified all of the tree species within 204 field plots (1000 m(2) each) and measured different environmental, human disturbance-related, and spatial variables using remote sensing and GIS data. To obtain a predictive model of alpha tree diversity (Fisher's alpha) based on selected explanatory variables, we used a generalized linear model with a gamma error distribution. Mantel tests of matrix correspondence were used to determine whether similarities in floristic composition were correlated with similarities in the explanatory variables. Finally, we used a method that combines alpha and beta tree diversity to define priority areas for conservation. Results The model for alpha tree diversity explained 44% of the overall variability, of which most was mainly related to precipitation, temperature, NDVI, and canopy (all relationships were positive, and quadratic for temperature and NDVI). There were no spatially structured regional factors that were ignored. Similarity in tree composition was correlated positively with climate and NDVI. Main conclusions The results were used to: (1) identify and assign conservation priority of unexplored areas that have high tree diversity, and (2) demonstrate the importance of several vegetation formations in the region's biodiversity. The method we present can be particularly useful in assessing regional needs and in developing local conservation strategies in poorly surveyed (and often at risk) tropical areas worldwide, where accessibility is usually limited.

Land cover change within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve: 1974-2001	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Estuarine water bodies provide a land to sea (freshwater to saltwater) transition zone. Protected from the full force of waves, winds, and storms by topographic features, e.g., reefs and barrier islands, estuaries provide habitats for countless numbers of plant and animal species. An estuary's wetlands, including salt marshes, naturally improve,all water quality by acting as filters. Thus, there are societal benefits to preserving estuaries. The U.S. government, in fact, passed the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, creating the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) System. The present study documents temporal land cover change occurring during the period 1974-2001 within the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (GBNERR)-the 24th NERR, designated in 1999. Occupying an area of 7284 hectares, it is one of the largest relatively undisturbed estuarine marsh-pine savanna habitats remaining on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Results were obtained by applying both unsupervised classification and change detection techniques to data derived from Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1974, 1991, and 2001, respectively. Land cover classes included open water, herbaceous wetland, forest, and barren land. For change detection analysis, change matrices were derived from postclassified pairs of successive image dates, yielding two change matrices. A map of overall cover change between 1974 and 2001 was also produced. Submersion of wetlands by water, attributed to a combination of factors, including rising sea levels, land subsidence, and historical geomorphologic changes that increased wave action and decreased sedimentation, caused a majority of the observed changes. Such a broad land cover analysis provides resource managers with information regarding the estuary's land cover types and spatial distributions, allowing for more informed decisions with regard to preserving biodiversity and planning restoration efforts.																	0749-0208					NOV	2006	22	6					1552	+		10.2112/05-0582.1								WOS:000242695100023

Linking restoration to the wider landscape: A study of a bracken control experiment within a upland moorland landscape mosaic in the Peak District, UK	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The reasons for choice of restoration target are often driven by policy objectives such as the requirements of Agri-environment schemes or Biodiversity Action Plans, where the target community may not reflect the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. Here, we relate the results of a restoration experiment designed to reverse succession by controlling bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and restoring moorland within the context of the surrounding landscape. Our study included three parts: (1) we tested the effects of the bracken control/restoration treatments within a relatively long-term experiment; (2) we used high spatial resolution aerial photography to produce a map of the landscape surrounding with 13 component land classes, and then estimated the composition and configuration of the landscape; (3) we compared the species in standing vegetation and soil diaspore bank and the vegetation communities in the experimental area and the wider landscape. The restoration treatments applied experimentally showed varying degrees of success. The bracken cover was reduced to varying degrees and for various periods by control, and the species number and cover increased over the 10 years. The vegetation communities (UK NVC classes) produced showed a mixture of responses, some close to the target and some not; these varied from dense bracken stands through to well-established Calluna and grass-heath mosaics, with some woodland communities. Comparison of the experiment with the landscape indicated that the restoration work had successfully created some of the target communities. However, it also showed that within the experiment there were some unwanted communities typical of disturbed habitats, there was a lack of mire communities, which were prevalent in the wider landscape, and there were some developing woodland communities. The latter result suggests it may have been more sensible to choose a woodland target on this site rather than moorland. The wider landscape had a fine-grained texture, was highly fragmented and had an intermixed distribution of many communities, with mires having a more complex structure than communities on drier soils.

Predicting the effects of habitat homogenization on marine biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Seafloor habitats throughout the world's oceans are being homogenized by physical disturbance. Even though seafloor sediments are commonly considered to be simple and unstructured ecosystems, the negative impacts of habitat homogenization are widespread because resident organisms create much of their habitat's structure. We combine the insight gained from remote sensing of seafloor habitats with recently developed analytical techniques to estimate species richness and assess the potential for change with habitat homogenization. Using habitat-dependent species-area relationships we show that realistic scenarios of habitat homogenization predict biodiversity losses when biogenic habitats in soft sediments are homogenized. We develop a simple model that highlights the degree to which the reductions in the number of species and functional diversity are related to the distribution across habitats of habitat-specific and generalist species. Our results suggest that, by using habitat-dependent species-area relationships, we can better predict variation in biodiversity across seafloor landscapes and contribute to improved management and conservation.

Here, we show that the vegetation classifications of the Ache, an indigenous hunter-gatherer tribe of the Mbaracayu Forest Reserve in Paraguay, are reflected in a supervised classification of satellite imagery of the reserve. Accuracy of classification was toward the low end of the range of published values, but was reasonable given the difficult nature of separating forest classes from satellite images, Comparison of the resultant map with a more traditionally elaborated vegetation map highlights differences between the two approaches and the gain in information obtained by considering TEK classifications. We suggest that integration of TEK and remote sensing may provide alternative insights into the ecology of vegetation communities and land cover, particularly in remote and densely forested areas where ecological field research is often limited by roads and/or trail systems.																	0364-152X					SEP	2006	38	3					377	387		10.1007/s00267-004-0338-9								WOS:000239657000005	16832592

In this paper, we document the present distribution of the major lakes and the changes in size that have taken place over the past 50 years, using remote sensing data and historical observations of land cover in the region. We also provide an overview of the changes in species richness, community composition, population size and age structure, and individual body size of aquatic plants, fishes, and waterfowl in these lakes. The overall species richness of aquatic plants found in eight major lakes has decreased substantially during the study period. Community composition has also been greatly altered, as have population size and age and individual body size in some species. These changes are largely attributed to the integrated effects of lake degradation, the construction of large hydroelectric dams, the establishment of nature reserves, and lake restoration practices.

J	Willson, A				Willson, Andrew			Forest conversion and land use change in rural northwest Yunnan, China - A fine-scale analysis in the context of the 'big picture'	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Contrary to the trend of rapid deforestation continuing across Asia, regional assessments point to recent increases in forest cover in China, including Yunnan Province, since the implementation of dramatic forestry policy changes. There is debate about whether the statistics that describe increasing forest cover adequately account for forest status and quality. In this context, the present article aims to quantify forest cover and land use changes in a Tibetan-dominated rural township in northwest Yunnan, China-an ecologically important region affected by recent forest policy changes. Three sequences of Landsat satellite imagery dating from 1981 to late 1999 and other digital datasets were used in a rules-based hybrid classification approach, achieving acceptable accuracy assessment scores. The results show an average aggregate decline in conifer forests of 23%, mostly due to an active logging industry. Much of this forest has converted to shrubland, which increased in area by over 100%. Grassland also increased, mainly at the expense of cultivation, as a response to increasing dependence on livestock by the rural communities, although high elevation rangelands decreased in area due to changing livelihoods and restrictions by the government on grazing and deliberate burning. Using the accepted definitions of forest and shrubland categories, it was difficult to depict forest and shrubland dynamics due to variation in forest regeneration and afforestation, dieback-affected forests, secondary succession of disused rangelands, and a variety of other mixed community types. Conversion analysis revealed significant forest-shrubland exchanges occurring even during the 1990s when reduction in overall forest cover slowed considerably. The results support the view that the standard categorizations and representations of land cover only portray a partial picture of forest status, as they do not account for multiple conversions that occur between different land covers over time. Due to ongoing forestry programs and increasing utilization of forest resources by local communities, these conversion issues may be significant, with implications for forest quality and biodiversity. Our understanding of China's forest status will be improved by correlating inventory data with finer-scale spatial datasets to enable conversion analysis in representative ecological regions. This will advance our knowledge of China's forest status and the effectiveness of forest policy for both local rural community needs, as well as for broader ecological conservation.																	0276-4741					AUG	2006	26	3					227	236		10.1659/0276-4741(2006)26[227:FCALUC]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000240026400009						
J	Romero-Calcerrada, R; Luque, S				Romero-Calcerrada, Raul; Luque, Sandra			Habitat quality assessment using Weights-of-Evidence based GIS modelling: The case of Picoides tridactylus as species indicator of the biodiversity value of the Finnish forest	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Biodiversity issues have gained importance in forestry as a result of the increased awareness of forest landscape changes, but still there is much to do before forest management meets reasonable goals for forest protection and renewal of biodiversity. In this work, we focus on boreal forest landscapes, using Finland as a case study, and taking advantage of a valuable database-the National Forest Inventory (NFI). We explore a multicriteria approach by using a predictive habitat suitability model for three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactyius) based on Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) and a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multisource Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The WofE model is a quantitative method used for combining evidence to examine the support for a given hypothesis. WE involves the estimation of a response variable (favourability for certain habitat occurrence) and a set of predictor variables (e.g. GIS layers containing environmental variables). WE is based on a log-linear form of Bayes' rule and uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Very few examples exist of WbfE being used to predict the spatial distribution of species or communities using biophysical descriptors. This work explores WofE as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment using georeferenced species information. Since the method is dependent of the indicator species used as a surrogate of biodiversity value it can be applied for assessing biodiversity conditions of both managed and protected areas to help decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats. Thus, the map of habitat suitability; represented as a range of probabilities of occurrence, offers an objective framework for evaluating the outcomes of different scenarios. Similarly, an objective assessment of habitat suitability provides a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat.

J	Tsai, F; Chou, MJ				Tsai, Fuan; Chou, Ming-Jhong			Texture augmented analysis of high resolution satellite imagery in detecting invasive plant species	JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS												During recent decades, a considerable number of alien species have been brought into Taiwan and have caused significant impacts to local ecosystems and biodiversity. High resolution satellite imagery can provide detailed spatial characteristics over a large area and has a great potential for accurate vegetation mapping. However, most traditional multispectral image classification techniques focus on spectral discrimination of ground objects and may overlook useful spatial information provided by hi-h resolution images. To achieve the best result, analysis of high resolution imagery should also incorporate spatial variations of the data. Therefore, this paper has looked into using a texture augmented procedure to analyze a high resolution satellite (QuickBird) image in order to detect an invasive plant species (Leucaena leucocephala) in southern Taiwan. Samples of primary vegetation covers were selected from the image to determine suitable texture analysis parameters for extracting texture features helpful for classification. Validation with ground truth data showed that the analysis produced high accuracies in detecting the target plant species and overall classification for primary vegetation types within the study site.																	0253-3839					JUL	2006	29	4					581	592		10.1080/02533839.2006.9671155								WOS:000239324400002

In this paper, we examine temporal change in open formations in the natural reserve of Poggio all'Olmo (central Italy). This area has undergone rural depopulation and the cessation of traditional methods of agriculture, resulting in the subsequent re-establishment and spread of other vegetation formations. Aerial photographs taken in 1954, 1977 and 1998 were orthorectified and classified based on the physiognomic characteristics of the vegetation. An objective definition of the minimum mapping unit (MMU) was guaranteed by using vector formal grids for this classification. We applied landscape pattern metrics based on landscape composition, the shape and size of patches and patch isolation. Our results demonstrate the key roles of shrubland, woodland and coniferous plantations in the ongoing fragmentation of open formations in the landscape. Multi-temporal landscape analyses, and, in particular, a restricted suite of landscape metrics, proved useful for detecting and quantitatively characterizing dynamic ecological processes. We conclude with some recommendations on the management alternatives feasible for the protection of the remaining grassland formations in the natural reserve of Poggio all'Olmo.

J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R				Hernandez-Stefanoni, J. Luis; Ponce-Hernandez, Raul			Mapping the spatial variability of plant diversity in a tropical forest: Comparison of spatial interpolation methods	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Knowledge of the spatial distribution of plant species is essential to conservation and forest managers in order to identify high priority areas such as vulnerable species and habitats, and designate areas for reserves, refuges and other protected areas. A reliable map of the diversity of plant species over the landscape is an invaluable tool for such purposes. In this study, the number of species, the exponent Shannon and the reciprocal Simpson indices, calculated from 141 quadrat sites sampled in a tropical forest were used to compare the performance of several spatial interpolation techniques used to prepare a map of plant diversity, starting from sample ( point) data over the landscape. Means of mapped classes, inverse distance functions, kriging and co-kriging, both, applied over the entire studied landscape and also applied within vegetation classes, were the procedures compared. Significant differences in plant diversity indices between classes demonstrated the usefulness of boundaries between vegetation types, mapped through satellite image classification, in stratifying the variability of plant diversity over the landscape. These mapped classes, improved the accuracy of the interpolation methods when they were used as prior information for stratification of the area. Spatial interpolation by co-kriging performed among the poorest interpolators due to the poor correlation between the plant diversity variables and vegetation indices computed by remote sensing and used as covariables. This indicated that the latter are not suitable covariates of plant diversity indices. Finally, a within- class kriging interpolator yielded the most accurate estimates of plant diversity values. This interpolator not only provided the most accurate estimates by accounting for the indices' intra-class variability, but also provided additional useful interpretations of the structure of spatial variability of diversity values through the interpretation of their semi-variograms. This additional role was found very useful in aiding decisions in conservation planning.

Spatial and temporal scale issues in determining biomass burning regimes in Bolivia and Peru	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					Annual Conference of the Remote-Sensing-and-Photogrammetry-Society	SEP 10-12, 2003	Nottingham, ENGLAND	Remote Sensing & Photogrammetry Soc				ATSR-2 active fire data from 1996 to 2000, TRMM VIRS fire counts from 1998 to 2000 and burn scars derived from SPOT VEGETATION ( the Global Burnt Area 2000 product) were mapped for Peru and Bolivia to analyse the spatial distribution of burning and its intra- and inter-annual variability. The fire season in the region mainly occurs between May and October; though some variation was found between the six broad habitat types analysed: desert, grassland, savanna, dry forest, moist forest and yungas (the forested valleys on the eastern slope of the Andes). Increased levels of burning were generally recorded in ATSR-2 and TRMM VIRS fire data in response to the 1997/1998 El Nino, but in some areas the El Nino effect was masked by the more marked influences of socio-economic change on land use and land cover. There were differences between the three global datasets: ATSR-2 under-recorded fires in ecosystems with low net primary productivities. This was because fires are set during the day in this region and, when fuel loads are low, burn out before the ATSR-2 overpass in the region which is between 02.45 h and 03.30 h. TRMM VIRS was able to detect these fires because its overpasses cover the entire diurnal range on a monthly basis. The GBA2000 product has significant errors of commission (particularly areas of shadow in the well-dissected eastern Andes) and omission (in the agricultural zone around Santa Cruz, Bolivia and in north-west Peru). Particular attention was paid to biomass burning in high-altitude grasslands, where fire is an important pastoral management technique. Fires and burn scars from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data for a range of years between 1987 and 2000 were mapped for areas around Parque Nacional Rio Abiseo (Peru) and Parque Nacional Carrasco (Bolivia). Burn scars mapped in the grasslands of these two areas indicate far more burning had taken place than either the fires or the burn scars derived from global datasets. Mean scar sizes are smaller and have a smaller range in size between years the in the study area in Peru (6.6-7.1 ha) than Bolivia (16.9-162.5 ha). Trends in biomass burning in the two highland areas can be explained in terms of the changing socio-economic environments and impacts of conservation. The mismatch between the spatial scale of biomass burning in the high-altitude grasslands and the sensors used to derive global fire products means that an entire component of the fire regime in the region studied is omitted, despite its importance in the farming systems on the Andes.

J	Foody, GM; Cutler, MEJ				Foody, GM; Cutler, MEJ			Mapping the species richness and composition of tropical forests from remotely sensed data with neural networks	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					3rd Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Informatics (ISEI)	AUG   26, 2002	Rome, ITALY	Int Soc Ecol Informat				The understanding and management of biodiversity is often limited by a lack of data. Remote sensing has considerable potential as a source of data on biodiversity at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for biodiversity management. To-date, most remote sensing studies have focused on only one aspect of biodiversity, species richness, and have generally used conventional image analysis techniques that may not fully exploit the data's information content. Here, we report on a study that aimed to estimate biodiversity more fully from remotely sensed data with the aid of neural networks. TWO neural network models, feedforward networks to estimate basic indices of biodiversity and Kohonen networks to provide. information on species composition, were used. Biodiversity indices of species richness and evenness derived from the remotely sensed data were strongly correlated with those derived from field survey. For example, the predicted tree species richness was significantly correlated with that observed in the field (r = 0.69, significant at the 95% level of confidence). In addition, there was a high degree of correspondence (similar to 83%) between the partitioning of the outputs from Kohonen networks applied to tree species and remotely sensed data sets that indicated the potential to map species composition. Combining the outputs of the two sets of neural network based analyses enabled a map of biodiversity to be produced. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the use of indigenous knowledge for the identification of habitat types in the field was compared against an ecological characterization of habitat types, including their species composition obtained by using classification and ordination techniques for a tropical landscape mosaic in a rural Mayan area of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Plant diversity data calculated from 141 sampled sites chosen randomly on a vegetation class's thematic map obtained by multispectral satellite image classification were used for this propose. Results indicated high similarity in the categorization of vegetation types between the Mayan classification and those obtained by cluster and detrended correspondence analysis. This suggests that indigenous knowledge has a practical use and can be comparable to that obtained by using science-based methods. Finally, identification and mapping of vegetation classes (habitat types) using satellite image classification allowed us to discriminate significantly different species compositions, in such a way that they can provide a useful mechanism for interpolating diversity values over the entire landscape.

J	Cayuela, L; Benayas, JMR; Echeverria, C				Cayuela, L; Benayas, JMR; Echeverria, C			Clearance and fragmentation of tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico (1975-2000)	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical montane forests have been recognised as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Our study focuses on the rate of loss and patterns of fragmentation in tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, during a 25-year period. Data from Landsat satellite imagery from 1975 (MSS), 1990 (TM) and 2000 (ETM+) were used to ascertain annual deforestation rates of 1.3 and 4.8% for the 1975-1990 and 1990-2000 periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of forest fragmentation were identified using selected landscape indices. Increases in the number of forest fragments (3520-10,542), patch density (1.0-3.2 patches/100 ha), and total edge length (24,781-38,400 km) were associated with decreases in the mean patch size (65.0-8.7 ha), largest patch index (60.7-4.0%), total core area (99,422-9,611 ha), and mean proximity index (10 1,369-1405). The observed trends indicate increasing deforestation and fragmentation, particularly during the 1990-2000 period. Circa 50% of the forest cover in the Highlands has been lost in 25 years, and a proportion of the remaining forests have been degraded as a result of human use. Increasing human population and a more demanding use of soils for agriculture and timber arise as the major causes of deforestation in the study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should be focused on the management of the natural system and the management of the external influences on it, particularly the detection of hotspots, passive and active restoration and sustainable forest exploitation by the local indigenous communities.

J	Allen, HD; Randall, RE; Amable, GS; Devereux, BJ				Allen, HD; Randall, RE; Amable, GS; Devereux, BJ			The impact of changing olive cultivation practices on the ground flora of olive groves in the Messara and. Psiloritis regions, Crete, Greece	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												This paper examines the impact that different olive cultivation practices have on the nature of the ground flora of olive groves in the region of the Psiloritis massif and Messara Plain in central and southern Crete, Greece. In lower, flatter areas there are areas of both traditional and intensive forms of olive cultivation. In more marginal, upland areas there are traditional terraced olive groves, some of which are being abandoned. The relationship between the vegetation composition of the ground flora and environmental variables was established, by means of TWINSPAN((R)) and ordination analysis, using survey data from nineteen sites across the region. Four vegetation communities are identified: olive with herbaceous taxa; olive with sclerophyllous shrub taxa; and two forms of sclerophyllous shrub communities. Ordination results indicate that environmental variables, such as soil characteristics, slope aspect and slope angle, explain about 60 per cent of the species-environment relationships. The remaining variation in species composition is interpreted to be the result of different cultivation practices. The implications for land degradation are examined, in particular the changes in vegetation diversity of both intensive and semi-abandoned olive groves, the potential for increased soil erosion, and the risk of fire as a result of increased fuel loading as flammable shrubs invade abandoned terraces. Intensification of olive cultivation in Crete, and across the Mediterranean, has been encouraged by subsidies from the European Union leading to rapid landscape change. Thus there is a need to monitor changes in olive cultivation practices both at the local scale, by means of ground-based fieldwork, and at landscape and regional scales, by means of remote sensing.

J	Brandt, JS; Townsend, PA				Brandt, Jodi S.; Townsend, Philip A.			Land use - land cover conversion, regeneration and degradation in the high elevation Bolivian Andes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Regional land-cover change affects biodiversity, hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles at local, watershed, and landscape scales. Developing countries are experiencing rapid land cover change, but assessment is often restricted by limited financial resources, accessibility, and historical data. The assessment of regional land cover patterns is often the first step in developing conservation and management plans. This study used remotely sensed land cover and topographic data (Landsat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission), supervised classification techniques, and spectral mixture analysis to characterize current landscape patterns and quantify land cover change from 1985 to 2003 in the Altiplano (2535-4671 m) and Intermediate Valley (Mountain) (1491-4623 m) physiographic zones in the Southeastern Bolivian Andes. Current land cover was mapped into six classes with an overall accuracy of 88% using traditional classification techniques and limited field data. The land cover change analysis showed that extensive deforestation, desertification, and agricultural expansion at a regional scale occurred in the last 20 years (17.3% of the Mountain Zone and 7.2% of the Altiplano). Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) indicated that communal rangeland degradation has also occurred, with increases in soil and non-photosynthetic vegetation fractions in most cover classes. SMA also identified local areas with intensive management activities that are changing differently from the overall region (e.g., localized areas of increased green vegetation). This indicates that actions of local communities, governments, and environmental managers can moderate the potentially severe future changes implied by the results of this study.

J	Trichon, V; Julien, MP				Trichon, V; Julien, MP			Tree species identification on large-scale aerial photographs in a tropical rain forest, French Guiana - application for management and conservation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Management and conservation planning of any ecosystem requires knowledge of species composition. This is a real challenge in tropical rain forests that are characterised by very high species richness and canopy access limitations. The possibility of approaching trees from remote sensing on large-scale aerial photographs, takes on its full significance in this context. Results of tree species identification by photo-interpretation in a French Guianan forest canopy are discussed, as well as an overview of the part of the forest accessible from the photographs. Two sets of aerial photographs were used. One set (1:3700 colour slides) covers 15 ha of primary forest, divided into a training set (TS, 5 ha) and a validation set (VS 1: 10 ha). Another validation set, taken in different conditions of acquisition, scale and season, is available for an adjacent area (VS 2: 6.5 ha). Aerial photographs captured a quarter of the tree community (dbh >= 10 cm) on average, and about 45% of the SGS (Species or Group of Species) on the training set. The crown appearance of 12 major canopy SGS, including commercial species and species of ecological interest, had been described in a previous work on the same training set. Following these descriptions, two photo-interpreters separately identified 309 tree crowns overall on VS 1, with a good agreement in their respective judgements. After their interpretations were checked in the field, the overall average identification success was high (87%) but the results varied according to the SGS. The results on VS 2 showed that some species displayed major seasonal and scale variations and were hardly recognized, whereas some others could be identified without modifying the learning process. The results are encouraging and this work will be extended as the identification of tropical rain forest trees from remote sensing has many applications, ranging from fundamental ecological knowledge of canopy species to the management and conservation of such highly diverse and hardly inventoried ecosystems.

Exploring human-environment tradeoffs in protected area conservation	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Protected areas, or parks, remain a major focus for biodiversity conservation globally. The goal of this special issue is to bring together a broad-based set of papers that examine the human dimensions of forest conservation in protected areas across the world. Park landscapes are often characterized by biological and socio-political dilemmas due to conflicts between biodiversity goals and local livelihood strategies. To best inform policy. research should seek to document the livelihoods of people in the landscapes around parks and investigate the impacts that parks and biodiversity outside the parks have on their livelihoods and activities in turn. Given the current debate on the effectiveness of protected area management, there is an urgent need for careful, quantitative evaluations that analyze the impact of exclusionary policies of protected area management on forest cover over time. Each of the four papers in this issue deals with a distinct case study. using different methods and questions. This research illustrates the utility of remote sensing. spatial statistics. fragmentation analyses and modeling for the study of parks. and for evaluation of the potential effectiveness of different management strategies in protected areas. These studies also underline the need for satellite image analysis to be supplemented by detailed field research to provide insights into the social and institutional processes that impact land cover change and forest conservation.

A parcel-level spatial econometric model identifies the driving forces of land use change in two communities located along the eastern edge of the Reserve. the locus of increased deforestation in 1957-1996. The study assesses the role of biophysical variables, locational context, household socioeconomics and institutional factors in driving deforestation. The results address the effectiveness of reserves and other state policy instruments in protecting forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examined patterns of ecosystem diversity, deforestation and fragmentation and provided an estimate on their possible causes through a temporal and spatial analysis of biotic and abiotic data using remote sensing and geographical information systems in six pilot areas covering a total of 4,200,000 ha. Ecological, demographic and socio-economic data were analysed to establish the local conditions. We used a landscape ecology approach to calculate indicators of ecosystem diversity, cover and forest fragmentation such as number of patches, mean patch size, mean shape index and mean nearest neighbour distance. Patterns of deforestation did not run parallel to access roads; instead the typical pattern of unplanned colonization follows the only transportation network existing in many areas in the Colombian Amazonia: rivers. In addition, we have used indicators of human influence such as demographic pressure, quality of life and economic activity indicators. Results show that the extent and rate of change varies between areas depending on population density. Annual deforestation rates were 3.73 and 0.97% in the high population density growth areas of Alto Putumayo and Macarena respectively, and 0.31, 0.23, and 0.01% in the relatively unpopulated areas of indigenous population. These changes are related to land use history as well as to environmental and historical socio-economic factors such as oil extraction, deforestation, cattle ranching or illegal cropping. The current situation in the region suggests that tropical deforestation rates in the Colombian Amazon are substantially higher than those found in previous studies in the rest of the Amazon.

J	Langford, WT; Gergel, SE; Dietterich, TG; Cohen, W				Langford, WT; Gergel, SE; Dietterich, TG; Cohen, W			Map misclassification can cause large errors in landscape pattern indices: Examples from habitat fragmentation	ECOSYSTEMS												Although habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide, virtually no attention has been paid to the quantification of error in fragmentation statistics. Landscape pattern indices (LPIs), such as mean patch size and number of patches, are routinely used to quantify fragmentation and are often calculated using remote-sensing imagery that has been classified into different land-cover classes. No classified map is ever completely correct, so we asked if different maps with similar misclassification rates could result in widely different errors in pattern indices. We simulated landscapes with varying proportions of habitat and clumpiness (autocorrelation) and then simulated classification errors on the same maps. We simulated higher misclassification at patch edges (as is often observed), and then used a smoothing algorithm routinely used on images to correct salt-and-pepper classification error. We determined how well classification errors (and smoothing) corresponded to errors seen in four pattern indices. Maps with low misclassification rates often yielded errors in LPIs of much larger magnitude and substantial variability. Although smoothing usually improved classification error, it sometimes increased LPI error and reversed the direction of error in LPIs introduced by misclassification. Our results show that classification error is not always a good predictor of errors in LPIs, and some types of image postprocessing (for example, smoothing) might result in the underestimation of habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is potential for large errors in nearly every landscape pattern analysis ever published, because virtually none quantify the errors in LPIs themselves.																	1432-9840					APR	2006	9	3					474	488		10.1007/s10021-005-0119-1								WOS:000237121600012

In this study, we characterize the impact of urbanization on land cover and lacustrine landscape and their consequences in a large urban lake watershed, Donghu Lake watershed (the largest urban lake in China), Central China, by using Landsat TM satellite images of three periods of 1987, 1993 and 1999 and ground-based information. We grouped the land covers into six categories: water body, vegetable land, forested land, shrub-grass land, open area and urban land, and calculated patch-related landscape indices to analyze the effects of urbanization on landscape features. We overlaid the land cover maps of the three periods to track the land cover change processes. The results indicated that urban land continuously expanded from 9.1% of the total watershed area in 1987, to 19.4% in 1993, and to 29.6% in 1999. The vegetable land increased from 7.0% in 1987, 11.9% in 1993, to 13.9% in 1999 to sustain the demands of vegetable for increased urban population. Concurrently, continuous reduction of other land cover types occurred between 1987 and 1999: water body decreased from 30.4% to 23.8%, and forested land from 33.6% to 24.3%. We found that the expansion of urban land has at least in part caused a decrease in relatively wild habitats, such as urban forest and lake water area. These alterations had resulted in significant negative environmental consequences, including decline of lakes, deterioration of water and air quality, and loss of biodiversity.

During the past decades, human population and intensity of land use have increased. At the same time, almost nothing is known about the natural dynamics of this widespread forest-savanna mosaic and how they are altered by human activities. This was investigated with respect to past, present and future forest-savanna dynamics, which presumably influence northern Guinean biodiversity. Location The Comoe National Park (CNP) region in north-eastern Ivory Coast. Methods Landscape dynamics and the rates of anthropogenic deforestation and natural reforestation were retrospectively analysed by means of historical and recent aerial photographs and satellite images, directly relating the semi-natural conditions in the CNP to neighbouring, traditionally utilized countryside. Results From 1954 to 1996, the studied forest-savanna pattern proved to be remarkably stable, even with extensive land utilization outside the CNP. The contour towards the surrounding savanna and, thus, the size of 95.4% of 653 forest islands remained unchanged. Unvegetated surfaces also remained remarkably constant during the period from 1967 to 1996. Although dynamics were clearly higher outside the CNP as a result of human activities, the 913 unvegetated surfaces studied showed no general trend of decrease or increase, i.e. there was no response over the study period to an identified climatic shift. Anthropogenic deforestation and subsequent natural reforestation within the contours of the existing forest have occurred to a noteworthy extent only outside the CNP. For the period 1988-2002, the extent of deforestation was greater than the extent of reforestation (40% vs. 14%). By 2002, 62% of the original gallery forest along a 75-km section of the Comoe river had been cleared. Main conclusions With its remarkable overall stability, the landscape pattern inside the CNP has responded with resilience to varying influences (in particular climatic variations) and disturbances (e.g. episodic mass herbivory). A possible natural succession from savanna to forest appears to proceed only very slowly due to the counteracting effects of annual savanna fires and the lower climatic humidity of the area compared to the southern Guinean zone. Consequently, the forests should be considered as habitat islands rather than as habitat fragments. As deforestation outside the CNP has increased considerably, the pre-existing pattern of forest insularization is now becoming overlain in these non-CNP areas by a pattern of forest fragmentation. This will aggravate the ecological and genetic isolation of the undisturbed forests in the CNP, which are among the last remaining natural forests of the entire Guineo-Sudanian transition zone.																	0305-0270					APR	2006	33	4					653	664		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01312.x								WOS:000236247200009

The relationships between the indices and a number of independent variables such as topography, geology, soil, climate, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land cover were investigated to understand relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem. Georeferenced field data from the established 56 quadrats (50 x 20 m) were used to calculate the indices. Principle component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression were employed for data reduction and model development, respectively. Three diversity maps were produced using the developed models. Residual maps and logical interpretations in ecological point of view were used to test the validity of the models. Elevation and climatic factors formed the most important components that are effective determinants of plant species diversity, but geological formations, soil, land cover and land-use characteristics also influenced plant diversity. Considering the different responses of the models, Shannon-Wiener (SWI) and NS models were found suitable for rare cover types, while Simpson (SIMP) model might be appropriate for single dominant land covers in the study area.

J	Lavigne, F; Gunnell, Y				Lavigne, F; Gunnell, Y			Land cover change and abrupt environmental impacts on Javan volcanoes, Indonesia: a long-term perspective on recent events	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Based on a presentation of the spectacularly abrupt environmental and societal processes occurring on Java since the 1990s, and using that as an analogue to compare their consequences with the known environmental history of the island, we unravel the relative contributions of natural and human impacts in shaping the environment of Java. Our work is based on remote sensing, Geographical Information System analysis, field-based observations and measurements of responses to abrupt land cover changes in the last 10 years. Ecological disturbance has been endemic to the long-term history of Java, but montane forests on volcanoes have since ca. 1990 become the last frontier of colonisation and are for the first time rapidly receding. We reveal how human disturbance of natural ecosystems, today as in the past, tends to be the greatest where resistance is the least. This appears true within the regional setting of Southeast Asia, where Javan forests since the last glaciation have constituted a biogeographical ecotone with a limited natural ability to regenerate after some imbalance. It is equally true at the scale of single events where humans will turn a natural disturbance to their own advantage. Overall, it remains difficult to deconvolve the signals of spontaneous human impacts and of localised natural events such as volcanic activity, El Nino-related forest fires or longer climatic anomalies because humans are opportunistic in their attitudes to natural variability and so the two are often inextricably linked. The clearest impact on land cover and land degradation comes from the history of state-organised deforestation, whether colonial or indigenous, because its impact has been systematic, pervasive and regionally consistent. Javan environments have shown astonishing signs of resilience under the abrupt, cumulative impacts that have been inflicted over the last four centuries in successive iterations, possibly because the high-energy tropical and volcanic environment is a system in which sediment turnover is naturally rapid and where past scars of land degradation either heal rapidly or are soon destroyed by younger events. However, the volcanoes are the island's keystone reservoirs of water, sediment and biodiversity and command the geomorphic metabolism of the lowlands. By removing forests from increasingly crowded mountain slopes, Javanese society is following a trajectory in which new nonlinear responses to environmental hazards and change may limit our capacity to anticipate and contain environmental risk to human life and property.																	1436-3798					MAR	2006	6	1-2					86	100		10.1007/s10113-005-0009-2								WOS:000238126800008						
J	Chowdhury, RR				Chowdhury, RR			Driving forces of tropical deforestation: The role of remote sensing and spatial models	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY												Remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to monitor landscape change in many parts of the world. While the availability of extensive and timely imagery from various satellite sensors can aid in identifying the rates and patterns of deforestation, modelling techniques can evaluate the socioeconomic and biophysical forces driving deforestation processes. This paper briefly reviews some emerging spatial methodologies aimed at identifying driving forces of land use change and applies one such methodology to understand deforestation in Mexico. Satellite image classification, change analysis and econometric modelling are used to identify the rates, hotspots and drivers of deforestation in a case study of the southern Yucatan peninsular region, an enumerated global hotspot of biodiversity and tropical deforestation. In particular, the relative roles of biophysical and socioeconomic factors in driving regional deforestation rates are evaluated. Such methodological approaches can be applied to other regions of the forested tropics and contribute insights to conservation planning and policy.

J	Dalle, SP; de Blois, S; Caballero, J; Johns, T				Dalle, SP; de Blois, S; Caballero, J; Johns, T			Integrating analyses of local land-use regulations, cultural perceptions and land-use/land cover data for assessing the success of community-based conservation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Studies of land-use/land cover change are an important means for examining the viability of community-based programs for forest conservation, although an analysis of the social processes influencing land-use decisions is necessary to understand the factors leading to different conservation outcomes. In this paper, we demonstrate that an analysis of locally recognized land-use rules and regulations embedded in local institutions can inform remote-sensing approaches by helping: (1) to elucidate some of the local perceptions, criteria and interactions with outside agencies that drive conservation actions and (2) to better interpret the spatial patterns of land-use change and forest conservation revealed by remote-sensing data. Based on a case study of a forest ejido from the Maya Zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico, we evaluate changes in forest cover and in local land-use regulations before and after the initiation in the mid-1980s of a community forestry program, the Plan Piloto Forestal (PPF). Methods included development of a time series of land cover maps based on LANDSAT imagery from 1976, 1988, 1991, 1997 and 2000, as well as interviews and participant observation with local farmers and community leaders. Results indicate a high degree of forest conservation on community lands with net rates of forest loss of 0.6-0.7%/year. Locally recognized conservation regulations included a number of forest reserves as well as regulations which protect specific forest types, resulting from both local initiatives and interventions of external agencies. These initiatives included but were not limited to the PPF, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-based conservation programs within a broader historical context. Conservation regulations protecting an important commercial non-timber forest product (Manilkara zapota) pre-dated the PPF and may have facilitated its implementation. In the most accessible agricultural areas, the only mature forest patches were customary forest reserves and an area regenerated from secondary forests, protected due to enrichment plantings of commercial timbers. Recognition of local Maya terminology used to distinguish forest types was crucial for proper interpretation of local land-use regulations, which revealed that less-valued forest types may not be adequately protected on community lands. We suggest that future research should examine the significance of the less-valued forest types for global biodiversity conservation. In addition careful consideration of the historical antecedents and community institutions which may have facilitated the implementation of the Plan Piloto Forestal will be important for the successful application of this model of community forestry to other socio-economic and cultural contexts.

Understanding the spatial distribution of dominant species at the regional scale is also essential for assessing the impacts of environmental change or human effects on vegetation distribution. Based on the spatial distribution of resource variables that correlate with or control plant distribution, this study focused on the prediction of Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) distribution at the regional scale, i.e., where the extent of the prediction was within the biogeographic range of Qinghai spruce in the upper reach of Heihe River. The development of the predictive model in the study required the integration of geographical information system (GIS) with remote sensing (RS), spatial analytic and statistical tools. First, we selected the main resource variables such as mean July temperature, water and solar radiation. These variables were spatialized as functions of elevation and horizontal coordinates or as functions of aspect and slope via a GIS. Second, the niche spaces of Qinghai spruce were determined by incorporating the spatially-distributed resource variables with the current distribution of the species, which came from remote sensing data (Landsat TM image). The niche spaces defined then were extrapolated over the study area. Third, the distribution pattern was validated by field investigations. The study showed that the scope of mean July temperature ranged from 8.5 degrees C to 13.5 degrees C, average annual precipitation from 370 mm to 660 mm, the soil moisture index from 2.3 m(3) m(-1) year(-1) to 4.5 m(3) m(-1) year(-1) and the shortwave radiation for an average July day from 3.8 mm m(-2) day(-1) to 7.8 mm m(-2) day(-1). The elevation range belonging to Qinghai spruce in Qilian Mountains was also determined according to the mean July temperature space occupied by the forest. The elevation occupied by Qinghai spruce was about from 2600 m to 3400 m. We found that the density of the species has higher value from 2650 m to 3100 m based on the field investigation, and from 3 100 m the density decreased with elevation increase. The basal area of Qinghai spruce had the same change as the density. That is, the suitable niche of the species ranged from 2650 m to 3 100 m. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Poulin, M; Beslisle, M; Cabeza, M				Poulin, M; Beslisle, M; Cabeza, M			Within-site habitat configuration in reserve design: A case study with a peatland bird	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												This study assesses the effects of considering within-site habitat configuration when designing reserve networks. This attribute takes all its importance in situations where the long-term integrity of (within-site) habitat patches cannot be preserved without protecting their surrounding environment. We addressed this issue through the concrete problem of selecting a reserve network of natural peatlands in southern Quebec, Canada. We used a reserve-selection algorithm that minimized the total number of peatlands to include within networks. The algorithm was constrained to include peatlands containing habitat patches that met specific size thresholds. Five habitat-clustering thresholds were used to set the eligibility of each site to the selection process. The resulting reserve networks were evaluated according to their representation efficiency and to the expected consequences for the Palm Warbler (Dendroica palmarum), an area and isolation-sensitive bird restricted to peatlands in southern Quebec. Constraining the algorithm to include peatlands showing increasingly larger patches of habitats led to larger networks, both in terms of area and number of sites, and to networks composed of smaller sites. These effects increased with the representation target (i.e., the % of each habitat preserved). With respect to the Palm Warbler, selecting peatlands with larger patches of habitats had only an indirect effect on its site-occupancy pattern. Indeed, despite the fact that the probability of occurrence of the warbler was negatively correlated with the size of habitat patches, the habitat-clustering threshold influenced the incidence of the warbler mainly via its effect on the physical attributes of the selected networks including the area, isolation level, and the number of selected sites. Because increasing the habitat-clustering threshold led indirectly to a greater regional availability of prime breeding habitats for the Palm Warbler, it mitigated the severe negative impact of an hypothetical alteration or destruction of non-selected peatlands. Our study thus emphasizes the importance of determining how the different factors describing within-site configuration are correlated with other intrinsic characteristics of the sites available to the selection process before opting for a site-selection strategy.

Location: The Panama Canal watershed. Methods: To assess which factors (climate, topography, geology and geographical distance) account for floristic composition, we performed Mantel tests on distance matrices and partitioned variation in species composition using canonical analysis. We used a permutation-based regression model computed on distance matrices and a hierarchical clustering of the tree composition to construct a predictive map of forest types of the Panama Canal Watershed. Results: We found that spatial variation alone explained 22-27% of species variation, while the fraction of species variation explained by environmental variables was smaller (10-12%); 13-19% of the variation was accounted for by the joint effect of environmental variation and geographic distance. The similarity-based map emphasizes the principal division in tree flora between the drier Pacific side and the wetter Caribbean slopes. Conclusions: The distribution of Panamanian tree species appears to be primarily determined by dispersal limitation, then by environmental heterogeneity. 'Environmental segregation' processes do play an important role. Maps of broad-scale vegetation patterns based on thorough tree inventories can be used in conservation planning in the tropics.

In this paper, the oasis spatial distribution pattern and dynamic change were examined using imageries of Landsat MSS, TM and ETM, land use and topographic maps in six different periods (such as 1949, 1962, 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2001) over the last 50 years in the valley. The oasis expansion process could be divided into two stages according to the annual rate of oasis area increase, the fast oasization stage (from 1949 to 1976) when the oasis area expanded from 156.385 km(2) in 1949 to 3,639.491 km(2) in 1976 because of rapidly increased population and quickly enlarged farmland area; and the urbanization stage (from 1976 to 2001) when the expansion ratio of farmland slowed down, and the urbanization process quickened, the total oasis area reached 5042.440 km(2) in 2001. With the continuous expansion of oasis and farmland, a large quantity of river water was drawn into irrigation ditch and plain lakes, so only a small quantity of river water could flow into lakes, as a result, the Manas Lake dried up, salization and basification problems happened in the low-lying oasis region. The natural swamp around the lake was shrunk greatly and biodiversity decreased significantly. The driving force analysis reveals that human activities, such as reclamation and population growth, played a major role in the oasis expansion and ecological deterioration in the Manas River Valley. So further efforts should be made to improve the efficiency of water resource utility and adjust layout of the regional agricultural and animal husbandry to keep the sustainable development of oasis economic belt of the northern slope of Tianshan Mts.																	1006-9313					FEB	2006	49	2					163	175		10.1007/s11430-004-5348-1								WOS:000236156400006

Cenchrus ciliaris) is an African grass that has been widely introduced in subtropical and regions of the world to improve rangelands for cattle production. However, it can have a negative effect on the diversity of native plant communities. Buffelgrass was introduced to Sonora, Mexico in the 1970s as a means to bolster the cattle industry. "Desmonte," the process by which native desert vegetation is removed in preparation for buffelgrass seeding, alters the land surface such that buffelgrass plots are easily detectable from aerial and Landsat satellite images. We estimated the extent of conversion to buffelgrass in a 1,850,000 ha area centered on Hermosillo, from MSS and TM images from 1973, 1983, 1990 and 2000. We then compared the relative above-ground productivity of buffelgrass to native vegetation using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values (NDVI) from Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite sensor systems. Buffelgrass pastures have increased from just 7700 ha in 1973 to over 140,000 ha in 2000. Buffelgrass pastures now cover 8% of the land surface in the study area. Buffelgrass pastures have lower net primary productivity, estimated by MODIS NDVI values, than unconverted desert land. The desmonte process removes trees and shrubs, while the buffelgrass plantings are often sparse, leading to an apparent net loss in net primary production from land conversion.

Most method proposals include the quality of the land in a descriptive way using rank scores for an arbitrarily selected set of indicators. This paper first offers a theoretical framework for the selection of suitable indicators for land use impact assessment, based on ecosystem thermodynamics. According to recent theories on the thermodynamics of open systems, a goal function of ecosystems is to maximize the dissipation of exogenic exergy fluxes by maximizing the internal exergy storage under form of biomass, biodiversity and complex trophical networks. Human impact may decrease this ecosystem exergy level by simplification, i.e. decreasing biomass and destroying internal complexity. Within this theoretical framework, we then studied possibilities for assessing the land use impact in a more direct way by measuring the ecosystems' capacity to dissipate solar exergy. Measuring ecosystem thermal characteristics by using remote sensing techniques was considered a promising tool. Once operational, it could offer a quick and cheap alternative to quantify land use impacts in any terrestrial ecosystem of any size. Recommendations are given for further exploration of this method and for its integration into an ISO compatible LCA framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Comparative study of fertilization effect on weed biodiversity of long term experiments with near field remote sensing methods	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION					23rd German Conference on Weed Biology and Weed Control	MAR 07-09, 2006	Stuttgart, GERMANY					Since the decision of The Earth Summit in Rio (UN 1992), conservation of biodiversity is a critical environmental protection issue. However the sector specific arable land agro biodiversity was only defined a few years ago in OECD countries. The one-sided usage of herbicide led to the selection of several weed species, and some species need protection. In this study, we analyzed the rate of weed coverage and population in a 22 year long term field experiment. A coenological survey has been performed simultaneously to a maize field production test with the application of increasing doses of NPK and NPK-FYM. Parallel with the conventional mapping, we also used a wide broad handy camera, taking images in NIR-R-G spectra, for mapping. The results of the image analysis significantly improved the reliability of field surveying in case of high weed cover (> 25 %) compared to traditional surveying methods. Regarding NPK and NPK-FYM treatments: the results of the statistical analysis (Student's t test) showed that the values of NDVI, weed cover (%) and the visual coenological survey (%) were significantly higher (SD = 5 %) for NPK-FYM treatments. We expressed the changes of the weed species constitution with the Shannon-index, well known in ecology. We evaluated the development of species number according to the different relations of nutrient supply. The application of increasing fertilizer doses reduced the number of occurring species in both treatments compared to control treatments. The information gained is suitable for the indication of biodiversity of other production sites, and can be a basis for optimising the cropping technology interferences.																	1861-3829	1861-3837					2006					20		801	807										WOS:000243263500100

Understanding hydrology and ecology of the lake and its tributaries is particularly important for the conservation of the Park's floodplain habitats and its biodiversity. There are concerns that hydrological boundary conditions and ecology of Lake Urema have changed in recent years. Possible causes for this change include climatic and land use changes as well as tectonic and geomorphological processes. In this study, a multi-temporal and multi-disciplinary approach was applied to investigate the dynamics and control mechanisms of Lake Urema. Principal methods comprised remote sensing analyses of time series of Landsat and ASTER data, geomorphological interpretations of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) as well as field investigations such as analyses of water quality and sediment composition. The waters of Lake Urema have a low mineralization and pH values approximately neutral. The spatially dominant sediment type has a pure clay texture consisting of kaolinite and smectite. The sandy type consists of quartz, kali felspar, and plagioclase. The results of the supervised classifications for the satellite images from 1979 to 2000 showed that the lake's extent ranged between 17 km(2) (09/1995) and 25 km(2) (08/1979). Above average rainfall was responsible for the extreme lake size in May 1997 (104 km(2)). The interpretations of the Digital Terrain Model demonstrated that alluvial fans limit the Urema basin from all sides and make Lake Urema a form of "reservoir lake". The control mechanisms of the hydrological regime of Lake Urema, such as the contribution of groundwater, are not yet fully understood. The lake's condition during the rainy season was not investigated. In the future, investigations of the sources and amounts of sediment input into the lake should be conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Elvebakk, A				Elvebakk, A			'Arctic hotspot complexes' - proposed priority sites for studying and monitoring effects of climatic change on arctic biodiversity	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA					2nd International Workshop on Circumpolar Vegetation Classification and Mapping	JUN 02-06, 2004	Tromso, NORWAY					The concept 'arctic hotspot' is proposed here for an area within the Arctic with an extrazonally warm climate, resulting in thermophilous blodiversity elements not found in its surroundings. Together with adjacent areas with zonal and extrazonally cold climates, these make up 'arctic hotspot complexes', with extraordinarily strong bioclimatic gradients. Horizontal temperature gradients should at least correspond to 'one bioclimatic subzone', but these could be realized along longer distances when local arctic hotspots are not only isolated, but situated within regionally defined hotspots. Topographic features and/or strong continentality explain the extrazonally warm climate and the resulting climatic gradient. An analysis of Svalbard resulted in four proposed arctic hotspot sites, and five more sites are included as examples from Canada, Greenland and Russia. Due to its topography, Greenland probably has the highest concentration of arctic hotspots. A number of arctic hotspot complexes contain centres which are boreal enclaves. There is a need to identify arctic hotspot sites including their biodiversity and bioclimatic characteristics. There is also a need for having arctic hotspot sites evaluated for inclusion in climate change-related studies and monitoring programs, as this may facilitate meso-scale approaches and collection of high-quality field data, related to remote sensing and modeling efforts. This may also facilitate integration of population data in bioclimatic contexts, as arctic hotspot sites can be expected to act as future migration centres for isolated populations exposed to climatic warming.																	0340-269X					DEC 13	2005	35	4					1067	1079		10.1127/0340-269X/2005/0035-1067								WOS:000234271700012

Even though there were significant autocorrelations among spectral indices, there were significant differences in the relationships between spectral indices and forest attributes. IRI was not significantly correlated with any of the structural variables while MIRI was correlated with canopy closure and NDVI values were correlated with canopy Closure as well is annual woody increment. NDVI and MIRI were both related to relative tree diversity and all three indices were associated with aspects of tree species composition. Based on the results of this study, it appears that spectral indices, and in particular NDVI, may be useful indicators of forest attributes in tropical dry forest habitats. Further research needs to be undertaken to identify if the results of this study can be applied to other tropical dry forests at a global spatial scale.

Photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and three indices derived from spectra] reflectance (the normalized difference vegetation index, the simple ratio, and the photochemical reflectance index) were used as indicators of structural and physiological components of photosynthetic activity. Considerable interspecific variation was evident in structural and physiological behavior in this forest stand, which included varying degrees of foliage loss, altered leaf orientation, stomatal closure, and phorosystem 11 downregulation. The normalized difference vegetation index and the simple ratio were closely related to canopy structure and absorbed radiation for most species, but failed to capture the widely divergent Photosynthetic behavior among evergreen species exhibiting various degrees of downregulation. The photochemical reflectance index and chlorophyll fluorescence were related indicators of Photosynthetic downregulation, which was not detectable with the normalized difference vegetation index or simple ratio. These results suggest that remote sensing methods that ignore downregulation cannot capture within-stand variability ill actual carbon flux for this diverse forest type. Instead, these findings support a sampling approach that derives Photosynthetic fluxes from a consideration of both canopy light absorption (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index) and photosynthetic light-use efficiency (e.g., photochemical reflectance index). Such sampling should improve our understanding of controls on photosynthetic carbon uptake in diverse tropical forest stands.

J	Harris, GM; Jenkins, CN; Pimm, SL				Harris, GM; Jenkins, CN; Pimm, SL			Refining biodiversity conservation priorities	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Although there is widespread agreement about conservation priorities at large scales (i.e., biodiversity hotspots), their boundaries remain too coarse for setting practical conservation goals. Refining hotspot conservation means identifying specific locations (individual habitat patches) of realistic size and scale for managers to protect and politicians to support. Because bot. pots have lost most of their original habitat, species endemic to them rely oil what remains. The issue now becomes identifying where this habitat is and these species are. We accomplished this by using straightforward remote sensing and GIS techniques, identifying specific locations in Brazil's Atlantic Forest hotspot important for bird conservation. Our method requires a regional map of current forest cover so we explored six popular products for mapping and quantifying forest: MODIS continuous fields and a MODIS land cover (preclassified products), AVHRR, SPOT VGT, MODIS (satellite images), and a GeoCover Landsat thematic mapper mosaic (jpg). We compared subsets of these forest covers against a forest map based oil a Landsat enhanced thematic mapper The SPOT VGT forest cover predicted forest area and location well, so we combined it with elevation delta to refine coarse distribution maps for forest endemic birds. Stacking these species distribution maps enabled identification of the subregion richest in threatened birds the lowland forests of Rio de Janeiro State. We highlighted eight priority fragments, focusing on one with finer resolved imagery for detailed study This method allows prioritization of at-eels for conservation front a region >1 million km(2) to forest fragments of lens of square kilometers. To set priorities for biodiversity conservation, coarse biological information is sufficient. Hence, our method is attractive for tropical and biologically rich locations, where species location information is sparse.

Interaction of Biodiversity and Economic Welfare - A Case Study from the Himalayas of India	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												In any area to achieve the goal of biodiversity conservation, the existing resources must be strengthened, which are helpful to provide the alternate livelihood or income to the local people. However, although various programmes/policies are being set up over the world for conservation of biodiversity, a variety of factors are hurdles to achieve the expected goals. Particularly in developing countries the sustainable livelihood of the local perople is difficult if restrictions are imposed on their traditional usufruct rights over the natural resources. Based on the extensive field work and analysis of satellite imagery in the selected localities of the Indian Himalaya, we found that if the people are having the alternate avenue (profitable options) for earning, their dependencies on the existing resources (only to meet the subsistence needs, not for commercial purpose) will become much lower. Therefore, the biodiversity in these areas is conserved and managed in a healthy way. In this paper, the interactions of biodiversity and economic welfare of local people are discussed in view of understanding that the economic security is more important than pure enforcement of policies for biodiversity conservation.

Establishing levels of natural variability within and between marine ecosystems is a necessary prerequisite to this process and requires a monitoring programme which takes account of the issues of time, space and scale. In this paper, we argue that an ecosystem approach to managing the marine environment should take direct account of climate change indicators at a regional level if it is to cope with the unprecedented change expected as a result of human impacts on the earth climate system. We discuss the purpose of environmental monitoring and the importance of maintaining long-term time series. Recommendations are made on the use of these data in conjunction with modern extrapolation and integration tools (e.g. ecosystem models, remote sensing) to provide a diagnostic approach to the management of marine ecosystems, based on adaptive indicators and dynamic baselines.

This approach may improve monitoring through diagnosing forest fragments instead of quantifying only forest area reduction. This paper aims to evaluate relationships between forest structure and vegetation indices in Atlantic Rainforest fragments, in southeastern Brazil. Two Landsat 7 ETM+ images acquired in humid and dry seasons were used, and measurements of forest structure in nine forest fragments and in a continuous forest area in the Guapiacu River Basin, in Rio de Janeiro State were taken. Three vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), moisture vegetation index using Landsat's band 5 (MV15) and moisture vegetation index using Landsat's band 7 (MV17)) were correlated with measurements of forest structure (frequency of multiple- stemmed trees, density of trees, mean and range of tree diameter, mean and range of tree height and average of basal area). Models describing the relationships between forest structure and vegetation indices using linear regression analysis were also developed. MV15 and MV17 showed the best performances in dense humid forests, whereas NDVI seems to be a good indicator of green biomass in deciduous and dry forests. Moreover, the saturation matter in vegetation indices and the transferability of relationships between biophysical characteristics and vegetation indices to other sites and times were discussed.

J	Foody, GM				Foody, GM			Mapping the richness and composition of British breeding birds from coarse spatial resolution satellite sensor imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing has great potential as a source of information on biodiversity over large areas. Past studies have generally focused on species richness, used aspatial statistical techniques and highlighted scale-dependent results. Here, a fuller assessment of avian biodiversity, considering species richness and composition, was undertaken for breeding bird species in Great Britain from NDVI and temperature data derived from NOAA AVHRR imagery. Broad classes of bird species composition defined by an ordination analysis exhibited a high degree of separability, with classification accuracies (based on training data) of up to 77.3% observed. Although only 18.1% of the variance in species richness could be explained by a conventional aspatial regression analysis it was apparent from geographically weighted regression analyses that the relationship between species richness and the remotely sensed response was significantly non-stationary. Relative to the standard regression, geographically weighted analyses yielded models that provided stronger relationships and highlighted the spatial dependence of the relationship. Marked spatial variation in the regression model parameters and explanatory power were evident within and between scales. The results indicated the ability to characterize aspects of biodiversity from coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data and highlight the need to accommodate for the effects of spatial non-stationarity in the relationship.																	0143-1161					SEP 20	2005	26	18					3943	3956		10.1080/01431160500165716								WOS:000233304000006

It has been stated in numerous publications that discrete return laser scanner data produce accurate tree canopy information since the quantiles of the height distribution of laser scanner data are related to the vertical structure of the tree canopy. Since some of the laser pulses will penetrate under the dominant tree layer, it is also possible to analyse multi-layered stands. In this Study, the existence and number of understory trees were examined. This was carried out by analysing the height distributions of reflected laser Pulses. In the laser data of this Study, (Toposys Falcon, survey May 2003 in Kalkkinen, Finland, flight altitude 400 m AGL) the average number of laser pulse hits/1m(2) was 12. The reference data consisted of 28 accurately measured field Sample plots. These plots, include highly heterogeneous structures of boreal forests. The existence of lower canopy layers, i.e. understory trees, was analysed visually by viewing the plotwise 3D-images of laser scanner-based canopy height point data and examining distributions of canopy densities which were computed as proportions of laser hits above different height quantiles. Furthermore, a developed histogram thresholding method (HistMod) was applied to the height distribution of laser hits in order to separate different tree storeys. Finally, the number and Lorey's mean height of understory trees were predicted with estimated regression models. The results show that multi-layered stand structures can be recognised and quantified using quantiles of laser scanner height distribution data. However, the accuracy of the results is dependent oil the density of the dominant tree layer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	McConnell, WJ; Sweeney, SP				McConnell, WJ; Sweeney, SP			Challenges of forest governance in Madagascar	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												There has been a huge surge in interest in the preservation of Madagascar's forests in the past two decades, but despite the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, the goal remains elusive. Recent legislation has given the government the authority to enter into contractual arrangements with communities for the management of the country's public forests, so it has become crucial to grapple with the significant challenges involved. This paper explores the enormity of the challenge of forest governance in Madagascar in an era of decentralization. By examining several forests in one part of the country, it reveals a dizzying range of forest types and forms of use and governance within a fairly small portion of the country. These examples make it apparent that the history of forest management in Madagascar constitutes a broad-ranging experiment with forest governance. Simply monitoring the dynamics of the forest canopy is a significant technical challenge. However, this pales in comparison to the difficulties inherent in explaining those dynamics and assessing the sustainability and equity of different management regimes. Of the forests considered in the study, those where the Malagasy state has partnered with international conservation and development organizations seem to stand out, both in terms of stabilized, or even growing, forest cover, as well as a balance of interests among users.																	0016-7398					SEP	2005	171		3				223	238		10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00162.x								WOS:000231928100003

The aim of this paper is to test whether plant species richness can be inventoried more efficiently by means of a spectrally-based ordering of sites to be sampled. Location The study area was a complex wetland ecosystem, the Lake Montepulciano Nature Reserve, central Italy. This is one of the most important wetland areas of central Italy because of the diverse plant communities and the seasonal avifauna. Methods Field sampling, based on a random stratified sampling design, was performed in June 2002. Plant species composition was recorded within sampling units of 100 m(2) (plots) and 1 ha (macroplots). A QuickBird multispectral image of the same date was acquired and corrected both geometrically and radiometrically. Species accumulation curves based on spectral information were obtained by ordering sites to be sampled according to a maximum spectral distance criterion (i.e. by ordering sampling units based on the maximum distances among them in a four-dimensional spectral space derived from the remotely sensed data). Different distance measures based on mean and maximum spectral distances among sampling units were tested. The performance of the species accumulation curve derived by the spectrally-based ordering of sampling units was tested against a rarefaction curve obtained from the mean of 10,000 accumulation curves based on randomly ordered sampling units. Results The spectrally-derived curve based on the maximum spectral distance among sampling units showed the most rapid accumulation of species, well above the rarefaction curve, at both the plot and the macroplot scales. Other ordering criteria of sampling units captured less richness over most of the species accumulation curves at both the spatial scales. The accumulation curves based on other measurements of distance were much closer to the random curve and did not show differences with respect to the species rarefaction curve based on random ordering of sampling units. Main conclusions The present investigation demonstrated that spectral-based ordering of sites to be sampled can lead to the maximization of the efficiency of plant species inventories, an activity usually driven by the 'botanist's internal algorithm' (intuition), without any formalized rule to drive field sampling. The proposed approach can reduce costs of plant species inventorying through a more efficient allotment of time and sampling.

Although the general geographic distributions of these epidemiologically important species are known, the spatiotemporal variation in their emergence and activity remains poorly understood. We used ecological niche modeling via a genetic algorithm to produce time-specific predictive models of monthly distributions of. Aedes aegypti in Mexico in 1995. Significant predictions of monthly mosquito activity and distributions indicate that predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of disease vector species is feasible; significant coincidence with human cases of dengue indicate that these dynamics probably translate directly into transmission of dengue virus to humans. This approach provides new potential for optimizing use of resources for disease prevention and remediation via automated forecasting of disease transmission risk.

J	Frazer, GW; Wulder, MA; Niemann, KO				Frazer, GW; Wulder, MA; Niemann, KO			Simulation and quantification of the fine-scale spatial pattern and heterogeneity of forest canopy structure: A lacunarity-based method designed for analysis of continuous canopy heights	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Forests canopies are dynamic, continuously varying, three-dimensional structures that display substantial heterogeneity in their spatial arrangement at many scales. At the stand-level, fine-scale spatial heterogeneity influences key canopy processes and contributes to the diversity of niche space and maintenance of forest biodiversity. We present a quantitative method that we developed based on a novel application of two well-established statistical techniques - lacunarity analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) - to determine the fine-scale (0.5-33 m) spatial heterogeneity found in the outer surface of a forest canopy. This method was specifically designed for the analysis of continuous canopy height data generated by airborne LiDAR systems or digital photogrammetry; however, in this study we demonstrate our method using a large, well-documented dataset composed of simulated canopy surfaces only. We found that the magnitude of the lacunarity statistic was strongly associated with canopy cover (R-2 = 0.85) and gap volume (R-2 = 0.84), while the pattern of decline in lacunarity across discrete measurement scales was related to many size- and density-related attributes of stand and canopy structure (0.27 <= R-2 <= 0.58) and their diverse vertical and horizontal spatial distributions. PCA uncovered two major gradients of spatial heterogeneity from the 10 dimensions of our original lacunarity dataset. The stronger of these two gradients reflected the continuous variation in canopy cover and gap volume, while a second, more subtle gradient was associated with the array of possible vertical and horizontal spatial configurations that might define any one measure of canopy cover. We expect that this quantitative method can be used to support a broad range of practical applications in sustainable forest management, long-term ecological monitoring, and forest science. Further research is required to understand how these statistical estimates and gradients of measured spatial heterogeneity relate to other ecologically relevant patterns of forest composition, structure, and function.

Existing methods to identify priority areas for conservation have focused almost entirely on biological factors. We suggest a new relative ranking method for identifying priority conservation areas that integrates both biological and social aspects. It is based on the following criteria: the habitat's status, human population pressure, human efforts to protect habitat, and number of endemic plant and vertebrate species. We used this method to rank 25 hotspots, 17 megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within each megadiverse country. We used consistent, comprehensive, georeferenced, and multiband data sets and analytical remote sensing and geographic information system tools to quantify habitat status, human population pressure, and protection status. The ranking suggests that the Philippines, Atlantic Forest, Mediterranean Basin, Caribbean Islands, Caucasus, and Indo-Burma are the hottest hotspots and that China, the Philippines, and India are the hottest megadiverse countries. The great variation in terms of habitat, protected areas, and population pressure among the hotspots, the megadiverse countries, and the hotspots within the same country suggests the need for hotspot- and country-specific conservation policies.																	0888-8892					AUG	2005	19	4					1273	1285		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00225.x								WOS:000231118600033

ECOGRAPHY												The structure and composition of arthropod assemblages are strongly associated with habitat complexity. Accurate, time efficient estimates of habitat complexity may provide insights for biodiversity management in natural systems. We obtained high-resolution (0.7 m pixel) multi-spectral aerial imagery of National Parks 20 km north and 20 km south of Sydney, Australia. We explored both the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the standard deviation of reflectance in the near-infrared spectrum (stdevR(NIR)) as indicators of low and high habitat complexity in sandstone forests north of Sydney. We then tested described predictions of ant community patterns (based on a previous study) using sites selected from high-resolution multi-spectral imagery in sandstone forests south of Sydney. Ground-scored habitat complexity was positively correlated with NDVIs and, to a lesser extent, stdevR(NIR) values in sandstone forests north of Sydney. As predicted, ant species richness was negatively correlated with NDVIs in forests to the south of Sydney. Also, ant species composition was different in areas with contrasting NDVIs. The ant species driving composition differences responded to habitat complexity in a similar way in forests to the north, and south, of Sydney. The strong association we detected between NDVIs and habitat complexity, most likely reflects the relatively exposed nature of the vegetative layers in the forests we sampled. Remote sensing, integrated with quantitative research testing predictive faunal responses to vegetation structure and biomass at landscape scales, may provide efficient means of estimating biodiversity for management in particular habitats.

The classification approaches used commonly to extract species information from remotely sensed imagery typically aim to optimize the overall accuracy of species identification, a target which need not satisfy the requirements of a particular user. Often users are interested in a specific species or subset of species, and these may not be accurately identified in a conventional classification. Here, a two-phase classification approach was used to map specific species from aerial sensor imagery of an ancient British woodland. Particular attention was focused on the identification of sycamore since this is displacing the native ash and information on its distribution would enhance basic understanding and management activities. The results show that the classification approach can be adapted to focus on a specific species of interest and used to increase classification accuracy significantly. For example, sycamore was classified to a low accuracy when a conventional approach to classification with a neural network was used (46.6-63.6%, depending on perspective), but the adoption of the two-phase approach increased its accuracy significantly (82.3-93.3%). The results demonstrate the ability to map specific class(es) of interest accurately from remotely sensed imagery. The approach used also highlights the ability to tailor an analysis to the specific requirements of the ecological study in hand and is of broad applicability.

Remote sensing has considerable potential to provide such maps, but classification accuracy within primary rain forests has generally been inadequate for practical applications. Here we test how accurately floristically defined forest types in lowland tropical rain forests in Peruvian Amazonia can be recognized using remote sensing data (Landsat ETM+ satellite image and STRM elevation model). Floristic data and a vegetation classification with four forest classes were available for eight line transects, each 8 km long, located in an area of ca 800 km. We compared two sampling unit sizes (line transect subunits of 200 and 500 m) and several image feature combinations to analyze their suitability for image classification. Mantel tests were used to quantify how well the patterns in elevation and in the digital numbers of the satellite image correlated with the floristic patterns observed in the field. Most Mantel correlations were positive and highly significant. Linear discriminant analysis was used first to build a function that discriminates between forest classes in the eight field-verified transects on the basis of remotely sensed data, and then to classify those parts of the line transects and the satellite image that had not been visited in the field. Classification accuracy was quantified by 8-fold crossvalidation. Two of the tierra firme (non-inundated) forest types were combined because they were too often misclassified. The remaining three forest types (inundated forest, terrace forest and Pebas formation/intermediate tierra firme forest) could be separated using the 500-m sampling units with an overall classification accuracy of 85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.62. For the 200-m sampling units, the classification accuracy was clearly lower (71%, Kappa 0.35). The forest classification will be used as habitat data to study wildlife habitat use in the same area. Our results show that remotely sensed data and relatively simple classification methods can be used to produce reasonably accurate forest type classifications, even in structurally homogeneous primary rain forests.

J	Leimgruber, P; Christen, CA; Laborderie, A				Leimgruber, P; Christen, CA; Laborderie, A			The impact of Landsat satellite monitoring on conservation biology	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Landsat 7's recent malfunctioning will result in significant gaps in long-term satellite monitoring of Earth, affecting not only the research of the Earth science community but also conservation users of these data. To determine whether or how important Landsat monitoring is for conservation and natural resource management, we reviewed the Landsat program's history with special emphasis on the development of user groups. We also conducted a bibliographic search to determine the extent to which conservation research has been based on Landsat data. Conservation biologists were not an early user group of Landsat data because a) biologists lacked technical capacity - computers and software - to analyze these data; b) Landsat's 1980s commercialization rendered images too costly for biologists' budgets; and c) the broad-scale disciplines of conservation biology and landscape ecology did not develop until the mid-to-late 1980s. All these conditions had changed by the 1990s and Landsat imagery became an important tool for conservation biology. Satellite monitoring and Landsat continuity are mandated by the Land Remote Sensing Act of 1992. This legislation leaves open commercial options. However, past experiments with commercial operations were neither viable nor economical, and severely reduced the quality of monitoring, archiving and data access for academia and the public. Future satellite monitoring programs are essential for conservation and natural resource management, must provide continuity with Landsat, and should be government operated.

J	Ferreira, MT; Aguiar, FC; Nogueira, C				Ferreira, MT; Aguiar, FC; Nogueira, C			Changes in Riparian woods over space and time: Influence of environment and land use	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Chronological studies (1951-1995) of the changing land use in three river basins belonging to the Tagus fluvial system (Portugal) were conducted using remote sensing data. The spatial characteristics of riparian woody vegetation and the temporal changes therein were quantified using landscape metrics such as average riparian canopy width, length of stand canopy closure types on river segments and patchiness indicators (e.g., the number of changes between types per survey unit). We also studied the predictive potential of geomorphology and climate features for explaining biological variability. We identify significant spatio-temporal land use changes on the adjacent floodplains, accompanied by remarkable differences in riparian integrity. Neither fragmentation patterns nor the loss or increase of riparian cover were consistent with similar land use changes throughout the rest of the studied basins, particularly in urbanizing landscape patches. The longitudinal patterns of streamside forests along Mediterranean-type rivers - particularly in Iberia - appear to be complex and dependent upon the previous life-history features of land use. Results also suggest that the proximity, type and extension of land use patch interplay influence the degree of changes in riparian integrity, which in overall terms displayed appreciable resistance to alterations and indirect disturbance. The results are broadly discussed with regard to spatial fine-grained scale changes in both land use and riparian integrity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Such a method will be a useful tool in planning the sustainable use and conservation of Amazonian rain forests. Location The study covered an area of c. 700 km(2) of primary rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador. Methods We field inventoried the species composition of pteridophytes and Melastomataceae in 340 inventory plots (5 m x 50 m), described the prevailing topography and analysed soil cation concentration and texture. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to summarize the floristic variation among the inventory plots in three ordination dimensions. The scores of the three ordination axes were predicted to non-visited places using a Landsat TM (thematic mapper) satellite image and the k nearest neighbours (knn) estimation method. To avoid extrapolation, we excluded from the analysis those pixel windows whose spectral values were not represented in the areas covered by field sampling. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by cross-validation and by comparing the predictions based on spectrally nearest neighbours to the predictions based on random neighbours. Results The floristic gradients presented by NMDS ordination were interpretable in terms of topography, drainage and soil cation content. Thirteen percent of the cloud-free pixels were excluded from the knn analysis to avoid extrapolation. The estimates of the floristic ordination scores based on spectrally nearest neighbours were always more accurate than estimates based on random neighbours. Main conclusions The presented method needs a relatively small input of work and resources, is mechanistic and produces maps that give relevant information on floristic variation over forest areas that are traditionally considered essentially homogeneous. Therefore, the method appears to have a great potential for use in mapping large areas of Amazonian rain forests.

Consequently, there is a loss of biodiversity due to change in habitat conditions. These remnant fragments provide the last hope for biodiversity conservation. The present study deals with the impact of decreasing patch size of a fragmented forest on the diversity of the tropical dry deciduous forests in Vindhyan highlands, India. There is considerable change in the vegetation cover of this region owing to rapid industrialization and urbanization, which has also contributed to forest fragmentation. In the present study, remotely sensed data has been used to describe the changes brought about in vegetated areas over a period of 10 years as a result of fragmentation and its impact on biodiversity was assessed. Further, in order to assess the loss of species with respect to the reduction in patch size, species area curves for various change areas were analysed. It was observed that the rate of decrease in the number of species is faster in the case of negative change areas as compared to the positive change areas of the region. Various diversity indices also support this observation. Such an analysis would help in formulating appropriate conservation measures for the region.

J	Nagendra, H; Karmacharya, M; Karna, B				Nagendra, H; Karmacharya, M; Karna, B			Evaluating forest management in Nepal: Views across space and time	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												This research follows the manner in which State-driven, upwardly accountable, forest decentralization programs play out on the ground, and evaluates their impact on forests and local institutions, a topic of much current concern and debate. In a landscape in Nepal's Terai plains, we conducted a census of 23 co-managed community and buffer-zone forest user groups-two predominant approaches to involving communities in forest-management activities in Nepal's Terai plains-to draw statistically relevant conclusions about the relative impact of these two programs at a landscape scale. We use a multidate Landsat TM (R) image classification to develop a land-cover change classification, and use this to generate objective, quantitative, biophysical indicators that enable us to assess the extent of clearing and regeneration in the forest areas controlled and managed by each of these communities. In-depth field interviews with the communities provide us with information about the impact of these initiatives on local institutions. Finally, we link these two kinds of information sets to interpret the satellite information on forest-cover change with reference to the socioeconomic processes and management rules that influence forest-cover change in these regions. Satellite image analysis shows the regeneration of several patches of forest that are managed within the purview of the Royal Chitwan National Park's buffer-zone program. This can be related to high levels of investment in plantation and forest-management activities by external agencies. The substantial revenue that these communities derive from ecotourism also helps, allowing them to hire forest guards, and afford better monitoring capabilities. In contrast, the less wealthy, community-forestry user groups have to make do with volunteer patrols, and do not have the same level of external technical and financial support to invest in plantation activities. Buffer-zone users, however, have to deal with rather strict controls on export of forest products, which were put in place by park authorities, and which the users do not have the power to modify. Downward accountability is limited, and communities do not have a high degree of effective control over forest-management policies. Thus, local communities currently function under a situation of constraint, where they have been delegated responsibilities, but lack the devolution of property rights and decision-making power. This has significant and potentially negative implications for the future of the program.

We introduce the idea of roadside verges as conservation areas and discuss the risks and opportunities of two potential scenarios for conservation. These are the introduction of mass reservoirs outside of the original areas of collection and conservation inside the area of origin. Four potential areas for in situ conservation in Latin America are identified. Although more detailed studies using remote sensing, soil information, and field reconnaissance will be necessary for a final assessment of the suggested areas as field conservation sites, we discuss the possibilities of establishing low-maintenance communities and the potential dangers of introducing harmful weed species. We do not have final answers with regard to the permanent maintenance of genetic diversity in these areas but suggest that further studies of genetic drift in the populations would not only be scientifically useful but might also lead to identifying useful genotypes for local use.																	1708-3087					JUN	2005	10	1							1									WOS:000230237900005

Factors such as explosive population growth, logging, mining, small-scale farming and ranching have synergistically fuelled deforestation in the state. The total area deforested in Rondonia in 1978 was 4200 km(2). In 1988, the area increased to 30 000 km(2), in 1998 to 53 300 km(2) and by the year 2003, a total of 67 764 km(2) of Rondonia was deforested. In response to the high rate of deforestation observed in Rondonia and other Amazonian states, state and federal agencies worked to create a network of conservation units (CUs) in Brazil during the 1990s that was signed into law (Law 9985/00) in 2000. The ability of these CUs to reduce the rate of deforestation was analysed. Remotely-sensed data from Landsat and thematic coverages were used to measure deforestation inside all CUs in Rondonia. A more detailed analysis of CUs with the highest levels of deforestation, including an analysis between soil types and deforestation and a forecast of potential future deforestation, was conducted. The creation of conservation units in Rondonia has been useful in curbing deforestation within their boundaries; however, many CUs face pressure from the combined activities of illegal loggers, cattle ranchers and small-scale farmers seeking new sources of timber and agricultural land. For example, an exponential increase in the amount of deforestation was observed in Rondonia's Bom Futuro National Forest between 1992 and 2000. A regression model indicated a total of 20 500 ha deforested by 2002, while measurements from 2002 imagery showed an actual total deforestation of 20 720 ha. Should this trend persist, Bom Futuro National Forest could be completely deforested by 2017. CUs in Rondonia must be developed and implemented jointly by all stakeholders through the creation of partnerships between local communities, non-governmental organizations and government agencies.

Reconsidering land-cover change in the Brazilian savanna	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												The Cerrado, the tropical savanna covering 22% of Brazil's territory, or approximately 1.783 million km(2), has suffered significant human impacts during the past three decades. This paper re-examines estimates of Cerrado vegetation change dynamics using high-resolution satellite remote sensing data from an area of interest extracted from eastern Mato Grosso State. This region has undergone a high degree of typical agricultural development since the early 1970s. Results indicate significant loss of original vegetation as well as high levels of regeneration, suggesting Cerrado vegetation may be more resilient to human impacts than catastrophic estimations suggest. The paper concludes with a critical review of Cerrado land-cover change studies and the implications of evidence for vegetation regeneration, land-cover dynamism and land-use intensification, paying particular attention to spatial scale and research methods. The discussion concludes that Cerrado land-cover change studied at a higher resolution and larger scales (smaller area) is required to represent more effectively the complexity of land conversion for better assessment of human impacts and environmental policy.																	0016-7398					JUN	2005	171		2				99	111		10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00153.x								WOS:000230553200001

We analyze the changes in lakes with an area >= 1 km(2) from the 1950s to 1998, using historical land-cover information and remote sensing data. The changes showed two distinct periods: the 1950s-1978 and 1978-1998. During the former period, the number of lakes fell from 414 to 250 (-39.6%) and total area decreased from 3885.4 km(2) to 1839.1 km(2) (-52.7%). During the latter period, the number of lakes rose, from 250 to 258 (+3.2%), while the area covered increased from 1839.1 km(2) to 2144.4 km(2) (+16.6%). The rapid fall in numbers of lakes from the 1950s to 1978 was largely attributed to extensive impoldering (land reclamation through draining techniques), resulting in substantial negative ecological consequences, such as increased flooding and a decline in biodiversity. In contrast, the increase in lake numbers and area from 1978 to 1998 was mainly due to the implementation of government policy prohibiting impoldering along the Yangtze River, and the return of inundated arable lands for aquaculture by local people.

It assesses the implications for bird conservation regionally and the scope for biodiversity assessments generally. Location A 200 km by 400 km area of farmland with seminatural and urban areas, covering south-eastern England. Methods Cluster analysis was used to link birds to landscapes. Cluster centroid coordinate values were processed to derive indices of bird-habitat preference. Further developments assessed the relative values of individual habitats for birds. Results Clustering objectively linked birds to landscapes. Maps of the clusters showed strong regional patterns associated with distinctive habitat assemblages. Derived indices related bird species directly to individual habitats and habitats to birds. Even rare species and scarce habitats showed successful linkages, often to each other. Objective corroboration strongly supported the associations of coastal, wetland, urban and woodland birds and habitats; but, it suggested that farmland birds, whose numbers have nearly halved since 1977, may prefer alternative habitats. Main conclusions Land cover maps from remote sensing provide an effective way to link birds to habitats and vice versa. Thus, generalized habitat maps might be used to extrapolate localized or sample-based bird observations or the results of autecological studies, helping to predict and understand bird distributions in the wider countryside. The weak links between farmland birds and farmland habitats in a region dominated by farming, suggests that reasons for the decline in farmland birds may be deep seated and thus hard to reverse. The procedures described are repeatable elsewhere and applicable more generally to evaluate landscapes and biodiversity. It is suggested that remote sensing could rarely be bettered as a means of assessing habitats, comprehensively, over wide areas, in most parts of the world.

The fragmentation scenario has been quantified using remote sensing data and GIS techniques. The remotely sensed data-derived vegetation map was an input to the fragmentation analysis. Transects were laid to inventory along different forest patch sizes of various communities to study the biodiversity levels. It was observed that with changing fragment, there is change in biodiversity levels. Hence, patch size might play an important role in the regulation of biodiversity levels. This information may provide an insight into the conservation strategy formulation for the fragmented dry tropical area. The analysis has brought out that biodiversity levels are different in various fragments of different sizes. Small fragments are similar to each other in terms of species composition; similar is the case with large fragments in general. It was also found that the small and large fragments are dissimilar in terms of species composition. The diversity levels among the fragments of similar size class varied across the anthropogenic gradient. Analysis of species richness, diversity indices has helped in studying the patterns/levels of biodiversity in different fragment size classes along different levels of anthropogenic pressure. The merits of conserving the small and large fragments have been discussed.																	0011-3891					APR 25	2005	88	8					1264	1274										WOS:000228825100018						
J	Hilli, M; Kuitunen, MT				Hilli, M; Kuitunen, MT			Testing the use of a land cover map for habitat ranking in boreal forests	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Habitat loss and modification is one of the major threats to biodiversity and the preservation of conservation values. We use the term "conservation value" to mean the benefit of nature or habitats for species. The importance of identifying and preserving conservation values has increased with the decline in biodiversity and the adoption of more stringent environmental legislation. In this study, conservation values were considered in the context of land-use planning and the rapidly increasing demand for more accurate methods of predicting and identifying these values. We used a k-nearest neighbor interpreted satellite (Landsat TM) image classified in 61 classes to assess sites with potential conservation values at the regional and landscape planning scale. Classification was made at the National Land Survey of Finland for main tree species, timber volume, land-use type, and soil on the basis of spectral reflectance in satellite image together with broad numerical reference data. We used the number and rarity of vascular plant species observed in the field as indicators for potential conservation values. We assumed that significant differences in the species richness, rarity, or composition of flora among the classes interpreted in the satellite image would also mean a difference in conservation values among these classes. We found significant differences in species richness among the original satellite image classes. Many of the classes examined could be distinguished by the number of plant species. Species composition also differed correspondingly. Rare species were most abundant in old spruce forests (> 200 m(3)/ha), raising the position of such forests in the ranking of categories according to conservation values. The original satellite image classification was correct for 70% of the sites studied. We concluded that interpreted satellite data can serve as a useful source for evaluating habitat categories on the basis of plant species richness and rarity. Recategorization of original satellite image classification into such new conservation value categories is challenging because of the variation in species composition among the new categories. However, it does not represent a major problem for the purposes of early-stage land-use planning. Benefits of interpreted satellite image recategorization as a rapid conservation value assessment tool for land-use planners would be great.																	0364-152X					APR	2005	35	4					505	516		10.1007/s00267-003-0301-1								WOS:000229616700013	15902448

In this paper, using information of forest cover from 1960 to 2000 derived from aerial photography and remote sensing data, we examine the dynamics associated with deforestation and secondary growth processes at the Chorotega region, Costa Rica. Our analysis is conducted using a comprehensive land capability map developed for the country. Our results indicate the occurrence of two well-defined land cover change processes over time. Extensive/intensive cattle ranching practices that contribute to significant forest degradation and forest cover loss characterize the first of these processes, occur-ring between 1960 and 1980. The second period (1980-2000) is characterized by a dynamic process of secondary forest growth resulting from a combination of internal and international market forces and conservation initiatives. Conclusions from this paper indicate that more attention needs to be paid to tropical secondary landscapes that are recuperating from years of constant degradation. This natural recovery process could be beneficial for biodiversity recovery, biological corridors and environmental services. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adverse impacts on terrestrial and oceanic environments often compound in the intertidal area, where mangrove forest ecosystems thrive. In tropical coastal areas of many developing countries where people depend on wood and other mangrove forest products and services, forest degradation leads to socioeconomic problems. At the same time, increasing freshwater needs in these areas are expected to cause additional problems [3-5]. On the basis of remote sensing and ground truthing complemented by colonial archival material from the Dutch East India Company (1602-1800), we report that changes to the historic system of inland freshwater management have increased dramatically in recent times. Hydrological changes, such as interbasin transfers, have resulted in a qualitative ecological and socioeconomic degradation in three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka. Variations in river hydrology have caused changes in the areas suitable as mangrove habitat and, thus, have resulted in an altered distribution. However, increases in mangrove area can mask the degradation of the site in terms of floristic composition, significance of the species, and biodiversity (this effect is termed "cryptic ecological degradation"). It is important that such changes be carefully monitored to ensure biological and socioeconomic sustainability.

J	Andrefouet, S; Guzman, HM				Andrefouet, S; Guzman, HM			Coral reef distribution, status and geomorphology-biodiversity relationship in Kuna Yala (San Blas) archipelago, Caribbean Panama	CORAL REEFS												Most of the knowledge of the reef geomorphology and benthic communities of Kuna Yala coral reefs (Caribbean Panama) comes from the western side of the archipelago, a few tens of kilometers around Punta San Blas (Porvenir). To bridge the gap between Porvenir and the Colombia-Panama border, we investigated with Landsat images the extent and geomorphological diversity of the entire Kuna Yala to provide geomorphologic maps of the archipelago in 12 classes. In addition to remote sensing data, in situ survey conducted in May-June 2001 provided a Kuna Yala-wide first synoptic vision of reef status, in terms of benthic diversity (number of species of coral, octocorals, and sponges) and reef health (coral versus algal cover). For a total reef system estimated to cover 638 km(2) along 480 km of coastline, 195 km(2) include coral dominated areas and only 35 km(2) can be considered covered by corals. A total of 69 scleractinian coral, 38 octocoral, and 82 sponge species were recorded on the outer slopes of reef formations, with a slightly higher diversity in the area presenting the most abundant and diverse reef formations (western Kuna Yala). Attempts to relate benthic diversity and geomorphological diversity provided only weak relationships regardless of the taxa, and suggest that habitat heterogeneity within geomorphological areas explain better the patterns of coral diversity. This study confirms the potential of combined remote sensing and in situ surveys for regional scale assessment, and we suggest that similar approaches should be generalized for reef mapping and assessment for other reef sites.																	0722-4028					MAR	2005	24	1					31	42		10.1007/s00338-004-0444-4								WOS:000227742400006

To contribute to these goals, a terrestrial carbon observing system requires the synthesis of several kinds of observation into terrestrial biosphere models encompassing the coupled cycles of carbon, water, energy and nutrients. Relevant observations include atmospheric composition (concentrations of CO(2) and other gases); remote sensing; flux and process measurements from intensive study sites; in situ vegetation and soil monitoring; weather, climate and hydrological data; and contemporary and historical data on land use, land use change and disturbance (grazing, harvest, clearing, fire). A review of model-data synthesis tools for terrestrial carbon observation identifies 'nonsequential' and 'sequential' approaches as major categories, differing according to whether data are treated all at once or sequentially. The structure underlying both approaches is reviewed, highlighting several basic commonalities in formalism and data requirements. An essential commonality is that for all model-data synthesis problems, both nonsequential and sequential, data uncertainties are as important as data values themselves and have a comparable role in determining the outcome. Given the importance of data uncertainties, there is an urgent need for soundly based uncertainty characterizations for the main kinds of data used in terrestrial carbon observation. The first requirement is a specification of the main properties of the error covariance matrix. As a step towards this goal, semi-quantitative estimates are made of the main properties of the error covariance matrix for four kinds of data essential for terrestrial carbon observation: remote sensing of land surface properties, atmospheric composition measurements, direct flux measurements, and measurements of carbon stores.

This paper presents new information relevant to land cover modifications and to resource inventory such as forest management and wildlife habitats. Formed in 1991, Bach Ma National Park and its buffer zone is one of the richest regions for biodiversity in Asia, providing habitat for endangered species. The paper assesses the major forest cover changes using Remote Sensing Imagery (Landsat: MSS, TM, +ETM) between the years prior to the establishment of national park status and the years following. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used across sensors; for the study area five regions were identified where major land-cover changes have occurred. Between 1973 and 2001 it is estimated that approximately 45% of the buffer zone was modified, or lost its forest cover, with most changes occurring around 1989, just prior to the park establishment. These changes can most likely be attributed to forest and resource extrapolation that coincided with a high human population density and is supported by extensive road building in the surrounding region. More research is needed to improve presented approaches in order to better safeguard forested landscapes in Vietnam.																	1465-5489					MAR	2005	7	1					1	8		10.1505/ifor.7.1.1.64163								WOS:000229056200001

Physical alteration, habitat loss, water withdrawal, pollution, overexploitation and the introduction of non-native species all contribute to the decline in freshwater species. Today, freshwater species are, in general, at higher risk of extinction than those in forests, grasslands and coastal ecosystems. For North America alone, the projected extinction rate for freshwater fauna is five times greater than that for terrestrial fauna-a rate comparable to the species loss in tropical rainforest. Because many of these extinctions go unseen, the level of assessment and knowledge of the status and trends of freshwater species are still very poor, with species going extinct before they are even taxonomically classified. Increasing human population growth and achieving the sustainable development targets set forth in 2002 will place even higher demands on the already stressed freshwater ecosystems, unless an integrated approach to managing water for people and ecosystems is implemented by a broad constituency. To inform and implement policies that support an integrated approach to water management, as well as to measure progress in halting the rapid decline in freshwater species, basin-level indicators describing the condition and threats to freshwater ecosystems and species are required. This paper discusses the extent and quality of data available on the number and size of populations of freshwater species, as well as the change in the extent and condition of natural freshwater habitats. The paper presents indicators that can be applied at multiple scales, highlighting the usefulness of using remote sensing and geographical information systems technologies to fill some of the existing information gaps. Finally, the paper includes an analysis of major data gaps and information needs with respect to freshwater species to measure progress towards the 2010 biodiversity targets.																	0962-8436					FEB 28	2005	360	1454					397	413		10.1098/rstb.2004.1595								WOS:000228214600014	15814353					
J	Ingram, JC; Dawson, TP; Whittaker, RJ				Ingram, JC; Dawson, TP; Whittaker, RJ			Mapping tropical forest structure in southeastern Madagascar using remote sensing and artificial neural networks	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Tropical forest condition has important implications for biodiversity, climate change and human needs. Structural features of forests can serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area (p<0.01) while there were weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=-0.69, p<0.01) when using a subset of the data, which represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, p<0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, p<0.01). The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semi-quantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.

Previous broad-scale studies on biodiversity and wildlife habitat have suffered from a lack of detailed information about understory distribution. Consequently, it is unclear how understory distribution influences the analysis of habitat quantity and spatial distribution. To address this problem, we compared estimates of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat with and without understory bamboo. The results show that the spatial distribution of bamboo has a substantial effect on the quantity and spatial arrangement of panda habitat. Total amount of estimated habitat decreased by 29-52% and decreased connectivity was notable after bamboo information was incorporated into the analyses. The decreases in the quantity and quality of panda habitat resulted in a decrease of 41% in the estimated carrying capacity. Our results suggest that it is necessary to incorporate understory vegetation into large-scale wildlife habitat research and management to avoid overestimation of habitat and improve broad-scale analyses of species distributions and biodiversity estimates in general.

J	DeFries, R; Hansen, A; Newton, AC; Hansen, MC				DeFries, R; Hansen, A; Newton, AC; Hansen, MC			Increasing isolation of protected areas in tropical forests over the past twenty years	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Protected areas are one of the cornerstones for conserving the world's remaining biodiversity, most of which occurs in tropical forests. We use multiple sources of satellite data to estimate the extent of forest habitat and loss over the last 20 years within and surrounding 198 of the most highly protected areas (IUCN status 1 and 2) located throughout the world's tropical forests. In the early 1980s, surrounding habitat in the 50-km unprotected or less highly protected "buffers" enhanced the protected areas' effective size and their capacity to conserve richness of forest-obligate,species above the hypothetical case of complete isolation. However, in nearly 70% of the surrounding buffers, the area of forest habitat declined during the last 20 years, while 25% experienced declines within their administrative boundaries. The loss of habitat occurred in all tropical regions, but protected areas in South and Southeast Asia were most severely affected because of relatively low surrounding forest habitat in the early 1980s and high subsequent loss, particularly in dry tropical forests. The future ability of protected areas to maintain current species richness depends on integrating reserve management within the land use dynamics of their larger regional, settings.

J	Gillespie, TW				Gillespie, TW			Predicting woody-plant species richness in tropical dry forests: A case study from south Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Tropical dry forests are one of the world's most endangered forest types. Currently there are no comparative data on extent or levels of species richness for remaining forest fragments. This research identifies landscape metrics and spectral indices that can be applied at the stand and patch level to predict woody-plant species richness in tropical dry forests. This study was undertaken in 18 stands of tropical dry forest with nine sites in the Florida Keys and nine sites within an urban-agricultural matrix in mainland Florida, USA. Woody-plant species richness was quantified at the stand level (belt transects totaling 500 m(2)) and patch level (presence/absence data for 65 native tropical plants less than or equal to2.5 cm dbh) for all study sites. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images (pixel resolution 30 x 30 m) were used to assess the utility of landscape metrics (forest patch area, nearest neighbor distance, shape index, boundary complexity) and spectral indices (normalized-difference vegetation index [NDVI] for nine pixels and 500 pixels directly over transects, and all pixels in the forest patch area) for predicting stand- and patch-level species richness. The 18 stands of tropical dry forest sampled in this study included 4248 woody plants, representing 71 species. Islands in the Florida Keys had higher levels of woody-plant species richness than mainland sites. There was a significant positive relationship between mean NDVI for the nine pixels over each stand and stand species richness and a significant negative relationship between species richness and standard deviation of NDVI for nine pixels over each stand. The density of evergreen plants explained 66% of the variability in mean NDVI. At the patch level, forest patch area and mean NDVI at the stand, 500-pixel, and patch level were all positively associated with patch species richness. However, combining forest patch area with NDVI significantly improved the prediction of patch species richness. Results from this study support the species-energy theory at the level of a forest stand and patch and suggest that a first-order approximation of woody-plant species richness in stands and patches of tropical dry forest is possible in biodiversity hot spots.																	1051-0761					FEB	2005	15	1					27	37		10.1890/03-5304								WOS:000227120700003

Wetlands constitute a significant environmental system, since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species and therefore contribute to the conservation of high global biodiversity. However, they suffer from degradation because of the intensification of agriculture, the increase in pollution rates and poor water management practices. This study attempts to develop a methodology by combining GIS applications, remote-sensing techniques and physically based hydrologic modelling for the formation of water management plans in lake catchments. This methodology has been tested in Trichonis Lake catchment, in Western Greece, where the endangered calcareous fens habitat undergoes great ecological stresses due to the irrational use of local water resources. The first results indicated that the particular methodology operated efficiently. The suggested scenario has been adopted by the local water authorities and the significant water level fluctuations observed in the past have been eliminated to approximately 25% in the initial implementation period.

An attempt is made to establish the relationship existing between biological richness and biotic disturbances across an altitudinal gradient, divided into six zones based on different vegetation types. Biological richness was determined as a function of ecosystem uniqueness, species diversity, biodiversity value, terrain complexity and disturbance index. Satellite images of IRS 1C/1D LISS III are used to stratify different vegetation types following a hybrid approach supplemented with biogeographic and altitude zone maps. The number of economically important species, medicinal species and endemic species decreases with altitude. High level of disturbance was observed across settlements and road networks and the areas having simpler and easily accessible terrains. A declining trend in species richness and plant endemism is noticed with increase in altitude. Habitats with low disturbance, highly complex terrain, high degree of species richness, plant endemism and species uniqueness show high level of biological richness. In general, the disturbance decreased with increase in altitude, whereas biological richness shows a hump-shaped pattern for Arunachal Pradesh. It was observed that high biological richness and high disturbance occurred in lower altitudes, whereas high-altitude areas showed low biological richness and low level of disturbance. The study demonstrates integration of remote sensing and GIS for landscape ecological modelling and thereby contributes to the understanding of biodiversity distribution in the Eastern Himalayas, Arunachal Pradesh.																	0011-3891					JAN 25	2005	88	2					250	257										WOS:000227161300017

In this study, we investigated the application of high spatial resolution ( 80 cm) Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 2 (CASI-2) data for mapping both spectrally complex species and species groups (subgenus grouping) in an Australian eucalypt forest. The relationships between spectral reflectance curves of individual tree species and identified statistical differences among species were analysed with ANOVA. Supervised maximum likelihood classifications were then performed to assess tree species separability in CASI-2 imagery. Results indicated that turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera Smith), mesic vegetation ( primarily rainforest species), and an amalgamated group of eucalypts could be readily distinguished. The discrimination of S. glomulifera was particularly robust, with consistently high classification accuracies. Eucalypt classification as a broader species group, rather than individual species, greatly improved classification performance. However, separating sunlit and shaded aspects of tree crowns did not increase classification accuracy.																	0067-1924						2005	53	4					337	345		10.1071/BT04085								WOS:000230008100005

Four quantitative models that describe sage grouse breeding habitat selection were developed for multiple scales using logistic regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS-Salford Systems). Based on candidate models and AIC, important habitat predictor variables were elevation, distance to human development, slope, distance to roads, NDVI and distance to water, but not Sagebrush. Some predictors changed when using different scales and MARS. For the year 2011, a cumulative prediction index approach is presented on how the population viability of sage grouse can be assessed over time and space using Markov chain models for deriving future landscape scenarios and MARS for species predictions.																	0302-9743		3-540-25862-0				2005	3482						152	161										WOS:000229696900017						
J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R				Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R			Mapping the spatial distribution of plant diversity indices in a tropical forest using multi-spectral satellite image classification and field measurements	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The relationships among alpha and beta diversity indices, computed from 141 randomly sampled quadrats, and the vegetation classes obtained by multi-spectral satellite image classification, were used as a strategy for mapping plant diversity in a tropical landscape mosaic. A relatively high accuracy of the land cover map was revealed by the overall accuracy assessment and the Cohen's Kappa statistic. Species accumulation models were used to evaluate how representative the sample size was of the different vegetation types. A standard one-way, between-subjects ANOVA confirmed a significant reduction of the within-class variance of plant diversity with respect to their total variance across the landscape. Computed uniformity indices, to assess the internal uniformity of vegetation classes on the diversity indices, confirmed the goodness of the mapped classes in stratifying variability of plant diversity. This allowed for the use of the mapped classes as spatial interpolators of plant diversity values for estimation and up-scaling purposes. Finally, it was revealed that the plant diversity of the landscape depends, to a large extent, on the diversity contained in the most mature forest class, which is also the most diverse community in the studied area. High and moderate beta diversity values between mature forests and both the secondary associations and the first stages of succession, respectively, indicated that there is a significant contribution to the diversity of the landscape by those vegetation classes.																	0960-3115					DEC	2004	13	14					2599	2621										WOS:000225468900002

We calculated the average fire-return interval for. each of the vegetation types individually, and for the MWLS as a whole. Using vegetation data from the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and the entire Western Ghats region, we conservatively estimated fire frequency information for these larger regions. Because the MWLS does not contain tropical evergreen or montane forests, we were unable to estimate fire conditions in these fire conditions in these forest types, which represent 31% of all Western Ghats vegetation cover. For the MWLS, all vegetation types had average fire-return intervals of <7 years, and the sanctuary as a whole had a fire-return interval of 3.3 years. Compared with a 13-year MWLS fire data set from 1909-1921, this represents a threefold increase in fire frequency over the last 80 years. We estimated average fire-return intervals of roughly 5 years for both the larger Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve and the entire Western Ghats region. Given other recent reports, the estimated fire frequencies for the Western Ghats forests outside protected reserves are conservative. We conclude that the current fire regime of the Western Ghats poses a severe and persistent conservation threat to forests both within and outside protected reserves.

J	Luoto, M; Virkkala, R; Heikkinen, RK; Rainio, K				Luoto, M; Virkkala, R; Heikkinen, RK; Rainio, K			Predicting bird species richness using remote sensing in boreal agricultural-forest mosaics	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												One of the main goals in nature conservation and land use planning is to identify areas important for biodiversity. One possible cost-effective surrogate for deriving appropriate estimates of spatial patterns of species richness is provided by predictive modeling based on remote sensing and topographic data. Using bird species richness data from a spatial grid system (105 squares of 0.25 km(2) within an area of 26.25 km(2)), we tested the usefulness of Landsat TM satellite-based remote sensing and topographic data in bird species richness modeling in a boreal agricultural-forest mosaic in southwestern Finland. We built generalized linear models for the bird species richness and validated the accuracy of the models with an independent test area of 50 grid squares (12.5 km(2)). We evaluated separately the modeling performance of habitat structure, habitat composition, topographical-moisture variables and all variables in the model-building and model-test areas. Areas of high observed and predicted bird species richness in the boreal agricultural-forest mosaic were mainly concentrated along river valleys in the grid squares with a high habitat diversity and steep topography. This landscape type also has the highest cover of habitats important for nature conservation: seminatural grasslands, deciduous forests, and watercourses. The covers of deciduous forests and serninatural grassland were included as explanatory variables of the bird species richness model, although they both cover only about 5% of the land in the study area. When the four models were evaluated by fitting them to the model test area, the explanatory power of the topography-moisture model decreased clearly, whereas the habitat-composition, habitat-structure, and all-variables models were more rigorous. Finally, we extrapolated the models to the whole study area of 600 km(2) and produced bird species richness probability maps using GIS techniques. We conclude that, instead of scattered study plots in which birds are counted, predictive modeling requires large study areas where the variation within the whole landscape can be taken into account. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing data produces the most reliable data sets, which can be used when predicting species richness in other landscapes.

J	Kerr, JT; Deguise, I				Kerr, JT; Deguise, I			Habitat loss and the limits to endangered species recovery	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Canada is one of the last places on earth with extensive wilderness areas, yet the number of Canadian species threatened with extinction continues to rise every year. Using satellite-derived land use data, we find that habitat loss explains most of the variation in numbers of endangered species across Canada. Habitat loss within species ranges is, therefore, likely to be the leading factor inhibiting their recovery. We measured habitat loss individually within the known ranges of 243 terrestrial species at risk of extinction across Canada. Recovery potential, as measured by extent of natural habitat within each species' range, is bimodally distributed, but less than 50% of the range of the majority of Canada's species at risk is natural habitat and there is no detectable habitat remaining for 16 of the 243 species at risk. There were no differences in the recovery potential of species categorized either by threat level (special concern, threatened, or endangered) or taxon. Despite having extensive wilderness areas, Canada has similar rates of endangerment to other countries in the Americas, underlining the effect of severe habitat loss to intensive agriculture that has occurred in Canada's most biologically diverse regions. Improvements to protected areas networks and especially cooperative conservation activities with private landowners will do the most to improve the recovery prospects of species at risk in Canada.																	1461-023X					DEC	2004	7	12					1163	1169		10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00676.x								WOS:000225078000006

The stations were in close geographical proximity to each other, yet very different phytoplankton assemblages were found. The factors that control phytoplankton biodiversity were investigated. Satellite remote sensing was used to map the development of stratification and fronts in spring and this placed the stations within a strong temporal context. Stations with a well-mixed water column had high nutrient concentrations, high rates of production and the phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by diatoms. At those stations with a stratified water column, nutrient concentrations were depleted but the assemblage was dominated by dinoflagellates and microflagellates. The ratios of depth-integrated primary production to depth-integrated chlorophyll concentration (P/B ratio) were higher at those stations with mixed water columns than at those in stratified waters. That is, under the low nutrient/high light conditions at the stratified station, there was less production than might have been expected for the quantity of chlorophyll present. The photosynthetic characteristics of the phytoplankton assemblages were determined at the stratified stations. P-m(B) values varied from 1.43 to 4.79 mg C [mg Ch1](-1) h(-1), while alpha(B) ranged from 0.011 to 0.047 mg C [mg Ch1](-1) h(-1) (mumol photons m(-2) s(-1))(-1). Phytoplankton biodiversity was low at every station and did not appear to influence primary production rates; the highest rate of daily primary production measured (2.4 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was at a station where a single species accounted for > 70% of the phytoplankton biomass.

Much of the current discussion centered around comparisons of management regimes can be traced to a dearth of cross-site quantitative evaluations, Remote sensing provides a particularly effective tool for this purpose, yet analysis of remotely sensed data requires fieldwork to interpret human activities and the socioeconomic and political contexts that relate to land cover change. This paper examines the effect of establishment of the Celaque National Park, Honduras, and the Royal Chitwan National Park buffer zone, Nepal, on limiting deforestation. In Celaque, the park itself has been largely successful in maintaining forest cover. However, recent changes in land use patterns have led to increasing pressure on the park boundaries, exacerbated by the lack of involvement of local residents. In the Royal Chitwan National Park, in contrast, participatory approaches towards co-management have been implemented over the past decade in the park buffer zone. With significant incomes derived from ecotourism, complete protection of the buffer zone forest has been adopted, leading to significant regrowth of tree cover. However, local decision-making power is limited, and buffer zone management has largely proven successful due to the investment and support provided by international donor agencies. These two case studies demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems analysis in providing a spatiotemporal perspective for assessing management policies. They also demonstrate the importance of fieldwork to provide a nuanced understanding of the socioeconomic and institutional conditions affecting the outcomes of forest management regimes.

J	Ravan, S; Kale, M; Roy, PS				Ravan, S; Kale, M; Roy, PS			Identification of potential sites for in situ conservation of landraces associated with forest ecosystem - Geomatics approach	CURRENT SCIENCE												Landraces may be defined as a locally adapted strain of a species bred through traditional methods of direct selection. There has been a continuous threat to these landraces due to outcrossing, migration of cultivators to the urban areas and replacement of high yielding varieties with traditional crops. Among many reasons to conserve forest ecosystem, landraces can be one of the important reasons, which focuses on protecting agro-biodiversity existing in the vicinity of forest ecosystem. One of the important observations was that, these landraces were present in proximity of forest areas where forest floor litter serves as source of manure. So it is implicit that without forests these crops cannot sustain. Forest floor litter, which is generally abundant in the study area, is gradually converted to humus, which during rainy seasons goes down-streams to agricultural areas. No chemical fertilizers are used for growing these crops. Since mapping of landraces using remote sensing data is difficult, an alternative approach is proposed for 'Mapping Potential Land Race Zone' rather than delineating agricultural patches. Land races are governed largely by terrain complexity and remoteness of villages. This information coupled with land-use land cover map provides basis to perform multi criteria modeling, thus helping in identifying potential land race zones.																	0011-3891					OCT 25	2004	87	8					1115	1122										WOS:000224925100027

This study examines the effect of establishment of the Celaque National Park, Honduras, in 1987, on limiting deforestation through a comparison with the surrounding landscape using remote sensing, GIS and landscape pattern analysis. Pressure on the park region is found to relate spatially to the locations of towns and roads, with increasing deforestation in the landscape surrounding the park. In contrast, the park has been largely successful in maintaining forest cover. Although the extent of change within the park is not pronounced, the pattern of change is. Expansion of agriculture and coffee production have led to increasing pressure on the park boundaries, with as much as 25% of the landscape surrounding the park experiencing land cover change between 1996 and 2000. This has significant implications for the future of the park. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Seto, KC; Fleishman, E; Fay, JP; Betrus, CJ				Seto, KC; Fleishman, E; Fay, JP; Betrus, CJ			Linking spatial patterns of bird and butterfly species richness with Landsat TM derived NDVI	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The ability to predict spatial patterns of species richness using a few easily measured environmental variables would facilitate timely evaluation of potential impacts of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Two common hypotheses maintain that faunal species richness can be explained in part by either local vegetation heterogeneity or primary productivity. Although remote sensing has long been identified as a potentially powerful source of information on the latter, its principal application to biodiversity studies has been to develop classified vegetation maps at relatively coarse resolution, which then have been used to estimate animal diversity. Although classification schemes can be delineated on the basis of species composition of plants, these schemes generally do not provide information on primary productivity. Furthermore, the classification procedure is a time- and labour-intensive process, yielding results with limited accuracy. To meet decision-making needs and to develop land management strategies, more efficient methods of generating information on the spatial distribution of faunal diversity are needed. This article reports on the potential of predicting species richness using single-date Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). We use NDVI as an indicator of vegetation productivity, and examine the relationship of three measures of NDVI - mean, maximum, and standard deviation - with patterns of bird and butterfly species richness at various spatial scales. Results indicate a positive correlation, but with no definitive functional form, between species richness and productivity. The strongest relationships between species richness of birds and NDVI were observed at larger sampling grains and extent, where each of the three NDVI measures explained more than 50% of the variation in species richness. The relationship between species richness of butterflies and NDVI was strongest over smaller grains. Results suggest that measures of NDVI are an alternative approach for explaining the spatial variability of species richness of birds and butterflies.

To characterize ecosystem functioning by focusing on above-ground net primary production (ANPP), and 2. to relate the spatial heterogeneity of both functional and structural attributes of vegetation to environmental factors and landscape structure. We discuss the relationship between vegetation structure and functioning found in Patagonia in terms of the capabilities of remote sensing techniques to monitor and assess desertification. Location Western portion of the Patagonian steppes in Argentina (39degrees30' S to 45degrees27' S). Methods We used remotely-sensed data from Landsat TM and AVHRR/NOAA sensors to characterize vegetation structure (physiognomic units) and ecosystem functioning (ANPP and its seasonal and interannual variation). We combined the satellite information with floristic releves and field estimates of ANPP. We built an empirical relationship between the Landsat TM-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and field ANPP. Using stepwise regressions we explored the relationship between ANPP and both environmental variables (precipitation and temperature surrogates) and structural attributes of the landscape (proportion and diversity of different physiognomic classes (PCs)). Results PCs were quite heterogeneous in floristic terms, probably reflecting degradation processes. Regional estimates of ANPP showed differences of one order of magnitude among physiognomic classes. Fifty percent of the spatial variance in ANPP was accounted for by longitude, reflecting the dependency of ANPP on precipitation. The proportion of prairies and semideserts, latitude and, to a lesser extent, the number of PCs within an 8 x 8 km cell accounted for an additional 33% of the ANPP variability. ANPP spatial heterogeneity (calculated from Landsat TM data) within an 8 x 8 km cell was positively associated with the mean AVHRR/NOAA NDVI and with the diversity of physiognomic classes. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem functioning described from ANPP result not only from water availability and thermal conditions but also from landscape structure (proportion and diversity of different PCs). The structural classification performed using remotely-sensed data captured the spatial variability in physiognomy. Such capability will allow the use of spectral classifications to monitor desertification.

We have evaluated as a first step the contribution of multitemporal ERS data and contextual methods of classification, with and without filtering, for the discrimination of vegetation types. The present study shows the importance of time series of the ERS sensor and of the vectorial MMSE (minimum mean square error) filter based on segmentation for land cover classification. Fifteen land cover classes were discriminated (eight concerning different vegetation types) with a mean producer's accuracy of 0.81 for a five-date time series within 1998, and of 0.71 for another four-date time series for 1994/1995. These results are comparable to those from SPOT XS images: 0.69 for July, 0.67 for October (0.85 for July plus October), and also from TM data ( 0.81). These results are corroborated by the kappa coefficient of agreement. The fusion between the 1994 series of ERS and XS (July), based on a derived method of the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, shows a slight improvement on overall accuracies: +0.06 of mean producer's accuracy and +0.04 of kappa coefficient.

These characteristics of the wetland also present innumerable challenges for mapping and monitoring such unique ecosystems. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided many sensors with different spatial and spectral scales and resolutions. However, they are still inadequate for mapping wetland vegetation at a large scale for various reasons, such as inadequate resolution and high costs. This study was designed to evaluate the potential of balloon aerial photography to acquire high resolution (15 cm pixel size) imagery for mapping wetland vegetation in the Akanuma marsh. We used a standard 28-mm non-metric camera (Nikon-F-801), which was mounted on helium-filled balloons operated by a remote radio-controlled system. By creating digital vegetation maps from visual interpretation of mosaicked photos, ten general types of vegetation and twenty-seven specific categories (species mixes) were successfully delineated. It was possible to classify small shrubs mixed with herbaceous plants; moss bogs with pools; dwarf shrubs with sedges; and moss with alpine plants. From this research, it seems that balloon aerial photography is a powerful tool for mapping temperate wetland vegetation, allowing classification of specific and typical vegetation types to the genus and species level.																	0277-5212					SEP	2004	24	3					701	710		10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0701:UOBAPF]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000224309600018						
J	Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ				Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ			Using biogeography to help set priorities in marine conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Biogeographic information has great potential to enhance systematic conservation planning, although it has yet to be routinely incorporated in marine situations. Fundamental differences between marine and terrestrial environments (physical, biological, and sociopolitical) mean that biogeographic data are harder to obtain for marine systems, biogeographic boundaries more difficult to define, and the outcomes of similar conservation approaches may differ Despite these challenges, an understanding of spatial context, connections, and scales of processes is needed to set conservation priorities that ensure the representation and continued persistence of species and habitats within functioning ecosystems. As we discovered in our review, scientific knowledge of marine systems is increasing rapidly thanks to recent advances in genetics, remote sensing, and geographical information systems. Such knowledge and tools have important implications for marine planning. We also reviewed the degree to which biogeography is incorporated into current marine conservation projects at spatial scales ranging from global to local. Overall, initiatives are becoming more regional in scope and incorporating biogeographic data in an increasingly rigorous manner However, initiatives that use few or no data are also on the rise and need to be treated with due caution. We recommend undertaking global and regional reviews within biogeographic frameworks; combining analytical approaches to determine biogeographic classifications and to define a range of potential conservation areas with stakeholder involvement to set priorities; understanding contemporary processes that maintain species distributions; and acquiring knowledge of historical distributions to provide appropriate baselines for current conservation. The urgent need for marine conservation, however, means that planning should proceed with the best currently available biogeographic information even while biogeographic research continues.																	0888-8892					AUG	2004	18	4					1004	1020		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00137.x								WOS:000222979400022

A number of species were strongly associated with one cover type and negatively with others. The major variation was for preferences for covers in upland or lowland parts of the region. Other distinct preferences for some species were covers such as those at the coast whilst a number of common species showed no strong preference for any cover variable.

J	Butler, R; Schlaepfer, R				Butler, R; Schlaepfer, R			Spruce snag quantification by coupling colour infrared aerial photos and a GIS	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Among different dead wood types, large snags have a particular ecological relevance for biodiversity in forest ecosystems. For both research and management purposes, rapid and cost-effective inventories of large snags are required. Due to the great variability within stands and across the landscape, field recording of large snags is labour-intensive and expensive, if adequate sample sizes have to be ensured. We present a new method enabling efficient mapping and quantification of large snags by coupling colour infrared aerial photographs and a geographic information system (GIS). The method is validated by comparing the results with the data assessed by field methods in four spruce-dominated mountain forests in Switzerland. The different steps for implementing the method are: (1) stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photos for snag detection; (2) scanning and production of orthophotos; (3) geo-referencing and integration of the orthophotos and other data layers into a GIS; (4) digitisation of detected snags and drawing up of snag distribution maps. With the developed method, a map of the spatial distribution of spruce snags with a dbh greater than or equal to25 cm can be obtained in about 16 h for an area of 3 km(2) (i.e. 3 min/ha of map). Tree diameter, treetop condition (broken or intact) and the canopy closure of the forest stands significantly affected the success of snag detection. The method detected 82% (93%) of snags greater than or equal to25 cm (greater than or equal to35 cm) with an intact treetop, and 67% (71%) when broken snags greater than or equal to25 cm (greater than or equal to35 cm) were also included. Given our encouraging results, the method should be further tested on similar study sites in order to obtain more certainty regarding validity of the coefficient correcting underestimation. The method may become a promising tool, complementing standard field methods, with various prospective applications, such as wildlife studies, forest inventories, certification processes, etc. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper describes a methodology to estimate plant diversity involving landscape structure as a proportional weight associated with different plant communities found in the landscape mosaic. The area occupied by a plant community, its patch number or its spatial distribution of patches are variables that could be expressed in gamma plant diversity of a territory. The methodology applies (1) remote sensing information, to identify land cover and land use types; (2) aspect, to discriminate composition of plant communities in each land cover type; (3) multi-scale field techniques, to asses plant diversity; (4) affinity analysis of plant community composition, to validate the stratified random sampling design and (5) the additive model that partitions gamma diversity into its alpha and beta components. The method was applied to three Spanish rural areas and was able to record 150-260 species per ha. Species richness, Shannon information index and Simpson concentration index were used to measure diversity in each area. The estimation using Shannon diversity index and the product of patch number and patch interspersion as weighting of plant community diversity was found to be the most appropriate method of measuring plant diversity at the landscape level.

However, an understanding of landscapes in terms of sustainability is still poorly developed. The project Spatial Indices for Land Use Sustainability was conducted to elaborate spatially explicit indicators for mapping ecological sustainability. Ecological sustainability was defined in terms of naturalness and biodiversity. The concept of hemeroby, a measure for the naturalness or conversely the human influence on ecosystems, was used for the assessment of ecological sustainability. Because direct information on the hemerobiotic state of landscapes was missing, shortcuts were analysed. An interdisciplinary multi-scale approach was developed that combined remote sensing data and a landscape ecological field survey, using a landscape typology as spatial reference frame. Variables describing the configuration and shape of the land mosaic were derived form a land cover classification based on landform and landscape fragmentation data. Two different assessment approaches were compared, (a) an expert-knowledge based fuzzy-rule system, and (b) an assessment based on the deviation of a certain landscape type from the mean hemerobiotic state. The hemeroby model was formulated and applied using ordinal regression techniques. The project results support the `pattern and process paradigm'. Variables describing landscape patterns turned out to be crucial for the model and were a good predictor for land-use intensity estimated by the hemerobiotic state. Based on each of the two approaches a `sustainability map' of Austria's cultural landscapes was derived. Despite the methodological differences of the two approaches similarities in the results could be demonstrated. Landscape-structure indicators were shown to be good indicators of ecological sustainability because they are related to ecological characteristics of landscapes such as naturalness and biodiversity.

Many ecological applications require detailed data representing large spatial extents, but these data are often unavailable or are impractical to gather using field-based techniques. Remote sensing offers an option for collecting data that can represent broad spatial extents with detailed attribute characterizations. Remotely sensed data are also appropriate for use in studies across spatial scales, in conjunction with field collected data. This article presents the pertinent technical aspects of remote sensing for images at high spatial resolution (i.e., with a pixel size of 16 square meters or less), existing and future options for the processing and analysis of remotely sensed data, and attributes that can be estimated with these data for forest ecosystems.

J	Cohen, WB; Goward, SN				Cohen, WB; Goward, SN			Landsat's role in ecological applications of remote sensing	BIOSCIENCE												Remote sensing, geographic information systems, and modeling have combined to produce a virtual explosion of growth in ecological investigations and applications that are explicitly spatial and temporal. Of all remotely sensed data, those acquired by Landsat sensors have played the most pivotal role in spatial and temporal scaling. Modern terrestrial ecology relies on remote sensing for modeling biogeochemical cycles and for characterizing land cover, vegetation biophysical attributes, forest structure, and fragmentation in relation to biodiversity. Given the more than 30-year record of Landsat data, mapping land and vegetation cover change and using the derived surfaces in ecological models is becoming commonplace. In this article, we summarize this large body of work, highlighting the unique role of Landsat.

J	Kerr, JT; Cihlar, J				Kerr, JT; Cihlar, J			Patterns and causes of species endangerment in Canada	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Few studies have addressed patterns and causes of species endangerment at different resolutions and geographical extents. Using newly developed remote sensing and species distribution data sets, we examined the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors on the density of terrestrial endangered species in Canada at two spatial scales. The first was at a national extent and the second was within a region of Canada (the mixed wood plains) where there are particularly large numbers of endangered species. We also examined the distribution of protected areas throughout Canada to determine their capacity to shelter endangered species. Land use, which is measured by 1-km resolution satellite data, is a strong predictor of endangered species densities at both scales of analysis. Land use integrates information on habitat loss to agriculture and land use intensity, an index of agricultural pollution. The amount of protected area in a region is unrelated to endangered species numbers except to the extent that areas with the most endangered species are, at best, nearly devoid of protected area. Newly legislated protections for endangered species are unlikely to bring much improvement to this conservation dilemma. Canada's endangered species legislation promotes cooperative conservation activities in areas where species endangerment is most pronounced but does little to protect remaining habitat.																	1051-0761					JUN	2004	14	3					743	753		10.1890/02-5117								WOS:000222174000010

This information will provide a rigorous foundation to address a wide range of applications including disease mapping, emerging infectious diseases, landscape ecological assessment, land cover trends and change detection, watershed assessment, and map accuracy assessment. It will develop an advanced map analysis system that integrates these techniques with an advanced visualization toolbox, and use the system to conduct large case studies using rich sets of raster data, primarily from remotely sensed imagery. As a result, it will be possible to study and evaluate raster maps of societal, ecological, and environmental variables to facilitate quantitative characterization and comparative analysis of geospatial trends, patterns, and phenomena. In addition to environmental and ecological studies, these techniques and tools can be used for policy decisions at national, state, and local levels, crisis management, and protection of infrastructure. Geospatial data form the foundation of an information-based society. Remote sensing has been a vastly under-utilized resource involving a multi-million dollar investment at the national levels. Even when utilized, the credibility has been at stake, largely because of lack of tools that can assess, visualize, and communicate accuracy and reliability in timely manner and at desired confidence levels. Consider an imminent 21st century scenario: What message does a multi-categorical map have about the large landscape it represents? And at what scale, and at what level of detail? Does the spatial pattern of the map reveal any societal, ecological, environmental condition of the landscape? And therefore can it be an indicator of change? How do you automate the assessment of the spatial structure and behavior of change to discover critical areas, hot spots, and their corridors? Is the map accurate? How accurate is it? How do you assess the accuracy of the map? How do we evaluate a temporal change map for change detection? What are the implications of the kind and amount of change and accuracy on what matters, whether climate change, carbon emission, water resources, urban sprawl, biodiversity, indicator species, human health, or early warning? And with what confidence? The proposed research initiative is expected to find answers to these questions and a few more that involve multi-categorical raster maps based on remote sensing and other geospatial data. It includes the development of techniques for map modeling and analysis using Markov Random Fields, geospatial statistics, accuracy assessment and change detection, upper echelons of surfaces, advanced computational techniques for geospatial data mining, and advanced visualization techniques.																	1352-8505					JUN	2004	11	2					113	138		10.1023/B:EEST.0000027205.77490.8c								WOS:000221330500002

Location The map documents the location and distribution of major vegetation types and non-vegetated land surface formations for the entire African continent plus Madagascar and the other surrounding islands. Methods The bulk of these data were acquired on a daily basis throughout the year 2000 by the VEGETATION sensor on-board the SPOT-4 satellite. The map of vegetation cover has been produced based upon the spectral response and the temporal profile of the vegetation cover. Digital image processing and geographical information systems techniques were employed, together with local knowledge, high resolution imagery and expert consultation, to compile a cartographic map product. Radar data and thermal sensors were also used for specific land-cover classes. Results A total of 27 land cover categories are documented, which has more thematic classes than previously published land cover maps of Africa contain. Systematic comparison with existing land cover data and 30-m resolution imagery from Landsat are presented, and the map is also compared with other pan-continental land cover maps. The map and digital data base are freely available for non-commercial uses from http://www.gvm.jrc.it/tem/africa/products.htm Main conclusions The map improves our state of knowledge of the land-cover of Africa and presents the most spatially detailed view yet published at this scale. This first version of the map should provide an important input for regional stratification and planning purposes for natural resources, biodiversity and climate studies.

J	Mbow, C; Goita, K; Benie, GB				Mbow, C; Goita, K; Benie, GB			Spectral indices and fire behavior simulation for fire risk assessment in savanna ecosystems	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The lack of information on the vegetation status before the use of fire as a management tool in protected areas leads to drastic destruction of the natural vegetation and biodiversity. This paper describes the use of spectral indices and simulation of savanna burning to assess risk of intensive fire propagation in a National Park (Niokolo Koba, Senegal, 'West Africa). Spectral parameters corresponding to thematic information (wetness, brightness, and greenness) were retrieved using an orthogonal transformation, the Tasseled Cap approach on LANDSAT-ETM images. Wetness and brightness indices were normalized (sigma = 1 and mean = 0) and then combined in a simple semiempirical algorithm of fire risk levels discrimination. These two indices are proven to reflect qualitatively both fuel moisture and its distribution, which constitute the most foreseen determinants of fire propagation in savanna areas. The fire risk assessment algorithm (FIRA algorithm) was used to produce a fire risk map at the beginning of the management fire implement period. In parallel, a fire area simulator (FARSITE) developed by USDA was used with randomly spaced fire sources to determine areas which can be potentially burned in the study site. These simulated burned areas and the FIRA algorithm results were cross-compared to a real fire scars dated at the end of the same burning period and to land cover map. A great consistency was found between the different sources of information. More than 85% of fire prone areas identified by the FIRA algorithm or simulated by FARSITE were located in trees-shrub, woodland, and shrub savannas. These cover types included also 95% of real fire scars. Almost 88% and 84% of real fire scars were found in the risk zones determined by the FIRA algorithm and the simulated burned areas by FARSITE, respectively. The method used is simple and suited for an operational use for management fire implementation in savanna ecosystems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Fairbanks, DHK; McGwire, KC				Fairbanks, DHK; McGwire, KC			Patterns of floristic richness in vegetation communities of California: regional scale analysis with multi-temporal NDVI	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Applying water-energy dynamics and heterogeneity theory to explain species richness via remote sensing could allow for the regional characterization and monitoring of vegetation community assemblages and their environment. We assess the relationship of multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to plant species richness in vegetation communities. Location California, USA. Methods Sub-regions containing species inventories for chaparral, coastal sage scrub, foothill woodland, and yellow pine forest communities were intersected with a vegetation community map and an AVHRR NDVI time series for 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1996. Principal components analysis reduced the AVHRR data to three variables representing the sum and temporal trajectories of NDVI within each community. A fourth variable representing heterogeneity was tested using the standard deviation of the first component. Quadratic forms of these variables were also tested. Species richness was analysed by stepwise regression. Results Chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and yellow pine forest had the best relationships between species richness and NDVI. Richness of chaparral was related to NDVI heterogeneity and spring greenness (r(2) varied between 0.26 and 0.62 depending on year of NDVI data). Richness of coastal sage scrub was nonlinearly related to annual NDVI and heterogeneity (r(2) 0.63-0.81), with peak richness at intermediate values. Foothill woodland richness was related to heterogeneity in a monotonic curvilinear fashion (r(2) 0.28-0.35). Yellow pine forest richness was negatively related to spring greenness and positively related to heterogeneity (r(2) 0.40-0.46). Main conclusions While NDVI's relationship to species richness varied, the selection of NDVI variables was generally consistent across years and indicated that spatial variability in NDVI may reflect important patterns in water-energy use that affect plant species richness. The principal component axis that should correspond closely with annual mean NPP showed a less prominent role. We conclude that plant species richness for coarse vegetation associations can be characterized and monitored at a regional scale and over long periods of time using relatively coarse resolution NDVI data.																	0960-7447					MAY	2004	13	3					221	235		10.1111/j.1466-822X.2004.00092.x								WOS:000221422000004

However, compared to overstorey, information about understorey vegetation distribution is scant, available mainly over small areas or through imprecise large area maps from tedious and time-consuming field surveys. A practical approach to classifying understorey vegetation from remote sensing data is needed for more accurate habitat analyses and biodiversity estimates. As a case study, we mapped the spatial distribution of understorey bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve (southwestern China) using remote sensing data from a leaf-on or growing season. Training on a limited set of ground data and using widely available Landsat TM data as input, a nonlinear artificial neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 80% despite the presence of co-occurring mid-storey and understorey vegetation. These results suggest that the influences of understorey vegetation on remote sensing data are available to practical approaches to classifying understorey vegetation. The success here to map bamboo distribution has important implications for giant panda conservation and provides a good foundation for developing methods to map the spatial distributions of other understorey plant species.

Yet, corals also mass spawn in the tropics, where SSTs vary little throughout the year. Here we show that the rise toward and fall from solar insolation maxima, which is the electromagnetic energy incident on the surface of the earth, coincide with coral spawning events in tropical Palau. Two insolation maxima (a consequence of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes) in the tropics lead to multiple spawning events per year. SSTs are poor predictors of coral spawning in the tropics. Multiple spawning events increase the rate of genetic recombination, which in turn may facilitate the likelihood of speciation and explain, in part, the high coral diversity in the tropics. We also show that mass spawning coincides with near-maximum solar insolation (5.0-7.2 kWh/m(2)/day) events from 33degreesN to 30degreesS in the western Pacific Ocean, and should be considered as one of the primary variables driving coral reproductive cycles.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					133	140		10.1007/s00338-003-0362-x								WOS:000220937200013						
J	Amar, A; Arroyo, B; Redpath, S; Thirgood, S				Amar, A; Arroyo, B; Redpath, S; Thirgood, S			Habitat predicts losses of red grouse to individual hen harriers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Hen harriers Circus cyaneus prey on red grouse Lagopus l. scoticus and high breeding densities of harriers can limit the number of grouse available for shooting in the autumn. Ultimately, grouse hunting contributes to the maintenance of heather moorland, an ecologically important habitat for biodiversity in general and hen harriers in particular. Predation rates vary widely among harrier individuals. Understanding which factors influence this variation would be useful to target management to mitigate the effect of harriers on grouse, such as diversionary feeding. 2. We used a simple habitat-based approach to test whether we could identify harrier nests to which most grouse were delivered. Using remote sensing habitat data, we tested whether delivery rates of dead grouse to the nest by hen harriers were higher for those pairs nesting in sites with more heather Calluna vulgaris. A relationship between heather cover and grouse delivery rates might have been expected as grouse densities were correlated with heather cover. 3. After adjusting for annual variation in grouse abundance, the rate at which grouse were delivered to harrier nests was positively associated with the proportion of heather cover within 2 km of harrier nests. This was primarily due to the positive effect of heather cover on female delivery rates. 4. This result allowed us to use habitat data to predict the harrier nests to which most grouse chicks would be delivered. Comparison of predictions of the model with observations of food delivery to nests indicated that, in terms of grouse chick delivery, the model correctly predicted the top 50% of harrier nests in five of six years. 5. We undertook an experiment where carrion was provided to certain harriers at nest sites, in order to decrease their predation on grouse. Data from this experiment showed that when harriers were given diversionary food, the relationship between grouse predation rate and habitat was removed, with grouse predation reduced to negligible levels in most cases. This demonstrated the increased benefit of feeding birds with the highest proportion of heather cover within 2 km of their nest sites, rather than feeding birds at random within the conflict population. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of heather cover around hen harrier nests can be used to predict which pairs will predate most grouse within a population. This information should facilitate targeted management practices, which may accrue greater benefit for grouse stocks and potentially reduce the conflict between grouse shooting and conservation of biodiversity.

J	Zhao, B; Kreuter, U; Li, B; Ma, ZJ; Chen, JK; Nakagoshi, N				Zhao, B; Kreuter, U; Li, B; Ma, ZJ; Chen, JK; Nakagoshi, N			An ecosystem service value assessment of land-use change on Chongming Island, China	LAND USE POLICY												Chongming Island is the world's largest alluvial island. Its coastal wetland and tidal flats provide many important ecological services including buffers against tidal surges and staging areas for migratory birds. Due to its extraordinary resources, scenic qualities, and its proximity to the city of Shanghai 45 km away, the island is also an attractive tourist destination, and it supports important agricultural and fisheries economies. Yet, large-scale land reclamation projects that are severely affecting these ecosystems have been implemented. In this paper, we report an investigation of changes in land use and ecosystem services on Dongtan (East Beach of Chongming Island) between 1990 and 2000. We used three LANDSAT TM and/or ETM data sets to estimate changes in the size of five land-cover/land-use categories, and we also used previously published value coefficients to estimate changes in the value of ecosystem services delivered by each land category. Finally, we ranked the contribution of various ecosystem functions to the overall value of the ecosystem services. We determined that the total value of ecosystem services in Dongtan declined by 62% from $ 316.77 to 120.40 million per year between 1990 and 2000 (totaling $855.26-981.85 million over 10-years). This massive decrease is largely attributable to the 71% loss of wetlands/tidal flats. Our sensitivity analysis suggested that these estimates were relatively robust. We also found that the contribution of water regulation, water supply, waste treatment, and raw materials increased, while the contribution of nutrient cycling, food production, disturbance regulation, recreation, habitat/refugia, and biological control decreased during the 10-year time period. We conclude that future land-use policy formulation should give precedence to the conservation of these ecosystems over uncontrolled reclamation, and that further land reclamation should be based on rigorous environmental impact analyses.

The research method was based on (i) recording land cover characteristics by means of a vegetation indicator, and (ii) classifying and mapping coastal wetlands utilizing a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of Cukurova Deltas in Turkey. Vegetation characteristics of various habitats, such as sand dunes, salt marshes, salty plains and afforestation areas, were identified by field surveys. A Landsat TM image of 4 July 1993 was preprocessed and then classified using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As a result of this supervised classification, the land cover types were classified with a largest accuracy of 90.2% by ANN. The classified satellite sensor imagery was linked to vegetation and bird census data, which were available through literature in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to determine the spatial distribution of plant and bird biodiversity in this coastal wetland. The resulting data provide an important baseline for further investigations such as monitoring, change detections and designing conservation policies in this coastal ecosystem.																	0960-3115					MAR	2004	13	3					615	633		10.1023/B:BIOC.0000009493.34669.ec								WOS:000187427000009						
J	Wallace, JF; Caccetta, PA; Kiiveri, HT				Wallace, JF; Caccetta, PA; Kiiveri, HT			Recent developments in analysis of spatial and temporal data for landscape qualities and monitoring	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Monitoring biodiversity presents the challenge of informing complex aspects of biological systems with consistent, repeatable, data-based indicators. The present paper does not address directly the selection of indicators for rangeland biodiversity, but rather presents essential aspects and examples of monitoring systems that address natural resource questions at comparable scales. In general, concepts of landscape quality, such as range condition, conservation value, health and biodiversity, are descriptive rather than quantitative and are either ill-defined or multiply defined. Assessment of the status of such indicators involves value systems, as well as process understanding at a range of scales for which data are often unavailable. Effective monitoring systems, in contrast, require repeated quantitative data at suitable temporal density and spatial scale, as well as appropriate methods and a conceptual framework to simplify and interpret these data. In recent years, broad-scale operational monitoring systems for land and vegetation have been developed in Australia based on sequences of satellite data, digital elevation models, ground information and appropriate statistical methods. These same datasets have been used to inform landscape qualities over broad areas; examples are given of the production of salinity risk maps and conservation management zones based on fragmentation patterns. These results have been achieved as a partnership between ecologists, resource scientists and statisticians and illustrate how surrogates for integrated concepts such as biodiversity can be derived from available data.

J	Ludwig, JA; Tongway, DJ; Bastin, GN; James, CD				Ludwig, JA; Tongway, DJ; Bastin, GN; James, CD			Monitoring ecological indicators of rangeland functional integrity and their relation to biodiversity at local to regional scales	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Functional integrity is the intactness of soil and native vegetation patterns and the processes that maintain these patterns. In Australia's rangelands, the integrity of these patterns and processes have been modified by clearing, grazing and fire. Intuitively, biodiversity should be strongly related to functional integrity; that is, landscapes with high functional integrity should maintain biodiversity, and altered, less functional landscapes may lose some biodiversity, defined here as the variety and abundance of the plants, animals and microorganisms of concern. Simple indicators of biodiversity and functional integrity are needed that can be monitored at a range of scales, from fine to coarse. In the present paper, we use examples, primarily from published work on Australia's rangeland, to document that at finer patch and hillslope scales several indicators of landscape functional integrity have been identified. These indicators, based on the quantity and quality of vegetation patches and interpatch zones, are related to biodiversity. For example, a decrease in the cover and width (quantity) and condition (quality) of vegetation patches, and an increase in bare soil (quantity of interpatch) near cattle watering points in a paddock are significantly related to declines in plant and grasshopper diversity. These vegetation patch-cover and bare-soil indicators have been monitored traditionally by field-based methods, but new high-resolution, remote-sensing imagery can be used in specific rangeland areas for this fine-scale monitoring. At intermediate paddock and small watershed scales, indicators that can be derived from medium-resolution remote-sensing are also needed for efficient monitoring of rangeland condition (i.e. functional integrity) and biodiversity. For example, 30-100-m-pixel Landsat imagery has been used to assess the condition of rangelands along grazing gradients extending from watering-points. The variety and abundance of key taxa have been related to these gradients (the Biograze project). At still larger region and catchment scales, indicators of rangeland functional integrity can also be monitored by coarse-resolution remote-sensing and related to biodiversity. For example, the extent and greenness (condition) of different regional landscapes have been monitored with 1-km-pixel satellite imagery. This regional information becomes more valuable when it indicates differences as a result of land management. Finally, we discuss potential future developments that could improve proposed indicators of landscape functional integrity and biodiversity, thereby improving our ability to monitor rangelands effectively.

A landscape-scale natural experiment was established to investigate the effects of these different fire histories ( derived from a 10-year Landsat remote-sensing sequence) on the floristic structure and composition of woody vegetation within and among three of the major vegetation types on three landscape types (sandplain, sandstone and volcanics) near Kalumburu in the North Kimberley bioregion. Substrate factors determine vegetation and associated fire patterns within the landscape such that each landscape type needs to be examined independently. Basalt soils are dominated by an open savanna and tend to have very high fire frequencies. Basalt vegetation showed few significant response variables to fire-history parameters. The total density of woody stems showed no significant relationship to fire-history variables, regardless of size class. The 0-2.0-m size class of Erythrophleum chlorostachys (F.Muell.) Baillon showed significant (P < 0.005) responses to the various interactions involving all three fire-history variables, indicating that seedling density is sensitive to fire. Sandplain is dominated by open woodland, with relatively low fire frequency. Total stem density, shrub density and the densities of Grevillea agrifolia Cunn. Ex R. Br., Canthium sp. A and Stenocarpus cunninghamii R. Br. showed strong positive ( P < 0.005) relationships with the total number of fire-free months. In sandstone, the density of all woody stems, acacias and a range of mid-storey trees showed significant positive relationships with the total number of fire-free months. Other species showed strong relationships with the number of late dry season fires. Vegetation thickening was evident in sand environments through the accumulation of woody stems in fire-free years and in sandstone through the promotion of 'fireweeds' such as Acacia gonocarpa F. Muell. after fire events. Mid-storey tree species capable of resprouting after fire showed some evidence of structural suppression in response to frequent fire events, including Planchonia careya (F. Muell.) Knuth, Persoonia falcata R. Br. and Buchanania obovata Engl. Results are discussed in the context of indigenous landscape burning and biodiversity conservation.

The response of species to patchiness may depend on the resolution and on the extent by which the spatial pattern is perceived. The goal of this paper is to identify the scale at which forest spatial pattern causes changes in species richness and abundances of Dipteran and Homopteran species as a whole, and further on their distinctive ecological functional groups. Using remotely-sensed optical imagery, we described the landscape structure surrounding sampling sites. We used two approaches to deal with the problem of the scale of observation: 1) variation of extent using a multiscale analysis, and 2) comparison of two satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions (SPOT: 20 x 20 m, and Landsat TM: 30 x 30 m). The relationship between entomological data and landscape descriptors at different spatial scales was tested with the Mantel test, redundancy analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression. Relative abundances of Homopteran species were affected by landscape patterns at finer scales than in Diptera. The strength of response to landscape was different for each Dipteran functional group. The multiscale analysis also enabled the optimal scale (6.25 ha) of landscape pattern, accounting for 62% of the variation in Homopteran richness, to be identified. As a practical application, Homopteran richness was mapped by extrapolation of the regression function to the pixels of the image. Multiscale analysis provides an alternative view of fragmentation effects, which are traditionally studied through the patch-based approach, and highlights the importance of scale in ecological processes. The detection of optimal scales and the use of satellite images enable maps of important biotic indicators to be drawn up.

In the French Antilles, about 80% of the coral communities are more or less damaged. A study has been undertaken in order to describe and understand the dynamics of this recent evolution. The aim of this study was also to detect the ecological descriptors able to characterize the state of health of coral communities by remote sensing. The species richness of coral communities, the most simple indicator of the biodiversity of the studied area, as well as diversity indices, revealed to be descriptors particularly stable and very little reactive to the degradation of the reef community. The coverage rate of the bottom by corals may be very different from one reef to another one or from one area to another one on the same reef. This does not necessarily imply the existence of a difference in the state of health between the communities. The most relevant criteria revealed to be associated with the state of health of coral colonies and the abundance of juvenile recruits. For the other components of the reef benthic community, the most pertinent descriptor was the ratio of the bottom covered with algal turf (healthy reefs) to that occupied by macro-algae (damaged reefs). These ecological descriptors revealed to be easy to estimate in a reproducible manner by observers who are not specialists of reef ecology. This extends the possibilities of monitoring the health of coral reefs through the assistance of non-scientific personnel (staff of the marine reserves, volunteers, etc.).																	0249-7395						2004	59	1-2					113	121										WOS:000220011300013

Remote sensing and field transects reveal changes in forest carbon stocks and accumulation rates. Deforestation was most rapid along the Interoceanic Highway during 1986-91 when credit and guaranteed markets were available, resulting in emissions of 708,000 Mg Cyr(-1), of which 14% was offset by secondary regrowth. Despite continued population growth, deforestation slowed during 1991-97 when fiscal austerity measures were imposed, resulting in emissions of 389,000 Mg Cyr(-1), of which 41% was offset by regrowth. Strategies to conserve frontier forests are compared in terms of carbon, biodiversity and economic costs and benefits. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The evergreen forests of Tamil Nadu are distributed in four distinct hill ranges, Nilgiri, Anamalai, Palni and Tirunelveli, having different topographic, bioclimatic and disturbance levels. The evergreen forests in these four hill ranges are characterized for their uniqueness in terms of patch characteristics and phytosociology. A vegetation type map was prepared using IRS LISS III satellite data and was used to study the patch characteristics in terms of patch size, number, shape, porosity and landcover diversity (LD). The phytosociological characteristics, namely species richness, diversity, similarity and community assemblages, were studied using ground data collected from 95 sample points of 0.1 ha size. Patch size and number revealed distinct intactness and disturbance levels in these four hill ranges. Evergreen forests in the Tirunelveli hills comprising 216.09 km(2) are distributed in 306 patches, and in the Palni hills, with 285 km(2), forests are distributed in 1029 patches, indicating a high level of fragmentation. LD, indicating the spatial heterogeneity of landcover, was very high in the Nilgiri hills and low in the Tirunelveli hills. The spatial analysis helped to delineate homogenous large patches of evergreen forest, which can be adopted for appropriate conservation strategies. A total of 342 tree species belonging to 4490 stems were evaluated for phytosociology. Only 15-28% of similarity in terms of species distribution was found across the hill ranges. Conjunctive analysis of patch characteristics and species distribution showed high species richness in less fragmented evergreen forests and vice versa. The study identified the areas of prioritization in terms of ecorestoration and conservation based on patch and phytosociological characteristics.																	0960-3115					DEC	2003	12	12					2331	2359		10.1023/A:1025858713716								WOS:000185493400001

Currently, these forests are facing strong exploitation pressure in the form of extensive clearcuts. Demand for conservation is also high. We characterize the boreal forest landscape in the region and assess the impacts of past and potential management actions through a mapping and modeling study that synthesizes methods from landscape ecology, remote sensing, and simulation modeling. The forests of the study area were mapped using techniques for interpreting multitemporal satellite images and detecting changes. The species composition and structure of the forests were estimated using the multisource k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) method. Forest harvesting rates and current landscape patterns were used to parameterize models built with a cell-based Spatially Explicit Landscape Event Simulator (SELES) modeling tool, and alternative land-use policy strategies were simulated with and without natural fire. Based on 10 Monte Carlo runs for each scenario, we can predict dramatic changes in the forest landscape structure after 30-70 yr. The current, complexly structured, near-natural forest assemblage will rapidly be converted into its transpose: an expanse of young regeneration stands, with blocks of near-natural forest extant only as islands within mires and in the reserve areas. The prompt establishment of the proposed Kalevala National Park is regionally important for these reasons: (1) to increase the types of near-natural forest conserved, (2) to provide a second large biodiversity source adjacent to the heavily fragmented Finnish forests, and (3) to reduce the currently inflated rate of harvesting.																	1195-5449					DEC	2003	7	2							8									WOS:000189307800004						
J	Zacharias, I; Dimitriou, E; Koussouris, T				Zacharias, I; Dimitriou, E; Koussouris, T			Developing sustainable water management scenarios by using thorough hydrologic analysis and environmental criteria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wetlands constitute a significant source of life since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species. They also contribute to the preservation of high global biodiversity and they are under protection according to EU legislation. Nevertheless, during the last century, significant degradation has been observed in wetlands, mainly due to intensification of agriculture and poor water management practices. Calcareous fens habitat with the endangered species Cladium mariscus and Carex spp. is an ecologically significant wetland that undergoes great ecological stresses globally, due to the irrational use of water resources. In Trichonis lake, Western Greece, this habitat has been under deterioration during the last 50 years due to the lack of a sustainable water management plan that has caused destabilization of the hydrologic balance and high water level fluctuations. This human induced hydrologic regime has led to seasonal shifting between drought and flooding which constitute unfavorable conditions for this fen habitat and as a result significant elimination of this ecosystem extent has occurred. This study has adopted technologically advanced scientific methods such as GIS applications and remote sensing techniques to quantify the existing water resources and formulate a sustainable management scheme by considering both anthropogenic water uses and environmental protection.

We present the results of a study of the fragmentation of Andean forests and other ecosystems and an assessment of the representativeness at the ecosystem level of protected natural areas in the eastern Andes of Colombia. We used satellite remote sensing data to characterize ecosystems and undertook ground truthing at six sites. The I I identified ecosystem types were analyzed within existing protected areas to assess the representativeness of these sites within the region. Five ecosystems were well-represented and six of them had <10% of their area protected. Highland ecosystems were the best represented in protected areas due to the preponderance of highland parks in the eastern Andes. However Andean and sub Andean forests have less than 4.5 and 6.4% of their original pre-Columbian extent currently protected. Fragmentation parameters such as patch size, patch shape, number of patches, mean nearest neighbor distance and landscape shape index were also analyzed. Andean, sub Andean and dry forests are highly fragmented ecosystems but there is a clear latitudinal gradient of fragmentation. Our findings suggested that conservation efforts should be directed first toward the conservation of dry and oak forests in the center of the eastern Andes, and then Andean and sub Andean montane forests toward the south near the border with Ecuador.

Due in large part to their inaccessibility, relatively little is known about the landscapes of this biodiverse region, which also supports some of the highest population densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-based IRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyze north-south and east-west trends across the entire Western Ghats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km(2). Northern and eastern landscapes are more fragmented compared to the southern and western slopes. Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity with land cover types more interspersed compared to the eastern slopes. These differences can be related to north-south and east-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes 10-50 km(2) in area, are further utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, and describe the geographical distribution of major natural and managed ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels of intra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern are encountered for all land cover types. Results at these two scales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratified approach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.

J	Wallace, OC; Qi, JG; Heilma, P; Marsett, RC				Wallace, OC; Qi, JG; Heilma, P; Marsett, RC			Remote sensing for cover change assessment in southeast Arizona	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												Understanding landscape conversion is vital for assessing the impacts of ecological and anthropogenic disturbances at regional and global scales. Since rangelands cover nearly half of the global land surface, and because a large part of rangelands is located in semi-arid ecosystems, they serve as critical land cover types for determining regional biodiversity, global biogeochemical cycles, and energy and gas fluxes. For such vast ecosystems, satellite imagery is often used to inventory biophysical materials and man-made features on Earth's surface. The large area coverage and frequent acquisition cycle of remotely sensed satellite images make earth observation data useful for monitoring land conversion rates at different spatial scales. Remote sensing could also be used for temporal assessment of semi-arid ecosystems by providing complimentary sets of rangeland health indicators. In this paper, temporal satellite data from multiple sensors were examined to quantify land use and land cover change, and to relate spatial configuration and composition to landscape structure and pattern. The findings were correlated with the role of fire to better understand ecological functionality and human and/or natural activities that are generating environmental stressors in a rapidly developing, semi-urban census division located in southeastern Arizona. Results indicate that conversion of a fire-suppressed native grassland area has 2 spatial components; in the rural areas, grass is being eliminated by increasingly homogeneous shrub and mesquite-dominated areas, whereas in the urban and suburban areas, grass as well shrubs and mesquite are being eliminated by a fragmented and expanding built landscape.																	0022-409X					SEP	2003	56	5					402	409		10.2307/4003829								WOS:000185463200001						
J	Milesi, C; Elvidge, CD; Nemani, RR; Running, SW				Milesi, C; Elvidge, CD; Nemani, RR; Running, SW			Assessing the impact of urban land development on net primary productivity in the southeastern United States	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The southeastern United States (SE-US) has undergone one of the highest rates of landscape changes in the country due to changing demographics and land use practices over the last few decades. Increasing evidence indicates that these changes have impacted mesoscale weather patterns, biodiversity and water resources. Since the Southeast has one of the highest rates of land productivity in the nation, it is important to monitor the effects of such changes regularly. Here, we propose a remote sensing based methodology to estimate regional impacts of urban land development on ecosystem structure and function. As an indicator of ecosystem functioning, we chose net primary productivity (NPP), which is now routinely estimated from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We used the MODIS data, a 1992 Landsat-based land cover map and nighttime data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) for the years 1992/1993 and 2000 to estimate the extent of urban development and its impact on NPP. The analysis based on the nighttime data indicated that in 1992/1993, urban areas amounted to 4.5% of the total land surface of the region. In the year 2000, the nighttime data showed an increase in urban development for the southeastern United States of 1.9%. Estimates derived from the MODIS data indicated that land cover changes due to urban development that took place during the 1992-2000 period reduced annual NPP of the southeastern United States by 0.4%. Despite the uncertainties in sensor fusion and the coarse resolution of the data used in this study, results show that the combination of MODIS products such as NPP with nighttime data could provide rapid assessment of urban land cover changes and their impacts on regional ecosystem resources.

J	Ekebom, J; Erkkila, A				Ekebom, J; Erkkila, A			Using aerial photography for identification of marine and coastal habitats under the EU's Habitats Directive	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Implementation of the E.U. Habitats Directive requires information on the distribution, abundance and area covered by the habitats listed in Annex I of the Directive. 2. In Finland, 21 of these habitats occur in marine and coastal areas. The demand for spatial information of these habitats is increasing, so rapid and relatively inexpensive mapping methods are needed. 3. This study examines the identification of 15 habitats using high altitude black and white aerial photographs. Our goal was to find out how well these habitats could be identified using these types of photographs. We used a test group of 34 persons who were given only brief instructions on how to identify the habitats prior to the test. Their results were compared to a set of field data from an archipelago area at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland, in August 1999 and autumn 2000. 4. The test group identified sandy beaches, lagoons, submerged sandbanks and cliffs with an accuracy of 82%, 71%, 66% and 65%, respectively. The main reasons for these high accuracy percentages were apparently the high contrast and/or easy delineation of the habitat from the surrounding areas. 5. Reefs, wooded dunes and submerged reefs were identified with an accuracy of 39%, 44% and 45%, respectively. The remaining habitats were less precisely identified, apparently due to their small size or poor contrast to the surrounding areas. 6. High altitude aerial photographs are shown to be a useful tool for identifying several of these habitats and can be used as a complement to field mapping methods, GIS methods and other remote sensing techniques. The use of high altitude photographs for monitoring change is discussed.

J	Rouget, M				Rouget, M			Measuring conservation value at fine and broad scales: implications for a diverse and fragmented region, the Agulhas Plain	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												This study explores the implications of spatial scale for conservation planning in the Agulhas Plain, South Africa. Regional planning relies on broad-scale data but fine-scale data are usually required for implementation at local level. This study addresses the implications of broad-scale planning for fine-scale implementation. Two original systems of notional reserves were developed for this region using C-plan, a decision support system for systematic conservation planning. The first conservation plan was derived using broad scale data (1:250,000) and consisted of nine broad habitat units (land classes based on topography, geology, and climate), remote sensing mapping of habitat transformation and large-planning units defined by 1/16th degree squares (average size 3900 ha). The second system was identified at a finer scale (1:10,000) using 36 vegetation types (mapped in the field), ground survey mapping of habitat transformation and cadastral boundaries as planning units (average size 252 ha). Using classification trees, this study compared reserve-design efficiency (the area required to achieve conservation targets), the spatial patterns,of conservation value (the irreplaceability value of planning units), biodiversity features, and habitat transformation at both scales. A similar amount of land was required to meet all conservation targets (identified using minimum set analysis) at the broad and fine scale. There was considerable overlap between the two conservation plans as most of fine-scale conservation targets could be achieved under the broad-scale conservation plan. However, irreplaceability values, which measure the likelihood of selecting planning units for achieving representation targets, were much higher at the fine scale. The use of broad-scale biodiversity features underestimated irreplaceability value at a fine scale in heterogeneous and fragmented portions of the landscape. The implications of moving from broad- to fine-scale conservation planning, as well as their respective benefits are discussed. Maximising biodiversity conservation while minimising cost and resources might be achieved by a combination of broad-scale assessments for relatively homogeneous and untransformed areas and fine-scale ones for heterogeneous and fragmented areas.

J	Foody, GM; Cutler, MEJ				Foody, GM; Cutler, MEJ			Tree biodiversity in protected and logged Bornean tropical rain forests and its measurement by satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Conservation activities have increasingly focused on issues at the level of the landscape but are constrained by limited data and knowledge relating to biodiversity at this scale. Satellite remote sensing has considerable, but under-exploited, potential as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape level. Remote sensing has generally been used to assess biodiversity indirectly, using approaches that often fail to fully exploit the information content of the imagery and typically only with regard to the species richness component of biodiversity. The aim of this paper was to assess the potential of remote sensing as a source of information on the richness, evenness and composition of tree species in a tropical rain forest. Location The test site was a c. 225 km(2) region centred on the Danum Valley Field Centre, Borneo. This test site contained regions of undisturbed and differentially logged rain forest. Methods Data on tree biodiversity had been acquired for fifty-two sample plots by standard field survey methods and were used to derive summary indices of biodiversity for seedlings, saplings and mature trees. Differences between logged and unlogged sites were evaluated by comparison of the indices and species accumulation curves. A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the site acquired close to the date of the field survey was obtained and rigorously pre-processed. Feedforward neural networks were used to derive predictions of biodiversity indices from the imagery. A Kohonen self organizing map neural network was used to ordinate the field data to derive classes of forest defined by relative similarity in species composition. The separability of the defined classes in the Landsat TM image was evaluated with a discriminant analysis. Results Analyses of the field data revealed considerable variation in the biodiversity of seedlings, saplings and trees at the site, associated, in part, with differences in logging activities. This variation in biodiversity was manifest in the remotely sensed data. The analyses indicated an ability to (1) predict biodiversity indices, with the highest correlation between predicted and actual index observed for evenness described by Shannon entropy (r = 0.546), but especially to (2) classify nine forest classes defined on the basis of similarity in tree species composition (accuracy 95.8%). Main conclusions Logging activities impacted on biodiversity and the resulting variation in biodiversity was reflected in the remotely sensed imagery. Using methods that exploit more fully the information content of the imagery than those used in other previous studies, a richer representation of biodiversity may be derived. This representation includes estimates of key summary indices of biodiversity, notably richness and evenness, as well as information on species composition. The results indicate that remotely sensed data may be used as a source of information on biodiversity at the landscape scale that may be used to inform conservation science and management.

J	Foody, GM; Boyd, DS; Cutler, MEJ				Foody, GM; Boyd, DS; Cutler, MEJ			Predictive relations of tropical forest biomass from Landsat TM data and their transferability between regions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The full realization of the potential of remote sensing as a source of environmental information requires an ability to generalize in space and time. Here, the ability to generalize in space was investigated through an analysis of the transferability of predictive relations for the estimation of tropical forest biomass from Landsat TM data between sites in Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand. The data sets for each test site were acquired and processed in a similar fashion to facilitate the analyses. Three types of predictive relation, based on vegetation indices, multiple regression and feedforward neural networks, were developed for biomass estimation at each site. For each site, the strongest relationships between the biomass predicted and that measured from field survey was obtained with a neural network developed specifically for the site (r>0.71, significant at the 99% level of confidence). However, with each type of approach problems in transferring a relation to another site were observed. In particular, it was apparent that the accuracy of prediction, as indicated by the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured biomass, declined when a relation was transferred to a site other than that upon which it was developed. Part of this problem lies with the observed variation in the relative contribution of the different spectral wavebands to predictive relations for biomass estimation between sites. It was, for example, apparent that the spectral composition of the vegetation indices most strongly related to biomass differed greatly between the sites. Consequently, the relationship between predicted and measured biomass derived from vegetation indices differed markedly in both strength and direction between sites. Although the incorporation of test site location information into an analysis resulted in an increase in the strength of the relationship between predicted and actual biomass, considerable further research is required on the problems associated with transferring predictive relations.

Research in temperate environments, however, has tended to keep pace with new remote sensing technologies more so than in tropical environments. Here, we identify what we consider to be three priority areas for remote sensing research in Neotropical dry forests. The first priority is the use of improved sensor capabilities, which should allow for better characterization of tropical secondary forests than has been achieved. Secondary forests are of key interest due to their potential for sequestering carbon in relatively short periods of time. The second priority is the need to characterize leaf area index (LAI) and other biophysical variables by means of bidirectional reflectance function models. These biophysical parameters have importance linkages with net primary productivity and may be estimated through remote sensing. The third priority is to identify tree species using hyper-spectral imagery, which represents an entirely new area of research for tropical forests that could have powerful applications in biodiversity conservation.

Such changes may have important consequences for ecosystem functioning. The objective of this paper is to quantify the trajectories and rates of change in land cover and use across the GYE for the period 1975-1995 using satellite imagery. Spectral and geographic variables were used as inputs to classification tree regression analysis (CART) to find "rules" which defined land use and land cover classes on the landscape. The resulting CART functions were used to map land cover and land use across seven Landsat TM scenes for 1995. We then used a thresholding technique to identify locations that differed in spectral properties between the 1995 and 1985 time periods. These "changed" locations were classified using CART functions derived from spectral and geographic data from 1985. This was similarly done for the year 1975 based on Landsat MSS data. Differences between the 1975, 1985, and 1995 maps. were considered change in land cover and use. We calibrated and tested the accuracy of our models using data acquired through manual interpretation of aerial photos. Elevation and vegetative indices derived from the remotely sensed satellite imagery explained the most variance in the land use and land cover classes (i.e., defined the "rules" most often). Overall accuracies from our study were good, ranging from 94% at the coarsest level of detail to 74% at the finest. The largest changes over the study period were the increases in burned, urban, and mixed conifer-herbaceous classes and decreases in woody deciduous, mixed woody deciduous-herbaceous, and conifer habitats. These changes have important implications for ecological function and biodiversity. The expansion of mixed conifer classes may increase fuel loads and enhance risk to the growing number of rural homes. The reduction of woody deciduous cover types is likely reducing population sizes for the numerous plant and animal species that specialize on this habitat type. Some of these species are also negatively influenced by the increase of rural homes in and near woody deciduous habitats.

J	Kerr, JT; Ostrovsky, M				Kerr, JT; Ostrovsky, M			From space to species: ecological applications for remote sensing	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												A variety of ecological applications require data from broad spatial extents that cannot be collected using field-based methods. Remote sensing data and techniques address these needs, which include identifying and detailing the biophysical characteristics of species' habitats, predicting the distribution of species and spatial variability in species richness, and detecting natural and human-caused change at scales ranging from individual landscapes to the entire world. Such measurements are subject to substantial errors that can be difficult to overcome, but corrected data are readily available and can be of sufficiently high resolution to be integrated into traditional field-based studies. Ecologists and conservation biologists are finding new ways to approach their research with the powerful suite of tools and data from remote sensing.																	0169-5347					JUN	2003	18	6					299	305		10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00071-5								WOS:000183516000012

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.

The indirect driving forces of biodiversity impoverishment listed in the Global Biodiversity Strategy that are particularly effective in and and semi-arid regions are (a) population growth, (b) economic systems and policies that fail to value the environment and its natural resources; (c) inequity in the ownership, management and flow of benefits from both the use and conservation of biological resources;, and (d) weakness in legal and institutional systems. The most effective direct human impacts are (a) habitat destruction and fragmentation, (b) overexploitation of biological resources, (c) biological invasion, and (d) agriculture. The problem in and and semiarid regions, particularly in developing countries, is exacerbated by the lack of knowledge and awareness, the paucity of research, and the diminishing number of competent systematists. This paper discusses the theoretical and practical aspects of each of the indirect driving forces, and the direct human impacts on biodiversity, and reviews case studies related to these impacts, with special reference to those carried out in and and semiarid regions. These studies include monitoring of the human impact on land cover by remote sensing, effects of landuse on species diversity, impact of habitat fragmentation by summer resorts on coastal dunes, consequences of protection from grazing on biodiversity, comparison of biodiversity in nature reserves and the traditional hema system with that of nearby territories, and the impact of desertification on animal life and endangered species. Case studies also include the tools applied for biodiversity conservation in and and semiarid lands with special emphasis on endangered species, restoration of degraded habitats and their biodiversity, the significance of nature reserves and captive breeding, the importance of conserving the populations below the species level throughout their geographical range of distribution, and ecotonal biodiversity.

This communication presents an approach for rapid assessment of biodiversity at landscape level using satellite remote sensing, phytosociological data and knowledge base in geospatial model. The geospatial analyses at the landscape level reveal that most of the fertile valleys of the region are occupied by the human activities and possess very low bio-richness.

This study attempts to answer such questions as: how crowded are the coastal zones, what is the pattern of land cover distribution in these areas, how much of these areas are designated as protected areas, what is the state of the biodiversity hotspots, and what are the interconnections between people and coastal environment. This study uses globally consistent and comprehensive geospatial datasets based on remote sensing and other sources. The application of Geographic Information System (GIS) layering methods and consistent datasets has made it possible to identify and quantify selected coastal zones environmental issues and their interconnections.

This work has focused on two spatial scales of imagery resolution: coarse-resolution NOAA-AVHRR imagery for savanna-wide assessments both of the daily distribution of fires ('hot spots'), and cumulative mapping of burnt areas('fire-scars') over the annual cycle; and fine-resolution Landsat imagery for undertaking detailed assessments of regional fire regimes. Importantly, substantial effort has been given to the validation of fire mapping products at both scales of resolution. At the savanna-wide scale, fire mapping activities have established that: ( 1) contrary to recent perception, from a national perspective the great majority of burning in any one year typically occurs in the tropical savannas; ( 2) the distribution of burning across the savannas is very uneven, occurring mostly in sparsely settled, higher rainfall, northern coastal and subcoastal regions (north-west Kimberley, Top End of the Northern Territory, around the Gulf of Carpentaria) across a variety of major land uses ( pastoral, conservation, indigenous); whereas ( 3) limited burning is undertaken in regions with productive soils supporting more intensive pastoral management, particularly in Queensland; and ( 4) on a seasonal basis, most burning occurs in the latter half of the dry season, typically as uncontrolled wildfire. Decadal fine-resolution fire histories have also been assembled from multi-scene Landsat imagery for a number of fire-prone large properties (e.g. Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Parks) and local regions ( e. g. Sturt Plateau and Victoria River District, Northern Territory). These studies have facilitated more refined description of various fire regime parameters ( fire extent, seasonality, frequency, interval, patchiness) and, as dealt with elsewhere in this special issue, associated ecological assessments. This paper focuses firstly on the patterning of contemporary fire regimes across the savanna landscapes of northern Australia, and then addresses the implications of these data for our understanding of changes in fire regime since Aboriginal occupancy, and implications of contemporary patterns on biodiversity and emerging greenhouse issues.

The analysis reveals the main deficits and development needs, and outlines some possible courses for future action. Specific reference is given to the boreal, Atlantic and continental regions of Europe. Especially the operational definition of biodiversity, the selection of the scale and consideration of the most appropriate indicators and data collection methods are of primary importance when defining a monitoring approach. The results of a recent assessment at national scale contribute to an improved understanding, but show some shortcomings with respect to the level of detail. The high variability of the distribution, structure and composition of forests in Europe can be comprised only partially when the monitoring follows national borders. To detect changes in time for corrective measures and to be able to apply appropriate threshold values for biodiversity indicators a more detailed approach, which takes into account different bio-geographical regions and forest ecosystem types, is needed. Technically, this could be based on aggregation national forest inventories or European-wide sampling scheme combined with remote sensing data and distinct forest types or categories.

J	Roy, PS				Roy, PS			Biodiversity conservation - Perspective from space	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												The conservation and utilization of biological diversity requires comprehensive knowledge of the biodiversity with respect to their quality and distribution so as to strike a balance between usage and renewal patterns. Increased anthropogenic interventions into. the natural landscape have carved out separate niche in the biosphere by modifying the ecosystems drastically. In the process we have been loosing biodivenity at faster rate than expected. Hence, sustainable management of our biological resources has become key issue for survival of planet earth. Space has provided holistic view to the planet earth. The satellite remote sensing has enabled to map and monitor vegetation resources in varying scale and time. The geographic information system enables to organize the data sets for analysis and decision making process. India has Made significant efforts to build state of art satellite systems and develop applications to manage the natural resources.' Forest vegetation mapping and biodiversity characterisation at landscape level using satellite remote sensing technology is already an operational tool. Under a national scientific initiative India has developed comprehensive data base on vegetation types, fragmentation, disturbance regimes and biological richness at landscape level in the important ecoregions of the country. This has been achieved by integrating the geospatial information on biological, physical, environmental, social and knowledge base. Remote sensing from space has facilitated systematic and hierarchical approach of biodiversity assessment and its monitoring. Hence biodiversity conservation strategy must include the information for defining the action.																	0250-541X						2003	26	7-8					169	184										WOS:000186875500002

Its survival and continuing vigour after 70 years is a testament to its utility, which has been achieved in spite of great changes in our understanding of the marine environment and in our concerns over how to manage it. The CPR has been superseded in several respects by other technologies, such as acoustics and remote sensing, but it continues to provide unrivalled seasonal and geographic information about a wide range of zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa. The value of this coverage increases with time and provides the basis for placing recent observations into the context of long-term, large-scale variability and thus suggesting what the causes are likely to be. Information from the CPR is used extensively in judging environmental impacts and producing quality status reports (QSR); it has shown the distributions of fish stocks, which had not previously been exploited; it has pointed to the extent of ungrazed phytoplankton production in the North Atlantic, which was a vital element in establishing the importance of carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. The CPR continues to be the principal source of large-scale, long-term information about the plankton ecosystem of the North Atlantic. It has recently provided extensive information about the biodiversity of the plankton and about the distribution of introduced species. It serves as a valuable example for the design of future monitoring of the marine environment and it has been essential to the design and implementation of most North Atlantic plankton research.

We produced a map showing 13 clearly differentiated landcover types, and described the composition and structure of the plant communities, in an area of almost 40 000 km(2) in central Argentina. The land-cover map obtained shows that the Chaco vegetation in central Argentina is highly disturbed. In the lowland part of the area the dominant land-cover types are largely cultural landscapes and substitute shrublands, which have displaced the original Chaco forests, leaving only small isolated remnants generally confined to sites with some kind of constrain for agriculture. The use of TM images and the multivariate analysis of phytosociological data showed a qualified, high accuracy mapping capability for landcover types in the Chaco region (ca. 85% overall accuracy). Our results highlight the utility of TM and field data in a subtropical to warm-temperate region, which is promising where other ancillary data are not available and a rapid acquisition of reliable vegetation data is required, so constituting a starting point for an imperative and more extensive classification and mapping of the endangered Chaco region.																	1402-2001					DEC	2002	5	2					213	226										WOS:000181162900007						
J	Poole, GC; Stanford, JA; Frissell, CA; Running, SW				Poole, GC; Stanford, JA; Frissell, CA; Running, SW			Three-dimensional mapping of geomorphic controls on flood-plain hydrology and connectivity from aerial photos	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Nyack flood plain of the Middle Fork Flathead River, MT, USA is a 9-km anastomosed alluvial montane flood plain. Upstream from the flood plain, the river is unregulated and the catchment virtually pristine. A patchy mosaic of vegetation and channels exists on the flood-plain surface. The surface and subsurface geomorphic structures of the flood plain facilitate high hydrologic connectivity (water flux between the channel and flood plain) marked by complex seasonal patterns of flood-plain inundation, extensive penetration of channel water laterally into the alluvial aquifer, and springbrooks formed by ground water erupting onto the flood-plain surface. After delineating and classifying flood-plain "elements" (vegetation patches and channel reaches) on the flood plain, we analyzed field-based elevation survey data to identify expected relationships among flood-plain element type, surface scour frequency, and flood-plain elevation. Data analyses show that scour frequency was inversely proportional to the elevation of the flood plain above river stage, except when localized geomorphic controls such as natural levees prevent normal high flows from inundating and scouring relatively low flood-plain elements. Further, while different flood-plain element types occupy distinct elevation zones on the flood plain, the elevation of each zone above the river channel varies with localized channel entrenchment. We found that topographic variation among flood-plain elements is greater than the variation within elements, suggesting that coarse-scale flood-plain topography can be characterized by delineating flood-plain elements. Field data document strong associations between specific classes of flood-plain elements and preferential ground-water flow paths in the upper alluvial aquifer. Combined with preexisting ground penetrating RADAR (GPR) surveys, these data intimate a sinuous lattice of preferential ground-water flow paths (buried abandoned streambeds) in the upper alluvial aquifer at approximately the same elevation as the main channel's streambed. Using aerial photo interpretation and the identified relationships among element-types, elevation, and preferential ground-water flow paths, we developed a quantitative, three-dimensional characterization of surface and subsurface geomorphology across the entire flood plain to support a heuristic modeling effort investigating the influence of flood-plain geomorphology on spatio-temporal patterns of surface and ground-water flow and exchange under dynamic hydrologic regimes.

Total forest area declined from 977 km(2) in 1979 to 896 km(2) by 1997.

We also analyzed changes in forest patterns by land ownership for three major river basins within the ecoregion (Eel, Klamath, and Rogue) using FRAGSTATS. Overall, forests covered 66.8% of the ecoregion in 1972 and 62.1% in 1992. Approximately 10.5% of the forest area was disturbed overall, translating into an annual disturbance rate of 0.53%. Although public lands accounted for a slightly higher total area of forest disturbance, private lands were cut at a slightly higher rate. Forest disturbance within fifth level watersheds averaged 13.2%, but reached as high as 93.2%. For the three river basins where spatial pattern of forest disturbance was analyzed, private lands were already more fragmented than public lands in 1972. Over the 20-year time period, forest fragmentation increased on all ownerships. Fragmentation rates on public lands were high for all basins especially the Rogue. Clearcut logging on private lands was generally in larger adjacent tracts, whereas cuts on public lands were generally smaller and more dispersed. Our results illustrate the importance of considering landscape change history when planning for effective biodiversity conservation in forested ecoregions and when formulating ecologically sustainable forest management strategies.																	0921-2973					OCT	2002	17	5					455	470		10.1023/A:1021274701133								WOS:000179388800007

This pilot project shall gather new knowledge on biodiversity, distribution patterns, and ecological processes, and the overriding aim is "to describe and understand the patterns of distribution, abundance and trophic relationships of the organisms inhabiting the mid-oceanic North Atlantic, and identify and model ecological processes that cause variability in these patterns". The project will focus on pelagic, benthopelagic and epibenthic macrofauna, and analyse distribution and abundance patterns in relation to the abiotic and biotic environment, as well as trophic relationships and life history strategies. Fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and gelatinous plankton and nekton have the highest priority in the study. A major challenge of the project is to overcome observation difficulties at large depths and in rugged terrain. A central aim is thus to utilise modern remote sensing technology (acoustics, optics) using advanced instrument carriers (e.g. towed vehicles, ROVs, AUVs, etc.). The project will be carried out as a multi-ship operation in 2003-2005, and the ongoing planning is a collaborative effort involving many nations around the North Atlantic. The project will work on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and in adjacent waters from the Azores to Iceland, both by surveying large areas by acoustics and mid-water trawling, and by focusing on three selected sub-areas for intensive sampling and observation by traditional and novel methods and technology.

The present study serves to review this literature and highlight the causes of such apparently large species numbers, while providing an objective and realistic review of the mangrove species actually present in Sri Lanka today. This study is based on standardized fieldwork over a 4-year period using well-established diagnostic identification keys. The study indicates that there are at present 20 identified `mangrove species' (major and minor components) and at least 18 mangrove associates' along the south-western coast of the island, and addresses the importance of clearly defining these terms. Incorrect identifications in the past have adversely affected interpretation of species composition in the framework of biogeography, remote sensing and biological conservation and management.

J	French, DD; Dolmans, J				French, DD; Dolmans, J			An agricultural stratification of Scotland: From plot to parish	SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												A stratification of Scottish land in terms of predominant agricultural use is constructed by calibrating low-resolution remote-sensed data with detailed ground survey samples, using the calibration to extrapolate the detailed compositional information from the field survey to the whole of Scotland. Although initially constructed for analyses of biodiversity in relation to land use, pollution and climate, the strata are applicable to a wide range of land use and ecological problems. Four agricultural strata are defined: 'arable', 'inbye', 'moor' and 'plateau'; also a 'non-agricultural' stratum comprising mainly urban areas, large forest blocks, and large water bodies. The strata are applicable at spatial scales from a few square metres to several hundred square kilometres, enabling directly comparable analyses at widely differing spatial resolutions. Some advantages of the system and examples of applications are outlined, and possible developments suggested.																	0036-9225						2002	118	4					299	321										WOS:000183882700003						
J	Nagendra, H				Nagendra, H			Using remote sensing to assess biodiversity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This review paper evaluates the potential of remote sensing for assessing species diversity, an increasingly urgent task. Existing studies of species distribution patterns using remote sensing can be essentially categorized into three types. The first involves direct mapping of individual plants or associations of single species in relatively large, spatially contiguous units. The second technique involves habitat mapping using remotely sensed data, and predictions of species distribution based on habitat requirements. Finally, establishment of direct relationships between spectral radiance values recorded from remote sensors and species distribution patterns recorded from field observations may assist in assessing species diversity. Direct mapping is applicable over smaller extents, for detailed information on the distribution of certain canopy tree species or associations. Estimations of relationships between spectral values and species distributions may be useful for the limited purpose of indicating areas with higher levels of species diversity, and can be applied over spatial extents of hundreds of square kilometres. Habitat maps appear most capable of providing information on the distributions of large numbers of species in a wider variety of habitat types. This is strongly limited by variation in species composition, and best applied over limited spatial extents of tens of square kilometres.

J	Coops, NC; Catling, PC				Coops, NC; Catling, PC			Prediction of historical forest habitat patterns using binomial distributions and simple Boolean logic from high spatial resolution remote sensing	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												The identification of forest habitat. its spatial pattern and use by selected taxa is a vital step for the protection of biodiversity. The use of airborne videography and frequency distribution models based on historical habitat complexity data can provide detailed information on the spatial and temporal variation of habitat, respectively. The two techniques, however, have not been jointly applied to link the temporal variation in habitat to the spatial variation of habitat over the landscape to provide a complete historical picture of the variation of habitat quality of a forest estate. In this paper, a processing methodology is developed which allows the current spatial distribution of habitat quality to be used as a base to make retrospective predictions of the spatial extent and pattern of habitat quality over the landscape. This is achieved by projecting the spatial distribution of habitat complexity scores derived from the videography, backward in time using a combination of simple Boolean logic, estimated binomial distributions, and the use of random fluctuations to mimic natural forest dynamics that are likely to have occurred over the modeling period. The simulations provide information on the type and condition of habitat in recent history and can be linked to models predicting the abundance of a variety of common and endangered taxa.

J	Wang, YQ; Moskovits, DK				Wang, YQ; Moskovits, DK			Tracking fragmentation of natural communities and changes in land cover: Applications of landsat data for conservation in an urban landscape (Chicago wilderness)	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Greater Chicago is home to a surprisingly high concentration of globally significant natural communities. Within the metropolis survive some of the world's best remaining examples of eastern tallgrass prairie, oak savanna, open oak woodland, and prairie wetland. Chicago Wilderness is more than 81,000 ha of protected areas in the urban and suburban matrix. It also is the name of the coalition of more than 110 organizations committed to the survival of these natural lands. The long-term health of these imperiled communities depends on proper management of the more extensive, restorable lands that surround and connect the patches of high-quality habitat. Information critical to the success of conservation efforts in the region includes (1) a current vegetation map of Chicago Wilderness in sufficient detail to allow quantitative goal setting for the regions biodiversity recovery plan; (2) quantified fragmentation status of the natural communities; and (3) patterns of land-cover change and their effects on the vitality of communities under threat. We used multispectral data from the Landsat thematic mapper (October 1997) and associated ground truthing to produce a current vegetation map. With multitemporal remote-sensing data (acquired in 1972, 1985, and 1997), we derived land-cover maps of tide region at roughly equivalent intervals over the past 25 years. Analyses with geographic information system models reveal rapid acceleration of urban and suburban sprawl over the past 12 years. Satellite images provide striking visual comparisons of land use and health. They also provide banks of geographically referenced data that make quantitative tracking of trends possible. The data on habitat degradation and fragmentation are the biological foundation of quantitative goals for regional restoration.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					835	843		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004835.x								WOS:000170179600011						
J	Muldavin, EH; Neville, P; Harper, G				Muldavin, EH; Neville, P; Harper, G			Indices of grassland biodiversity in the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion derived from remote sensing	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We used a relatively simple and direct remote-sensing approach to determine biodiversity values in arid ecosystems and thus identify potential conservation sites. We developed indices based on regression models between, grass, shrub, litter, exposed-soil groundcover components and Landsat thematic mapper satellite imagery reflectance values over a reference site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico. This site supports low-disturbance grasslands that have been under a continuous grazing regime for over 100 years. Greater richness and abundance of noninvasive and nonruderal plant species were associated with the low-disturbance grasslands that had lower shrub abundance, increased litter and grass cover, and lower exposed soil. Using the thematic mapper indices, we computed an additive grassland biodiversity index such that, as exposed soil and shrub values go down, litter and grass values go up, as does the biodiversity index. When the biodiversity index was applied to the reference-site landscape, grasslands previously identified for their high conservation value were detected. As a further test, we applied the indices to a site in Chihuahua, Mexico, that supports similar grasslands but for which there are few other data on condition and conservation values. The soil, grass, and shrub indices were moderately effective in describing the range of variation at the Mexico site, but the litter equation was not. Still, higher biodiversity value in terms of nonruderal plant diversity tended to correspond to higher grass cover and lower soil exposure and a higher overall biodiversity index. Some localized calibration with geologic substrate may be required along with an assessment of the temporal constraints, but generally the index shows promise for quickly and efficiently detecting desert grasslands of high biodiversity conservation value.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					844	855		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004844.x								WOS:000170179600012

All recent vegetation surveys have been based on optic il satellite data, which is hampered by cloud cover and by southern Bahia's intricate mix of forest patches with other tree crops, especially cocoa. We describe the application of radar remote-sensing data to distinguish forest patches from cocoa planted in the shade of natural-forest trees, Radar, unlike optical sensors, is not obstructed by cloud cover and can acquire information about-forest structure by penetrating into the vegetation canopy The vegetation map generated from radar data clearly separates forest patches based on the degree of structural disturbance such as the density of shaded trees, the openness of the canopy, and the density of the monodominant Erythyrina shaded trees. The structural classification based on the radar data, and shown on the map, can help researchers assess the degree of fragmentation of the original Atlantic coastal forest and delineate areas of less disturbance with higher potential for conservation of biodiversity. This information can then be applied to conservation planning, especially the design and monitoring of nature reserves and the modeling of biological corridors.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					867	875		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004867.x								WOS:000170179600014						
J	Mumby, PJ				Mumby, PJ			Beta and habitat diversity in marine systems: a new approach to measurement, scaling and interpretation	OECOLOGIA												Habitat diversity is a widely used criterion for locating conservation activities such as protected areas. Most habitat diversity indices are measures of alpha diversity at the scale of habitats and are therefore insensitive to the underlying biological differences between habitats. To incorporate such inter-habitat differences, a new method is presented which calculates a measure of beta (beta) diversity from pixels within a window passed throughout a habitat map. To avoid confusion with beta diversity indices, the new measure is called beta -dissimilarity. beta -Dissimiliarity is calculated from the mean Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, D-m, of field data which comprise each habitat class. The variance of D-m distinguishes discrete beta -dissimilarity distributions from homogenous patterns. The method also attempts to remove some of the arbitrary aspects of habitat mapping, can be scaled to other levels of diversity or measures of community structure, is readily interpretable and permits hypothesis testing. Its applications to ecosystem science and coastal management are discussed and illustrated.

J	Zomer, RJ; Ustin, SL; Carpenter, CC				Zomer, RJ; Ustin, SL; Carpenter, CC			Land cover change along tropical and subtropical riparian corridors within the Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area, Nepal	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Low elevation riparian forests found within the Middle Hills of Nepal are both essential biological habitats tial biological habitats and important resources for local subsistence farmers. Forming networks of habitat patches within the primarily agricultural matrix of the Middle Hills, these forests are repositories of a rich biological diversity. Dynamics of forest change along riparian corridors were investigated within the newly established Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area (MBCA) of eastern Nepal, based on a comparison of remote sensing data over a 20-year interval. Multispectral analysis and a supervised classification of Landsat TM (1992) and Landsat MSS (1972) data estimate approximately 7000 ha of low elevation riparian forests within the study area. Change detection analysis estimates based on the respective supervised classifications reveal little significant change in extent of the tropical and subtropical zone riparian forests. More impact was evident toward the upper elevational limits of the study area. A 4% (approximately 300 ha) loss of cover within areas previously designated as forest is estimated. For all areas in the study area, a net loss of forest of 11% is estimated. Land use is shown to be highly dynamic, with significant internal trading between land use classes. The important role of riparian corridors in biodiversity conservation within the Middle Hilts of east Nepal is discussed. Further research on biodiversity within these patches and a specific recognition of the value of remnant riparian forests within the landscape and rural economy are required if conservation goals for the eastern Nepal Himalaya are to be met.

However, we found that this common perception was not true in Wolong Nature Reserve (southwestern China), which was established in 1975 as a "flagship" protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. Analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. The rate of Loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. After the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were;similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created.

J	Ares, J; Bertiller, M; del Valle, H				Ares, J; Bertiller, M; del Valle, H			Functional and structural landscape indicators of intensification, resilience and resistance in agroecosystems in southern Argentina based on remotely sensed data	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												There is increasing interest in developing criteria to evaluate the environmental implications of intensive agricultural land use. This implies discriminating between nature and man-made effects upon structural and functional attributes of agroecosystems. Adequate indicators of these combined effects should be cost efficient yet compatible with the core of ecological theory on biodiversity, spatial organization and ecosystem stability. We developed resistance-resilience metrics of plant growth to evaluate the intensity of agricultural use in a temperate irrigated basin in southern Argentina. The metrics are based on an analysis of the components of a temporal series of vegetation indices computed at a low resolution from available globally remote sensed reflectance imagery. We related the developed metrics to the properties of the soils and plant canopies observed at field scale and high-resolution imagery of the basin. Soil depth, soil erosion status and land fragmentation account for large fractions of the variance of the distribution of functional groups of the plant canopies and are also correlated with smaller scale attributes of land vegetation cover. Resistance-resilience indicators constitute a cost-efficient and adequate approach to evaluate the degree of intensification of land agricultural use.																	0921-2973					APR	2001	16	3					221	234		10.1023/A:1011172006029								WOS:000168194400003						
J	Pan, D; Domon, G; Marceau, D; Bouchard, A				Pan, D; Domon, G; Marceau, D; Bouchard, A			Spatial pattern of coniferous and deciduous forest patches in an Eastern North America agricultural landscape: the influence of land use and physical attributes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												In agricultural landscapes, most studies have investigated the influence of the spatial pattern of forest patches on other ecological phenomena and processes, such as animal movement and biodiversity. However, few have focused on explaining the spatial pattern of the forest patches themselves. Understanding how these patterns relate to the processes that generate them is fundamental in developing a sound theory of landscape ecology, and in devising rational management strategies. In this paper, the pattern of the overall forest patches, as well as the pattern of deciduous and coniferous patches in an agricultural landscape of Southern Quebec, Canada, were analyzed and related to landscape physical attributes and land use, using remote sensing, geographic information systems and statistical methods. Results show that the role of landscape physical attributes on forest patch pattern has been modified by land use. In the study area, coniferous or deciduous patches are not associated with a specific surface deposit. In addition, physical attributes explain only a small proportion of the abundance of conifers on past abandoned land compared with land-use factors. Physical attributes only indirectly influence the forest pattern because they strongly influence the land-use practices. Our results reveal a conifer recovery process with the abandonment of agricultural land. On past abandoned land, conifers expand with increasing stand age, mostly by invasion from neighboring coniferous patches. Spatially, coniferous patches are usually located on the margins of the overall forest patches, and they are connected to non-forest land-use types such as crop and pasture, the latter being the most important. By showing the importance of some coniferous forest types that did not exist in the precolonial forest, a new perspective emerges when landscape, especially, land-use dynamics are taken into account.																	0921-2973					FEB	2001	16	2					99	110		10.1023/A:1011167905097								WOS:000167936500002

We used remotely sensed, landscape, and habitat data. The meadow type, as determined from the remotely sensed data, was highly correlated with abundances of six of the 11 bird species. Landscape variables significant in predicting occurrence were selected using a stepwise multiple regression for each bird species. These variables were then used in a multiple regression with the variable meadow type. As expected, the abundances of the generalist species (American Robin, Dark-eyed Junco, White-crowned Sparrow, Brewer's Blackbird, and Chipping Sparrow) were not strongly correlated with landscape variables or meadow type. Conversely, abundances of the Common Snipe, Common Yellowthroat, Lincoln's Sparrow, Savannah Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, and Yellow Warbler were highly correlated with meadow type and landscape variables such as percent cover of willow (Salix spp.), graminoid, woody vegetation, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), and graminoid and shrub biomass. The results from our study indicate that remotely sensed data are applicable for estimating potential habitats for bird species in the different types of montane meadows. However, to improve predictions about species in specific sites or areas, we recommend the use of additional landscape metrics and habitat data collected in the field.

At each sampling site substrates, species richness as well as population vitality and mode of propagation were investigated. Data were analysed at the local and the district scale. Species richness was correlated with substrate diversity and with the number of habitats and the size of vegetation-areas for districts. Based on habitat and climatic changes within the last two hundred years, current observations were compared with historic data. Habitat and substrate diversity were the most influential parameters on species richness and population vitality of bryophytes in Vienna.

J	Gould, W				Gould, W			Remote sensing of vegetation, plant species richness, and regional biodiversity hotspots	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding mesoscale patterns of ecosystem properties is important if we are to effectively monitor ecosystem change due to land use and climate change. Remote sensing provides the best tool for looking at large areas of the earth's surface to analyze, map, and monitor ecosystem patterns and processes. Patterns of vegetation and variation in biodiversity are important ecosystem properties, with strong relationships to important ecosystem functions. Species richness is the most widely used measure of biodiversity, and mapping patterns of species richness within a landscape can provide a basis for future monitoring and an ecological basis for land management and conservation decisions. This study presents (1) a map of the vegetation of the Hood River region of the Central Canadian Arctic derived from a supervised classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, (2) estimations and maps of regional variation in plant species richness, and (3) a comparison of three species richness estimation techniques. The three vascular species richness estimates are derived from measures of variation in normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI), abundance of mapped vegetation types weighted by relative potential species richness, and a multiple regression of both these variables for 17 sampling sites of 500 pixels each. Ground-based measures of species richness range from 69 to 109 vascular plant species per 0.5-km(2) sample area. Variation in NDVI is positively correlated with measured species richness and a weighted abundance of mapped vegetation types. Multiple regression indicates that variation in NDVI and weighted abundance of mapped vegetation types explain 79% of the variance in ground-based measures of species richness. Three methods for remotely estimating species richness agree to within +/- 15 species over 60% of the area and +/- 30 species over 93% of the area.

Such maps are useful in understanding wildlife populations and habitat, forest biodiversity, and forest productivity. They may be important in ecological monitoring programs at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and could include assessment of structural aspects of the landscape, such as forest or habitat fragmentation. Quantification and measurement of landscape structure depend on the definition of landscape classes or patches, defined on the basis of more or less homogeneous elements, which differ in some measurable way from neighbouring patches. In this paper, we review some of the issues, and provide examples using satellite remote sensing data, in the quantification of landscape structure in two Canadian forests. The link between landscape structure and biodiversity is provided through the emergence of ecological understanding of species richness, species-habitat or niches, and metapopulation dynamics.

J	Cushman, SA; Wallin, DO				Cushman, SA; Wallin, DO			Rates and patterns of landscape change in the Central Sikhote-alin Mountains, Russian Far East	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												We used Landsat imagery and GIS to quantify the rates and patterns of landscape change between 1972 and 1992 for a 734,126 ha forested study area in the central Sikhote-alin Mountains of the Russian Far East. The study area includes a portion of the Sikhote-alinskiy Biosphere Reserve which is a part of the United Nations international Man and the Biosphere (MAB) reserve network. Wildfire is a major disturbance agent throughout the area and timber harvesting outside the reserve is also important. Maximum likelihood classification of the satellite imagery identified four broad cover types (hardwood, conifer, mixed and non-forest) in 1992 and changes among them between 1972 and 1992. We used multi-temporal principal components analysis to describe the magnitude and direction of landscape change for six watersheds that represent a range of ecological histories and disturbance regimes. Overall, forest cover declined from 90.4% in 1972 to 77.2% in 1992. The disturbance rate was more than twice as high in conifer than in hardwood forests. The rate of disturbance outside the reserve was three times that inside. While the rates of disturbance are not markedly higher than those recorded from other temperate forests, there has recently been a large alteration in the disturbance regime which will lead to a general transformation of forest composition and structure in the study area if the trend continues.																	0921-2973					OCT	2000	15	7					643	659		10.1023/A:1008180207109								WOS:000089421500005

J	Mertens, B; Lambin, EF				Mertens, B; Lambin, EF			Land-cover-change trajectories in southern Cameroon	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												The objective of this study is to better understand the complexity of deforestation processes in southern Cameroon by testing a multivariate, spatial model of land-cover change trajectories associated with deforestation. The spatial model integrates a spectrum of independent variables that characterize land rent on a spatially explicit basis. The use of a time series of high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images (Landsat MSS and SPOT XS), spanning two decades, allows a thorough validation of spatial projections of future deforestation. Remote sensing observations reveal a continuous trend of forest clearing and forest degradation in southern regions of Cameroon, but with a highly fluctuating rate. A significant proportion of the areas subject to a land-cover conversion experienced other changes in the following years. The study also demonstrates that modeling land-cover change trajectories over several observation years allows a better projection of areas with a high probability of change in land-cover than projecting such areas on the basis of observations from the previous time period alone. Statistical results suggest that, in our southern Cameroon study area, roads mostly increased the accessibility of the forest for migrants rather than providing incentives for a transformation of local subsistence agriculture into market-oriented farming systems. The spacial model developed in this study allows simulations of likely impacts of human actions, leading to a transformation of the landscape (e.g., road projects) on key landscape attributes (e.g., biodiversity). Currently, several road projects or major logging concessions exist in southern Cameroon.

We hypothesized that mesic meadows would support the highest species diversity of plants, birds, and butterflies because they are more moderate environments. We also hypothesized that mesic meadows would exhibit the greatest seasonal and interannual variability in spectral response across years. Field sampling in each of the meadow types was conducted for plants, birds, and butterflies in 1997 and 1998. Mesic meadows supported the highest plant species diversity, but there was no significant difference in bird or butterfly species diversity among meadow types. These data show that it may be easier to detect significant differences in more species rich taxa (e.g., plants) than taxa that are represented by fewer species (e.g., butterflies and birds). Mesic meadows also showed the great est seasonal and interannual variability in spectral response. Given the rich biodiversity of mesic montane meadows and their sensitivity to variations in temperature and moisture, they may be important to monitor in the context of environmental change.

J	Reusing, M				Reusing, M			Mapping woodland vegetation in SW Ethiopia based on a hybrid model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Despite the fact that indigenous inhabitants have sustainably managed the forests and woodlands for centuries, Ethiopia's woodland resources are now under severe pressure. At the request of the Ethiopian Government, in 1996/97 the Savanna Woodland Management Study Project was initiated by the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ). A detailed analysis of the woodland resources in SW Ethiopia and a vegetation map were produced. The map was generated using multispectral remote-sensing data, and provides details of the variety within Ethiopian woodlands. A hybrid data classification procedure was applied to incorporate relief and climatic conditions. After analysis of the remote sensing data by image processing, a spatial overlay was performed to incorporate the additional site condition factors. The vegetation map shows the spatial distribution of all existing woodland types in the area and enhances our knowledge of the rich biodiversity of SW Ethiopia. Such mapping gives us a better understanding of existing ecosystems and indigenous land-use systems, and hence, can lead to more sustainable management of the natural resources in the future.																	1350-4509					SEP	2000	7	3					251	259		10.1080/13504500009470045								WOS:000090061200008						
J	Zheng, DL; Chen, JQ				Zheng, DL; Chen, JQ			Edge effects in fragmented landscapes: a generic model for delineating area of edge influences (D-AEI)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We developed a generic model for delineating area of edge influences D-AEI for quantifying edge effects within a landscape by combining remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), moving window (3 x 3), and computer programming techniques. Our model provided a more realistic assessment of edge effects than those based on traditional methods. Unique characteristics of the D-AEI model included: (1) preservation of the spatial characteristics of the landscape structure; (2) incorporation of the most critical parameters controlling edge effects, such as edge orientation, edge contrast, prevailing direction of edge effects, decay value, and interior approximation; and (3) ability to quantify edge effects for various variables at multiple scales. The model is flexible so that the users can define key parameters and generate ecologically relevant output based on environmental and spatial characteristics of the study area and the study purpose. Our results demonstrated that: (a) edge effects were not symmetrically distributed in all directions around clearcuts; (b) AEI was not necessarily continuous around patches; and (c) boundary dynamics and multiple edge effects were clearly reflected across the landscape. Results from this research are important for current and future resource assessments, biological conservation and wildlife habitat management, biodiversity studies of flora and fauna, microclimatic research, future studies on edges and their importance in landscape design and analysis. The model has potential for broader applications in other research areas where human and natural disturbances are evident, at multiple scales from watershed, forest management district, to region.

J	Roy, PS; Tomar, S				Roy, PS; Tomar, S			Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using geospatial modelling technique	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Geospatial presentation of habitat status has become a key issue for planning conservation. Biodiversity characters of the habitat provide the basis of prioritizing the sites in conservation effort. Since India is identified as one of the 12-mega biodiversity countries in the world, this task is of great significance. In India, biogeographers have long since recognized North-East India as one of the most diverse regions with respect to flora and fauna, Since historic times. human interventions had started influencing the landuse and landcover of this region. Deforestation is mainly attributed to shifting cultivation and commercial logging of timber. This has resulted in fragmentation of the landscape. Landscape fragmentation and degradation have been identified as fundamental reasons for biodiversity loss. The paper uses landscape ecological principles for biodiversity characterization, Satellite remote sensing data have been used for characterization of the landscape and stratification for ground inventory. A geographic information system has been used to spatially model the disturbance regimes and to integrate the ground based nonspatial data with the spatial characters of the landscape. The vegetation types and landuse of Meghalaya have been mapped using Indian remote sensing (IRS) time series data. The various parameters (viz. patch shape. patch size, number of patches, porosity, fragmentation and juxtaposition) have been analyzed on the most recent landcover map to spatially present the disturbance regimes. A spatial model incorporating ground based biodiversity attributes of the landscape elements, landuse change patterns, disturbance regimes of the landscape and terrain complexity have been used to delineate the spatial pattern of biological richness. This has been achieved using the landscape analysis package (LAP) developed at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. Habitat evaluation using ground based data and their spatial organization have been found to provide reliable information on the biodiversity distribution pattern. The present approach for prioritizing the biodiversity rich sites have the advantage of integrating spatial, non-spatial information and horizontal relationships. The information is finally presented in space and time. This approach will facilitate conservation prioritization: systematic inventory and continuous monitoring. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Etter, A; Villa, LA				Etter, A; Villa, LA			Andean Forests and farming systems in part of the Eastern Cordillera (Colombia)	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT					International Symposium of the Andean-Mountain-Association	DEC 09-14, 1998	QUITO, ECUADOR	Andean Mt Assoc				Andean ecosystems are among the most diverse and threatened ecosystems in the world. Only very general data on the extent and impacts of the transformation processes that have affected ecosystems in Colombia are available to date. This study analyzes the transformation of forests in part of the Eastern Colombian Andes, using the landscape ecological approach, with remote sensing, fieldwork, and GIS. There are two levels of analysis: a region al level (1:500,000) covering 4.1 million ha and a subregional level (1:50,000) covering 225,000 ha. The former covers the central portion of the East-Andean Cordillera, where the remaining forest and paramo areas were quantified and their spatial distribution analyzed. The subregional analysis level is located in the Middle Chicamocha Watershed. The effects of human activities on the ecosystems were analyzed, taking current farming systems into consideration. The historical human impact in the region has been intense, especially in the drier parts of the study area. At the regional level, only 22% of the original forests remain, of which 28.7% are located in the national parks. In the subregional study area, only 7.6% remain, mainly at altitudes of more than 3000 m. Of five identified forest types, the two with considerable covered areas were the High-Andean Polylepis Forests (33.6%) and the High-Andean mixed forests (35.1%). The original land cover of the sub-Andean dry forests has been almost totally replaced by seminatural shrublands, pastures, crops, and severely degraded areas. The largest fragments are Andean mixed forests and the Andean oak forests, with sizes up to 866 and 1182 ha. Of 19 identified farming systems at the subregional level, only 5 include substantial proportions of their original forest covers.

J	Trisurat, Y; Eiumnoh, A; Murai, S; Hussain, MZ; Shrestha, RP				Trisurat, Y; Eiumnoh, A; Murai, S; Hussain, MZ; Shrestha, RP			Improvement of tropical vegetation mapping using a remote sensing technique: a case of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The forest ecosystems of Thailand are characterized by a diverse and complex vegetation structure. Classification of vegetation types of such forest ecosystems has been experienced as a difficult task, even with large-scale aerial photography. Satellite remote sensing, the digital technique in particular, has not been widely used for vegetation mapping in Thailand until now. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of digital image processing over the existing technique of visual interpretation of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) false colour composite (BGR-2, 3, 4) to produce forest cover maps in Thailand. Supervised and unsupervised classification methods were employed with different band combinations to discriminate vegetation types in the Khao Yai National Park using Landsat TM data. The results indicated that thematic classes derived from supervised classification produced higher overall accuracy than unsupervised classification. In addition, the combination of ratio bands R4/3; R5/2, R5/4 and R5/7 ranked the highest in terms of accuracy (65% for unsupervised and 79% for supervised) and the combination of bands 2, 3 and 4 gave the lowest (56% for both methods). Finally, it was concluded that, even within the limit of spectral information available in the image, the digital classification can improve the result of visual interpretation.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	2000	21	10					2031	2042		10.1080/01431160050021277								WOS:000087470500005						
J	Kampichler, C; Barthel, J; Wieland, R				Kampichler, C; Barthel, J; Wieland, R			Species density of foliage-dwelling spiders in field margins: a simple, fuzzy rule-based model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Field margins are grassy strips or banks between arable fields or meadows that are not cultivated or ploughed and contain only single shrubs or trees. They not only support beneficial arthropods, e.g. predators of crop pests, but can also be of potential value to species of concern, making them a critical target for conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Most ecological data and most knowledge of ecological relationships are imprecise, uncertain or ambiguous. An overemphasis on the precision of mathematical models, thus, does not necessarily translate into a greater representation of reality. In contrast, fuzzy expert systems permit the representation and processing of 'soft' ecological knowledge in terms of natural language. This is done by sets of IF-THEN rules that relate the variables (expressed in the form of fuzzy sets such as 'rather cold', 'comparably few species', etc.) among each other. Data on 96 field margins in southern Germany and their foliage-dwelling spider assemblages, which had been collected from May to September 1994, were used for fuzzy modelling of the effects of margin width, margin density, frequency of mechanical disturbance and vegetation-architectural complexity on species density of spiders. Habitat factors were ordered according to their hierarchical effectiveness: margin width and disturbance determine habitat persistence, habitat persistence and margin density determine colonisation potential, and colonisation potential and herbaceous-plant cover determine species density. Forty-five rules are necessary to relate these factors. The predictive power of the fuzzy model was surprisingly high. The mean average error between predicted and observed number of species for test data, which was not used for model development, was less than 1.4 species (observed values ranged between 3 and 25). A multiple-regression model showed a mean average error of 3.17 species. We conclude that fuzzy models are suitable for representing the soft knowledge of field-margin/spider-assemblage relationships. The model permits time- and manpower-saving validation on larger scales by qualitative rather than quantitative data collection and by the inclusion of remote sensing data. We believe that fuzzy models could provide a valuable means for formulating measures necessary for conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Roff, JC; Taylor, ME				Roff, JC; Taylor, ME			National frameworks for marine conservation - A hierarchical geophysical approach	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Development of environmental protected areas has been driven 'more by opportunity than design, scenery rather than science' (Hackman A. 1993. Preface. A protected areas gap analysis methodology: planning for the conservation of biodiversity. World Wildlife Fund Canada Discussion Paper: i-ii). If marine environments are to be protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of types of marine habitats and delineation of their boundaries in a consistent classification is required. Without such a classification system, the extent and significance of representative or distinctive habitats cannot be recognized. Such recognition is a fundamental prerequisite to the determination of location and size of marine areas to be protected. 2. A hierarchical classification has been developed based on enduring/recurrent geophysical (oceanographic and physiographic) features of the marine environment, which identifies habitat types that reflect changes in biological composition. Important oceanographic features include temperature, stratification and exposure; physiographic features include bottom relief and substrate type. 3. Classifications based only on biological data are generally prohibited at larger scales, due to lack of information. Therefore, We are generally obliged to classify habitat types as surrogates for community types. The data necessary for this classification are available from mapped sources and from remote sensing. It is believed they can be used to identify representative and distinctive marine habitats supporting different communities. and will provide an ecological framework for marine conservation planning at the national level.

This paper reports on the results of a case study undertaken in the lower Herbert River catchment in north-east Queensland, which utilised remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assess both spatial and temporal changes in land cover since European settlement in the mid-nineteenth century. We demonstrate that since European settlement there has been a substantial reduction in the area of Melaleuca, rainforest, and eucalyptus-dominated land-cover patterns. We also provide a range of quantitative measures to show that the landscape diversity, integrity and quality of these ecosystems have also declined between the 1860s and 1996. We conclude that reform is required at policy, planning and enterprise levels if the ecological, economic and social values of these systems are to be maintained in the future.																	0004-9182					MAR	2000	31	1					75	86		10.1080/00049180093547								WOS:000086394900005						
J	Kozlowski, TT				Kozlowski, TT			Responses of woody plants to human-induced environmental stresses: Issues, problems, and strategies for alleviating stress	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES												Forest ecosystems are enormously important to mankind. They not only supply wood, foods, medicines, waxes, oils, gums, resins and tannins, but they also regulate climate, hydrology, mineral cycling, soil erosion, and cleansing of air and water. A variety of natural and human-induced environmental stresses have both beneficial and harmful effects on forest ecosystems. However, human-induced stresses are much more harmful than naturally induced disturbances. Human-induced stresses, which often are catastrophic although avoidable, include deforestation, fire, pollution, flooding, and soil compaction. Such stresses variously injure woody plants, impede vegetative and reproductive growth, and induce mortality, largely by causing physiological dysfunction in plants. Human-induced environmental stresses have led to decimation of forest ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, forest declines, and potential global warming. Short-rotation plantations, especially in the tropics, are increasing rapidly, largely to produce wood quickly. Plantations also stabilize soil, prevent water runoff, provide shelter from wind and heat, and relieve pressure for exploiting natural forests. However, plantations alone are unlikely to satisfy society's growing needs for the products and services that can be provided by woody plant ecosystems. Hence, several multiple concurrent strategies are urgently needed to lessen the many destructive effects of human-induced environmental stresses on woody plants. These include not only the expansion of plantations but also of agroforestry systems and forest reserves as well as the development of innovative silvicultural techniques with a focus on the preservation of natural forests. Conserving sustainability of natural forests will require a land ethic as prelude to understanding the functioning of forest ecosystems, ecological and physiological impacts of disturbances on ecosystems, and the processes involved in recovery of disturbed ecosystems. Many of the harmful effects of pollution, fire, flooding, and soil compaction can be abated by judicious planning to create and perpetuate the critical components of forest stand structure and species composition. Strategies for continuous production of the products and services that can be supplied by woody plants will need to be reinforced by expanded long-term research and close cooperation among forest biologists, social scientists, economists, and regulatory government agencies.																	0735-2689	1549-7836					2000	19	2					91	170		10.1016/S0735-2689(00)80001-5								WOS:000086494300001

The dynamics of the landscape elements and the spatial pattern of Minorca were analysed to test whether this human-modelled landscape was at a stationary state, and, if it was the case, to see whether the system could be characterized by a particular spatial pattern. Landsat TM satellite images were processed to derive land cover classification and vegetation index maps corresponding to the years 1984 and 1992, the best compromise between een null cloudiness and maximum time span. The classification was used to test the stationary state by estimating the transition matrix; of land cover. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to analyse the spatial pattern of change at the patch level. The spatial analysis of NDVI was based on four indices: fractal dimension, number and size distribution of patches, and spatial Kappa index. Those pattern descriptors were compared with values obtained from stochastic landscape simulations. Temporal analysis showed that land cover proportions remained approximately constant over the 8-year period, although interchange amongst patches existed. This suggested that the landscape of Minorca was close to a stationary state. The study of NDVI changes revealed that the spatial structure was different from that of neutral models and presented scale invariance properties. Results from land cover transitions and from NDVI patterning suggest that the landscape of Minorca is a critical system, in the framework of the self-organized criticality hypothesis, i.e. the mosaic of patches would self-organize at the frontier of a dynamic equilibrium constituted by the balance between disturbances and successional processes.

J	Nagendra, H; Gadgil, M				Nagendra, H; Gadgil, M			Biodiversity assessment at multiple scales: Linking remotely sensed data with field information	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												We examine the efficacy of a scheme of multiscale assessment of biodiversity linking remote sensing on larger spatial scales with localized field sampling. A classification of ecological entities from biosphere to individual organisms in the form of a nested hierarchy is employed, such that entities at any level are differentiated in terms of their composition/configuration involving entities at the next lower level. We employ the following hierarchy: biosphere (10(14) m(2)), ecoregions (10(11)-10(12) m(2)), ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)), ecotopes (10(3)-10(6) m(2)), and individual organisms (10(-4) 10(2) m(2)). Focusing on a case study of West Coast-Western Chats ecoregion (1.7 x 10(11) m(2)) from India, we demonstrate that remotely sensed data permit discrimination of 205 patches of 11 types of sufficiently distinctive ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)) through unsupervised classification by using distribution parameters of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, with a pixel size of 3.24 x 10(6) m(2). At the ecomosaic scale, Indian Remote Sensing LISS-2 satellite data with a pixel size of 10(3) m(2) permit discrimination of approximate to 30 types of sufficiently distinctive ecotopes on the basis of supervised classification, Field investigations of angiosperm species distributions based on quadrats of 1-10(2) m(2) in one particular landscape of 27.5 x 106 m(2) show that the seven ecotope types distinguished in that locality are significantly different from each other in terms of plant species composition, This suggests that we can effectively link localized field investigations of biodiversity with remotely sensed information to permit extrapolations at progressively higher scales.

Plant communities distributed in these landscape element types were surveyed in the field using 246 quadrats of 10 x 10 m, in order to assess whether these types could be distinguished in terms of species composition. All angiosperms excluding grasses, which could not be identified accurately in the held, were recorded for this put-pose. 3. Landscape element types identified in the field harboured significantly distinctive sets of species of flowering plants, and were also by and large distinctive in terms of their species richness. 4. Landscape element types could be identified accurately on the basis of supervised classification: the types thus demarcated harboured distinctive sets of flowering plants. 5, Landscape element types coupled to satellite imagery could then be used to organize a programme of monitoring biodiversity. 6. Unsupervised classification of satellite imagery did not permit classification of landscape element types with a high enough level of accuracy. In consequence, the demarcated landscape element types did not harbour significantly distinctive sets of species of flowering plants. Unsupervised classification is therefore not appropriate in a programme of monitoring biodiversity.

J	Smith, W; Meredith, TC; Johns, T				Smith, W; Meredith, TC; Johns, T			Exploring methods for rapid assessment of woody vegetation in the Batemi Valley, North-central Tanzania	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Conservation of local biological resources in remote areas requires efficient data and collection methods. This paper describes part of a local conservation initiative in Northern Tanzania in which an indigenous conservation group enlisted the support of outside scientists to explore means of preparing baseline ecological reports. Two factors are seen as important: one is local use of ecological resources and the other is local availability. This paper focuses on the second of these and considers woody species. A variety of ecological field methods, statistical analysis and remote sensing and mapping techniques are used to generate baseline ecological inventories. The fieldwork identified 101 woody species, representing 54 genera and 37 families in the Batemi area. There are three main vegetation types: Vangueria apiculata-Ficus sycomorus-Trichilia emetica type; Croton dictygamous-Euphorbia tirucalli-Grewia bicolor type; and Acacia tortilis-Balanites aegyptica-Euphorbia candelabrum type. The Landsat TM map identified four main land-cover classes: (1) bushland and woodland thicket, (2) woodland (3) wooded grassland, and (4) grassland with scattered trees, which includes agricultural areas and villages. The combination of these data and methods can be useful for conservation planning and long-term monitoring, but it is clear that ground-level local assessment is necessary to detect subtleties of human-environment interaction that are required for conservation planning.																	0960-3115					APR	1999	8	4					447	470		10.1023/A:1008898331292								WOS:000081405700001						
J	Hunziker, M; Kienast, F				Hunziker, M; Kienast, F			Potential impacts of changing agricultural activities on scenic beauty - a prototypical technique for automated rapid assessment	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												As a result of the liberalisation of the agricultural market, mountain regions in Central Europe are at great risk of experiencing increasing land abandonment and spontaneous reforestation. Prior to taking measures for landscape maintenance, the ecological and landscape-aesthetic consequences of land abandonment should be analysed. This paper addresses the aesthetic component of such analyses: we investigated whether lay people perceive land abandonment and spontaneous reforestation as a loss or a gain and developed a prototypical technique for rapid aesthetic assessment of reforestation scenarios for vast regions. First, we conducted image experiments to assess the respondents' reactions to increasing levels of reforestation. Based on these experiments we concluded that a medium degree of reforestation is most desirable. Second, we analysed the relationship between scenic beauty and landscape patterns and found that landscape preference values correlate significantly with various quantitative measures of the landscape pattern (e,g., diversity and contagion indices of grey-tone and colour images). Third, we applied a GIS-assisted 'moving-window' technique to transform spatially explicit remote-sensing data (in particular orthophotos) of a test region to spatially explicit data of landscape-pattern indices. Thanks to the significant positive correlation between pattern indices and landscape preference values, the resulting maps can preliminarily be interpreted as 'beauty'-maps of the test-region.

Digital image processing and geographical information systems techniques were employed, together with local knowledge, high resolution imagery and expert consultation, to compile a cartographic map product. Results The TREES Vegetation Map of Central Africa has been shown to be strongly correlated with the FAO Forest Resources Assessment for 1990. Comparison with other map sources indicates that the map contains greater spatial detail and is more consistent than conventionally compiled maps. The conventional maps however, contain more thematic information content relating to vegetation type. Main conclusions The map improves our stale of knowledge of the vegetation cover of Central Africa and presents the most consistent and spatially detailed view yet published at this scale. Thematic information content on forest type is limited but should be improved in the near future with the inclusion of data from new satellite sensors. This first version of the map and future planned updates should provide an important input for regional stratification and planning purposes for forest resources, biodiversity and climate studies.																	0305-0270					MAR	1999	26	2					353	366		10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00270.x								WOS:000081618000013

A statistical classifier applied to satellite images identified 14 land-cover classes including water, swamp, dry grasslands, degraded woody vegetation, semi-natural forest classes and intensive land uses. Validation, using 240 sample sites, recorded 86% correspondence between field and map data. Intensive land use makes up 23% of the area, water and swamps 27%, dry grasslands 29%, woody vegetation 21%, with semi-natural forests covering 15% of the area. The species data from sample-based field surveys included flowering plant species, dragon/lies, butterflies, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The species data were used to generate biodiversity ratings, based on species 'richness' and 'rarity', which could be related to the vegetation cover. This inter-relation helped to generate a biodiversity map of the Sango Bay area which has since been used to aid conservation planning. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vasquez, JA; Camus, PA; Ojeda, FP				Vasquez, JA; Camus, PA; Ojeda, FP			Diversity, structure and functioning of rocky coastal ecosystems in northern Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												This study, among others of the Fondecyt Sectorial Program directed toward the study of biodiversity of Antofagasta, was carried out in three rocky areas on the exposed coast of northern Chile selected for their representation of varying upwelling regimes: (a) Caleta Constitucion (Mejillones-Antofagasta Peninsula) located in a stable focus of coastal upwelling; (b) Carrizal Bajo (Huasco), a reference zone without permanent coastal upwelling; and (c) San Lorenzo (Punta Lengua de Vaca), a reference zone of contrast, on a focus of stable upwelling. The general objetives of our study were: (1) characterize the taxonomic composition and community structure, as a function of categories or trophic revels in subtidal and intertidal habitats; (2) characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of the diversity and abundance of species in the communities studied, relating these to variations in productivity and sea surface temperature (obtained by remote sensing); and (3) evaluate the effects of upwelling on community attributes in relation to similar comparisons between areas with and without upwelling. Our results show that the frequency of upwelling was not a determining factor in the diversity of the rocky littoral communities which were studied. Although the species richness of the subtidal benthos and ichthyofauna is greater in Caleta Constitucion (permanent upwelling) than in Carrizal Bajo (seasonal upwelling), these values were lowest for San Lorenzo (permanent upwelling). In contrast, the species richness of intertidal habitats did not show evident differences among the communities studied. There was no relationship evident between the diversity of primary producer and benthic herbivores with the Frequency of coastal enrichment. However, patterns of abundance and diversity of some producers groups (eg. Chlorophytes) showed that the importance of coastal upwelling cannot be discarded in specific cases, although the changes may not be observed at the community level. An analysis of the relationship between the general trophic structure of benthic intertidal and subtidal communities did not show major differences in trophic linkage at the carnivore level. However, although trophic linkages between herbivores are similar between localities, there were significant differences between habitats. In contrast, trophic linkages between assemblages of fishes showed significant differences in structure and complexity between localities with and without permanent upwelling. Trophic relationships documented for subtidal habitats constitute the first contribution to the knowledge of the trophic structure in these habitats of northern Chile.																	0716-078X					DEC	1998	71	4					479	499										WOS:000078276100005						
J	Innes, JL; Koch, B				Innes, JL; Koch, B			Forest biodiversity and its assessment by remote sensing	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Serveral international conventions and agreements have stressed the importance of the assessment of forest biodiversity. However, the methods by which such assessments can be made remain unclear. Remote sensing represents an important tool for looking at ecosystem diversity and various structural aspects of individual ecosystems. It provides a means to make assessments across several different spatial scales, and is also critical for assessments of changes in ecosystem pattern over time. Many different forms of remote sensing are available. While lately the emphasis on laser scanner and synthetic aperture radar data has increased, most work to date has used photographs and digital optical imagery, primarily from airborne and spaceborne platforms. These provide the opportunity to assess different phenomena from the landscape to the stand scale. Remote sensing provides the most efficient tool available for determining landscape-scale elements of forest biodiversity, such as the relative proportion of matrix and patches and their physical arrangement. At intermediate scales, remote sensing provides an ideal tool for evaluating the presence of corridors and the nature of edges. At the stand scale, remote sensing technologies are likely to deliver an increasing amount of information about the structural attributes of forest stands, such as the nature of the canopy surface. the presence of layering within the canopy and presence of (very) coarse woody debris on the forest floor. Given the rate of development in the technology, even greater usage is likely in the future.

J	Prasad, SN				Prasad, SN			Conservation planning for the Western Ghats of Kerala: II. Assessment of habitat loss and degradation	CURRENT SCIENCE												Habitat change analyses for conservation planning in India were hampered by lack of efforts to utilize the existing spatial data. While, traditionally, most change analyses involving remote sensing data were of short term in nature (less than or equal to 10 years), the ecological history studies of long term (>10 years) were essentially nonspatial in nature, and have contributed little to site-specific explanation on dynamics of habitat loss and consequent impact on biodiversity. In this study, GIS tools are applied to analyse habitat loss, and transformation over a period of 30 years beginning late 1950s for Western Chats of Kerala, It is shown that over a thirty-year period the evergreen/semi-evergreen habitat has declined by 47% while the deciduous habitat has marginally increased by 7%. Landscape variables such as perimeter/area ratio were shown to be better indicators of habitat degradation rather than simple estimates of habitat loss. Attention is drawn to building a comprehensive data base for conservation planning.																	0011-3891					AUG 10	1998	75	3					228	235										WOS:000075560000020

Towards this, tools like Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) have been used for decision making and to derive meaningful outputs for plant resources conservation and management. The potential application of GIS is illustrated through various case studies ranging from development of Forest Resources Information System at divisional level to micro-level planning in Joint Forest Management areas.

However; its commonest application has been at the project level, where it fails to ensure adequate consideration of potentially serious trans-boundary, widespread, indirect, cumulative and synergistic ecological effects. The fact that ecological effects cannot be predicted or evaluated effectively if EIA is confined to single development actions and contrained by artificial boundaries is an important justification for moves towards the strategic application of EIA. The need for a more strategic approach to ecological assessment can be illustrated by reference to road development in the UK, where project-level EIA has failed to quantify the overall impact of new road development on biodiversity. Some form of strategic ecological assessment (SEcA) is required to ensure that proposed new road development is compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of EIA, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the availability, accuracy, reliability and resolution of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals. This paper summarizes the results of a SEcA carried out to determine whether currently proposed road developments, when considered collectively, would be compatible with the safeguard of an internationally important and protected wildlife habitat (lowland heathland) and associated protected species. The study was carried out using a version of the Countryside Information System developed for the UK Department of the Environment by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology. Areas of lowland heathland are identified together with 'hot spots' where two protected lowland heathland species (sand lizard, Lacerta agilis and the Dartford warbler; Sylvia undata also occur: Possible risks attributable to proposed new road development are quantified for I km squares and evaluated on a county basis.

Natural experiments with model systems can be a powerful complement to direct, manipulative experiments, especially where the processes that regulate biodiversity have no more than modest direct impacts on ecosystem function. Mangrove ecosystems on continental land masses and isolated islands offer unusual potential as natural experiments for biodiversity and ecosystem function studies, largely because sites with similar physical environments can have clear contrasts in the diversity of the dominant autotrophs. These contrasts provide a starting point for exploring the role of species diversity of higher plants in modulating biogeochemical functions (e.g. production, nutrient cycling), ecological functions (e.g. habitat for organisms in different tropic levels), and anthropogenic functions (e.g. maintenance of fisheries, management of sediments), on a range of time scales.

J	Holopainen, M; Wang, GX				Holopainen, M; Wang, GX			Accuracy of digitized aerial photographs for assessing forest habitats at plot level	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The objective of the present study was to determine the accuracy of digitized colour-infrared aerial photographs for predicting forest habitats defined by dominant tree species, stand age and ground vegetation in order to assess the structural diversity of forests. The solar direction and viewing angle at exposure time exert strong effects on illumination by causing a bidirectional reflectance effect. As a result, the same forest habitat will have totally different reflectance values, depending on its position in the photograph. Digital tone values were thus calibrated prior to the stratification, using empirical regression-calibration or rationing methods. Linear regression calibration to the principal-point level of the photographs, in which the mean pixel value was modelled as a function of sun and sensor position at the time of exposure, was shown to be the most effective method. The results showed that regression calibration significantly improved stratification accuracies. Separation of 12 habitat types was accomplished with 85.3% accuracy and 48 habitat types with 57.7% accuracy. The results also indicated that final stratification accuracy is very dependent on the prestratification needed, since the bidirectional reflectance effect in aerial photographs differs in various habitat types.																	0282-7581	1651-1891					1998	13	4					499	508		10.1080/02827589809383011								WOS:000077692600013						
J	Debinski, DM; Humphrey, PS				Debinski, DM; Humphrey, PS			An integrated approach to biological diversity assessment	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Although biodiversity assessment has become a topic of interest in the last decade, there are no specific guidelines as to how such assessments should be conducted, and the initiation of such projects can be a daunting task. The primary goal of most biodiversity assessments is to obtain species lists for the taxa of interest; but species lists are only a first step. Biodiversity assessments provide opportunities for monitoring community changes over time, prioritizing areas of conservation concern, and developing testable hypotheses relating patterns of geographic variation in species assemblages to selected environmental factors. If the data collected are to be useful for elucidating ecological relationships or monitoring trends over time, rigorous methods of sampling and analysis must be established. To aid managers, systematists, and ecologists in obtaining useful biodiversity data, we have described an integrated approach to biodiversity assessment. Our approach includes the use of species effort curves, Geographic Information Systems, remotely sensed data, and multivariate ordination techniques. We address selection of taxonomic groups, sampling replication, and the relative merits of presence/absence data and abundance data for terrestrial systems.

J	Holmgren, P; Thuresson, T				Holmgren, P; Thuresson, T			Applying objectively estimated and spatially continuous forest parameters in tactical planning to obtain dynamic treatment units	FOREST SCIENCE												Forestry planning is usually approached as the problem of combining and scheduling stand treatments, Stands are assumed to be homogeneous and spatially static and are usually delineated and described by subjective surveying methods. Because, in reality, stands vary internally, only subsets of the possible management alternatives will be considered in stand-based planning. As price expectations and other planning parameters change over time, it is likely that optimal locations, extensions, and schedules for forest operations change. This paper proposes a method whereby timber volumes and treatment priorities are estimated on objectively inventoried gee-referenced circular plots. Kriging interpolation and image analysis of scanned aerial photographs are then used to predict the variables in a spatially near-continuous raster. Treatment units are dynamically formed, based on price-expectations, and objectives defined by the forest owner. Given strategic goals, tactical plans are produced for two wood price situations, and compared with a plan based on conventional stands, The results imply that forest management planning should, perhaps, not be based on static stands if economic efficiency and planning flexibility are desirable.																	0015-749X					AUG	1997	43	3					317	326										WOS:A1997XQ40200002						
J	Menon, S; Bawa, KS				Menon, S; Bawa, KS			Applications of geographic information systems, remote-sensing, and a landscape ecology approach to biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats	CURRENT SCIENCE												The mountains along the west coast of peninsular India, the Western Ghats, constitute one of the unique biological regions of the world. Rapidly occurring land-cover and land-use change in the Western Ghats has serious implications for the biodiversity of the region. Both landscape changes as well as the distribution of biodiversity are phenomena with strong spatial correlates. Recent developments in remote-sensing technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow the use of a landscape ecology and spatial analysis approach to the problem of deforestation and biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats. Applications of this approach include analyses of land-cover and landuse change; estimation of deforestation rates and rates of forest fragmentation; examination of the spatial correlates of forest loss and the socioeconomic drivers of land-use change; modelling of deforestation; analysis of the consequences of land-cover and land-use change in the form of climate change and change in distribution of biodiversity; biomass estimation; gap analysis of the effectiveness of the protected area network in conserving areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; and conservation planning. We present examples from our work in the Western Ghats, in general, and in the Agastyamalai region and Biligiri Rangan Hills, in particular, as well as that of other researchers in India on various aspects of applications of GIS, remote sensing, and's landscape ecology approach to biodiversity conservation.

J	Stapanian, MA; Cassell, DL; Cline, SP				Stapanian, MA; Cassell, DL; Cline, SP			Regional patterns of local diversity of trees: Associations with anthropogenic disturbance	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We used a probability-based sampling scheme to survey the forested lands of 14 states in five regions in the US (California, Colorado, and parts of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast) from 1990 to 1993. Using a nationally consistent plot design, we evaluated the local diversity of trees over 2.5 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) at 780 1/15-ha plots nationwide by measuring the plot-level species richness (R). Visually evident anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. artificial regeneration, logging, grazing by livestock, and prescribed burning), if any, were recorded on each plot. We classified plots with visually evident anthropogenic disturbance as 'disturbed' and the remaining plots as 'undisturbed'. In each of the five geopolitical regions, we quantified the difference in mean R between disturbed and undisturbed plots. With the exception of Colorado (5%), between 34 and 55% of forested lands in each region had recorded anthropogenic disturbances. Mean R was significantly higher for undisturbed areas than for disturbed areas in the Northeast and Southeast, with the largest differences occurring in the Southeast. Mean R was greater in undisturbed areas than in disturbed areas in most forest cover types for all regions. These differences were greatest in the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.), and oak-pine forest types of the Southeast. The only group for which mean R was significantly greater in disturbed areas was the mixed western hardwoods in California. As expected from previous studies, significant differences between regions in mean R were observed, in both disturbed and undisturbed areas. This study bridges an important gap between site-specific forest studies and remote-sensing studies of the forests of a region. We discuss (1) why combining site-specific studies is not appropriate in most cases for rigorous testing at the regional level and (2) how data for some important site-specific variables are not available from most remotely-sensed data sets. The widespread presence of anthropogenic disturbances in most regions, notably the cutting and planting of pine plantations in the Southeast, is associated with generally lower local species richness of trees. The results warrant further investigation at the regional level in light of recent empirical studies on diversity and ecosystem stability. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Nohr, H; Jorgensen, AF				Nohr, H; Jorgensen, AF			Mapping of biological diversity in Sahel by means of satellite image analyses and ornithological surveys	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Through analysis of biological data and satellite images from the Ferlo region in Northern Senegal, the correlations between remote sensing data and biological diversity have been tested. Data on a number of biological and abiotic factors have been compared with different analyses of LANDSAT TM and NOAA satellite images. Biological diversity has mainly been measured through ornithological surveys in the dry seasons 1991-1993. Correlations are obtained between different measurements for avian diversity and the combination of a landscape diversity index based on a LANDSAT TM pixel analysis, and the yearly biomass production expressed by INDVI for the study areas (multivariable coefficient of determination r(2) ranging from 0.35 to 0.56). A multiple regression model, based on 10 different parameters from the study sites, can explain 59-68% of the variation in avian species richness, number of individuals and Simson diversity index. The following factors are significantly involved in explaining the model: latitude, LANDSAT TM landscape diversity indices, plant biomass, bare ground, herbaceous and woody vegetation. Explaining factors vary in relation to the avian parameter used in the model, but in general latitude (-), LANDSAT TM landscape diversity indices (+) and bare ground (+) are significant factors in all models. Based on the positive multivariable regression between avian diversity and features of LANDSAT TM and NOAA images, a biodiversity map has been produced for the Ferlo region. This map can be one layer of a future integrated conservation strategy for the Ferlo region. Limitations for the interpretation of the map, and recommendations for improvement of the data gathering and analyses in similar studies, are discussed.																	0960-3115					APR	1997	6	4					545	566		10.1023/A:1018333328680								WOS:A1997WV93800004

Our landscape data included a remote sensing derived map of the current habitat of the study area and six maps of future habitat distributions resulting from different land development scenarios. Our species data included lists of all bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species in the study area, their habitat associations, and area requirements for each. We estimated the area requirements using home ranges, sampled population densities, or genetic area requirements that incorporate dispersal distances. Our measures of biodiversity were species richness and habitat abundance. We calculated habitat abundance in two ways. First, we computed the total habitat area for each species in each landscape. Second, we calculated the number of habitat units for each species in each landscape by dividing the size of each habitat patch in the landscape by the area requirement and summing over all patches. Species richness was based on presence of habitat. Species became extinct in the landscape if they had no habitat area or no habitat units, respectively. We then computed ratios of habitat abundance in each future landscape to habitat abundance in the present for each species. We also computed the ratio of future to present species richness. We then calculated summary statistics across all species. Species richness changed little from present to future. There were distinctly greater risks to habitat abundance in landscapes that extrapolated from present trends of zoning patterns, however, as opposed to landscapes in which land development activities followed more constrained patterns. These results were stable when tested using Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity tests on the area requirements. We conclude that this methodology can begin to discriminate the effects of potential changes in land development on vertebrate biodiversity.

A pilot study using the NOAA-AVHRR remote sensing data	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The GAC (Global Area Coverage) by the NOAA-AVHRR satellites represents an excellent data set for studying global and regional patterns of variations in surface conditions driven in part by climatic variation, In this pilot study we examined whether biodiversity 'hotspots', defined from peak concentrations of neoendemics as well as geographically relict forms, differ in ecoclimatic stability from surrounding areas under present-day climatic conditions, Coefficients of variation of the ratio between brightness surface temperature (Ts) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based upon 10 years' monthly composited scenes of tropical Africa revealed distinctive geographical patterns of interannual variability in surface conditions, Regions with a predominance of old species are characterized by spatial uniformity in the ecoclimatic variability, while regions where rapidly radiating groups dominate are spatially complex in this respect. However, the exact 'hotspots', with peak concentrations of endemic species, are characterized by a local reduction in ecoclimatic variability, or placement on the boundary to a stable region. This relationship was supported statistically by comparing ecoclimatic profiles across montane forests representing 'hotspots', and those of other montane forests, It is suggested that, because of interactions between prevailing atmospheric flows, topography and vegetation, the impact of extreme weather is moderated locally. The correlation between current stability and aggregates of neoendemics as well as old relies indicate that local moderation of climatic extremes persist through shifting climatic periods, permitting populations of unique species to survive in these places. The results are used to identify study sites for better ground truthing and for paleoclimatological studies which may be useful for more thorough studies of these relationships.

Preliminary results indicate that the spectral response of corals can be determined up to a depth of 10 m. An accurate and replicable procedure is proposed to quantify the spectral response of various corals and other submerged substrates to determine biodiversity and stress indicators for mapping and assessing coral ecosystems at site-specific and regional locations. Applications of the approach in establishing baseline information, assessing environmental change and managing linked systems within an integrated coastal management framework are high-lighted.

The BirdLife Biodiversity project has mapped the distributions of all the world's restricted-range bird species and identified the areas where they are concentrated. Re-analysis of project data originally published in 1992 has led to the identification of 218 'Endemic Bird Areas' (EBAs), defined as areas supporting two or more species with ranges less than 50,000 km(2). Point locality data for a total of 2649 such restricted-range birds were mapped using GIS to identify these areas. A large series of regional maps and six tables present the project findings in outline, and details of revisions to the original analysis are provided. In total, EBAs occupy a mere 4.5% of the Earth's land surface, and contain 73% of all globally threatened birds; research to date indicates a high congruence of endemism between birds and other life-forms, so that it is reasonable to propose that EBAs should be used as guides to general centres of endemism. Identifying refugia, the use of GIS and remote sensing, and exchange of information between biogeographers are three ways to continue this work towards a global map of biodiversity.																	0960-7447					JUL-SEP	1996	5	4-5					281	304		10.2307/2997796								WOS:A1996VY33900010

Although forests dominate much of other regions of eastern Tennessee, this 15,000-ha tract of mostly natural forest habitat is unique in the southern Ridge and Valley physiographic province, which is otherwise widely developed for pasture, marginal cropland, woodlot, and urban uses. Twenty state-listed and federal-candidate plant species are known to be present on the ORR. This richness of species, which are provided protection by state and federal laws, exceeds that of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on a species area basis and is an index of the value of the ORR both regionally and nationally in conserving biodiversity. With the end of the Cold War, changing DoD and DOE missions combined with increasing development pressure contribute to uncertainty in the future management of security reservations.																	0364-152X					MAR-APR	1996	20	2					207	218		10.1007/BF01204005								WOS:A1996TZ62800005

A description of the grassland habitats and of the landscape as a function of the physical environment is performed. The agroecological approach, taking the diversity of farming practices into account, points out the effects of those practices on plant species richness and composition in different habitats. Field experiment on abandonment and extensification leads to new questions on their efficiency to restore floristic diversity. Remote sensing provides a global image of the region consistent with the previous approaches. In conclusion the authors emphasize the interdisciplinary and multi-level approach which is needed for a better assessment and management of grassland plant diversity at the regional scale.

J	Chatelain, C; Gautier, L; Spichiger, R				Chatelain, C; Gautier, L; Spichiger, R			A recent history of forest fragmentation in southwestern Ivory Coast	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												This study provides monitoring and spatial analysis of forest fragmentation based on high-resolution remote sensing, in order to give a framework for assessing residual biodiversity in the Guiglo-Tai region. Massive deforestation has taken place, mainly in the last 20 years, 79% of unprotected forests have been eliminated on the 100 X 100 km study area. Deforestation is also beginning to encroach on protected areas. Forest fragments are mainly found close to the deforestation front. In areas which were first deforested, forest fragments are very scarce and are restricted to less productive soils; they are often severely degraded. Young secondary forests develop on abandoned fields, but primary forest regeneration seems unlikely in light of the distance from seed sources and the increase in population pressure. Conservation initiatives in this zone of high biodiversity should focus on protected areas, taking into account short and long term benefits for the local population.																	0960-3115					JAN	1996	5	1					37	53		10.1007/BF00056291								WOS:A1996TW70400003

Vegetation richness and vegetation clustering showed a scare-dependent relationship to elevation across the range of quadrat sizes from 500 to 50,000 mi(2). All diversity measures increased east to west, with a rather abrupt transition at the Colorado Front Range. The longitudinal diversity gradients found in this study are in contrast to the reported latitudinal and longitudinal gradients for species diversity.																	0042-3106					AUG	1995	119	2					91	100		10.1007/BF00045592								WOS:A1995TA07700001

This research analyzes satellite imagery to compare patterns of land use among Bari settlements that differ in their population size, cattle holdings, and distance to nearest marketplace. These comparisons indicate that settlement history mediates the effect of population pressure and herd sizes on land use. Moreover, intensification of land use is associated with greater deforestation and a more heterogeneous landscape, but less biodiversity in woody species.																	0300-7839					SEP	1994	22	3					279	316		10.1007/BF02168854								WOS:A1994PZ90400003						
J	KRAUSE, DC; ANGEL, MV				KRAUSE, DC; ANGEL, MV			MARINE BIOGEOGRAPHY, CLIMATE-CHANGE AND SOCIETAL NEEDS	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Pelagic biogeography deals with the large scale distributional patterns of pelagic organisms in the world's oceans, their origins through evolution and the changes in ocean morphology during the geological past, and the factors which currently control and maintain them. The knowledge it generates has a wide variety of uses in science, both basic and applied, and in socio-economics. Its products include: (1) Distributional data compiled in data bases, maps and atlases; (2) Explanatory scientific and non-scientific publications on the distributions and their implications; (3) Standardisation of methodologies; (4) Trained specialists; (5) Advice to society on oceanic aspects of global resource management; and (6) Assessments of oceanic biodiversity in relation to the Biodiversity Convention. The immediate users of this knowledge include oceanographers in other disciplines, ecologists, applied scientists and engineers, resource managers, fishermen, environmentalists, teachers, international lawyers and policy-makers. At present the largest users are the natural resource managers seeking to optimise and to sustain the resource for which they are responsible. There is a considerable body of national and international legislation which is underpinned by biogeographical information. Similarly much of our understanding about past climate which is being used to predict future trends, is based on applying information on present-day distributional patterns to the interpretation of the fossil record in marine sediments. Global change, in the ocean, the atmosphere and on land, is strongly modulated by the feedback between marine organisms, nutrients and greenhouse gases, The marked coherence observed between the distributions of physical, chemical and biological patterns suggest that the processes involved in this feedback are linked with pelagic community structure. Remote sensing of sea-surface properties and the heat content of the mixed-layer, offer considerable potential for linking ecological and biogeographical processes to large scale features of ocean circulation and climatology. The long-term monitoring of the ocean in the Global Ocean Observing System will need to integrate physical, chemical and ecological data, if the models used to predict future change are to achieve adequate precision. The future use and resource management of the oceans has to involve biogeographical information. Traditional sampling methods, even when supplemented by large scale surveys such as CALCOFI and the Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys,will never provide sufficient data, so new techniques for intensive sampling and monitoring are being sought. Some surrogate measures such as chlorophyll fluorescence are already well established as standard oceanographic methodology; others involving acoustics and optical properties have the potential for sampling the biological characteristics at the same time/space scales as the physicochemical properties of the oceans are being studied. However, the calibration of these new techniques against traditional sampling and observational methods remains problematic. Information technology is beginning to be used, not only to unify the systematics of many taxonomic groups, but also to improve information exchange. Improvements in digital data bases will lead to freer exchange of information, and also facilitate the production of maps and interpretations customized for other users. The scientific resources being devoted to pelagic biogeography are declining with potentially serious consequences. This trend can only be reversed if the biogeographers themselves make their output more accessible and user-friendly for non-scientists, and take advantage of the new technologies which promise to re-vitalise the field.																	0079-6611						1994	34	2-3					221	235		10.1016/0079-6611(94)90010-8								WOS:A1994QB20400010

Remotely-sensed data provide a means to accomplish part of this task, but there has been no comprehensive scientific framework to guide its effective application. Here we propose a remote sensing research agenda designed to improve the quality and quantity of information available for testing scientific hypotheses, monitoring, and conservation planning. Biodiversity should be more fully incorporated into ongoing Earth system science and global change programmes, with remote sensing featured as a prominent data acquisition and analysis tool.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1993	14	10					1839	1860		10.1080/01431169308954007								WOS:A1993LR84800002

J	Westman, WE; Strong, LL; Wilcox, BA				Westman, Walter E.; Strong, Laurence L.; Wilcox, Bruce A.			Tropical deforestation and species endangerment: the role of remote sensing	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Initial results of a pilot study to link remotely-sensed information on tropical forest loss to field-based information on species endangerment are reported here. LANDSAT multispectral scanner (MSS) imagery from 1973 and 1988 were used to estimate net forest removal (29% of forest area), regrowth (7% of forest area, including possible artifactual errors), and forest edges in Mabira Forest in southeastern Uganda during the 15-year period. Of the forest remaining, the percentage that was heavily disturbed increased from 18% to 42%. This change in forest density was observable with the MSS imagery. The total forest edge-to-area ratio (including edges interior to the forest boundary) increased by 29% over the period. Although four distinct types of closed tropical forest, based on structure or dominance, could be recognized on the ground, the types could not be distinguished by differences in spectral reflectance in the four MSS bands. Closed tropical forest could be readily distinguished from exotic conifer plantations, banana plantations, and other non-forest vegetation types. Field measurements in Mabira and other Ugandan rain forests, and in rain forest isolates on the Atherton Tableland of North Queensland, are being made to relate changes in forest fragmentation to resulting changes in species abundance, structural form of the forests, and morphological diversity of target populations. Possible applications of conservation biology theory and modeling to these data are briefly discussed.																	0921-2973					DEC	1989	3	2					97	109		10.1007/BF00131173								WOS:000207944200004
