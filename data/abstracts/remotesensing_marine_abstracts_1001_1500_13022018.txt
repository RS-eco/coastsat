Fracture zones have variable influence on uplift of the Kamchatka Cape Peninsula. Relevant morphologic indicators of neotectonic activity are multilevel, highly uplifted marine terraces and terraces displaced along active faults. Recent uplift rates of coastal sediments are determined by remote sensing via ASTER and SRTM DEM combined with optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL). On the Kamchatka Cape Peninsula, terraces from the same generation are mapped at different elevations by remote sensing methods. After defining different areas of uplifted terraces, four neotectonic blocks are identified. According to apatite fission track data, the mean differential exhumation rates range from 0.2 to 1.2 mm year(-1) across the blocks since Late Miocene. The OSL data presented point to significant higher uplift rates of up to 3 +/- A 0.5 and 4.3 +/- A 1 mm year(-1), which indicates an acceleration of the vertical movement along the coast of Kamchatka Cape Peninsula in Upper Pleistocene and Holocene times.

Mapping sub-surface geostrophic currents from altimetry and a fleet of gliders	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Integrating the observations gathered by different platforms into a unique physical picture of the environment is a fundamental aspect of networked ocean observing systems. These are constituted by a spatially distributed set of sensors and platforms that simultaneously monitor a given ocean region. Remote sensing from satellites is an integral part of present ocean observing systems. Due to their autonomy, mobility and controllability, underwater gliders are envisioned to play a significant role in the development of networked ocean observatories. Exploiting synergism between remote sensing and underwater gliders is expected to result on a better characterization of the marine environment than using these observational sources individually. This study investigates a methodology to estimate the three dimensional distribution of geostrophic currents resulting from merging satellite altimetry and in situ samples gathered by a fleet of Slocum gliders. Specifically, the approach computes the volumetric or three dimensional distribution of absolute dynamic height (ADH) that minimizes the total energy of the system while being close to in situ observations and matching the absolute dynamic topography (ADT) observed from satellite at the sea surface. A three dimensional finite element technique is employed to solve the minimization problem. The methodology is validated making use of the dataset collected during the field experiment called Rapid Environmental Picture-2010 (REP-10) carried out by the NATO Undersea Research Center-NURC during August 2010. A marine region off-shore La Spezia (northwest coast of Italy) was sampled by a fleet of three coastal Slocum gliders. Results indicate that the geostrophic current field estimated from gliders and altimetry significantly improves the estimates obtained using only the data gathered by the glider fleet.

The case of nesting sea turtles in the Mediterranean	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Artificial night lights pose a major threat to multiple species. However, this threat is often disregarded in conservation management and action because it is difficult to quantify its effect. Increasing availability of high spatial-resolution satellite images may enable us to better incorporate this threat into future work, particularly in highly modified ecosystems such as the coastal zone. In this study we examine the potential of satellite night light imagery to predict the distribution of the endangered loggerhead (Caretta caretto) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtle nests in the eastern Mediterranean coastline. Using remote sensing tools and high resolution data derived from the SAC-C satellite and the International Space Station, we examined the relationship between the long term spatial patterns of sea turtle nests and the intensity of night lights along Israel's entire Mediterranean coastline. We found that sea turtles nests are negatively related to night light intensity and are concentrated in darker sections along the coast. Our resulting GLMs showed that night lights were a significant factor for explaining the distribution of sea turtle nests. Other significant variables included: cliff presence, human population density and infrastructure. This study is one of the first to show that night lights estimated with satellite-based imagery can be used to help explain sea turtle nesting activity at a detailed resolution over large areas. This approach can facilitate the management of species affected by night lights, and will be particularly useful in areas that are inaccessible or where broad-scale prioritization of conservation action is required.

Algorithm development for predicting biodiversity based on phytoplankton absorption	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Ocean color remote sensing has provided the scientific community with unprecedented global coverage of chlorophyll a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass. Together, satellite-derived chlorophyll a and knowledge of Phytoplankton Functional Types (PFTs) will improve our limited understanding of marine ecosystem responses to physiochemical climate drivers involved in carbon cycle dynamics and linkages. Using cruise data from the Gulf of Maine and the Middle Atlantic Bight (N = 269 pairs of HPLC and phytoplankton absorption samples), two modeling approaches were utilized to predict phytoplankton absorption and pigments. Algorithm I predicts the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient (a*(ph) (m(2) mg chl a(-1))) using inputs of temperature, light, and chlorophyll a. Modeled r(2) values (400-700 nm) ranged from 0.79 to 0.99 when compared to in situ observations with similar to 25% lower r(2) values in the UV region. Algorithm II-a utilizes matrix inversion analysis to predict a(ph)(m(-1), 400-700 nm) and r(2) values ranged from 0.89 to 0.99. The prediction of phytoplankton pigments with Algorithm II-b produced r(2) values that ranged from 0.40 to 0.93. When used in combination, Algorithm I, and Algorithm II-a are able to use satellite products of SST, PAR, and chlorophyll a (Algorithm I) to predict pigment concentrations and ratios to describe the phytoplankton community. The results of this study demonstrate that the spatial variation in modeled pigment ratios differ significantly from the 10-year SeaWiFS average chlorophyll a data set. Contiguous observations of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biodiversity will elucidate ecosystem responses with unprecedented complexity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Within the framework of the REBENT network, sediment characteristics, depth, and macrofaunal abundance were determined for 95 stations spread over five subtidal sectors, using a combination of seabed acoustic remote sensing systems and grab sampling. The physico-chemical properties of the water column and the hydrodynamic conditions were generated by validated three-dimensional environmental models which take into account variations over shorter temporal scales. Multivariate analyses ranked 16 natural abiotic variables according to the significance of their influence on the macrofauna. Together these variables explained 51% of spatial variation in the macrofauna, with morpho-sedimentological and hydrological factors contributing 22% and 26%, respectively. The outputs from validated three-dimensional environmental models appear to be useful interpretational tools for benthic ecology studies, especially in estuarine and coastal ecosystems with high environmental variability due to regular freshwater inputs. Ten major species assemblages were identified using biological and physical characteristics. The results provide important baseline knowledge for future ecosystem and resource management.

A new method to determine the direction of impact: Asymmetry of concentric impact craters as observed in the field (Lockne), on Mars, in experiments, and simulations	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Most impacts occur at an angle with respect to the horizontal plane. This is primarily reflected in the ejecta distribution, but at very low angle structural asymmetries such as elongation of the crater and nonradial development of the central peak become apparent. Unfortunately, impact craters with pristine ejecta layers are rare on Earth and also in areas with strong past or ongoing surface erosion on other planetary bodies, and the structural analysis of central peaks requires good exposures or even on-site access to outcrop. However, target properties are known to greatly influence the shape of the crater, especially the relatively common target configuration of a weaker layer covering a more rigid basement. One such effect is the formation of concentric craters, i.e., a nested, deeper, inner crater surrounded by a shallow, outer crater. Here, we show that with decreasing impact angle there is a downrange shift of the outer crater with respect to the nested crater. We use a combination of (1) field observation and published 3-D numerical simulation of one of the best examples of a terrestrial, concentric impact crater formed in a layered target with preserved ejecta layer: the Lockne crater, Sweden; (2) remote sensing data for three pristine, concentric impact craters on Mars with preserved ejecta layers further constraining the direction of impact; as well as (3) laboratory impact experiments, to develop the offset in crater concentricity into a complementary method to determine the direction of impact for layered-target craters with poorly preserved ejecta layers.

Retrospective satellite ocean color analysis of purposeful and natural ocean iron fertilization	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Significant effort has been invested in understanding the role of iron in marine ecosystems over the past few decades. What began as shipboard amendment experiments quickly grew into a succession of in situ, mesoscale ocean iron fertilization (OIF) experiments carried out in all three high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the world ocean. Dedicated process studies have also looked at regions of the ocean that are seasonally exposed to iron-replete conditions as natural OIF experiments. However, one problem common to many OIF experiments is determination of biological response beyond the duration of the experiment (typically < 1 month). Satellite-derived products have been used to address this shortcoming with some success, but thus far, have been limited snapshots of a single parameter, chlorophyll. Here, we investigate phytoplankton responses to OIF in both purposeful and naturally iron enriched systems using estimates of chlorophyll (Chl), phytoplanIcton carbon biomass (C-phyto), their ratio (Chl:C-phyto) and two fluorescence indices, fluorescence per unit chlorophyll (FLH:Chl) and the chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency (phi(f)). These quantities allow partitioning of the biological response to OIF into that due to changes in biomass and that due to phytoplankton physiology. We find that relative increases in Chl (similar to 10-20x) following OIF far exceed increases in C-phyto < 4-5x), suggesting that a significant fraction of the observed Chl increase is associated with physiological adjustment to increased growth rates, photoacclimation, and floristic shifts in the phytoplankton community. Further, a consistent pattern of decreased satellite fluorescence efficiency (FLH:Chl or phi(f)) following OIF is observed that is in agreement with current understanding of phytoplankton physiological responses to relief from iron stress. The current study extends our ability to retrieve phytoplankton physiology from space-based sensors, strengthens the link between satellite fluorescence and iron availability, and shows that satellite ocean color analyses provide a unique tool for monitoring OIF experiments.

The derived data represents significant inputs to population size estimation and study of animal-habitat interactions. One growing application is bird distributions and abundances in relation to EIAs for marine installations such as offshore wind farms and sea crossing transportation infrastructure. The ornithological surveys in relation to the EIA process concerning the Burbo Bank Extension and Walney Extension offshore wind farms that are being undertaken jointly by Aarhus University and BLOM-UK are an example of the former, with monthly surveys of two offshore areas (total area ca. 670 km(2)) in the Irish Sea. Image coverage comprises acquisition of 4 cm and 3 cm image data. Object based image analysis methods are used to localise marine birds. This paper describes the data processing and analysis procedures used. It presents examples of representations in these image data of five bird species. Examples of non-bird 'background' image patterns that can impact the bird localisation possibilities are presented along with developed countering-strategies. Results of initial assessments of levels of bird under-mapping by the OBIA method are given; the reported overall success level from 18 image frames with respect to under-mapping is over 92%.

Airborne remote sensing of coastal features and processes: an overview. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(2), 239-255. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Coastal ecosystems tend to be spatially complex and exhibit high temporal variability. Observing them requires the ability to monitor their biophysical features and controlling processes at high spatial and temporal resolutions, which can be provided by airborne remote sensors. High-resolution satellite data are now also available, yet the finer resolution and frequent, flexible overflights offered by airborne sensors can be more effective in a range of coastal research and management applications, such as wetlands mapping, coastal bathymetry, and tracking coastal plumes, salinity gradients, tidal fronts, and oil slicks. The airborne imagery is also useful for the interpretation of satellite data. This article reviews estuarine and coastal remote sensing applications that require the high spatial and temporal resolutions provided by airborne sensors.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2013	29	2					239	255		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00107.1								WOS:000316162400001

Possible return of Acropora cervicornis at Pulaski Shoal, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(2), 256-271. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Seabed classification is essential to assessing environmental associations and physical status in coral reef ecosystems. At Pulaski Shoal in Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida, nearly continuous underwater-image coverage was acquired in 15.5 hours in 2009 along 70.2 km of transect lines spanning similar to 0.2 km(2). The Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based, high-speed, digital imaging system, was used. ATRIS-derived benthic classes were merged with a QuickBird satellite image to create a habitat map that defines areas of senile coral reef, carbonate sand, seagrasses, and coral rubble. This atypical approach of starting with extensive, high-resolution in situ imagery and extrapolating between transect lines using satellite imagery leverages the strengths of each remote-sensing modality. The ATRIS images also captured the spatial distribution of two species once common on now-degraded Florida Caribbean coral reefs: the stony staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis, a designated threatened species, and the long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum. This article documents the utility of ATRIS imagery for quantifying number and estimating age of A. cervicornis colonies (n = 400, age range, 5-11 y) since the severe hypothermic die-off in the Dry Tortugas in 1976-77. This study is also the first to document the largest number of new colonies of A. cervicornis tabulated in an area of the park where coral-monitoring stations maintained by the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute have not been established. The elevated numbers provide an updated baseline for tracking revival of this species at Pulaski Shoal.																	0749-0208					MAR	2013	29	2					256	271		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00078.1								WOS:000316162400002

Offshore and onshore seepage of thermogenic gas at Katakolo Bay (Western Greece)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Considerable seepage of natural gas occurs throughout the Katakolo Bay, both at sea and on land, along the Ionian coast of Peloponnesus (Western Greece). Explosive levels of CH4 and toxic concentrations of H2S accumulating in the ground, pose a severe hazard for humans and tourist infrastructures. A wide offshore and onshore gas survey, including marine remote sensing, underwater exploration by a towed instrumented system, compositional and isotopic analyses, and flux measurements of gas, allowed us to assess that: (a) gas seepage takes place along two main normal faults; (b) offshore side-scan sonographs recorded at least 823 gas bubble plumes over an area of 94,200 m(2), at depths ranging from 5.5 to 16 m; (c) offshore and onshore seeps release the same type of thermogenic gas (delta C-13(CH4)similar to-34 to -36 parts per thousand); (d) offshore gas showed increased stable carbon isotopic ratio of CO2 and propane, which suggests enhanced biodegradation of hydrocarbons; (e) isotopic data combined with thermogenic gas generation modeling and maturity plots, suggest that the gas is related to a deep Petroleum System with Jurassic carbonate reservoirs, Triassic source rocks, and Triassic evaporites; (f) H2S (delta S-34: +2.4 parts per thousand) is produced by thermochemical sulfate reduction in deep anhydrites, in contact with hydrocarbon-rich carbonates; (g) due to the shallow depth, more than 90% of CH4 released at the seabed enters the atmosphere, consistent with theoretical bubble dissolution models, with a mean plume output of 0.12 kg d(-1); total offshore CH4 output was estimated in the range of 33 to 120 t y(-1); and (h) in the onshore area at least 50 gas vents in the harbor and a large seep on the adjacent Faros hill, emit in total about 89 t CH4 y(-1).

As such, there is a clear need to map biodiversity at high spatial resolutions across large areas. Airborne and spaceborne optical remote sensing is a potential tool to provide such biodiversity data. The spectral variation hypothesis (SVH) predicts a positive correlation between spectral variability (SV) of a remotely sensed image and biodiversity. The SVH has only been tested on a few terrestrial plant communities. Our study is the first attempt to apply the SVH in the marine environment using hyperspectral imagery recorded by Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). All coverage-based diversity measures of benthic macrophytes and invertebrates showed low but statistically significant positive correlations with SV whereas the relationship between biomass-based diversity measures and SV were weak or lacking. The observed relationships did not vary with spatial scale. SV had the highest independent effect among predictor variables in the statistical models of coverage-derived total benthic species richness and Shannon index. Thus, the relevance of SVH in marine benthic habitats was proved and this forms a prerequisite for the future use of SV in benthic biodiversity assessments.

To evaluate the potential utility of bathymetric LiDAR for applications of this kind, we compared detailed surveys collected using wading and sonar techniques with measurements from the United States Geological Survey's hybrid topographic/bathymetric Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR (EAARL). These comparisons, based upon data collected from the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, California, and the Colorado River, Colorado, demonstrated that environmental conditions and postprocessing algorithms can influence the accuracy and utility of these surveys and must be given consideration. These factors can lead to mapping errors that can have a direct bearing on derivative analyses such as hydraulic modeling and habitat assessment. We discuss the water and substrate characteristics of the sites, compare the conventional and remotely sensed river-bed topographies, and investigate the laser waveforms reflected from submerged targets to provide an evaluation as to the suitability and accuracy of the EAARL system and associated processing algorithms for riverine mapping applications.

Monitoring estuarine water quality using satellite imagery. The Mondego river estuary (Portugal) as a case study	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Monitoring water bodies is a task not only scientifically relevant but also legally binding in several countries (e.g. Water Framework Directive and the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive). Ecosystem health assessment projects are greatly enhanced by the use of remote sensing technologies. In the present study, a small Portuguese estuary (Mondego river estuary), was used as a case study to assess the feasibility of measuring several key indicators using satellite imagery. The feasibility of using MODIS land/cloud bands to evaluate Secchi Disk Depth (SD) was addressed. The ratio of remote sensing reflectance at 469 and 555 nm was the best predictor for this parameter (R-2 = 0.9678; p < 0.05). Landsat-7 ETM+ was, in turn, used to estimate Chlorophyll-a concentration (OC), Turbidity and Salinity. Reflectance values were compared with concurrent in situ data recorded by an automatic sampling buoy. ETM-F data was also used to develop a local water color index, which takes advantage of the relative differences in the reflectance values of the three bands in the visible range of the spectrum. Overall, remote sensing data yielded robust estimates of the selected indicators, favoring its future operational use in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The averaged percent errors were 33. 8%, 20. 27. 7%, 37. 5%, 9. 5% and 10. 8% for the total absorption coefficients at 412, 440, 510, 555, 650 and 676 nm bands respectively. The main error sources of model were the uncertainty of the model parameters and measurement errors. According to the discussion, the spectral slope S has a slight influence on the retrieval of total absorption coefficients. However, the impact of the spectral power Y on the retrieval cannot be negligible. The model is suitable for hyperspectral data and can fulfill the gaps of inherent optical properties retrieval research in the Bohai Sea, so it can be used for hyperspectral remote sensing data to retrieve inherent optical properties.																	1000-0593					FEB	2013	33	2					498	501		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2013)02-0498-04								WOS:000314675100047

Thus, shadows are an important scene type that should be identified and excluded from the set of clear-sky pixels. In this paper, we present an optical cloud shadow-detection technique called the Cloud Shadow Detection Index (CSDI). This approach is for homogeneous water bodies such as deep waters where shadow detection is very challenging due to the relatively small differences in the brightness values of the shadows and neighboring sunlit or some other regions. The CSDI technique is developed based on the small differences between the total radiances reaching the sensor from the shadowed and neighboring sunlit regions of similar optical properties by amplifying the differences through integrating the spectra of the two regions. The Integrated Value (IV) is then normalized by the mean of the IVs within a spatial adaptive sliding box where atmospheric and marine optical properties are assumed homogeneous. Assuming that the true color and the IV images represent accurate shadow locations, the results were visually compared. The CSDI images agree reasonably well with the corresponding true color and the IV images over open ocean. Also, the shape of the cloud shadow particularly for the isolated cloud closely follows that of the cloud, as expected, reconfirming the potential of the CSDI technique.																	0196-2892					FEB	2013	51	2					732	741		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2204267								WOS:000314019500002

Assessing vulnerability due to sea-level rise in Maui, Hawai'i using LiDAR remote sensing and GIS	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Sea-level rise (SLR) threatens islands and coastal communities due to vulnerable infrastructure and populations concentrated in low-lying areas. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data were used to produce high-resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Model) for Kahului and Lahaina, Maui, to assess the potential impacts of future SLR. Two existing LiDAR datasets from USACE (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) were compared and calibrated using the Kahului Harbor tide station. Using tidal benchmarks is a valuable approach for referencing LiDAR in areas lacking an established vertical datum, such as in Hawai'i and other Pacific Islands. Exploratory analysis of the USACE LiDAR ground returns (point data classified as ground after the removal of vegetation and buildings) indicated that another round of filtering could reduce commission errors. Two SLR scenarios of 0.75 (best-case) to 1.9 m (worst-case) (Vermeer and Rahmstorf Proc Natl Acad Sci 106:21527-21532, 2009) were considered, and the DEMs were used to identify areas vulnerable to flooding. Our results indicate that if no adaptive strategies are taken, a loss ranging from $18.7 million under the best-case SLR scenario to $296 million under the worst-case SLR scenario for Hydrologically Connected (HC; marine inundation) and Hydrologically Disconnected (HD; drainage problems due to a higher water table) areas combined is possible for Kahului; a loss ranging from $57.5 million under the best-case SLR scenario to $394 million under the worst-case SLR scenario for HC and HD areas combined is possible for Lahaina towards the end of the century. This loss would be attributable to inundation between 0.55 km(2) to 2.13 km(2) of area for Kahului, and 0.04 km(2) to 0.37 km(2) of area for Lahaina.																	0165-0009					FEB	2013	116	3-4					547	563		10.1007/s10584-012-0510-9								WOS:000313737100006

The Persian Gulf, as one of the warmest seas, has also experienced coral mortalities and bleaching events. Historically, bleaching events are known to occur south of the Persian Gulf, such information is scarce in the northern side. Perhaps remoteness and inaccessibility to Iran main coral communities which have developed on offshore islands can explain such lack of data. To address this issue, the feasibility of using multi-temporal satellite images for detecting past bleaching events were investigated. Two QuickBird images (2005, 2008) were selected to detect 2007 bleaching event at Kish Island, Iran, and the accuracy of results were compared to in situ observations. Current study might represent "algae-challenged" scenario in terms of having 7 months' time lapse between bleaching event and post-bleaching satellite image. As a result of this, we had algae-covered corals instead of white bleached corals. In the proposed procedure pre and post-bleaching images were classified, and changes in reflectance values within coral classes were interpreted as bleaching areas. By using this method we could eliminate the effect of miss-classification between bleached corals and sand; as well as algae-covered corals and live corals. Furthermore, it is not necessary to have a post-bleaching image acquired during bleaching events, although having such image will increase the accuracy. The proposed technique detected similar to 28% of bleached corals and the results support the idea that coral bleaching can be distinguished by detecting the changes in reflectance values in pre and post-bleaching images. Understanding the occurrence, severity, and extent of past bleaching events may help us understand the population dynamics of Iran corals and reveal coral connectivity patterns in the Persian Gulf.

J	Yang, Q; Stramski, D; He, MX				Yang, Qian; Stramski, Dariusz; He, Ming-Xia			Modeling the effects of near-surface plumes of suspended particulate matter on remote-sensing reflectance of coastal waters	APPLIED OPTICS												A radiative transfer model was applied to examine the effects of vertically stratified inherent optical properties of the water column associated with near-surface plumes of suspended particulate matter on spectral remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), of coastal marine environments. The simulations for nonuniform ocean consisting of two layers with different concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) are compared with simulations for a reference homogeneous ocean whose SPM is identical to the surface SPM of the two-layer cases. The near-surface plumes of particles are shown to exert significant influence on R-rs(lambda). The sensitivity of R-rs(lambda) to vertical profile of SPM is dependent on the optical beam attenuation coefficient within the top layer, c(1)(lambda), thickness of the top layer, z(1), and the ratio of SPM in the underlying layer to that in the top layer, SPM2/SPM1, as well as the wavelength of light, lambda. We defined a dimensionless spectral parameter, P(lambda) = c(1)(lambda) x z(1) x (SPM2/SPM1), to quantify and examine the effects of these characteristics of the two-layer profile of SPM on the magnitude and spectral shape of R-rs(lambda). In general, the difference of R-rs(lambda) between the two-layer and uniform ocean decreases to zero with an increase in P(lambda). For the interpretation of ocean color measurements of water column influenced by near-surface plumes of particles, another dimensionless parameter P'(lambda) was introduced, which is a product of terms representing homogenous ocean and a change caused by the two-layer structure of SPM. Based on the analysis of this parameter, we found that for the two-layer ocean there is a good relationship between R-rs(lambda) in the red and near-infrared spectral regions and the parameters describing the SPM(z) profile, i.e., SPM1, SPM2, and z(1).

By using the Remote Sensing Axis Line method (RSAL), the Axis lines of Xiaomiaohong creek were extracted based on one MSS image and six TM images in the period of 1979, 1987, 1989, 1993, 1995, 2003 and 2009. The results showed that: (1) on the basis of overlaying generated axis line and DEM (digital elevation model) data both acquired in 2003, axis line can be the substitution of the thalweg line because of similar trend and minor deviation of above two kinds of lines, which is revealed that RSAL was serviceable and effective to understand dynamic evolution of tidal creeks quickly and accurately; (2) deviation between axis line and thalweg line is inevitable because of the slopes of both side is asymmetric. The biased distance depended on the slope degree of creeks. The much larger slope degree is, the further distance is shifted; (3) from 1979 to 2009, the front end of Xiaomiaohong creek were growing and its subordinate branches were eroding. Some new subordinate branches were turned out and developed in southern part caused by the strong hydrodynamic condition. Based on the comparison, the entire tidal creek was relatively stable.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-857-8				2013	405-408						3061	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.405-408.3061								WOS:000339463301250

Effective oil spill detection and monitoring are the basis for the rapid response and play an important role. Due to its all-weather, day and night detection, wide coverage, and real-time monitoring capability, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the most applicable sensors for marine oil spill monitoring and detection. Radar detection of target always uses back scattering of its reaction. After the oil spills, oil slicks spread to the sea surface dampen the Bragg waves and reduce radar backscattering coefficients; that is, smooth the sea surface. So oil spills appear as dark areas in the SAR images. The critical part of the oil spill detection is to distinguish oil spills from other natural phenomena. Low wind speed areas, internal waves, biogenic films and so on can lead to this phenomenon, which are called " lookalikes". Based on the principle of oil spill detection using SAR images, analysis accomplished over ENVISAT ASAR data gathered in the Gulf of Mexico and related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill accident, which happened on April 20, 2010, is mentioned in this paper. The main areas of interest related to such disaster are the following: 1) to detect oil spills at sea and 2) analyze changes of oil slicks over the sea. In order to achieve the proposed goal, the method consists of three steps: preprocessing, detection of dark spots and analysis. Firstly, the SAR data are pre-processed, including histogram equalization, geometric correction and speckle filtering. Enhanced Lee filter is used to reduce the speckle noise due to the good capability in noise suppression and edge preserving. Secondly, SAR image classification and oil spill identification are carried out. Because of dark patches in SAR images cause by other natural phenomena, the purpose of the classifier is to distinguish oil spills from look-alikes. So the object-based classification is applied with support vector machine (SVM) owing to a better effect for oil spill identification. Last but not the least, based on the results of oil spill exaction and polluted areas, the development process of Deepwater Horizon oil spill is analyzed, such as the temporal dispersion scope, diffusion and drift of the oil slick. In addition, oil spill area is calculated for area variation tendency. At the early stage of this accident, shapes of oil slicks mainly appear as patches. As time passed by, quite a few parts of oil slicks showed as stripes. Oil slick shape and position were affected by winds, ocean currents and so on. During the middle or later period, a portion of oil slick eroded the coasts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida. In the early days of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the size of oil slicks presented the tendency of increasing as a whole and reached a peak in June. However, after July, areas of oil slicks began to fall. Relevant reports such as weather and plugging are also attached, which indicate analysis and reports are in accordance.																	2161-024X						2013																		WOS:000339361500147

From their morphology and spatial distribution, authors are able to characterize a singular event in terms of intensity (wave height, flow velocity). Recent post-catastroph studies (e.g. Indian Ocean 2004 and Japan 2011 tsunamis) have demonstrated also the interest of boulder deposits in reconstructing the event kinematics through a multi-proxy approach. But as boulder studies require a statistically robust dataset they are field-time consuming and sometimes fieldwork takes place in remote areas with low facilities. The use of very high resolution remote sensing could overcome some of these limits. In this paper, we evaluate the possibility to identify meter-size coral boulder thrown on a reef flat during the hit of a tropical cyclone. Image analysis allows for the discrimination of major geographical object encountered on coralline islands: submerged coral boulder, emerged coral boulder, perched reef, sand beach. Within emerged boulder population, specific bands available with WorldView-2 images (i.e. red and NIR2 band) allow the spectral discrimination and mapping of fresh and weathered elements.

The system consists of a marine sediment microbial fuel cell (MFC) and the associated power management system. The MFC exploits bacterial metabolic activities associated with the redox reaction to generate electrical energy directly from biodegradable substrates. The power management circuit collects the energy harvested by the MFC and boosts the output voltage to a sufficient and stable level for loads such as sensor devices. Simulation results of the power management integrated circuit in a 90nm CMOS process demonstrate the expected functions and the significant improvement in energy conversion efficiency.

It is especially sensitive to the scattering coefficient, which cannot be retrieved from the unpolarized light used in current ocean color remote sensing algorithms. Through the unpolarized remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), these classical algorithms can only estimate backscattering coefficients bb, but the total scattering coefficient b could be solely retrieved based on the characteristics of polarized light. The correlation is quantified in this paper. Based on extensive simulations using the vector radiative transfer program RayXP, the attenuation-to-absorption ratio (c/a), from which b is readily computed, is shown to be closely related to the degree of linear polarization (DoLP). The relationship is investigated for the upwelling polarized light for several wavelengths in the visible part of the spectrum, for a complete set of viewing geometries, and for varying concentrations of phytoplankton, non-algal particles, and color dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the aquatic environment. It is shown that there is an excellent correlation between the DoLP and c/a for a wide range of viewing geometries. That correlation is investigated theoretically using fitting techniques, which show that it depends not only on the general composition of water but also on the particle size distribution (PSD) of the (mainly non-algal) particles. A large dataset of Stokes components for various water compositions, measured in the field with a hyperspectral and multi-angular polarimeter, then provides the opportunity to validate the parameterized relationship between DOLP and c/a. This study opens the possibility for the retrieval of additional inherent optical properties (IOPs)from air-or space-borne DoLP measurements of the ocean.

Recovering an image from its samples implies applying a low pass filter which would present some distortion in the wave spectrum. In this paper, a new approach to acquire the wave spectrum with minimal distortion is proposed. The basic idea is to avoid the whole scan conversion stage and apply a Fourier transform directly on B-scan images. Of course, the regular Fourier transform cannot help here. Therefore, a new Fourier-like transform, referred to as the polar Fourier transform, is adopted in order to generate the power spectrum. The new Fourier transform represents an image in terms of cylindrical waves rather than plane waves as in the regular Fourier transform. Results show the potential of the proposed polar Fourier transform to estimate the wave spectrum without using scan conversion.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-0000-8; 978-1-4799-0002-2				2013																		WOS:000335313100237

The main purpose of the planned open-ocean infrastructure FRAM (FRontiers in Arctic marine Monitoring) is permanent presence at sea, from surface to depth, for the provision of near real-time data on climate variability and ecosystem change in a marine Arctic system. The Alfred-Wegener-Institut - Helmholtz-Zentrum fur Polar- und Meeresforschung (AWI), together with partner institutes in Germany and Europe, aims at providing such infrastructure for the polar ocean as a major contribution to the grand challenges of Earth observation and environmental status. The FRAM Ocean Observing System targets the gateway between the North Atlantic and the Central Arctic, representing a highly climate-sensitive and rapidly changing region of the Earth system. It will serve national and international tasks towards a better understanding of the effects of change in ocean circulation, water mass properties and sea-ice retreat on Arctic marine ecosystems and their main functions and services. FRAM will implement existing and next-generation sensors and observatory platforms, allowing synchronous observation of relevant ocean variables, as well as the study of physical, chemical and biological processes in the water column and at the seafloor. Experimental and event-triggered platforms will complement observational platforms. Products of the infrastructure are continuous long-term data with appropriate resolution in space and time, as well as ground-truthing information for ocean models and remote sensing. FRAM will integrate and develop already existing observatories, i.e. the oceanographic mooring array HAFOS (Hybrid Arctic/Antarctic Float Observing System) and the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site HAUSGARTEN.

It is determined that the sea surface temperature scope of high squid fisheries is 10 similar to 22 degrees C, and the appropriate temperature is 18 similar to 20 degrees C. The chlorophyll density of squid fish is approximately 0.02 similar to 0.40mg/m(3). The frequency is the highest when the chlorophyll density is between 0.08 similar to 0.24 mg/m(3). GAM module analysis indicates that neon flying squid the relation of the entertainment factor and north feeding migration every June to August and South action every October to November has different features. There is a positive con-elation between SST and neon flying squid catch while north feeding migration. It is a negative correlation while going south. And there is a good correspondence between the distribution of chlorophyll and the distribution of the fish catch of core fishery. Fish catch doesn't has great change as with longitude, but it correspond well with the latitude.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7				2013	726-731						4604	4609		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.4604								WOS:000333767501403

This has led to new paradigms in scientific discovery. The combination of agility, reactivity, and persistent presence makes autonomous robots ideal for targeted sampling of elusive, episodic events such as algal blooms. In order to achieve this goal, they need to be deployed at the right place and time. To that end, we have designed and will soon deploy a shore-based event recognition technology to continuously monitor remote sensing imagery for algal blooms as targets for robotic field experiments. A Support Vector Machine underlies a field-tested decision support system which scientists will consult prior to deploying robots in the coastal ocean. Our aim is to target oceanographic field experiments for evaluation and verification.																	2153-0858		978-1-4673-6358-7				2013							3362	3367										WOS:000331367403064

A multi-sensor approach for remotely modeling and mapping sediment properties	2013 IEEE/OES ACOUSTICS IN UNDERWATER GEOSCIENCES SYMPOSIUM (RIO ACOUSTICS 2013)					IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)	JUL 24-26, 2013	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE, OES				Detailed information about the oceanic environment is essential for many applications in the field of marine geology, marine biology, coastal engineering, and marine operations. Especially, knowledge of the sediment properties is often required. Acoustic remote sensing techniques have become highly attractive for classifying the sea bottom and mapping the distribution of sediment properties, due to their high coverage capabilities and low costs compared to common sampling methods. In 2007, the Maritime Rapid Environmental Assessment /Blue Planet trial (MREA/BP'07) was carried out in a shallow water environment with fine-grained sediments in the Mediterranean Sea, in order to investigate means of efficiently obtaining a detailed picture of the underwater environment [1]. Measurements were taken by a large set of sensors, including echosounders, seismic systems, and dedicated array configurations, thereby providing all information required to fully describe the environment. Since these systems operate at different frequencies, they provide information on the sea bottom at different depths. This gave reason for a combination of the acoustic data as taken by the different sensors. Especially, the combination of the classification of the upper sediment layer achieved by the hydrographic surveying and the sediment layering obtained from the seismic systems resulted in a well-described three-dimensional picture of the distribution of the underwater sediments [2]. In this paper we present this environmental picture in the context of geoacoustic inversion. Geoacoustic inversion techniques are an attractive means for estimating a variety of physical properties of underwater environments, such as sound speed, density, and attenuation in each sediment layer, as well as layer thicknesses. Geoacoustic inversion, however, comes at the price of high computational efforts. Especially, in cases in which large numbers of parameters need to be inverted for, finding those parameters that provide the best fit between the measurements and model predictions requires hundreds of iterations. Efficient global optimization tools can reduce these efforts. We propose that both the surveying and inversion efforts can be reduced further by carrying out geoacoustic inversion at a small number of selected sites, only. In this paper it is investigated whether a combination of hydrographic and seismic surveying is suitable for selecting areas for sub-seafloor sediment classification by geoacoustic inversion techniques.																			978-1-4799-0362-7				2013																		WOS:000330575600044

The model used the median filtering, zero pixels elimination, image normalization, nonlinear transformation, and brought in the law of gravity. The research was upon two oil spill incidents which occurred on the Mediterranean Sea in 2004 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2006. Based on the MODIS remote sensing data, we executed the model to detect the two incidents and compared the results with the results of Sobel detection algorithm. The experimental results illustrated that the model introduced in this paper is superior to Sobel detection algorithm. The proposed model is powerful in oil spill detection.																	0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-642-41184-7; 978-3-642-41183-0				2013	8157						703	710										WOS:000329811200071

MEDSLIK-II, a Lagrangian marine surface oil spill model for short-term forecasting - Part 2: Numerical simulations and validations	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												In this paper we use MEDSLIK-II, a Lagrangian marine surface oil spill model described in Part 1 (De Dominicis et al., 2013), to simulate oil slick transport and transformation processes for realistic oceanic cases, where satellite or drifting buoys data are available for verification. The model is coupled with operational oceanographic currents, atmospheric analyses winds and remote sensing data for initialization. The sensitivity of the oil spill simulations to several model parameterizations is analyzed and the results are validated using surface drifters, SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and optical satellite images in different regions of the Mediterranean Sea. It is found that the forecast skill of Lagrangian trajectories largely depends on the accuracy of the Eulerian ocean currents: the operational models give useful estimates of currents, but high-frequency (hourly) and high-spatial resolution is required, and the Stokes drift velocity has to be added, especially in coastal areas. From a numerical point of view, it is found that a realistic oil concentration reconstruction is obtained using an oil tracer grid resolution of about 100 m, with at least 100 000 Lagrangian particles. Moreover, sensitivity experiments to uncertain model parameters show that the knowledge of oil type and slick thickness are, among all the others, key model parameters affecting the simulation results. Considering acceptable for the simulated trajectories a maximum spatial error of the order of three times the horizontal resolution of the Eulerian ocean currents, the predictability skill for particle trajectories is from 1 to 2.5 days depending on the specific current regime. This suggests that re-initialization of the simulations is required every day.

Evaluation of ocean color data processing schemes for VIIRS sensor using in-situ data of coastal AERONET-OC sites	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2013	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24, 2013	Dresden, GERMANY	SPIE				In the processing of Ocean Color (OC) data from sensor data recorded by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard JPSS-Suomi satellite, NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) is deriving a continuous temporal calibration based on the on-board calibration measurements for the visible bands, and then reprocessing the full mission to produce a continuously calibrated sensor data record (SDR) product. In addition, a vicarious calibration during SDR to OC Level-2 processing is applied. In the latest processing the vicarious calibration is derived from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) data, whereas in the initial processing it was derived from a sea surface reflectance model and a climatology of chlorophyll-a concentration. Furthermore, NASA has recently reprocessed the OC data for the entire VIIRS mission with lunar-based temporal calibration and updated vicarious gains. On the other hand, in fulfilling the mission of the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS) developed by Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems, for the processing of the environmental data products from sensor data records, has gained beta status for evaluation. As these processing schemes continue to evolve, monitoring the validity and assessments of the related VIIRS ocean color products are necessary, especially for coastal waters, to evaluate the consistency of these processing and calibration schemes. The ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) has been designed to support long-term satellite ocean color investigations through cross-site measurements collected by autonomous multispectral radiometer systems deployed above water. As part of this network, the Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory (LISCO) near New York City and WaveCIS in the Gulf of Mexico expand those observational capabilities with continuous monitoring as well as (for the LISCO site) additional assessment of the hyper-spectral properties of coastal waters. In the investigations carried out over a one and half year period dataset of VIIRS, based on the data from two coastal AERONET-OC sites, it has been observed that the VIIRS sensor captures well the seasonal and temporal variations in the nLw data, exhibiting significant correlation with in-situ data (R = 0.929 and 0.985 for LISCO and WaveCIS respectively). For the WaveCIS site, VIIRS nLw data retrievals are seen to be enhanced with each incremental adjustments of vicarious and calibration procedures. However, that is not the case for the LISCO site which exhibits more frequent occurrences of negative water-leaving radiances, while underestimation in VIIRS nLw data is further exacerbated. Strong consistency between the time-series nLw data retrieved from the VIIRS and MODIS sensors was also observed.

Improved exploration of fishery resources through the integration of remotely sensed merged Sea level anomaly, Chlorophyll concentration, and Sea surface temperature	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2013	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24, 2013	Dresden, GERMANY	SPIE				The capabilities of evolving satellite remote sensing technology, combined with conventional data collection techniques, provide a powerful tool for efficient and cost effective management of living marine resources. Fishes are the valuable living marine resources producing food, profit and pleasure to the human community. Variations in oceanic condition play a role in natural fluctuations of fish stocks. The Satellite Altimeter derived Merged Sea Level Anomaly(MSLA) results in the better understanding of ocean variability and mesosclae oceanography and provides good possibility to reveal the zones of high dynamic activity. This study comprised the synergistic analysis of signatures of SEAWIFS derived chlorophyll concentration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer(NOAA-AVHRR) derived Sea Surface Temperature and the monthly Merged Sea Level Anomaly data derived from Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1 and ERS-1 Altimeters for the past 7 years during the period from 1998 to 2004. The overlapping Chlorophyll, SST and MSLA were suggested for delineating Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs). The Chlorophyll and SST data set were found to have influenced by short term persistence from days to week while MSLA signatures of respective features persisted for longer duration. Hence, the study used Altimeter derived MSLA as an index for long term variability detection of fish catches along with Chlorophyll and SST images and the maps showing PFZs of the study area were generated. The real time Fishing statistics of the same duration were procured from FSI Mumbai. The catch contours were generated with respect to peak spectra of chlorophyll variation and trough spectra of MSLA and SST variation. The vice-a-versa patterns were observed in the poor catch contours. The Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) for each fishing trail was calculated to normalize the fish catch. Based on the statistical analysis the actual CPUEs were classified at each probable MSLA depth zones and plotted on the same images.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9757-4				2013	8888								UNSP 888805	10.1117/12.2029016								WOS:000328345700004

Distribution of phytoplankton functional types in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll waters in a new diagnostic ecological indicator model	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Modeling and monitoring plankton functional types (PFTs) is challenged by the insufficient amount of field measurements of ground truths in both plankton models and bio-optical algorithms. In this study, we combine remote sensing data and a dynamic plankton model to simulate an ecologically sound spatial and temporal distribution of phyto-PFTs. We apply an innovative ecological indicator approach to modeling PFTs and focus on resolving the question of diatom-coccolithophore coexistence in the subpolar high-nitrate and low-chlorophyll regions. We choose an artificial neural network as our modeling framework because it has the potential to interpret complex nonlinear interactions governing complex adaptive systems, of which marine ecosystems are a prime example. Using ecological indicators that fulfill the criteria of measurability, sensitivity and specificity, we demonstrate that our diagnostic model correctly interprets some basic ecological rules similar to ones emerging from dynamic models. Our time series highlight a dynamic phyto-PFT community composition in all high-latitude areas and indicate seasonal coexistence of diatoms and coccolithophores. This observation, though consistent with in situ and remote sensing measurements, has so far not been captured by state-of-the-art dynamic models, which struggle to resolve this "paradox of the plankton". We conclude that an ecological indicator approach is useful for ecological modeling of phytoplankton and potentially higher trophic levels. Finally, we speculate that it could serve as a powerful tool in advancing ecosystem-based management of marine resources.

Globe model become a hotspot in the area of GIS research presently. It is a useful platform for integration and sharing of spatial information with its strong abilities of spatial data management and visualization. In this paper, Multi-resolution remote sensing imagery and DEM of terrain is implemented with LOD based on Globe Model. A numerical simulation result of PL19-3 oil spill based on General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) is visualized using particle trace and analysed on the globe model.

As a result, marine oil pollution has caused huge economic losses. The remote sensing sensors can detect and record the spectral information of sea film and background seawater. Here we chose to use 250-resolution MODIS data in the area of Dalian Xingang, China where ill spill case was happened on April. 4th, 2005. Based on the image pre-processing and enhanced image processing, the spectral features of different bands were analyzed. More obvious characteristics of the spectral range of film was obtained. The oil-water contrast was calculated to evaluate the feature of oil at different spectral band. The result indicates that IR band has the maximum value of reflective. So band ratio was used between 400nm and 800nm and the original radiance images were used between 800nm and 2130nm. In order to get the most obvious images of entropy windows of different sizes were tested in order to decide the optimum window. At last, a FCM fuzzy clustering method and image texture analysis was combined for the MODIS images of the oil spill area segmentation. At last, the oil spill zone was estimated, the results were satisfied.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9806-9				2013	8921								UNSP 892106	10.1117/12.2030393								WOS:000327588700006

Overview of hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping marine benthic habitats from airborne and underwater sensors	IMAGING SPECTROMETRY XVIII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Imaging Spectrometry XVIII	AUG 26-27, 2013	San Diego, CA	SPIE				The seafloor, with its diverse and dynamic benthic habitats varying on meter to centimeter scales, is difficult to accurately monitor with traditional techniques. The technology used to build imaging spectrometers has rapidly advanced in recent years with the advent of smaller sensors and better signal-to-noise capabilities that has facilitated their use in mapping fine-scale benthic features. Here, the use of such sensors for hyperspectral remote sensing of the seafloor from both airborne and underwater platforms is discussed. Benthic constituents provide a so-called optical fingerprint with spectral properties that are often too subtle to be discerned with simple color photographs or multi-channel spectrometers. Applications include the recent field validation of the airborne Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM), a new imaging sensor package optimized for coastal ocean processes in Elkorn Slough California. In these turbid sediment-laden waters, only subtle spectral differences differentiate seafloor with sediment from that with eelgrass. The ultimate goal is to provide robust radiometric approaches that accurately consider light attenuation by the water column and are able to be applied to diverse habitats without considerable foreknowledge.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9720-8				2013	8870								88700L	10.1117/12.2026529								WOS:000326705200017

Maido observatory: a new high-altitude station facility at Reunion Island (21 degrees S, 55 degrees E) for long-term atmospheric remote sensing and in situ measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Since the nineties, atmospheric measurement systems have been deployed at Reunion Island, mainly for monitoring the atmospheric composition in the framework of NDSC/NDACC (Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change/Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change). The location of Reunion Island presents a great interest because there are very few multi-instrumented stations in the tropics and particularly in the southern hemisphere. In 2012, a new observatory was commissioned in Maido at 2200 m above sea level: it hosts various instruments for atmospheric measurements, including lidar systems, spectro-radiometers and in situ gas and aerosol measurements. This new high-altitude Maido station provides an opportunity: 1. to improve the performance of the optical instruments above the marine boundary layer, and to open new perspectives on upper troposphere and lower stratosphere studies; 2. to develop in situ measurements of the atmospheric composition for climate change surveys, in a reference site in the tropical/subtropical region of the southern hemisphere; 3. to offer trans-national access to host experiments or measurement campaigns for focused process studies.

Light absorption and partitioning in Arctic Ocean surface waters: impact of multiyear ice melting	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Ice melting in the Arctic Ocean exposes the surface water to more radiative energy with poorly understood effects on photo-biogeochemical processes and heat deposition in the upper ocean. In August 2009, we documented the vertical variability of light absorbing components at 37 stations located in the southeastern Beaufort Sea including both Mackenzie River-influenced waters and polar mixed layer waters. We found that melting multiyear ice released significant amount of non-algal particulates (NAP) near the sea surface relative to subsurface waters. NAP absorption coefficients at 440 nm (a(NAP)(440)) immediately below the sea surface were on average 3-fold (up to 10-fold) higher compared to subsurface values measured at 2-3m depth. The impact of this unusual feature on the light transmission and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was further examined using a radiative transfer model. A 10-fold particle enrichment homogeneously distributed in the first meter of the water column slightly reduced photosynthetically available and usable radiation (PAR and PUR) by similar to 6 and similar to 8 %, respectively, relative to a fully homogenous water column with low particle concentration. In terms of R-rs, the particle enrichment significantly flattered the spectrum by reducing the R-rs by up to 20% in the blue-green spectral region (400-550 nm). These results highlight the impact of meltwater on the concentration of particles at sea surface, and the need for considering non-uniform vertical distribution of particles in such systems when interpreting remotely sensed ocean color. Spectral slope of aNAP spectra calculated in the UV (ultraviolet) domain decreased with depth suggesting that this parameter is sensitive to detritus composition and/or diagenesis state (e.g., POM (particulate organic matter) photobleaching).

Whenever we need to identify oil spill, confirm the location or get the shape and acreage of oil spill, we have to get the edge information of oil slick images firstly. Hyperspectral remote sensing imaging is now widely used to detect oil spill. Active Contour Models (ACMs) is a widely used image segmentation method that utilizes the geometric information of objects within images. Region based models are less sensitive to noise and give good performance for images with weak edges or without edges. One of the popular Region based ACMs, active contours without edges Models, is implemented by Chan-Vese. The model has the property of global segmentation to segment all the objects within an image irrespective of the initial contour. In this paper, we propose an improved CV model, which can perform well in the oil spill hyper-spectral image segmentation. The energy function embeds spectral and spatial information, introduces the vector edge stopping function, and constructs a novel length term. Results of the improved model on airborne hyperspectral oil spill images show that it improves the ability of distinguishing between oil spills and sea water, as well as the capability of noise reduction.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9779-6				2013	8910								UNSP 891026	10.1117/12.2035052								WOS:000325485500075

For this reason, satellite images from ENVISAT/MERIS and Aqua/MODIS were used along with collocated in-situ measurements. The latter were in-sync with the satellite images acquisition so that rigorous and validation could be performed. Chlorophyll-a concentration and total suspended matter were estimated using the CASE-II algorithm and MERIS satellite images, while sea surface temperature was estimated from MODIS Ocean Team products. The results show that the satellite images covered the study area completely, with some data gaps due to cloud coverage. Comparisons show a good correspondence with in-situ measurements. Thus, the time series of satellite images that was produced suggests that it is possible to monitor the biological changes on an operational basis. The produced maps described a detailed spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter that could not have been identified from the sparse in-situ measurements.

This separation is problematic due to the similar absorption spectra of these substances. Due to this complication, we approach the problem by constructing a neural network which relates the remote sensing reflectance at the available MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667nm) with the ratio of the absorption coefficient of non-algal particulates to the absorption coefficient of dissolved species, thereby permitting analytical separation of the total non-algal absorption into particulate and dissolved components. The resulting synthetically trained algorithm is tested on simulated data as well as independently on the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Very good agreement is obtained, with R-2 values of 87% and 78% for the non-algal particulate and dissolved absorption components, respectively for the NOMAD. Finally, we apply the algorithm to MODIS data and present global distributions for these parameters.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9638-6				2013	8795								UNSP 87951N	10.1117/12.2028379								WOS:000325475000059

Complex vertical layering and mixing of aerosols over the eastern Mediterranean: Active and passive remote sensing at the Cyprus University of Technology	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2013)	Proceedings of SPIE				1st International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	APR 08-10, 2013	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc, Cyprus Univ Technol, European Space Agcy, Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber, Cyprus Meteorol Serv, Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Frederick Univ, European Space Agcy, Intergraph (SG&I) Italia LLC, Hexagon, Geosystems Hellas, Neapolis Univ				Aerosols can have a complicated influence on climate conditions, directly as well as indirectly via cloud formation. The southeastern Mediterranean region can be characterized as a cross road of aerosols originating from European, Asian and African continents. Complex vertical aerosol distributions are frequently detected over Cyprus by means of active remote sensing. Observations of such complex aerosol layering and comparison of the measurements with aerosol products of regional and global atmospheric transport models are required to improve our understanding of life cycles of aerosol mixtures and their impact on climate as well as on satellite remote sensing products. In this study, a case of an intense desert dust outbreak from Syria and Saudi Arabia towards the eastern Mediterranean in September 2011 is presented. The observations used in this study were performed with a 532-nm polarization Lidar and a sun/sky AERONET photometer operated at 8 channels from 340 to 1640 nm wavelength. Both instruments belong to remote sensing station of the Cyprus Technical University at Limassol, Cyprus (34 degrees N, 33 degrees E). The lofted dust plume was doped with air masses that crossed sources of biomass burning smoke and anthropogenic pollution. In addition, the shallow marine boundary layer over the Mediterranean Sea and over Limassol became mixed with the anthropogenic haze by sea breeze circulations. The case study demonstrates the potential of combined lidar/photometer observations to deliver detailed vertically resolved information of the aerosol characteristics in terms of particle optical and microphysical properties, separately for the spherical particle fraction as well as for the non-spherical aerosol mode.

Combination of ground-based and satellite remote sensing measurements over Limassol	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2013)	Proceedings of SPIE				1st International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	APR 08-10, 2013	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc, Cyprus Univ Technol, European Space Agcy, Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber, Cyprus Meteorol Serv, Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Frederick Univ, European Space Agcy, Intergraph (SG&I) Italia LLC, Hexagon, Geosystems Hellas, Neapolis Univ				According to the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) there are still uncertainties in climate change predictions due to the impact of aerosols in the solar irradiance. The scattering procedure of aerosols depends strongly on their shape and size distribution while lidar techniques could give the vertical distribution of them. Southeastern Mediterranean is affected by air masses of different sources thus layers with complicate aerosol composition are frequently observed over Cyprus. A backscatter lidar has been established at Cyprus University of Technology's (CUT) premises (34 degrees N, 33 degrees E) since 2010, in order to provide vertical profiles of the aerosol optical properties such as backscatter coefficient and particle depolarization ratio. More than 2 years of daily measurements have been analyzed for the period of May 2010 to May 2012. From this dataset, there are almost 45 CALISPO coincidence overpasses at a distance of less than 105km from the location of the ground-based lidar and from those two cases were selected. Both, ground based and space born active remote sensing techniques were used in order to characterize aerosol layers in the free troposphere over SE Mediterranean. The layers of CALIPSO and CUT's lidar observations have been examined with respect to their origin, in order to retrieve the backscatter coefficient and the particle depolarization ratio at 532nm. The analysis of the presented cases, together with the air mass back-trajectories calculations, in accordance with depolarization retrievals, show that non-spherical particles originated from Africa whereas marine layer consist of spherical particles. Furthermore aerosol optical properties such as Angstrom exponents (AE) derived from the sun-photometer belonging to the AERONET network at Limassol city were used complementary in order to support our analysis.

Kurtis; Devred, Emmanuel; Platt, Trevor; Sathyendranath, Shubha			Variation in ocean colour may help predict cod and haddock recruitment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Characteristics of the spring and fall phytoplankton blooms in spawning areas on the Scotian Shelf, Canada, were estimated from remote sensing data. These blooms, along with anomalies in the North Atlantic Oscillation, were used to explain variation in the recruitment of 4 populations of cod and haddock. We tested the effects of the timing of the bloom using the chlorophyll a (chl a) signal, the maximum amount of chl a, the timing of the diatom bloom, and the maximum relative dominance of diatoms on the recruitment (to Age 1) of cod and haddock on the Scotian Shelf. Models were run separately for the effects of the spring and fall blooms. Only 3 of 10 models tested (0-lag) explained significant (80 to 92%) variation in recruitment. However, the performance of these models was not consistent across populations or species, suggesting that generalities about how spring and fall phytoplankton blooms affect recruitment cannot yet be made. The differences among models suggest that fish larvae are probably adapted locally to food production and thus indirectly to the characteristics of the phytoplankton bloom, which in turn are influenced by regional (meso-scale) oceanographic conditions.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2013	491						187	197		10.3354/meps10451								WOS:000325282500015

A synthesis of the available information on b(bp) for the Laurentian Great Lakes is presented to support mechanistic approaches for remote sensing. This includes (1) direct measurements of b(bp), (2) characterization of the backscattering attributes of minerogenic particles, (3) partitioning of b(bp) into contributing minerogenic (b(b,m)) and organic (b(b,o)) components, and (4) development of appropriate cross-sections (mass-specific coefficients) for retrieval of concentrations of backscattering constituents by remote sensing. Levels of b(bp) were particularly high in the western basin of Lake Erie and Green Bay, Lake Michigan, intermediate levels prevailed in parts of Lake Ontario during a whiting event, and values were substantially lower in the open waters of the upper Great lakes. Minerogenic backscattering (b(b,m)) is an important component of b(bp) throughout the system. Clay mineral particles dominate this component, except during whiting events when calcite is dominant. Mie-theory calculations supported estimates of b(b,m) and together with particle morphological considerations, guided the development of the optical cross-section for minerogenic particles. The collected data and associated analyses are appropriate to support initiatives to develop and preliminarily test mechanistic remote sensing approaches for the Great Lakes.

Paired measurements of optically active constituents (OACs), and inherent optical properties (IOPs) and apparent optical properties (AOPs), were made in September 2010 across the optical gradients of Green Bay, extending from the Fox River to Sturgeon Bay (8 sites), and for three near-shore locations in the main basin of Lake Michigan. The array of laboratory and in situ measurements provided a robust characterization of the underwater and emergent light fields of these waters with respect to magnitudes and spectral features of the OACs, IOPs and AOPs. These measurements resolved the character and possible origins of the major gradients within the bay (5 to 10-fold differences) and the substantial differences between the bay and the main basin. The credibility of the characterizations was supported through closure analyses which demonstrated: (1) the approach to equivalence between various field and laboratory measurements, and (2) good matches of AOP observations by values predicted from measured IOPs using accepted radiative transfer expressions. The bay was demonstrated to be an optically complex case 2 system, with uncoupled variations along the spatial gradient(s) in OACs of phytoplankton biomass, colored dissolved organic material, and non-algal particulates. The documented spatial differences in optical properties rival those reported in much larger marine surveys. Radiative transfer expressions are used to predict changes in AOPs of the downwelling (underwater) attenuation coefficient and remote sensing signal in response to scenarios of changes in levels of OACs of potential ecological and management interest.

The results indicate that, the primary component of CDOM is humic-like. The secondary component is tryptophan-like, which is the product of phytoplankton and aquatic debris rather than the wastewater treatment drainaged from city. In this study, six fluorophores with multiple excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) peaks (A, B, C, N, M, T) were identified according to the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The average contribution of each component to the CDOM is 19.93, 18.82, 16.88, 16.39, 12.26, and 15.72%, respectively. Red Shifted phenomenon will happen with the increase of fluorescence intensity for ultraviolet and terrestrially humic-like. Conversely, marine humic-like will appear Reverse Red Shifted with the increase of fluorescence intensity. The primary contributor to the shoulder value of CDOM's absorption coefficient at 275 nm is phytoplankton productivity, followed by marine humic-like. The main contributors to the shoulder shape are UV humic-like and phytoplankton productivity, followed by marine humic-like and tryptophan-like. A strong correlation between CDOM absorption and fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength of 424 nm and excitation wavelength ranging from 280 to 360 nm was found. The absorption coefficient can be retrieved successfully from the same excitation wavelength's fluorescence intensity by an exponential model.				huang, changchun/E-6580-2016; huang, changchun/R-5236-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X; huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663												1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	2					326	335		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e26								WOS:000324045100011

Although securing rare earth elements is essential for economic growth of all nations, their demand is rapidly expanding among global powers such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Rare earth element deposits were discovered in the seafloor near hydrothermal vents in the 1980s. Japan has the sixth largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and is abundant in underwater natural resources such as a cobalt and a manganese mine. Because underwater exploration of rare earth elements was deemed unprofitable, the practice was suspended. Current advancements in underwater robotics, however, have led to economic viability in this venture. Such developments have resulted in the increased use of remote sensing with sonars on unmanned underwater vehicles. The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) developed a cruising autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) known as Urashima. This AUV performed its first sea trial in 2000, and cruise for 317 km without recharging or refueling in 2005 as a world record at the time. The first mission of Urashima was a vast sea exploration to investigate worldwide environmental crises such as global warming. However, the purpose of these missions has since then shifted primarily to the exploration of underwater natural resources. In addition, JAMSTEC developed a synthetic aperture sonar on a neutral buoyancy towfish in 2010. This underwater exploration system, known as Kyouryuu, scanned Wakamiko caldera at the sea bottom in Kagoshima Bay where volcanic activity was evident. Numerous hot-water flows from hydrothermal vents were clearly recorded. In addition, many dormant chimneys were detected. These features provide important data for estimating the distribution of hydrothermal vents and chimneys in addition to their transitions.																			978-0-7918-4494-6				2013							131	+										WOS:000324507000017

The Baltic Sea model is based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM from NCAR - National Centre for Atmospheric Research). CESM was adopted for the Baltic Sea as a coupled sea-ice model. It consists of the Community Ice CodE (CICE, model version 4.0) and the Parallel Ocean Program (POP, version 2.1). The models are linked through a coupler (CPL7), which is based on the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) library. The current horizontal resolution is about 2 km (1/48 degrees). The ocean model has 21 vertical levels and is forced by atmospheric fields from the European Centre for Medium Weather Forecast (ECMWF). A preliminary validation of the hydrodynamic module with in situ measurements and reanalysis from My Ocean (http://www.myocean.eu) has also been done. In the operational mode, 48-hour atmospheric forecasts provided by the UM model from the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling of Warsaw University (ICM) are used. The variables presented on the website in real time for a 48-hour forecast are temperature,. salinity, currents, sea surface height, ice thickness and ice coverage (http://deep.iopan.gda.pl/CEMBaltic/new_lay/index.php).

J	Jusoff, K				Jusoff, Kamaruzaman			Malaysian Mangrove Forests and their Significance to the Coastal Marine Environment	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Mangrove forests are one of the most productive and bio-diverse wetland environments on earth. Yet these unique coastal tropical forest environments are among the most threatened habitats in the world. Some key progress points in mangrove conservation, restoration, and research in Malaysia are highlighted. Based on an intensive literature review, the ecology and ecological management, distribution and areas of existing mangroves in the world and Malaysia, issues associated with mangrove conservation and restoration are discussed. Growing in the intertidal areas and estuary mouths between land and sea, mangroves provide critical habitat for diverse marine and terrestrial flora and fauna. Important for the flora and fauna is the opportunity to continue living in a sustainable environment and in suitable conditions. A potential stand is the place that obtains the possibility of germination and establishment of a plant species according to their physical, chemical, and biological demands. In many cases it is seen that because of unsuitable selection of site and species, afforestation and reforestation projects are forced to fail after spending time, cost, and labor. The population boom and rapid economic developments have greatly reduced mangrove areas in Malaysia despite the Malaysian government launching a series of programs to protect mangroves in the 1980s and establishing mangrove ecosystems as high-priority areas for improving environmental and living resource management. The issues, threats, and significant values of mangroves also were highlighted. A more systematic protection strategy using ecological engineering management-based, active restoration and rehabilitation measurements still are urgently needed in order to preserve these valuable resources in Malaysia.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2013	22	4					979	1005										WOS:000323402700001

The plume dispersion from the thermal outfall of the nuclear power plant at Kalpakkam, on the southeast coast of India, was investigated from March to December 2011 using thermal infrared images along with field measurements. The absolute temperature as provided by the thermal infrared (TIR) images is used in the Arc GIS environment for generating a spatial pattern of the plume movement. Good correlation of the temperature measured by the TIR camera with the field data (r(2) = 0.89) make it a reliable method for the thermal monitoring of the power plant effluents. The study portrays that the remote sensing technique provides an effective means of monitoring the thermal distribution pattern in coastal waters.																	2050-7887						2013	15	9					1729	1734		10.1039/c3em00081h								WOS:000323352100009	23839171

These NNs are used to relate the water leaving remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at available MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667nm) to the phytoplankton (a(ph)), non-phytoplankton particulate (a(dm)), dissolved (a(g)) absorption and particulate backscattering (b(bp)) coefficients at 443nm. These reflectance derived parameters (a(ph)(443), a(dm)(443), a(g)(443), b(b)p(443)) are then combined with the measured reflectance values and used as input to a fourth NN, (IOP NN [Chl]), to derive chlorophyll concentration ([Chl]). Unlike NNs previously developed by us that were trained on a synthetic dataset and then tested on the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD), the (IOP NN [Chl]) network was both trained and tested solely on NOMAD. Although the inherent optical properties (IOP) can be derived from the optical signal through their direct relation to the Rrs, the relationship of [Chl] to IOP varies with location and season, and is therefore difficult to model globally. In order to demonstrate that the inclusion of derived IOP estimates along with radiance measurements can improve the retrieval of [Chl], we construct a neural network that is trained to derive [Chl] from reflectance measurements only We also compare our [Chl] product to that obtained from the current OC3 algorithm implemented by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Finally, we apply our algorithm to MODIS data and present and analyze the global seasonal variability for all three parameters.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9515-0				2013	8724								UNSP 87240P	10.1117/12.2018143								WOS:000323517900023

Real-Time Beyond the Horizon Vessel Detection	RADAR SENSOR TECHNOLOGY XVII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Radar Sensor Technology XVII	APR 29-MAY 01, 2013	Baltimore, MD	SPIE				The marine transportation system (MTS) is a vital component of the United States Economy. Waterborne cargo accounts for more than $742 billion of the nation's economy and creates employment for 13 million citizens. A disruption in this system would have far reaching consequences to the security of the country. The US National High Frequency radar network, which comprises 130 radar stations around the country, became operational in May 2009. It provides hourly measurements of surface currents to the US Coast Guard for search and rescue (SAR). This system has the capability of being a dual use system providing information for environmental monitoring as well as vessel position information for maritime security. Real time vessel detection has been implemented at two of the radar stations outside New York Harbor. Several experiments were conducted to see the amount vessel traffic that the radar could capture. The radars were able to detect a majority of the vessels that are reporting via the Automatic Identification System (AIS) as well as 30 percent of mid to large size vessels that are not reporting via AIS. The radars were able to detect vessels out to 60 km from the coast. The addition of a vessel detection capability to the National HF radar network will provide valuable information to maritime security sector. This dual use capability will fill a gap in the current surveillance of US coastal waters. It will also provide longer-range situational awareness necessary to detect and track smaller size vessels in the large vessel clutter.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9505-1				2013	8714								UNSP 87140Z	10.1117/12.2015871								WOS:000323559400031

This technique makes it possible to probe the ocean where is large scale or difficult to deploy instruments. In this study, we build an inverse method to estimate the ocean current from the travel time perturbation of eigenrays which was calculated by NTU-RAY. NTU-RAY is a numerical model which is included in NTU-GBM (Gaussian Beams Model). The purpose of this study is to estimate the feasibility of an experiment in the north-eastern sea of Taiwan in the future. The method is tested first in an idealized environment, such as Pekeris waveguide, and then applies to the real ocean scenario. Results show that the inverse method works well generally but with limitations.

Ecosystem modelling for ecosystem-based management of bivalve aquaculture sites in data-poor environments	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Although models of carrying capacity have been around for some time, their use in aquaculture management has been limited. This is partially due to the cost involved in generating and testing the models. However, the use of more generic and flexible models could facilitate the implementation of modelling in management. We have built a generic core for coupling biogeochemical and hydrodynamic models using Simile (www.simulistics.com), a visual simulation environment software that is well-suited to accommodate fully spatial models. Specifically, Simile integrates PEST (model-independent parameter estimation, Watermark Numerical Computing, www.pesthomepage.org), an optimization tool that uses the Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm and can be used to estimate the value of a parameter, or set of parameters, in order to minimize the discrepancies between the model results and a dataset chosen by the user. The other critical aspect of modelling exercises is the large amount of data necessary to set up, tune and ground truth the ecosystem model. However, ecoinformatics and improvements in remote sensing procedures have facilitated acquisition of these datasets, even in data-poor environments. In this paper we describe the required datasets and stages of model development necessary to build a biogeochemical model that can be used as a decision-making tool for bivalve aquaculture management in data-poor environments.																	1869-215X						2013	4	2					117	133		10.3354/aei00078								WOS:000323076900002

Parameterization of vertical chlorophyll a in the Arctic Ocean: impact of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum on regional, seasonal, and annual primary production estimates	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Predicting water-column phytoplankton biomass from near-surface measurements is a common approach in biological oceanography, particularly since the advent of satellite remote sensing of ocean color (OC). In the Arctic Ocean, deep subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs) that significantly contribute to primary production (PP) are often observed. These are neither detected by ocean color sensors nor accounted for in the primary production models applied to the Arctic Ocean. Here, we assemble a large database of pan-Arctic observations (i.e., 5206 stations) and develop an empirical model to estimate vertical chlorophyll a (Chl a) according to (1) the shelf-offshore gradient delimited by the 50m isobath, (2) seasonal variability along pre-bloom, post-bloom, and winter periods, and (3) regional differences across ten sub-Arctic and Arctic seas. Our detailed analysis of the dataset shows that, for the pre-bloom and winter periods, as well as for high surface Chl a concentration (Chl a(surf); 0.7-30 mgm(-3)) throughout the open water period, the Chl a maximum is mainly located at or near the surface. Deep SCMs occur chiefly during the post-bloom period when Chl a(surf) is low (0-0.5 mg m(-3)). By applying our empirical model to annual Chl a(surf) time series, instead of the conventional method assuming vertically homogenous Chl a, we produce novel pan-Arctic PP estimates and associated uncertainties. Our results show that vertical variations in Chl a have a limited impact on annual depth-integrated PP. Small overestimates found when SCMs are shallow (i.e., pre-bloom, post-bloom > 0.7 mgm(-3), and the winter period) somehow compensate for the underestimates found when SCMs are deep (i.e., post-bloom < 0.5 mgm(-3)). SCMs are, however, important seasonal features with a substantial impact on depth-integrated PP estimates, especially when surface nitrate is exhausted in the Arctic Ocean and where highly stratified and oligotrophic conditions prevail.

A 4-D climatology (1979-2009) of the monthly tropospheric aerosol optical depth distribution over the Mediterranean region from a comparative evaluation and blending of remote sensing and model products	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth- Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level-2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatio-temporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003-2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology. We extend the 2003-2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003-2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosol-climate studies.

This leads to overestimation of upwelling longwave fluxes and underestimation of upwelling shortwave fluxes at the top-of-atmosphere. One experiment is performed by applying a distinct cloud parameterization scheme to the GFS model with the original GFS atmospheric variables. The scheme generates significantly more low clouds than the original GFS cloud output leading to much better agreement between model and observations for marine stratocumulus over eastern sub-tropical oceans.

OC-SMART uses a one-step nonlinear optimal estimation/Levenberg-Marquardt method instead of the traditional two-step look-up table approach to improve retrieval accuracy, and a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) forward radiative transfer model for the coupled atmosphere-water system to increase retrieval speed without loss of accuracy. We discuss applications of OC-SMART to analyze SeaWiFS, MERIS, and MODIS images obtained over coastal waters. Five parameters are obtained from the retrieval: aerosol optical depth, aerosol bi-modal fraction, chlorophyll concentration, CDOM absorption, and backscattering coefficient. The water leaving radiance is provided as a by-product.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1155-5				2013	1531						919	922		10.1063/1.4804921								WOS:000320763100226

The shape of the ASDF and its dependence on meteorological parameters, altitudes above sea level (H), fetch (X), wind speed (U) and relative humidity (RH) are investigated. The spectral profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficients calculated by MaexPro (Marine Aerosol Extinction Profiles) are in good agreement with observational data and the numerical results obtained from the Navy Aerosol Model (NAM) and the Advanced Navy Aerosol Model (ANAM).

Carlos			Ecosystem function and particle flux dynamics across the Mackenzie Shelf (Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean): an integrative analysis of spatial variability and biophysical forcings	BIOGEOSCIENCES												A better understanding of how environmental changes affect organic matter fluxes in Arctic marine ecosystems is sorely needed. Here we combine mooring times series, ship-based measurements and remote sensing to assess the variability and forcing factors of vertical fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) across the Mackenzie Shelf in 2009. We developed a geospatial model of these fluxes to proceed to an integrative analysis of their determinants in summer. Flux data were obtained with sediment traps moored around 125m and via a regional empirical algorithm applied to particle size distributions (17 classes from 0.08-4.2 mm) measured by an Underwater Vision Profiler 5. The low fractal dimension (i.e., porous, fluffy particles) derived from the algorithm (1.26 +/- 0.34) and the dominance (similar to 77 %) of rapidly sinking small aggregates (< 0.5 mm) in total fluxes suggested that settling material was the product of recent aggregation processes between marine detritus, gel-like substances, and ballast minerals. Modeled settling velocity of small and large aggregates was, respectively, higher and lower than in previous studies within which a high fractal dimension (i.e., more compact particles) was consequential of deep-trap collection (similar to 400-1300 m). Redundancy analyses and forward selection of abiotic/biotic parameters, linear trends, and spatial structures (i.e., principal coordinates of neighbor matrices, PCNM) were conducted to partition the variation of the 17 POC flux size classes. Flux variability was explained at 69.5% by the addition of a temporal trend, 7 significant PCNM, and 9 biophysical variables. The first PCNM canonical axis (44.5% of spatial variance) reflected the total magnitude of POC fluxes through a shelf-basin gradient controlled by bottom depth and sea ice concentration (p < 0.01). The second most important spatial structure (5.0 %) corresponded to areas where shelf break upwelling is known to occur under easterlies and where phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms. Among biophysical parameters, bacterial production and northeasterly wind (upwelling-favorable) were the two strongest corollaries of POC fluxes (r(2) cum. = 0.37). Bacteria were correlated with small aggregates, while northeasterly wind was associated with large size classes (> 1mm ESD), but these two factors were weakly related with each other. Copepod biomass was overall negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with vertical POC fluxes, implying that metazoans acted as regulators of export fluxes, even if their role was minor given that our study spanned the onset of diapause. Our results demonstrate that on interior Arctic shelves where productivity is low in mid-summer, localized upwelling zones (nutrient enrichment) may result in the formation of large filamentous phytoaggregates that are not substantially retained by copepod and bacterial communities.

Instruments onboard the FAAM BAe aircraft provided in situ measurements of the main liquid cloud microphysical variables. The latest-generation cloud microphysics retrieval method SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Cloud) has been compared with the microphysics observed by the in-situ aircraft measurements and with the METEOSAT Second Generation geostationary system, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI). Synergistic profiling from LIDAR, Doppler k(a)-band cloud RADAR and humidity and temperature microwave radiometer have been used by SYRSOC to retrieve profiles of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), droplet effective radius (R-eff) and liquid water content (LWC) and timeseries of cloud optical thickness (COT) from the two observed stratocumuli. Temporally and spatially co-located SEVIRI images and aircraft overpasses have then been selected for comparison with SYRSOC microphysics. Full profiles of cloud microphysics from FAAM BAe and cloud-top microphysics from SEVIRI proved to be in very good agreement with SYRSOC. The vertically-resolved microphysics measured by the aircraft revealed a generally adiabatic structure for both stratocumuli, while SYRSOC provided lower-peak and more subadiabatic LWC profiles.

J	Stramska, M; Zuzewicz, A				Stramska, Malgorzata; Zuzewicz, Agata			Comparison of primary productivity estimates in the Baltic Sea based on the DESAMBEM algorithm with estimates based on other similar algorithms	OCEANOLOGIA												The quasi-synoptic view available from satellites has been broadly used in recent years to observe in near-real time the large-scale dynamics of marine ecosystems and to estimate primary productivity in the world ocean. However, the standard global NASA ocean colour algorithms generally do not produce good results in the Baltic Sea. In this paper, we compare the ability of seven algorithms to estimate depth-integrated daily primary production (PP, mg C m(-2)) in the Baltic Sea. All the algorithms use surface chlorophyll concentration, sea surface temperature, photosynthetic available radiation, latitude, longitude and day of the year as input data. Algorithm-derived PP is then compared with PP estimates obtained from C-14 uptake measurements. The results indicate that the best agreement between the modelled and measured PP in the Baltic Sea is obtained with the DESAMBEM algorithm. This result supports the notion that a regional approach should be used in the interpretation of ocean colour satellite data in the Baltic Sea.

Large Marine oil spill is difficult to clean up and pollution range is large, lasting for a long time, for the biological and ecological environment destruction, particularly serious. It is very important to take corresponding measures that how to quickly master the location of the oil spill when this event occurs. Satellite remote sensing has advantages of large, multi-temporal, all-weather, real-time, quick and economic and has become an important means of monitoring marine oil spill, playing an important role in the monitoring of marine oil spill treatment. This paper illustrates by Penglai 19-3 oil spill accident, using MODIS remote sensing data, the use of the Robert operator, Sobel operator, Laplacian operator and LOG operator to extract the oil spill edge, and extraction accuracy of the comparison and analysis.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-550-8				2013	610-613		1-4				3747	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.610-613.3747								WOS:000319792101354

Xiangshan Bay of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province is a famous seafood production base, with a title of "Big Fish Pond" in East Sea. However, it have been facing serious problems, such as industrial pollution, marine eutrophication, and biological invasion. Recently, local government approved a number of industrial and tourism projects in order to improve economy. So it is forecasted with a rapid expansion of manufacturing and tourism in next 5 similar to 10 years. Combined with the planned projects, scenario analysis was conducted in this paper, so that we can inspect the effects of different scenarios. Potential Class (PC) and Sustainability Class (SC) were constructed based on the data of investigation and remote sensing image of 2009, as a tool to assess scenarios. PC is evaluation criterion of economic benefit and social benefit, while SC is of ecological benefit and environmental benefit. Among all scenarios, combination of agriculture and tourism in coastal wetlands is optimizing for Xiangshan Bay. According to the study, eco-tourism should be promoted and existing wetland agriculture should be ecologically improved. It is also necessary to restrict the secondary industry to ensure ecological protection and tourism growth.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-550-8				2013	610-613		1-4				3826	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.610-613.3826								WOS:000319792101368

An analysis model of SST is proposed based on the combination of observations at different time, different places and with different techniques. According to this model, Kalman Filter and the principle of non-negative matrix factorization can be used to fuse the SST data in temporal and spatial dimension when the data absence occurs. Through which an accurate estimation of SST observations will be made. The experiment results with SST data obtained in East China Sea in 2006, showed that the model presented in this article can obviously improve the precision of SST data estimation, which can provide accurate reference for the quality evaluation of marine information.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9587-7				2013	8783								87830V	10.1117/12.2013925								WOS:000318540900031						
J	Taylor, MH; Losch, M; Bracher, A				Taylor, Marc H.; Losch, Martin; Bracher, Astrid			On the drivers of phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic marginal ice zone: A modeling approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The pelagic province of the Southern Ocean generally has low levels of primary production attributable to a short growing season in the higher latitudes, a deep mixed layer, and iron limitation. Exceptions include phytoplankton blooms in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) during spring and summer sea-ice retreat. The prevailing hypothesis as to the drivers of the blooms is that sea-ice retreat increases the vertical stability of the water column through the production of melt water and provides shelter from wind mixing in areas of partial sea-ice coverage. These conditions are favorable to phytoplankton growth by allowing them to maintain their position in the upper reaches of the water column. This work investigates the drivers of MIZ blooms using a biochemically coupled global circulation model. Results support the hypothesis in that physical conditions related to a shallow, vertically stable water column (e. g., mixed layer depth and available light) were the most significant predictors of bloom dynamics, while nutrient limitation was of lesser importance. We estimate that MIZ blooms account for 15% of yearly net primary production in the Southern Ocean and that the earlier phases of the MIZ bloom, occurring under partial ice coverage and invisible to remote sensing, account for about two thirds of this production. MIZ blooms were not found to enhance depth-integrated net primary production when compared to similar ecological provinces outside of the MIZ, although the elevated phytoplankton concentrations in surface waters are hypothesized to provide important feeding habitats for grazing organisms such as krill.

The absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) from satellite ocean color data can be used to estimate the salinity and thus the plume area in coastal oceans if a robust conservative salinity and a(CDOM) relationship and an accurate satellite a(CDOM) algorithm can be established. In this paper, tight relationships between surface water salinity and in situ a(CDOM) were found during several cruises covering all seasons and the full salinity range in the East China Sea. Thus, a salinity inversion model from a(CDOM) was developed and validated with an independent data set, in which 73.6% of the data were within the absolute salinity error of +/- 1 and 87.1% were within +/- 1.5. Factors influencing the conservative behavior of colored dissolved organic matter are analyzed, with a particular focus on the effect of the phytoplankton-induced autochthonous colored dissolved organic matter. In addition, several satellite a(CDOM) algorithms were compared and validated with our in situ data. Monthly satellite-derived salinity images were mapped in August from 2008 to 2010 and showed the significant interannual variability in the plume coverage. This study demonstrated that the salinity derived from satellite-derived a(CDOM) can provide a reliable and good synoptic view of the plume area, and help with biogeochemical studies, in particular, those properties related to the interannual variability of plume coverage, although the development of a localized satellite algorithm of a(CDOM) is still desirable.

J	Zhai, P; Bower, A				Zhai, Ping; Bower, Amy			The response of the Red Sea to a strong wind jet near the Tokar Gap in summer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Remote sensing and in situ observations are used to investigate the ocean response to the Tokar Wind Jet in the Red Sea. The wind jet blows down the atmospheric pressure gradient through the Tokar Gap on the Sudanese coast, at about 19 degrees N, during the summer monsoon season. It disturbs the prevailing along-sea (southeastward) winds with strong cross-sea (northeastward) winds that can last from days to weeks and reach amplitudes of 20-25 m/s. By comparing scatterometer winds with along-track and gridded sea level anomaly observations, it is observed that an intense dipolar eddy spins up in response to the wind jet. The eddy pair has a horizontal scale of 140 km. Maximum ocean surface velocities can reach 1 m/s and eddy currents extend more than 100 m into the water column. The eddy currents appear to cover the width of the sea, providing a pathway for rapid transport of marine organisms and other drifting material from one coast to the other. Interannual variability in the strength of the dipole is closely matched with variability in the strength of the wind jet. The dipole is observed to be quasi-stationary, although there is some evidence for slow eastward propagation in an idealized numerical model. Simulation of the dipole in an idealized high-resolution numerical model suggests that this is the result of self-advection. Citation: Zhai, P., and A. S.

Remote Sensing of the Nearshore	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 5	Annual Review of Marine Science											The shallow waters of the nearshore ocean are popular, dynamic, and often hostile. Prediction in this domain is usually limited less by our understanding of the physics or by the power of our models than by the availability of input data, such as bathymetry and wave conditions. It is a challenge for traditional in situ instruments to provide these inputs with the appropriate temporal or spatial density or at reasonable logistical or financial costs. Remote sensing provides an attractive alternative. We discuss the range of different sensors that are available and the differing physical manifestations of their interactions with the ocean surface. We then present existing algorithms by which the most important geophysical variables can be estimated from remote sensing measurements. Future directions and opportunities will depend on expected developments in sensors and platforms and on improving processing algorithms, including data assimilation formalisms.

J	Scheuvens, D; Schutz, L; Kandler, K; Ebert, M; Weinbruch, S				Scheuvens, Dirk; Schuetz, Lothar; Kandler, Konrad; Ebert, Martin; Weinbruch, Stephan			Bulk composition of northern African dust and its source sediments - A compilation	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper presents a review of bulk compositional data of northern African dust and its potential source sediments and includes elemental, isotope and mineralogical data. Northern African dust represents about one half of the total global atmospheric mineral dust burden, and its uplift, transport and deposition have strong impacts on climate and various terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The chemical data set shows, that an 'average northern African dust' exhibits comparable Si, Fe and Mn contents with respect to the average composition of the upper continental crust, is slightly depleted in the alkali metals K and Na, and enriched in Ti and P. However, the complete data set yields clear evidence that northern African dust and its source sediments are compositionally heterogeneous on a regional scale and that this heterogeneity can be used to differentiate between major potential source areas on the basis of so-called source markers. An evaluation of these compositional fingerprints shows that the following parameters and especially their combination are effective in the discrimination of the most active source areas in northern Africa: ratio of (Ca + Mg)/Fe [wt.%], calcite (or carbonate) content, palygorskite occurrence and abundance, illite/kaolinite ratio, epsilon(Nd)(0) value, and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio. For example, the data set corroborates previous ideas, which assign carbonate-, illite- and palygorskite-rich mineral dusts to north(west)ern source regions. Because most of the above listed source markers do not change substantially during transport, even far-traveled dusts may be assigned to specific potential source areas in northern Africa. Some limitations of the presented data set are also discussed. Our compilation reveals some substantial gaps in the knowledge of the composition of source sediments and mineral dusts from important potential source areas that should be filled in the future. The here compiled data set can be used as a reference frame, when incorporating the composition of source sediments (e.g., mineralogy) into global or regional dust transport models and can be compared with source analysis by remote sensing or back-trajectory analysis. However, source apportionment studies supported by our data set will not only be useful for actual dust samples, but will also be helpful for the understanding of paleo-wind directions and hence paleo-climatological conditions through the investigation of Quaternary eolian sediments deposited in and around northern Africa.

J	Painemal, D; Zuidema, P				Painemal, D.; Zuidema, P.			The first aerosol indirect effect quantified through airborne remote sensing during VOCALS-REx	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The first aerosol indirect effect (1AIE) is investigated using a combination of in situ and remotely-sensed aircraft (NCAR C-130) observations acquired during VOCALS-REx over the southeast Pacific stratocumulus cloud regime. Satellite analyses have previously identified a high albedo susceptibitility to changes in cloud microphysics and aerosols over this region. The 1AIE was broken down into the product of two independently-estimated terms: the cloud aerosol interaction metric ACI(tau) = d ln tau/d ln N-a vertical bar(LWP), and the relative albedo (A) susceptibility SR-tau = d A/3d ln tau vertical bar(LWP), with tau and N-a denoting retrieved cloud optical thickness and in situ aerosol concentration respectively and calculated for fixed intervals of liquid water path (LWP). ACI(tau) was estimated by combining in situ N-a sampled below the cloud, with tau and LWP derived from, respectively, simultaneous upward-looking broadband irradiance and narrow field-of-view millimeter-wave radiometer measurements, collected at 1 Hz during four eight-hour daytime flights by the C-130 aircraft. ACI tau values were typically large, close to the physical upper limit (0.33), with a modest increase with LWP. The high ACI tau values slightly exceed values reported from many previous in situ airborne studies in pristine marine stratocumulus and reflect the imposition of a LWP constraint and simultaneity of aerosol and cloud measurements. SR-tau increased with LWP and tau, reached a maximum SR-tau (0.086) for LWP (tau) of 58 gm(-2) (similar to 14), and decreased slightly thereafter. The 1AIE thus increased with LWP and is comparable to a radiative forcing of -3.2- -3.8 W m(-2) for a 10% increase in N-a, exceeding previously-reported global-range values. The aircraft-derived values are consistent with satellite estimates derived from instantaneous, collocated Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) albedo and MOderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-retrieved droplet number concentrations at 50 km resolution. The consistency of the airborne and satellite estimates, despite their independent approaches, differences in observational scales, and retrieval assumptions, is hypothesized to reflect the ideal remote sensing conditions for these homogeneous clouds. We recommend the southeast Pacific for regional model assessments of the first aerosol indirect effect on this basis. This airborne remotely-sensed approach towards quantifying 1AIE should in theory be more robust than in situ calculations because of increased sampling. However, although the technique does not explicitly depend on a remotely-derived cloud droplet number concentration (N-d), the attimes unrealistically-high N-d values suggest more emphasis on accurate airborne radiometric measurements is needed to refine this approach.

J	Li, L; Wu, XB; Long, C; Liu, B				Li Lun; Wu Xiong-Bin; Long Chao; Liu Bin			Regularization inversion method for extracting ocean wave spectra from HFSWR sea echo	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION												HFSWR (High Frequency Surface Wave Radar) is capable of all-weather remote sensing of large area ocean surface dynamics (currents, wind and wave) with relatively high precision. Its capability of currents detection has been considered satisfying the requirements for routine marine observations while its wind and wave outputs have not reached the matched status. The second-order Doppler spectra of the HFSWR sea echoes contain ocean wave spectra information. This paper proposes a new method for extracting ocean wave spectra from the Doppler spectra with HFSWR. The method is developed by introducing a regularization mathematics model to the discrete linearization of the integral equation based on the principle of HF radio wave ocean detecting. Solution of the discrete linearization of the integral equation is obtained by singular value decomposition (SVD) method, while the regularization parameter is determined by L-Curve. Validity and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical simulation with different noise levels both at single radar and two radars of the same coverage detecting which show good agreement, Non-directional spectra can be extracted from single radar and directional spectra can be obtained by two radars at the same coverage. Some preliminary results from measured data detected by HFSWR OSMAR071 located at Longhai of Fujian province are also introduced. Further study is needed for the practical use of this method. It is promising for HFSWR wave inversion in future applications.																	0001-5733					JAN	2013	56	1					219	229		10.6038/cjg20130122								WOS:000314480100022

This area included three sites at 2, 10 and 18 km perpendicular to the coast, sampled at surface, mid-Secchi and Secchi depths at each site. Phytoplankton absorption coefficients were transformed into specific coefficients (a(ph)*(lambda)) by normalizing them with respect to chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The influence on the variability of the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton was assessed for physicochemical and biological parameters such as nutrients or Chla levels, as well as size structure and abundance of the phytoplankton community. The results showed that the phytoplankton absorption coefficients decreased from inshore to offshore, but were relatively constant within the water column, revealing a well-mixed column. The a(ph)*(lambda) varied inversely with Chla content, with minima in Autumn and Spring, matching phytoplankton blooms. The effects of the size structure of the community and pigment composition on the variability of phytoplankton absorption coefficient were studied and results showed that size structure had a greater influence on the variability of the phytoplankton absorption, although the pigment contribution was also important.

It is primarily designed to satisfy the requirements for planning of marine transportation and other marine operations in ice-infested waters around North America, including Canada's two Arctic Metareas; regional sea-ice model initialization; and the needs of regional numerical weather prediction models. A three-dimensional variational approach (3D-Var) is used to assimilate various types of observations. In this first version, only analyses of ice concentration are produced at approximately 5 km resolution using a 6 h persistence forecast from the previous analysis as the background state. The assimilated observations are sea-ice concentrations from two sources of passive microwave satellite data, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth observing system (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and manually derived ice charts from the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). Objective verification scores computed from independent data are used to evaluate the accuracy of the analyses in comparison with other available sources of ice information. This comparison demonstrates that the new analyses have consistently more accurate ice extent compared with the currently operational global sea-ice analyses at the Canadian Meteorological Centre. It also shows that the early morning analysis can provide marine transportation clients with a valuable update to the most recently available CIS daily ice chart.

Intercomparison of zooplankton (net) sampling systems: Results from the ICES/GLOBEC sea-going workshop	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												An inter-comparison and evaluation of methods for sampling and determination of zooplankton distribution and biomass was conducted in a fjord environment (Storfjorden at More, Norway) from 2 to 13 June 1993. The inter-comparison was carried out with the German R/V "A. v. Humboldt" and the Norwegian R/V "Johan Hjort" and involved a total number of 38 scientific personnel from 8 countries. The inter-comparisons included the MOCNESS, BIONESS, MultiNet, LHPR, OPC, CPR, Gulf-V, CalCOFI 1-m Ring Net, and WP-2 net. In addition, acoustics data were collected with a Simrad EK500 echosounder operating on 4 frequencies (18, 38, 120, 200 kHz) and hydrographic, nutrient, phytoplankton, and meteorological data were collected to characterize the environment in which the comparisons were made; environmental changes were minor during the study. The results of this study corroborate the results of earlier studies. Mesh size of the net had a major influence on the biomass and species composition of the zooplankton community. There is a consistent relationship between retention (or escapement through the mesh) and the width of the organisms; about 50% of the organisms escape through the mesh at a width equal to the mesh size. The effect of towing speed on the extrusion of smaller organisms through the net can be substantial and adds to the loss due to escapement. Active avoidance of the sampler is only important for the larger macrozooplankton and not a significant problem for the mesozooplankton. Different vertical, oblique, and multiple opening/closing net systems produced similar estimates of zooplankton when operated with comparable mesh-sized nets and a sufficiently high mesh open area to mouth opening ratio. The choice of mesh size is important and 150 pm mesh is possibly an optimal mesh size for use in coastal waters with neritic zooplankton communities. Replicate tow variability was also consistent with earlier studies and reflects the need to understand the interplay between the underlying patchiness of the zooplankton distributions and the method of sampling. No single net is suitable to sample across the wide size range of zooplankton from small mesozooplankton to macrozooplankton. Recent large interdisciplinary programs to assess marine ecosystem structure and dynamics have recognized this through the use of nets designed to sample particular size fractions in combination with video and acoustic remote sensing techniques.

Analog experiments that consider both the external (accumulation on the slope) and the endogenous (intrusion-related bulging) trigger phenomena. The effect of accumulation on the sub-aqueous slope on the initiation of sub-marine mass movements has been analyzed. By combining the monitoring data with analog modeling, the observed deformations from the combined action of overpressure in the volcanic system and gravity have been related. The results suggest that the superficial movements observed by the GBInSAR system represent the response of the Stromboli volcano to overpressure changes in the conduit. The movements observed on the Sciara del Fuoco were slope instability phenomena where the gravitational component produced a constant creep, while changes in the magma overpressure explain why certain periods are characterized by accelerations, which induce instability on the external flanks of the crater area and in the Sciara del Fuoco and eventually promote failure of the volcanic slopes.

Population trends of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) with respect to remote sensing measures of chlorophyll-a in critical habitat	MARINE BIOLOGY												The recovery plan for Steller sea lions (SSL; Eumetopias jubatus) suggests critical habitat should be enhanced to incorporate the spatio-temporal variation in dynamic oceanographic features that influence the prey and survival of SSL. It is necessary, therefore, to determine which features affect SSL. Demographics for sub-regions of the endangered, western stock of SSL were examined with respect to corresponding average, maximum, and variance of chlorophyll-a data (SeaWIFS), a proxy for primary productivity. Overall, SSL trends (2000-2008) and pup productivity (1999-2009) were related to maximum values of chl-a in critical habitat. Additionally, conditions in critical habitat appeared worse in areas of decline (i.e., dispersed patterns of chl-a hotspots and greater distances from SSL sites to productive areas). Although there may be a low feasibility of mitigating the effects of dynamic features on the recovery of SSL, the interactive effects of primary productivity and other stressors should be investigated for safeguarding their prey.																	0025-3162					JAN	2013	160	1					195	209		10.1007/s00227-012-2077-4								WOS:000313047600017						
J	Dong, Q; Shang, SL; Lee, Z				Dong, Qiang; Shang, Shaoling; Lee, Zhongping			An algorithm to retrieve absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from ocean color	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We extended the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) architecture to analytically derive absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(g)). Specifically, we used an empirical formula based on total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients to estimate and then remove detritus absorption coefficient (a(d)), and developed a scheme to use absorption coefficients at three wavelengths (412,443, and 490 nm) for the separation of a(g) and a(ph) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton). The algorithm was tested using an in situ data set collected in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and a global in situ data set the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Our results indicated that this new analytical algorithm for retrieving a(g) performed reasonably well with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 45% for a(g)(412), while it also presented a satisfactory performance for a(ph) and a(d) in both coastal and oceanic waters. Furthermore, the applicability of this new algorithm for general oceanographic studies was briefly illustrated by applying it to MODIS measurements over the Taiwan Strait and the shelf region near the Mississippi River delta. Nevertheless, more independent tests with in situ and satellite data are needed to further validate and improve this innovative approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The radiation extinguishing property is quantified in terms of optical depth, a key parameter for aerosol size estimation through remote sensing. The present work studies the determination of aerosol optical depth at urban area with both ground based radiometric measurement and satellite image analysis using shorter and longer wavelengths of radiation in ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared range. It is concluded that the use of longer wavelengths yields more consistent result and the data obtained from shorter wavelengths get masked by Rayleigh scattering effect.																	2373-6739		978-1-4673-5037-2; 978-1-4673-5036-5; 978-1-4673-5035-8				2013							104	108										WOS:000394378100019

The objective of this study was to generate the coastal and marine habitat map for the Straits of Malacca using the SPOT and Landsat data acquired at low tide in 2010 similar to 2012. Images were first processed with atmospheric and geometric correction. The hierarchical unsupervised classification and contextual editing were then used to produce the final habitat map. The WorldView2 and GeoEye data were also used for evaluating purposes in some studied area. Our classification scheme included sandy beach, mangrove forest, mud /sand flat, seagrass /algae, coral reefs, water and others. The produced habitat map provides the most up to date habitat information in the Straits of Malacca and will aid for the regional coastal ecosystems assessment as well as for future comparative study.

Oyster in tidal flat usually has rough structures, causing a strong depolarization in microwave backscattering. The signatures can be detected using multi-frequency polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Strong volume and depolarization effects were observed in the oyster reefs of C-band SAR data, while only surface scattering was dominant in the L-band SAR data. We also investigated why the oyster reefs distributed in those areas and how they generated naturally. We focused on groundwater discharge to relate the distribution of oyster in tidal flat, and found obvious signatures of groundwater discharge along the marginal part of the tidal flat from SAR data.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							2435	2438		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723312								WOS:000345638902135

How to reduce the risk of oil spill disasters has become one of the principal problems faced with marine environment management. Oil spill observation and spill processes simulation are two main parts for oil spill accident controlling and management. Traditionally, the oil spill information detection and spill simulation is disjoined without any feedback. The modeling approach is all conducted with fixed structure and static data input while the observation system is always static with fixed monitoring scheme. In such a circumstance, neither the observation system nor the simulation can provide highly accurate information. This paper propose a new framework combining oil spill monitoring and simulation as a symbiotic feedback control system based on the theory of Dynamic Data Drive Application System (DDDAS), a new paradigm dynamically integrated simulations, measurements, and applications. The numerical oil spill model can accepts real time data from remote sensing monitoring which assure modeling a more accurate and more reliable outcomes. Multiple simulations will be executed with different remote sensing monitoring scheme and the feedback from simulation guide and determine how to gather the data. For mathematical modeling of the DDDAS based marine oil spill management system, we built a multi-stage optimization model. Such system could promise more accurate prediction and more reliable outcomes with real time oil spill input, which will improve modeling technologies, advance prediction capabilities of simulation systems, and enhance oil spill monitoring.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							4526	4529		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723842								WOS:000345638904143

A joint Queensland and Australian government initiative produced the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan (Reef Plan) in 2003 in response to the decline in water quality, updating the plan in 2009 and most recently in 2013. The Reef Plan outlines a clear set of water quality and management practice targets for sediment, nutrients and pesticides. Improvement in water quality is achieved through government and landholder investment into improved agricultural management practices. A Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring and Modelling, Reporting program (Paddock to Reef) has been established to measure and report progress towards meeting Reef Plan goals and targets, and to assess the benefits of improved land management practices on water quality discharged to the reef lagoon. The program integrates five lines of evidence including: monitoring of practice effectiveness, prevalence of adoption of improved practices and catchment indicators through time, paddock and catchment modelling, and catchment and marine monitoring and remote sensing. Paddock to Reef is an innovative program where paddock and catchment modelling is an essential component used to report on progress towards meeting reef water quality targets. An important innovation is the linking from paddock through to catchment scale models to assess the impact of changes in management practices on end of system loads																			978-0-9872143-3-1				2013							3169	3175										WOS:000357105903029

The MAREDAT global database of high performance liquid chromatography marine pigment measurements	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												A global pigment database consisting of 35 634 pigment suites measured by high performance liquid chromatography was assembled in support of the MARine Ecosytem DATa (MAREDAT) initiative. These data originate from 136 field surveys within the global ocean, were solicited from investigators and databases, compiled, and then quality controlled. Nearly one quarter of the data originates from the Laboratoire d'Oceanographie de Villefranche (LOV), with an additional 17% and 19% stemming from the US JGOFS and LTER programs, respectively. The MAREDAT pigment database provides high quality measurements of the major taxonomic pigments including chlorophylls a and b, 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, alloxanthin, divinyl chlorophyll a, fucoxanthin, lutein, peridinin, prasinoxanthin, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin, which may be used in varying combinations to estimate phytoplankton community composition. Quality control measures consisted of flagging samples that had a total chlorophyll a concentration of zero, had fewer than four reported accessory pigments, or exceeded two standard deviations of the log-linear regression of total chlorophyll a with total accessory pigment concentrations. We anticipate the MAREDAT pigment database to be of use in the marine ecology, remote sensing and ecological modeling communities, where it will support model validation and advance our global perspective on marine biodiversity. The original dataset together with quality control flags as well as the gridded MAREDAT pigment data may be downloaded from PANGAEA: http://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.793246.

As a consequence, shipping routes are becoming very crowded and the likelihood of oil slicks occurring is also increasing. In this frame, a fully integrated remote sensing system can act as a valuable monitoring tool. We propose an integrated and interoperable system able to monitor ship traffic and marine operators, using sensing capabilities from a variety of electronic sensors, along with geo-positioning tools, and through a communication infrastructure. Our system is capable of transferring data, freely and seamlessly, between different elements of the information system (and their users). In this way different data are brought together, easily and in a consistent and usable form. The system also integrates a collection of decision support services providing proactive functionalities. Such services demonstrate the potentiality of the system in facilitating dynamic links between different data, models and actors, as indicated by the performed field tests.

The history on operational and research-based satellite ocean wind mapping is briefly described for passive microwave, scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Currently 6 GW installed capacity is found in the European Seas. The European Wind Energy Association, EWEA, expects the cumulative offshore capacity in Europe will reach 150 GW in year 2030. The offshore environment is far less well-known than over land and this increases the challenge of planning, operation and maintenance offshore. Satellite-based ocean surface wind data can fill a gap in our understanding of marine winds, their temporal and spatial variations. The statistics from satellite-based ocean surface wind maps include wind resources, long-term trend analysis and daily variations in winds. Some examples using data from passive microwave radiometer, scatterometer and SAR are presented from the North Sea and Baltic Sea. These seas are home to the majority of offshore wind farms today and many new offshore wind farm projects are in progress here.

Improved access to integrated biodiversity data for science, practice, and policy - the European Biodiversity Observation Network (EU BON)	NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA												Biodiversity is threatened on a global scale and the losses are ongoing. In order to stop further losses and maintain important ecosystem services, programmes have been put into place to reduce and ideally halt these processes. A whole suite of different approaches is needed to meet these goals. One major scientific contribution is to collate, integrate and analyse the large amounts of fragmented and diverse biodiversity data to determine the current status and trends of biodiversity in order to inform the relevant decision makers. To contribute towards the achievement of these challenging tasks, the project EU BON was developed. The project is focusing mainly on the European continent but contributes at the same time to a much wider global initiative, the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), which itself is a part of the Group of Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). EU BON will build on existing infrastructures such as GBIF, LifeWatch and national biodiversity data centres in Europe and will integrate relevant biodiversity data from on-ground observations to remote sensing information, covering terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. A key feature of EU BON will be the delivery of relevant, fully integrated data to multiple and different stakeholders and end users ranging from local to global levels. Through development and application of new standards and protocols, EU BON will enable greater interoperability of different data layers and systems, provide access to improved analytical tools and services, and will provide better harmonised biodiversity recording and monitoring schemes from citizen science efforts to long-term research programs to mainstream future data collecting. Furthermore EU BON will support biodiversity science-policy interfaces, facilitate political decisions for sound environmental management, and help to conserve biodiversity for human well-being at different levels, ranging from communal park management to the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Additionally, the project will strengthen European capacities and infrastructures for environmental information management and sustainable development. The following paper outlines the framework and the approach that are pursued.

Such data is imperative for installation of devices, design of arrays and for through life environmental monitoring of farms. Previously the typical method of obtaining accurate, live data has been to deploy a separate work vessel equipped with current monitoring equipment wasting fuel, time and money. Conventional buoys are not suitable for use on strong tidal current sites as the drag forces pull the buoy under water when the current speed increases. This work discusses the development of the Mojo Current Buoy, designed to provide tidal current profile and heading data for transmission back to land or ship in extreme tidal locations without submerging. It delivers a live data stream for the assistance of marine operations, and can also be used as a cost effective alternative to vessel or bottom mounted acoustic profilers for metocean data acquisition at tidal array sites. A case study of a recent operation based at the EMEC site, Orkneys, is used to illustrate the capabilities of the buoy.																			978-0-7918-5542-3				2013									V008T09A039									WOS:000360869000039

WEIBULL MULTIPLICATIVE MODEL AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR FULL-AUTOMATIC DARK-SPOT DETECTION FROM SAR IMAGES	SMPR CONFERENCE 2013	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				2nd International Conference on Sensors and Models in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (SMPR)	OCT 05-08, 2013	Univ Tehran, Tehran, IRAN	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing	Univ Tehran			As a major aspect of marine pollution, oil release into the sea has serious biological and environmental impacts. Among remote sensing systems (which is a tool that offers a non-destructive investigation method), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide valuable synoptic information about the position and size of the oil spill due to its wide area coverage and day/night, and all-weather capabilities. In this paper we present a new automated method for oil-spill monitoring. A new approach is based on the combination of Weibull Multiplicative Model and machine learning techniques to differentiate between dark spots and the background. First, the filter created based on Weibull Multiplicative Model is applied to each sub-image. Second, the sub-image is segmented by two different neural networks techniques (Pulsed Coupled Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks). As the last step, a very simple filtering process is used to eliminate the false targets. The proposed approaches were tested on 20 ENVISAT and ERS2 images which contained dark spots. The same parameters were used in all tests. For the overall dataset, the average accuracies of 94.05 % and 95.20 % were obtained for PCNN and MLP methods, respectively. The average computational time for dark-spot detection with a 256x256 image in about 4 s for PCNN segmentation using IDL software which is the fastest one in this field at present.

Large-scale physical gradients constrain seabird habitat. Birds however respond behaviourally to physical heterogeneity at much smaller scales. Here, we use, for the first time, three-dimensional GPS tracking of a seabird, the great frigatebird (Fregata minor), in the Mozambique Channel. These data, which provide at the same time high-resolution vertical and horizontal positions, allow us to relate the behaviour of frigatebirds to the physical environment at the (sub-)mesoscale (10-100 km, days-weeks). Behavioural patterns are classified based on the birds' vertical displacement (e. g. fast/slow ascents and descents), and are overlaid on maps of physical properties of the ocean-atmosphere interface, obtained by a nonlinear analysis of multi-satellite data. We find that frigatebirds modify their behaviours concurrently to transport and thermal fronts. Our results suggest that the birds' co-occurrence with these structures is a consequence of their search not only for food (preferentially searched over thermal fronts) but also for upward vertical wind. This is also supported by their relationship with mesoscale patterns of wind divergence. Our multi-disciplinary method can be applied to forthcoming high-resolution animal tracking data, and aims to provide a mechanistic understanding of animals' habitat choice and of marine ecosystem responses to environmental change.

In this study, we explore direct ground based remote sensing methods to assess the Aerosol-Cloud Indirect Effect directly, as space-borne retrievals are not directly suitable for simultaneous aerosol/cloud retrievals. To illustrate some of these difficulties, a statistical assessment of existing multispectral imagers on geostationary (e.g., GOES)/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite retrievals of the Cloud Droplet Effective Radius (R-eff) showed significant biases especially at larger solar zenith angles, further motivating the use of ground based remote sensing approaches. In particular, we discuss the potential of using a combined Microwave Radiometer (MWR)-Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) system for real-time monitoring of Cloud Optical Depth (COD) and Cloud Droplet Effective Radius (R-eff), which are combined with aerosol vertical properties from an aerosol lidar. An iterative approach combining the simultaneous observations from MFRSR and MWR are used to retrieve the COD and R-eff for thick cloud cases and are extensively validated using the DoE Southern Great Plains (SGP) retrievals as well as regression based parameterized model retrievals. In addition, we account for uncertainties in background aerosol, surface albedo and the combined measurement uncertainties from the MWR and MFRSR in order to provide realistic uncertainty estimates, which is found to be similar to 10% for the parameter range of interest in Aerosol-Cloud Interactions. Finally, we analyze a particular case of possible aerosol-cloud interaction described in the literature at the SGP site and demonstrate that aerosol properties obtained at the surface can lead to inconclusive results in comparison to lidar-derived aerosol properties near the cloud base.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Remote sensing of environmental indicators of potential fish aggregation: An overview	BALTICA												Sustainable use of marine resources requires effective monitoring and management of the world's fish stocks. Acoustic and electromagnetic remote sensing techniques are being used to help manage fisheries at sustainable levels, while also guiding fishing fleets to locate fish schools more efficiently. Fish tend to aggregate in ocean areas that exhibit conditions favored by specific fish species. Some of the relevant oceanographic conditions, such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (productivity) and oceanic fronts, which strongly influence natural fluctuations of fish stocks, can be observed and measured by remote sensors on satellites, aircraft and ships. The remotely sensed data are provided in near-real time to help fishermen save fuel and ship time during their search for fish, to modelers who produce fisheries forecasts, and to scientists who help develop strategies for sustainable fisheries management. This article describes how acoustic, optical and radar sensors on ships, satellites and aircraft are used with forecast models to improve the management and harvesting of fisheries resources.																	0067-3064					DEC	2012	25	2					99	112		10.5200/baltica.2012.25.10								WOS:000313402800002

Abiotic and biotic controls of cryptobenthic fish assemblages across a Caribbean seascape	CORAL REEFS												The majority of fish studies on coral reefs consider only non-cryptic species and, despite their functional importance, data on cryptic species are scarce. This study investigates inter-habitat variation in Caribbean cryptobenthic fishes by re-analysing a comprehensive data set from 58 rotenone stations around Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands. Boosted regression trees were used to associate the density and diversity of non-piscivorous cryptobenthic fishes, both in the entire data set and on reef habitats alone, with 14 abiotic and biotic variables. The study also models the habitat requirements of the three commonest species. Dead coral cover was the first or second most important variable in six of the eight models constructed. For example, within the entire data set, the number of species and total fish density increased approximately linearly with increasing dead coral cover. Dead coral was also important in multivariate analyses that discriminated 10 assemblages within the entire data set. On reef habitats, the number of species and total fish density increased dramatically when dead coral exceeded similar to 55 %. Live coral cover was typically less important for explaining variance in fish assemblages than dead coral, but live corals were important for maintaining high fish diversity. Coral species favoured by cryptobenthic species may be particularly susceptible to mortality, but dead coral may also provide abundant food and shelter for many fishes. Piscivore density was a key variable in the final models, but typically increased with increasing cryptobenthic fish diversity and abundance, suggesting both groups of fishes are responding to the same habitat variables. The density of territorial damselfishes reduced the number of cryptobenthic fish species on reef habitats. Finally, habitats delineated by standard remote sensing techniques supported distinct cryptobenthic fish assemblages, suggesting that such maps can be used as surrogates of general patterns of cryptic fish biodiversity in conservation planning.

Primary productivity and nitrogen fixation by Trichodesmium spp. in the Arabian Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Trichodesmium was studied with the purpose of understanding its distribution, organic production and nitrogen fixation in the Arabian Sea. Out of the 143 stations sampled, a total of 93 stations showed the presence of Trichodesmium filaments. Two species of Trichodesmium namely, T. thiebautii and T. erythraeum were found. These were distributed on the basis of the physico-chemical conditions of the Arabian Sea. This was the first time that we managed to detect and record the presence of Trichodesmium thiebautii bloom in the Arabian Sea at depths as deep as 60-70m. Total counts of Trichodesmium varied between 0 and 400737 filamentsL(-1). T. thiebautii developed in offshore waters during the fall intermonsoon, when the water temperature was around 28 degrees C and nitrate content was as low as 0.34 mu M.. After the northeast monsoon, Trichodesmium erythraeum developed in the offshore area and then spread to coastal waters. Both species of Trichodesmium together produced a total of 0.263 TgCyear(-1) and fixed a total of 0.2976TgNyear(-1) in the Arabian Sea. The study revealed that Trichodesmium was a major contributor to the organic matter productivity of the Arabian Sea during the period from November to April. The seasonality of the blooms of Trichodesmium is discussed with the help of Ocean Color Monitoring (OCM) data and biogeochemical implication of these findings in the Arabian Sea.

J	Dunhill, AM				Dunhill, Alexander M.			Problems with using rock outcrop area as a paleontological sampling proxy: rock outcrop and exposure area compared with coastal proximity, topography, land use, and lithology	PALEOBIOLOGY												Fossil specimens can be recovered easily only from exposed localities, so rock exposure area should represent a better proxy for rock availability than the frequently used outcrop (i.e., map) area. Data collected via remote sensing and GIS show that map area does not consistently correlate with exposure area in different regions. Proportional rock exposure is not geographically consistent and is influenced by a number of variables that are independent of outcrop area, including proximity to the coast, elevation, bedrock age, land use and lithology. These variables appear to be non-independent in their influence on rock exposure, and are not consistent in their effects across continents. The inconsistency in the correlation between outcrop and exposure area, and the variability in the influence of different factors on rock exposure, suggests that using outcrop area as a sampling proxy is poorly supported. The weaknesses in using outcrop area as a sampling proxy, highlighted by the lack of correlation with exposure area, suggest that a single accurate global sampling proxy may never be attained and it is premature to assume that paleodiversity curves can be corrected using such proxies. It is therefore preferable to work on a regional scale, comparing regional fossil collection data with a number of proxies representing all aspects of sampling. The lack of correlation between outcrop and exposure area suggests that the covariance detected between outcrop area and paleodiversity might be better explained by a common-cause model, and that geological megabiases may not have had as profound an effect on paleodiversity curves as previously thought.																	0094-8373	1938-5331				WIN	2012	38	1					126	143		10.1666/10062.1								WOS:000299063400008

The inferred interannual anomalies in phytoplankton size structure are related to those in sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface height (SSH), derived using satellite radiometry and altimetry, and stratification, derived using the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) database. In regions influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole, we observe a tight correlation between phytoplankton size structure and the physical variables, such that interannual variations in the physical variables accounts for up to 70% of the total variance in phytoplankton size structure. For much of the Indian Ocean, low temperature. low SSH and low stratification (indicative of a turbulent environment) are correlated with larger size classes, consistent with theories on coupling between physical-chemical processes and ecosystem structure. To the extent that phytoplankton function is related to its size structure, changes in physical forcing are likely to influence biogeochemical cycles in the region and the pelagic food web. The limitations of our approach are discussed and we highlight future challenges in satellite ocean-colour monitoring, should climate change lead to any modification in our marine ecosystem.

Interannual variation in commercial oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming in the sea (Florianopolis, Brazil, 27 degrees 44 ' S; 48 degrees 33 ' W) in relation to temperature, chlorophyll a and associated oceanographic conditions	AQUACULTURE												Aquaculture of filter-feeding bivalve mollusks involves the fruitful conversion of marine particulate organic matter into premium protein of high nutritive value. Culture performance of bivalves is largely dependent on hydrological conditions and directly affected by e. g. temperature and chlorophyll levels. Accordingly, these parameters may be related with seasonality but also with oceanographic features combined with climate events. Yields of Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas) reared at commercial procedures in suspended structures (long-lines) in a sheltered bay in Southern Brazil (Santa Catarina State, 27S 43'; 48 W 30') were evaluated in relation to local environmental conditions: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and associate effects of cold fronts events and El Nino and La Nina periods. Outputs from four consecutive commercial crop years were analyzed (2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09) in terms of oyster survival and development time during the following grow-out phases of the culture cycle: seed to juvenile, juvenile to adult, adult to marketable. Since culture management and genetics were standardized significant differences verified among crop performance could be mostly related to environmental effects. Time series of temperature and chlorophyll a (remote sensing data) from crop periods displayed significant seasonal and interannual variation. As expected, performance during initial grow-out stages (seed to juvenile) was critical for final crop yield. Temperature was the main factor affecting survival in these initial stages with a trend of negative correlation, though not statistically significant. On the other hand, oyster development rate was significantly and positively affected by chlorophyll a concentration. Chlorophyll a values could be increased by upwelled cold nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW, related to predominant Northern winds) though further dependent on occurrence of Southern winds (cold fronts) to assist seawater penetration into the sheltered farming area. Lower salinity nutrient-rich northward drifted waters from La Plata River discharge may also result in chlorophyll a rise in the farming area. The El Nino period (July 2006 to February 2007) coincided with lower chlorophyll a levels in the farming site that may be related to both decreased number of cold fronts as well as predominance of Northern winds that retain northward spreading of La Plata River discharge waters. In contrast, the La Nina period (August 2007 to June 2008) corresponded to higher chlorophyll a values in the farming area by both upwelling of SACW and penetration of La Plata River discharge water assisted by increased occurrence of Southern winds and cold fronts. The recognition of the potentially changing climate and effects upon the environment will be an important step in planning future development of bivalve aquaculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

RMS Titanic, Inc., has completed eight expeditions to RMS Titanic in its capacity as salvor-in-possession. These efforts include the first comprehensive remote-sensing survey of the shipwreck site in 2010. During this time, the company's focus has evolved from marine salvage to treatment of RMS Titanic as an archaeological site. An important tool in archaeological interpretation of historic shipwrecks is a geographic information system (GIS). In 2006, RMS Titanic, Inc., formally initiated the GIS-based Titanic Mapping Project. Components of the Titanic Mapping Project include data rescue, digital transfer of film media, design of GIS methodology, verification and rectification of positioning data from original field records, preparation of detailed profiles for all recovered artifacts, development of GIS attribute tables for recovered artifacts and key in situ site features, and integration of remote-sensing data from Titanic Expedition 2010. With information on over 5,500 accessioned artifacts organized within the GIS, the company looks forward to making substantive contributions to deepwater archaeological research and forensic investigations of the shipwreck site. In combination with current architectural- and engineering-related knowledge of RMS Titanic, new light can be cast on such topics as the wrecking event during that fateful night in 1912.																	0025-3324					NOV-DEC	2012	46	6					111	128		10.4031/MTSJ.46.6.8								WOS:000314448800011

Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a tool for mapping macroalgal habitats if the algal communities are spectrally resolvable. We compared the performance of three classification approaches to determine the distribution of macroalgae communities in the rocky intertidal zone of Heligoland, Germany, using airborne hyperspectral (AISA(eagle)) data. The classification results of two supervised approaches (maximum likelihood classifier and spectral angle mapping) are compared with an approach combining k-Means classification of derivative measures. We identified regions of different slopes between main pigment absorption features of macroalgae and classified the resulting slope bands. The maximum likelihood classifier gained the best results (Cohan's kappa = 0.81), but the new approach turned out as a time-effective possibility to identify the dominating macroalgae species with sufficient accuracy (Cohan's kappa = 0.77), even in the heterogeneous and patchy coverage of the study area.

Historically this had been difficult in marine environments until the advancement of acoustic sensors. This study demonstrates the applicability of supervised learning techniques for benthic habitat characterization using angular backscatter response data. With the advancement of multibeam echo-sounder (MBES) technology, full coverage datasets of physical structure over vast regions of the seafloor are now achievable. Supervised learning methods typically applied to terrestrial remote sensing provide a cost-effective approach for habitat characterization in marine systems. However the comparison of the relative performance of different classifiers using acoustic data is limited. Characterization of acoustic backscatter data from MBES using four different supervised learning methods to generate benthic habitat maps is presented. Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Quick, Unbiased, Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were evaluated to classify angular backscatter response into habitat classes using training data acquired from underwater video observations. Results for biota classifications indicated that SVM and RF produced the highest accuracies, followed by QUEST and MLC, respectively. The most important backscatter data were from the moderate incidence angles between 30 degrees and 50 degrees. This study presents initial results for understanding how acoustic backscatter from MBES can be optimized for the characterization of marine benthic biological habitats.

Thus, a large-scale analysis of the spatial patterns of coastal marine habitats makes it possible to adequately estimate the status of valuable coastal marine habitats, provide better evidence for environmental changes, and describe the processes behind the changes. Knowing the spatial distribution of benthic habitats is also important from the coastal management point of view. Our previous results clearly demonstrated that remote sensing methods can be used to map water depth and distribution of taxonomic groups of benthic algae (e.g., red, green, and brown algae) in the optically complex coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. We have as well shown that benthic habitat mapping should be done at high spatial resolution owing to the small-scale heterogeneity of such habitats in Estonian coastal waters. Here we tested the capability of high spatial resolution hyperspectral airborne image in its application for mapping benthic habitats. A big challenge is to define appropriate mapping classes that are also meaningful from the ecological point of view. In this study two benthic habitat classification schemes-broader level and finer level-were defined for the study area. The broader level classes were relatively well classified, but discrimination among the units of the finer classification scheme posed a considerable challenge and required a careful approach. Benthic habitat classification provided the highest accuracy in the case of the Spectral Angle Mapper classification method applied to a radiometrically corrected image. Further processing levels, such as spatial filtering and glint correction, decreased the classification accuracy.

J	Boyce, DG; Lewis, M; Worm, B				Boyce, Daniel G.; Lewis, Marlon; Worm, Boris			Integrating global chlorophyll data from 1890 to 2010	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Understanding large-scale phytoplankton dynamics requires accurate, multi-decadal measurements of abundance and distribution. Since 1890, marine phytoplankton abundance has been assessed using a diverse range of sensors and observational platforms, and inter-calibrating these data have been challenging. Consequently, syntheses of historical phytoplankton data have been rarely attempted, and the need for accurate, long-term assessments of phytoplankton abundance and distribution is commonly acknowledged. Here, we derive quantitative indices of phytoplankton abundance from measurements of upper ocean transparency and color-calibrated with direct measurements of surface chlorophyll. The strong correlation and linear scaling of the predicted data enabled the construction of a comprehensive, globally intercalibrated chlorophyll time series from 1890 to 2010. The calibrated chlorophyll data reproduced the well-established spatial features of phytoplankton surface biomass and were strongly correlated with chlorophyll concentration derived from two independent remote sensing platforms discontinuously available since 1978. These results suggest that with careful statistical treatment it is possible to generate a globally integrated chlorophyll time series extending 120 years into the past. This database, which is available in the web appendices of this paper, may enable new insights in the areas of climate science, biogeochemical cycling, and marine ecosystem structure and functioning over the past century.																	1541-5856					NOV	2012	10						840	852		10.4319/lom.2012.10.840								WOS:000312067700003

The measurement of phytoplankton biomass using flow-cytometric sorting and elemental analysis of carbon	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Phytoplankton are one of a multitude of particle types in the marine environment that contribute to the particulate organic carbon pool. Current methods for estimating phytoplankton carbon (C phyto) in the field rely on proxy measurements, such as chlorophyll or cell biovolume conversions. Other means of estimating C phyto include remote-sensing applications that convert optical properties, such as chlorophyll fluorescence or particulate backscattering, into biomass. These values, however, are not well constrained due to the variability of phytoplankton physiology (i.e., internal pigment concentrations) and the lack of field data for validating C phyto retrievals. Here we introduce a method that uses flow cytometry to isolate phytoplankton from the total particle field. Phytoplankton samples are then analyzed for total carbon content. Analyses of laboratory cultures of Synechococcus, Micromonas pusilla, and Thalassiosira pseudonana indicate that this method allows elemental analysis of phytoplankton cells in the absence of unwanted particles. Tests of field samples show that the structure of the natural community is retained in a sorted sample. The acquisition of C phyto data using this method will 1) benefit remote-sensing applications by allowing more thorough validation of phytoplankton carbon estimates from space, 2) improve our knowledge of phytoplankton stoichiometry, and 3) provide a better understanding of phytoplankton physiological responses to environmental forces.																	1541-5856					NOV	2012	10						910	920		10.4319/lom.2012.10.910								WOS:000312067700009

Spatial ecology of krill, micronekton and top predators in the central California Current: Implications for defining ecologically important areas	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Marine spatial planning and ecosystem models that aim to predict and protect fisheries and wildlife benefit greatly from syntheses of empirical information on physical and biological partitioning of marine ecosystems. Here, we develop spatially-explicit oceanographic and ecological descriptions of the central California Current region. To partition this region, we integrate data from 20 years of shipboard surveys with satellite remote-sensing to characterize local seascapes of ecological significance, focusing on krill, other micronekton taxa, and top predators (seabirds and marine mammals). Specifically, we investigate if micronekton and predator assemblages co-vary spatially with mesoscale oceanographic conditions. The first principal component of environmental and micronekton seascapes indicates significant coupling between physics, primary productivity, and secondary and tertiary marine consumers. Subsequent principal components indicate latitudinal variability in niche-community space due to varying habitat characteristics between Monterey Bay (deep submarine canyon system) and the Gulf of the Farallones (extensive continental shelf), even though both of these sub-regions are located downstream from upwelling centers. Overall, we identified five ecologically important areas based on spatial integration of environmental and biotic features. These areas, characterized by proximity to upwelling centers, shallow pycnoclines, and high chlorophyll-a and krill concentrations, are potential areas of elevated trophic focusing for specific epipelagic and mesopelagic communities. This synthesis will benefit ecosystem-based management approaches for the central California Current, a region long-impacted by anthropogenic factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Retrieval of the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda) in open and coastal ocean waters using a neural network inversion	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d(lambda) is a fundamental radiometric parameter that is used to assess the light availability in the water column. A neural network approach is developed to assess K-d(lambda) at any visible wavelengths from the remote sensing reflectances as measured by the SeaWiFS satellite sensor. The neural network (NN) inversion is trained using a combination of simulated and in-situ data sets covering a broad range of K-d(lambda), between 0.0073 m(-1) at 412 nm and 12.41 m(-1) at 510 nm. The performance of the retrieval is evaluated against two data sets, one consisting of mainly synthetic data while the other one contains in-situ data only and is compared to those obtained with previous published empirical (NASA, Morel and Maritorena (2001) and Zhang and Fell (2007)) and semi-analytical (Lee et al., 2005b) algorithms. On the in-situ data set from the COASTLOOC campaign, the retrieval accuracy of the present algorithm is quite similar to published algorithms for oligotrophic and mesotrophic ocean waters. But for Kd(490) > 0.25 m(-1), the NN approach allows to retrieve Kd(490) with a much better accuracy than the four other methods. The results are consistent when compared with other SeaWiFS wavelengths. This new inversion is as suitable in the open ocean waters as in the turbid waters. The work here is straightforwardly applicable to the MERIS sensor and with few changes to the MODIS-AQUA sensor. The algorithm in matlab and C code is provided as auxiliary material.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 27	2012	117								C10023	10.1029/2012JC008076								WOS:000310344200001

A study of how marine low-level clouds over Barents Sea and the northern parts of the Norwegian Sea are affected by air mass origin has been performed by combining ground-based aerosol measurements with satellite cloud retrievals. Aerosol number size distributions have been obtained from measurement stations in northern Finland, and a trajectory model has been used to estimate the movement of the air masses. To identify anthropogenic influences on the clouds, the dataset has been divided according to aerosol loading. The clean air masses arrived to the investigation area from the north and the polluted air masses arrived from the south. Satellite derived microphysical and optical cloud parameters from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) have then been analyzed for days when the trajectories coincided with marine low-level clouds over the investigated area. The cloud optical thickness (tau), cloud depth (H) and droplet number concentration (N-d) were significantly higher for the polluted days compared to the clean conditions, while the opposite was found for the cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)). The H and N-d were derived from the satellite retrievals of tau and r(e). Furthermore, calculations of the aerosol cloud interaction relationship (ACI), relating N-d to boundary layer aerosol concentrations, resulted in a value of 0.17, which is in line with previous remote sensing studies. The results demonstrate that ground-based aerosol measurements can be combined with satellite cloud observations to study the indirect aerosol effect, and that the microphysics of marine sub-polar clouds can be considerably affected by continental aerosols.

J	Veitch, SA; Nettles, M				Veitch, Stephen A.; Nettles, Meredith			Spatial and temporal variations in Greenland glacial-earthquake activity, 1993-2010	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Glacial earthquakes are anomalous earthquakes associated with large ice-loss events occurring at marine-terminating glaciers, primarily in Greenland. They are detectable teleseismically, and a proper understanding of the source mechanism may provide a remote-sensing tool to complement glaciological observations of these large outlet glaciers. We model teleseismic surface-wave waveforms to obtain locations and centroid-single-force source parameters for 121 glacial earthquakes occurring in Greenland during the period 2006-2010. We combine these results with those obtained by previous workers to analyze spatial and temporal trends in glacial-earthquake occurrence over the 18-year period from 1993-2010. We also examine earthquake occurrence at six individual glaciers, comparing the earthquake record to independently obtained observations of glacier change. Our findings confirm the inference that glacial-earthquake seismogenesis occurs through the capsize of large, newly calved icebergs. We find a close correspondence between episodes of glacier retreat, thinning, and acceleration and the timing of glacial earthquakes, and document the northward progression of glacial earthquakes on Greenland's west coast over the 18-year observing period. Our results also show that glacial earthquakes occur when the termini of the source glaciers are very close to the glacier grounding line, i.e., when the glaciers are grounded or nearly grounded.

J	Ostrowska, M				Ostrowska, Miroslawa			Model of the dependence of the sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence quantum yield on the environmental factors in the sea	OPTICS EXPRESS												The paper discusses a physical model, obtained with the aid of statistical analyses, of the relationships between the sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence quantum yield and marine environmental factors. The relationships are based on a large set of empirical data from various ocean regions with basins of different trophicity, at different depths and in different seasons. Underwater spectral radiance and irradiance in the PAR spectral range were used to determine the quantum yield of sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence. From a statistical analysis a preliminary mathematical expression was derived to describe the fluorescence quantum yield as a function of the scalar irradiance, basin trophicity and the water temperature in situ. These relationships may be useful for analysing the budget of the light energy absorbed by phytoplankton pigments utilized in chemical and non-chemical quenching.

Estimating Coastal Lagoon Tidal Flooding and Repletion with Multidate ASTER Thermal Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Coastal lagoons mix inflowing freshwater and tidal marine waters in complex spatial patterns. This project sought to detect and measure temperature and spatial variability of flood tides for a constricted coastal lagoon using multitemporal remote sensing. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared data provided estimates of surface temperature for delineation of repletion zones in portions of Chincoteague Bay, Virginia. ASTER high spatial resolution sea-surface temperature imagery in conjunction with in situ observations and tidal predictions helped determine the optimal seasonal data for analyses. The selected time series ASTER satellite data sets were analyzed at different tidal phases and seasons in 2004-2006. Skin surface temperatures of ocean and estuarine waters were differentiated by flood tidal penetration and ebb flows. Spatially variable tidal flood penetration was evaluated using discrete seed-pixel area analysis and time series Principal Components Analysis. Results from these techniques provide spatial extent and variability dynamics of tidal repletion, flushing, and mixing, important factors in eutrophication assessment, water quality and resource monitoring, and application of hydrodynamic modeling for coastal estuary science and management.																	2072-4292					OCT	2012	4	10					3110	3126		10.3390/rs4103110								WOS:000313914100011

The performances of three operational algorithms (OC4v6, OC3Mv6, OC4Mev6), two Arctic adapted algorithms (OC4L, OC4P), and one semi-analytical (GSM01) algorithm to estimate Chla were evaluated using in situ measurements collected in the southeastern Beaufort Sea. All evaluated algorithms clearly overestimated Chla by a factor of three to five. A high contribution of colored dissolved organic matter and nonalgal particles to the blue light absorption appeared as the source of that poor performance. It was also found that fluorometrically measured Chla were two times greater than those determined from high-performance liquid chromatography, contributing to the observed discrepancies between our findings and previous studies carried out in the Arctic. We propose regionally adapted and new algorithms allowing accurate estimation of Chla in the southeastern Beaufort Sea. Finally, a matchup analysis of coincident in situ data and satellite overpass showed that the normalized water-leaving reflectance and the blue-to-green ratio retrieval were more accurate for SeaWiFS than for MODIS and MERIS.																	0703-8992	1712-7971				OCT	2012	38	5					535	556										WOS:000312838600001

Results of the PCA showed that monthly variations in catch per unit effort (CPUE) values were significantly correlated with the sea surface temperature (SST), subsurface temperature at 105 m, thermocline depth (horizontal) gradient magnitude, chlorophyll-a concentration, and fish size. April and May were the warmest months of the year in terms of the SST, and the thermocline was generally deep. After July, a drop in the temperature below the preferred temperature range for YET is probably the reason that the CPUE subsequently decreased in the period of 1998-2003. It was suggested that the CPUE by age at a given time was significantly affected by chlorophyll-a concentrations 1-3 months prior to that time. The lower thermocline depth gradient magnitude enhanced the aggregation density of YFT in 2004 which showed that the high catch and high CPUE of the YFT fishery increased from the western to the eastern Arabian Sea.

Comparing the information content of coral reef geomorphological and biological habitat maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

Remote sensing of a film layer of marine surface in the IR spectral range	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS												The reflectance and temperature of the boundary surface layer of marine surface are determined under natural conditions in the presence of the wind wave using the remote sensing of the radiation of marine surface and atmosphere in the IR spectral range. The permittivity of water is determined in the layer where the radiation is generated (1.5-2.0 thicknesses of skin layer). It is demonstrated that the permittivity of the film layer under natural conditions is a variable quantity that is less than the permittivity of sea water in the laboratory measurements, which is employed in the conventional procedures for the determination of the ocean temperature fields. The data of the measurements under natural conditions are interpreted using the model of a single layer with the skin-layer thickness of at least 10 mu m that contains a static mixture of water and air microbubbles formed under the surface-tension film.

The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) provides continuous high-resolution vertical profiles of aerosol properties on a near-global scale. Here the CALIPSO Vertical Feature Mask is used to document the three-dimensional (3D) frequency-of-occurrence distribution of aerosols over a broad region of the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. The 3D distributions illustrate the seasonal cycle in the zonal and meridional variability of the vertical profiles of mineral dust, biomass-burning smoke, polluted dust (external mixture of dust and smoke), and polluted continental aerosol, and also of their emissions sources and transport pathways. Four aerosol domains stand out in the product: dust over North Africa and the Middle East and smoke over southern Africa and South America. The transport pathways of African dust and smoke over the Atlantic are evident. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) plays a clear role in limiting the southward transport of North African dust and northward transport of South African smoke. Dust and smoke are mixed in the ITCZ and consequently the highest probability of polluted dust is found there, even though the probabilities of dust and smoke in this region are relatively low. The mixing of dust and pollution has significant implications for cloud microphysical processes over a broad region of the Atlantic.

Optical and radar remote sensing can be used to observe landslide-induced ground deformation, ranging from regional to local scales. This work presents a methodology called Landslide HotSpot Mapping; this approach integrates cartographic, thematic and optical data with Persistent Scatterer Interferometry for the identification of extremely slow to very slow moving landslides, and for the evaluation of their state of activity and intensity. This methodology scans wide areas to detect hotspots, which are narrow unstable zones characterized by higher landslide hazard. To these hotspots, priority has to be given when planning field surveys and in situ validation campaigns, so that field work time and effort can be optimized and significantly reduced. The approach is tested in Central Calabria, over a 4,470 km(2) area located in southern Italy. ENVISAT ascending images acquired between 2003 and 2009 and processed with the Persistent Scatterer Pairs (PSP) technique are used to analyse deformation patterns. Combining conventional photo-interpretation with the analysis of PSP data, 64 new landslides are identified and the spatial (boundaries) and temporal (activity) information of 980 pre-mapped phenomena (23.6% of updated inventory) are updated. 1,012 active (continuous or reactivated) landslides are identified and 4 hotspot areas selected: San Fili, Rende, Lago, Catanzaro. Urgent field checks have to be organized for these hotspots to validate the satellite-based observations and to design appropriate mitigation measures to reduce impacts on the elements at risk.

Health monitoring of fluid dampers for vibration control of structures: experimental investigation	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS												This paper presents results from a comprehensive experimental program on medium-size and large-size fluid dampers in an effort to extract their force output during cyclic loading by simply measuring the strain on the damper housing and the end-spacer of the damper. The paper first discusses the stress path within the damper and, subsequently via the use of linear elasticity, shows that the experimental data obtained with commercially available strain gauges yield a force output of the damper that is in good agreement with the readings from the load cell. This comparison is achieved via the use of a position and velocity transducer, which combines good accuracy together with robust performance in a marine environment. The paper then examines the performance of a portable data acquisition system that can be used to collect and transmit data from a damper installed on a bridge to a nearby location (order of a km) where data are collected via either a wired or a wireless Local Area Network (LAN). Alternatively, the data may be transmitted to any remote location via mobile telecommunication networks; however, this requires leased telephone lines. The data show that the proposed arrangement is promising for monitoring in situ the force output of fluid dampers and detecting possible loss of their energy dissipation capability.

J	Solberg, AHS				Solberg, Anne H. Schistad			Remote Sensing of Ocean Oil-Spill Pollution	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE												Oil spills on the sea surface are observed relatively often. Pollution due to either accidents or deliberate oily discharges from ships represents a serious threat to the marine environment. Operational oil spill monitoring is currently done using a combination of satellite monitoring and aircraft surveillance. The combined use of satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and aircraft surveillance flights is a cost-effective way to monitor oil spills in large ocean areas and catch the polluters. SAR images enable covering large areas, but aircraft observations are needed to prosecute the polluter, and in certain cases to verity the oil spill. Traditionally, oil spill detection is based on single polarization SAR images. Oil spills can be discriminated from look-alikes based on a set of features describing the contrast, shape, homogeneity, source, and surroundings of the slick. Good performance is reported for single-polarization oil spill detection, but in certain cases the oil slicks cannot be discriminated from biogenic films. In the recent years, a number of studies have shown that polarimetric SAR can improve the discrimination between oil slicks and biogenic films. Several features computed from dual-pol or quad-pol images have been proposed. These include both quad-pol features like polarimetric entropy and anisotropy, mean scattering angle, polarimetric span, conformity coefficient, as well as the dual-pol features standard deviation of the copolarized phase difference and the copolarized correlation coefficient. As dual-pol SAR imagery is now available on a regular basis from Cosmo Skymed and TerraSAR-X, and quad-pol data are available from RADARSAT-2, polarimetric SAR can now be utilized on a more regular basis. Optical data from sensors like Aqua MODIS and ENVISAT MERIS can be a useful supplement under certain cloud-free conditions.																	0018-9219	1558-2256				OCT	2012	100	10			SI		2931	2945		10.1109/JPROC.2012.2196250								WOS:000308996200012

We describe two case studies of the combined measurements made in two coastal zones in Crete in 2006 and in Rozewie on the Baltic Sea in 2009. The combination of lidar and sun photometer measurements provides comprehensive information on both the total aerosol optical thickness in the entire atmosphere as well as the vertical structure of aerosol optical properties. Combination of such information with air mass back-trajectories and data collected at stations located on the route of air masses provides complete picture of the aerosol variations in the study area both vertically and horizontally. We show that such combined studies are especially important in the coastal areas where depending on air mass advection directions and altitudes the influence of fine or coarse mode (in this case possibly sea-salt) particles on the vertical structure of aerosol optical properties is an important issue to consider.

Although experienced observers are a spill response's mainstay, few trained observers and confounding factors including weather, oil emulsification, and scene illumination geometry present challenges. DWH spill and impact monitoring was aided by extensive airborne and spaceborne passive and active remote sensing. Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (>0.1 mm) slicks from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach based on the shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response thickness class maps. Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however. SAR generally cannot discriminate thick (> 100 mu m) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0.1 mu m). The UAVSAR's (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related to a combination of oil slick thickness, fractional Surface coverage, and emulsification. In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with AVIRIS and corroborated spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. CALIPSO and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation. Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as MODIS thermal data. However, interpretation challenges and a lack of Rapid Response Products prevented significant use. Rapid Response Products were key to response utilization data needs are time critical; thus, a high technological readiness level is critical to operational use of remote sensing products. DWH's experience demonstrated that development and operationalization of new spill response remote sensing tools must precede the next major oil spill. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Considered MLP products are chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a), absorption by yellow substance at 412 nm (a(ys)(412)) and concentration of total suspended matter (TSM), all determined from spectral remote sensing reflectance R-RS. Investigated oceanographic regions comprise the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the northern Adriatic Sea, the Westem Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. The in situ measurements applied in the study were produced within the framework of the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (COASTS) and Rio-Optical Mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs contributing to a unique dataset that represents different water types including chlorophyll a, yellow substance and sediment dominated waters. Performance analysis of the proposed regional MLPs indicates that Chl-a can be quantified with the highest accuracy in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (with absolute percent difference of 14% with respect to in situ measurements). In the case of a(ys)(412), the most accurate determination is observed for the Baltic Sea waters (13%). Instead, TSM retrieval is the most accurate in the Black Sea (14%). The study demonstrated the limited generalization capability of regional algorithms.

Diurnal variability of turbidity and light attenuation in the southern North Sea from the SEVIRI geostationary sensor	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This study follows up on the successful feasibility study of Neukermans et al. (2009) for mapping suspended matter in turbid waters from the SEVIRI sensor on board the METEOSAT geostationary weather satellite platform. Previous methodology is extended to the mapping of turbidity. T, and vertical attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), K-PAR. The spatial resolution of the SEVIRI products is improved from 3 km x 6.5 km to 1 km x 2 km using the broad high resolution visual band. The previous atmospheric correction is further improved and the uncertainties on marine reflectance due to digitization are considered. Based on a two year archive of SEVIRI imagery, available every 15 min, the diurnal variability of T and K-PAR is investigated during cloud free periods and validated using half-hourly T and K-PAR data obtained from a system of moored buoys (SmartBuoys) in the southern North Sea. Based on numerous match-ups, 80% of SEVIRI derived T and K-PAR are within 53% and 39% of SmartBuoy T and K-PAR, respectively. Results further show that on cloud free days, the SEVIRI T and Km signals are in phase with the SmartBuoy data, with an average difference in the timing of the maximum T and K-PAR of 11 min and 23 min, respectively. It is concluded that diurnal variability of T and K-PAR can now be mapped by remote sensing offering new opportunities for improving ecosystem models and monitoring of turbidity. Limitations of the current SEVIRI sensor and perspectives for design of future geostationary sensors and synergy with polar orbiting satellites are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Hydrodynamics and Marine Optics during Cold Fronts at Santa Rosa Island, Florida	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Observations of optical and hydrodynamic processes were made on the open beach on Santa Rosa Island, Florida, in March 1995. This study focuses on the passage of two cold fronts. The observations have been supplemented by a bio-optical model; a suite of hydrodynamic models to simulate coastal flows forced by waves, tides, local wind, and coastal sea level; and a gee-optical model that predicts scattering by mineral particles resuspended by wave action. These models have been used to examine the interaction of atmospheric forcing and hydrodynamics with respect to the observed marine hydrosol. The optical and hydrodynamic measurements, and the model results, have been used to conceive a cold-front regime model of the hydrosol for open beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. The optical environment during the cold front was determined by three hydrosol phases: (1) a prefrontal steady-state hydrosol consisting of fine resuspended mineral particles, phytoplankton cells, organic detritus, and colored dissolved organic matter; (2) a frontal phase dominated by resuspended mineral particles; and (3) a postfrontal hydrosol containing large phytoplankton, detritus, and fine mineral particles. This concept is useful for identifying the physical processes responsible for observed optical properties. It should be applicable to other regions and types of events.																	0749-0208					SEP	2012	28	5					1073	1087		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00179.1								WOS:000308774400010

A global analysis of ENSO synchrony: The oceans' biological response to physical forcing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A global-scale Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of physical (sea surface temperatures, sea level height anomalies, atmospheric sea level pressure, photosynthetically active radiation, zonal surface currents and wind-driven upwelling velocities) and biological (surface chlorophyll concentrations and primary production) variables shows synchronous variations from 1993 to 2010 in the first mode of variability associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The first EOF of vertical temperature structure along the equatorial Pacific shows identical temporal patterns. The ENSO-driven biological changes are explained both qualitatively and quantitatively from a subset of the physical variables. During the strong 1997-1998 El Nino a global new production decrease of similar to 0.6-0.9 PgC yr(-1) is estimated from changes in the depth of the nutricline and wind-driven upwelling. This is consistent with the 3.0 PgC yr(-1) decrease in global primary production observed by satellite remote sensing. A simple two-layer model of chlorophyll and primary production driven by changes in nitrate and light reproduces the patterns and magnitude of changes observed by satellite. Changes in the depth of the nutricline are found to be the primary driver of the biological anomalies. The ENSO mode of zonal currents in the equatorial Pacific shows that horizontal advection is responsible for changes in chlorophyll in the central Pacific not explained by the two-layer model.

TMOOS has been operating gliders in the Western Mediterranean Sea since 2006 and has set-up electronic and maintenance laboratories in order to establish a key glider port in the area. Twenty-two glider missions have been performed to date and over 17000 hydrographic and biogeochemical profiles collected. TMOOS is using gliders for operational, technological and scientific objectives. Studies of path planning analysis and adaptive sampling for gliders in combination with other platforms have been undertaken and new methodologies have been developed to process data from gliders. Thus far, IMEDEA gliders have contributed to the better understanding of mesoscale processes in the upper ocean, including the coupling between the physical and biogeochemical process of the marine ecosystem and, in combination with remote sensing observations, high-resolution glider data has enabled advances in new methodologies to improve coastal altimetry. Gliders have also proved to be important platforms for the development of operational oceanography tools and useful vehicles on which to test and implement new sensors for ocean monitoring.

J	Farhan, AR; Lim, S				Farhan, A. R.; Lim, S.			Vulnerability assessment of ecological conditions in Seribu Islands, Indonesia	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The sustainability in the marine and coastal environment was conceptualized significantly since the Earth Summit in 1992 where Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was proposed as one of the solutions that can support the decision makers to work together and provide decisive actions for the better coastal management. A right balance between the socio-economic growth and the environmental protection is the most important goal in the coastal management. In order to achieve the goal, a framework-based strategy, financial planning and policy enforcement must be implemented in the coastal management. Indonesia as one of the archipelagic states has adopted this concept within two Indonesian cooperation laws which were intended to enable the Indonesian government to manage the coastal areas more responsibly and accountably in the aim for the improved environment for future generations. Since the endorsement of those laws, however, the implementation has been lagging and the Indonesia government's focus is rather on the land-based development despite the consequence of the negligence in the coastal management. This is evident in the impact on the coastal environment that is caused by rapid and ill-planned developments in Indonesian coastal regions. As a result, Indonesia already lost four islands associated with Seribu Islands by 1999. It proves that Seribu Islands lack in the policy enforcement and were unnoticed by both the central government and the local government. This paper aims to assess the ecological vulnerability with a focus on coral reefs in Seribu Islands using Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing technologies. From the study results, it can be summarized that the urban pressures and pollutants from four main rivers in Jakarta Bay and Banten Province played a significant role in the environmental degradation. Most of the islands associated with Seribu Islands are at risk, if the urban development continues. The vulnerability analysis of Seribu Islands can assist the decision makers to prepare pivotal actions in order to adapt the changes and develop essential recovery programs for the region.

Uncertainties in the determination of global sub-micron marine organic matter emissions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Organic matter (OM) constitutes an important contribution to the composition of sub-micron sea-spray aerosol produced from biologically active waters. However. OM emission estimates vary by more than an order of magnitude. To estimate the uncertainties in the OM production estimates a sensitivity analysis has been performed in which various parameters have been varied. These include different sea-spray source functions, satellite-retrieved chlorophyll distributions, and a relationship correlating in situ organic mass measurements with satellite-retrieved chlorophyll data. The starting point was a baseline model from which the annual global emission of the water insoluble organic matter (WIOM) fraction in sea spray has been estimated to be 20.4 Tg. In this baseline the global WIOM emission is dominated by the contribution (80%) of the chlorophyll-poor regions (<0.3 mg m(-3)). Significant deviations from this estimate are introduced by the choice of the sea-spray source function and the assumed background organic mass fraction, each of which leads to an uncertainty of at least a factor of 2. In particular the chlorophyll-poor regions which dominate the WIOM contribution are strongly affected by the choice of the organic mass fraction parameterisation. The way the chlorophyll data are handled, such as different gap filling approaches, causes deviations in the OM emission that are in the order of 10% and is therefore of less importance. The present research indicates that special attention should be given to the low chlorophyll areas in e.g. the tropics, since there the parameterisations are most uncertain and at the same time these regions dominate total WIOM emissions.

The light signal recorded at eight wavelengths by the sensor allows, after correction for Solar illumination and atmospheric effects, the retrieval of coloured biogeochemical products such as the chlorophyll, suspended sediment and coloured dissolved organic matter concentrations every hour between 9: 00 am and 4: 00 pm local time around the Korean peninsula. However operational exploitation of the mission needs beforehand a sound validation of first the radiometric calibration, i.e. inspection of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and second atmospheric corrections for retrieval of the water-leaving reflectance at sea surface. This study constitutes a contribution to the quality assessment of the GOCI radiometric products generated by the Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) through comparison with concurrent data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, NASA) and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS, ESA) sensors as well as in situ measurements. These comparisons are made with spatially and temporally collocated data. We focus on Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho(RC)) and normalized remote-sensing marine reflectance (nRrs). Although GOCI compares reasonably well with MERIS and MODIS, what demonstrates the success of Ocean Colour in geostationary orbit, we show that the current GOCI atmospheric correction systematically masks out data over very turbid waters and needs further examination and correction for future release of the GOCI products.

Using passive remote sensing to retrieve the vertical variation of cloud droplet size in marine stratocumulus: An assessment of information content and the potential for improved retrievals from hyperspectral measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We present a theoretical study into the information content of solar reflectance measurements at multiple near-infrared wavelengths in the context of deriving the vertical variation of cloud droplet size from marine stratocumulus. We employ a Bayesian optimal estimation approach to retrieve a profile of droplet effective radius as a function of optical depth in the cloud. This allows an assessment of the information content of the measurement of reflectance at different wavelengths and the potential for a new generation of hyperspectral sensors to improve the retrieval. Our results show that using the three absorbing near-infrared channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) centered at 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m a retrieval of droplet sizes lower in the cloud is highly sensitive to small changes in reflectance. Consequently instrument and modeling errors must be reduced to <1% in order to gain a useful uncertainty constraint on droplet size near to cloud base. By introducing many high spectral resolution wavelength channels, such as those available from hyperspectral sensors, we find that the information content pertaining to all retrieval variables increases significantly. This results in a reduction in the uncertainty estimates on all retrieved quantities. We also test the ability of a vertical profile retrieval to provide improved liquid water path estimates by using several in situ profiling measurements of marine stratocumulus in the South-East Pacific region. We find that a vertical profile retrieval significantly improves the liquid water path estimate when compared to a two-band lookup table retrieval.

J	Brunelle, CB; Larouche, P; Gosselin, M				Brunelle, Corinne B.; Larouche, Pierre; Gosselin, Michel			Variability of phytoplankton light absorption in Canadian Arctic seas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Phytoplankton light absorption spectra (a(phi)(lambda)) were measured in the Canadian Arctic (i.e., the Amundsen Gulf, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, northern Baffin Bay and the Hudson Bay system) to improve algorithms used in remote-sensing models of primary production. The absorption by algae, dominated by picophytoplankton (<5 mu m), was not the major light absorption factor in the four provinces; the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) contributed up to 70% of total light absorption. During the fall, the low total chlorophyll a-specific a(phi)*(443) (a(phi)(443)/TChl a) coefficients of the Canadian High Arctic were associated with photoacclimation processes (i.e., the package effect) occurring in light-limited environments. Low light availability and high proportion of CDOM (absorbing strongly the ultraviolet) seem to allow the growth of phytoplankton with accessory pigments absorbing light at longer wavelengths. The ratio of photoprotective and photosynthetic carotenoids (PPC:PSC) was inversely proportional with the salinity and the cell size, and mostly decreases throughout the Canadian High Arctic during fall. In return, the highest TChl a-specific phytoplankton light absorption coefficients at the blue peak (a(phi)*(443)) were observed in the Hudson Bay system from September to October (i.e., fall) as well as in the Amundsen Gulf from May to July (i.e., spring/summer). These results will ultimately allow the accurate monitoring of phytoplankton biomass and productivity evolution that is likely to take place as a result of the fast-changing Arctic environment.

J	Collin, A; Long, B; Archambault, P				Collin, Antoine; Long, Bernard; Archambault, Phillippe			Merging land-marine realms: Spatial patterns of seamless coastal habitats using a multispectral LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A lack of spatially, structurally and thematically accurate habitat data complicates conservation and management planning as well as ecological research within structurally complex littoral enviromnents. The Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Survey (SHOALS) has considerable potential to provide such data, by means of its proficiency in generating high-resolution measurements of emerged and immersed elevations and to create thematic maps. Return signals, i.e., waveforms, contain signatures and structural information of salt-marsh and benthic cover. This paper focuses on the capability of the SHOALS to assess the structural complexity of emerged and immersed coastal habitats, and to define the contribution of SHOALS data, both elevation and intensity, in order to accurately and seamlessly map these habitats from supratidal to nearshore levels. The study area was selected based upon the variety of littoral cover types, encompassing kelp habitat, eelgrass meadow, beach, salt-marsh, farm and urban coastal environments. Firstly, the LiDAR-derived green waveform, through an ad hoc decision-tree, satisfactorily assessed the structural complexity of littoral habitats (r = 0.75, p<0.01). Secondly, synergistic combination between NDLVI (LiDAR-derived red and near-infrared data) and topographic/bathymetric surfaces (LiDAR-derived near-infrared and green, respectively) enabled the accurate mapping of 19 littoral habitats (overall accuracy and kappa coefficient equaled to 90.09% and 0.8883, respectively). Accordingly, a single multispectral (three bands) LiDAR survey holds significant potential for monitoring small-scale structural complexity, as well as constructing spatially and temporally seamless patterns of coastal habitats.

Remotely sensed estimates of surface salinity in the Chesapeake Bay: A statistical approach	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In coastal and estuarine environments, near-surface salinity varies significantly in space and time. As absolute salinity and salinity gradients are central to many physical and ecological processes in these environments, reliable and consistent salinity estimates are a priority for marine research and application communities. Satellite remote sensing has a great potential to meet this need, yet sensors and algorithms designed to monitor open ocean salinity are typically ill-suited for high resolution applications to coastlines and estuaries. Here we present results of multiple statistical models that predict daily. gridded surface salinity at 1 km resolution across Chesapeake Bay as a function of level 2 surface reflectance estimates from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard the Aqua platform. Eight statistical methods were tested and it was found that sea surface salinity can be accurately predicted via remote sensed products with an accuracy that is more than sufficient for many physical and ecological applications. For the best-performing statistical model, mean absolute error was 1.82 relative to mean Chesapeake Bay salinity of 16.5. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We propose a new algorithm that uses symbolic regression to estimate chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations from remote sensing reflectance. We compared the accuracy and computational efficiency of the new algorithm to that of the explicit empirical algorithms (OC4v4 and OC4v6), and implicit algorithms based on neural networks or support vector machines (SVM). Results show that the accuracy of the symbolic regression algorithm is higher than that of the OC4 algorithms and comparable to that of implicit algorithms. The improvement is particularly important for high biomass areas (chl a >= 3 mgm(-3)) that are often found in optically complex waters. The computational efficiency of the explicit algorithm developed by symbolic regression is comparable to that of the two versions of OC4 algorithms and better than that of implicit algorithms based on SVM. With its good precision and fast processing, the symbolic regression algorithm is a powerful tool for remote sensing of chl a that could be used advantageously in the reprocessing of large datasets.

Robert; Hannon, Mark			Floods, floodplains, delta plains - A satellite imaging approach	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Thirty-three lowland floodplains and their associated delta plains are characterized with data from three remote sensing systems (AMSR-E, SRTM and MODIS). These data provide new quantitative information to characterize Late Quaternary floodplain landscapes and their penchant for flooding over the last decade. Daily proxy records for discharge since 2002 and for each of the 33 river systems can be derived with novel Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) methods. A descriptive framework based on analysis of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data is used to capture the major landscape-scale floodplain elements or zones: 1) container valleys with their long and narrow pathways of largely sediment transit and bypass, 2) floodplain depressions that act as loci for frequent flooding and sediment storage, 3) zones of nodal avulsions common to many continental scale rivers, and often located seaward of container valleys, and 4) coastal floodplains and delta plains that offer both sediment bypass and storage but under the influence of marine processes. The SRTM data allow mapping of smaller-scale architectural elements in unprecedented systematic manner. Floodplain depressions were found to play a major role, which may largely be overlooked in conceptual floodplain models. Lastly, MODIS data (independently and combined with AMSR-E) allows the tracking of flood hydrographs and pathways and sedimentation patterns on a near-daily timescale worldwide. These remote-sensing data show that 85% of the studied major river systems experienced extensive flooding in the last decade. A new quantitative paradigm of floodplain processes, honoring the frequency and extent of floods, can be develop by careful analysis of these new remotely sensed data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Forest land cover continues to exacerbate freshwater acidification despite decline in sulphate emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Evidence from a multi-date regional-scale analysis of both high-flow and annual-average water quality data from Galloway, south-west Scotland, demonstrates that forest land cover continues to exacerbate freshwater acidification. This is in spite of significant reductions in airborne pollutants. The relationship between freshwater sulphate and forest cover has decreased from 1996 to 2006 indicating a decrease in pollutant scavenging. The relationship between forest cover and freshwater acidity (pH) is, however, still present over the same period, and does not show conclusive signs of having declined. Furthermore, evidence for forest cover contributing to a chlorine bias in marine ion capture suggests that forest scavenging of sea-salts may mean that the forest acidification effect may continue in the absence of anthropogenic pollutant inputs, particularly in coastal areas.

Particle backscattering as a function of chlorophyll and phytoplankton size structure in the open-ocean	OPTICS EXPRESS												Using an extensive database of in situ observations we present a model that estimates the particle backscattering coefficient as a function of the total chlorophyll concentration in the open-ocean (Case-1 waters). The parameters of the model include a constant background component and the chlorophyll-specific backscattering coefficients associated with small (<20 mu m) and large (> 20 mu m) phytoplankton. The new model performed with similar accuracy when compared with a traditional power-law function, with the additional benefit of providing information on the role of phytoplankton size. The observed spectral-dependency (gamma) of model parameters was consistent with past observations, such that gamma associated with the small phytoplankton population was higher than that of large phytoplankton. Furthermore, gamma associated with the constant background component suggests this component is likely attributed to submicron particles. We envisage that the model would be useful for improving Case-1 ocean-colour models, assimilating light into multi-phytoplankton ecosystem models and improving estimates of phytoplankton size structure from remote sensing.

Younger moraines and rock glaciers are present at the heads of tributary valleys; but these were inaccessible because they are located close to politically sensitive borders with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Glaciers during the Dabudaer glacial stage advanced into the central part of the Tashkurgan valley. During the Tashkurgan glacial stages, glaciers advanced several kilometers beyond the mouths of the tributary valleys into the Tashkurgan valley. Glaciers during the Hangdi and Kuzigun glacial stages advanced just beyond the mouths of the tributary valleys. Glaciation in this part of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen is likely strongly controlled by northern hemisphere climate oscillations, although a monsoonal influence on glaciation cannot be ruled out entirely.

Kirk			Improving aerosol distributions below clouds by assimilating satellite-retrieved cloud droplet number	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Limitations in current capabilities to constrain aerosols adversely impact atmospheric simulations. Typically, aerosol burdens within models are constrained employing satellite aerosol optical properties, which are not available under cloudy conditions. Here we set the first steps to overcome the long-standing limitation that aerosols cannot be constrained using satellite remote sensing under cloudy conditions. We introduce a unique data assimilation method that uses cloud droplet number (N-d) retrievals to improve predicted below-cloud aerosol mass and number concentrations. The assimilation, which uses an adjoint aerosol activation parameterization, improves agreement with independent N-d observations and with in situ aerosol measurements below shallow cumulus clouds. The impacts of a single assimilation on aerosol and cloud forecasts extend beyond 24 h. Unlike previous methods, this technique can directly improve predictions of near-surface fine mode aerosols responsible for human health impacts and low-cloud radiative forcing. Better constrained aerosol distributions will help improve health effects studies, atmospheric emissions estimates, and air-quality, weather, and climate predictions.

The stable isotopic composition and hydrochemistry of groundwater samples collected from different aquifers were determined to identify recharge sources and water quality. Stable isotopic values suggest that shallow alluvial and fracture zone aquifers are recharged from seasonal precipitation, while groundwater in deeper sedimentary sub-basins is paleowater that was recharged during periods of less arid regional climate. Hydrochemical analysis indicates elevated salinity in each aquifer type, which is attributed to leaching and dissolution of terrestrial salts and to mixing with marine water. Groundwater from sedimentary sub-basin aquifers can be treated and used for drinking and domestic purposes. Groundwater from shallow alluvial and fracture zone wells is suitable for animal husbandry and mineral ore dressing. A model water budget shows that approximately 4.8 x 10(9) m(3) of recoverable groundwater is stored in sedimentary sub-basin aquifers, or approximately 550 years of water at present utilization rates.

J	Vrbancich, J				Vrbancich, Julian			Airborne electromagnetic bathymetry and estimation of bedrock topography in Broken Bay, Australia	GEOPHYSICS												A helicopter transient electromagnetic (TEM) survey was flown over shallow coastal waters in Broken Bay, Australia, overlying several palaeovalleys and exposed reef sections. The in-filled palaeovalleys contain unconsolidated sediments with variable thicknesses exceeding 100 m. Previous marine seismic reflection and vibrocore studies provide an estimate of sediment thickness and surficial sediment conductivity, respectively, which, combined with known bathymetry (sonar soundings) and measured seawater conductivity, can be used to generate a crude ID geoelectric ground-truth model consisting of two layers (seawater/sediment) overlying a relatively resistive basement. The primary focus was to examine the accuracy of interpreted water depths obtained by 1D inversion of airborne TEM data; assuming a two-layer over resistive basement model, by comparing these depths with known water depths. The secondary focus was to compare the interpreted sediment thickness (i.e., the thickness of the second geoelectric layer, which combined with bathymetry, gives the bedrock depth) with thicknesses estimated from marine seismic data to test the potential of using airborne electromagnetic systems for remote sensing of the coarse features of the bedrock topography. Interpreted water depths obtained from TEM data resulted in absolute water depth accuracies of 1-2 m for depths between 10 and 30 m, and 0.3-0.5 m in water shallower than similar to 10 m. More importantly, similar water depth accuracies were obtained using raw TEM data (With birdswing removal) and TEM data obtained by postprocessing using time-consuming empirical corrections based on the TEM half-space response over deep sea water. The interpreted sediment depths derived from TEM and marine seismic data showed good agreement, generally, for example, inversion of TEM data delineated a distinct palaeovalley that transects a beach, with a maximum depth of 60-70 m below the seafloor, in agreement with depths estimated from marine seismic data to within +/-5-10 m.																	0016-8033					JUL-AUG	2012	77	4		S			WB3	WB17		10.1190/GEO2011-0354.1								WOS:000307799500002

Coastal habitats support large number of marine and wetland species including shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers and allies). In this study, we investigate how coastal habitats may be impacted by sea level rise in the Farasan Islands, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We use Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus - a common coastal breeding shorebird - as an ecological model species to predict the influence of sea level rise. We found that any rise of sea level is likely to inundate 11% of Kentish plover nests. In addition, 5% of the coastal areas of Farasan Islands, which support 26% of Kentish plover nests, will be flooded, if sea level rises by one metre. Our results are constrained by the availability of data on both elevation and bird populations. Therefore, we recommend follow-up studies to model the impacts of sea level rise using different elevation scenarios, and the establishment of a monitoring programme for breeding shorebirds and seabirds in Farasan Islands to assess the impact of climate change on their populations.

Airborne Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for the Quantification of Dissolved Organic Matter Concentration in Natural Waters	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Analysis of dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration and composition is essential to quantifying biological and chemical oxygen demand and atmosphere-ocean heat flux exchange in natural waters. However, manual water sampling is costly and time consuming over large areas. The purpose of this research was to analyze the applicability of airborne laser-induced fluorescence light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for the detection of DOM in estuarine ecosystems impacted by agriculture. A fluorescence LiDAR system (Airborne Marine) (FLS-AM) was used to assess the DOM concentration of the Annapolis River and Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada, as well as three rivers and their estuaries in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Two FLS-AM flight missions were conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009 and the resulting datasets were compared with spectral fluorescence signature (SFS DOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis of in situ water samples. Significant positive correlations were found at five of seven sites between the FLS-AM DOM and SFS DOM relationship which indicates that the FLS-AM sensor is a good surrogate for traditional sample collection of DOM data in estuaries in this region. Positive correlations were also found at all sites between FLS-AM DOM values and DOC. FLS-AM DOM patterns show that DOM values are significantly higher in rivers and estuaries that drain watersheds which are heavily impacted by agricultural practices. The results of this study show that the FLS-AM can be used efficiently as a general indicator for how estuaries are affected by runoff from agricultural watersheds in real time and thus reduce the requirement for traditional water sample collection and laboratory analysis methods.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Sea ice properties in the Bohai Sea measured by MODIS-Aqua: 2. Study of sea ice seasonal and interannual variability	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												During the 2009-2010 winter, the Bohai Sea experienced its most severe sea ice event in four decades, which caused significant economic losses, affected marine transportation and fishery, and impacted the entire marine ecosystem in the region. Measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite from 2002 to 2010 and surface atmosphere temperature (SAT) data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are used to study and quantify the extreme sea ice event in the 2009-2010 winter and the interannual variability of the regional sea ice properties, as well as the relationship between sea ice and the climate variability in the Bohai Sea. The mean sea ice reflectance from MODIS-Aqua visible and near-infrared wavelengths are 933%, 13.26%, and 12.60% in the months of December 2009, January 2010, and February 2010, respectively, compared with the monthly average sea ice reflectance values (from 2002 to 2010) of 9.35%, 11.21%, and 11.41% in the same three winter months. The sea ice monthly average coverages are similar to 5427, similar to 27,414, and similar to 21,156 km(2) in these three winter months. These values are significantly higher than the averages of monthly sea ice coverage of similar to 2735, similar to 11,119, and similar to 10,287 km(2) in the Bohai Sea in December, January, and February between 2002 and 2010. Most of the sea ice coverage was located in the northern Bohai Sea. Both the intra-seasonal and interannual sea ice variability in the Bohai Sea is found to be related closely to SAT. The mechanism of anomalous SAT and intense sea ice severity are also discussed and attributed to large-scale climate changes due to the variability of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Siberian High (SH).

J	Clark, CD; Hughes, ALC; Greenwood, SL; Jordan, C; Sejrup, HP				Clark, Chris D.; Hughes, Anna L. C.; Greenwood, Sarah L.; Jordan, Colm; Sejrup, Hans Petter			Pattern and timing of retreat of the last British-Irish Ice Sheet	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the last glacial the ice sheet that subsumed most of Britain, Ireland and the North Sea attained its maximum extent by 27 ka BP and with an ice volume sufficient to raise global sea level by ca 2.5 m when it melted. We reconstruct the demise of this British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) and present palaeo-glaciological maps of retreat stages between 27 and 15 ka BR The whole land area was investigated using remote sensing data and we present maps of moraines, meltwater channels, eskers, and drumlins and a methodology of how to interpret and bring them together. For the continental shelf, numerous large moraines were discovered recording an extensive pattern of retreat stretching from SW Ireland to the Shetland Isles. From an integration of this new mapping of glacial geomorphology (>26,000 landforms) with previously published evidence, compiled in the BRITICE database, we derive a pattern of retreat for the whole BIIS. We review and compile relevant dates (881 examples) that constrain the timing of retreat. All data are held within a Geographic Information System (GIS), and are deciphered to produce a best-estimate of the combined pattern and timing of retreat. Pattern information reveals an ice sheet mainly comprised of a shelf-parallel configuration from SW Ireland to NE Scotland but it spread far enough to the south to incorporate outlying ice domes over Wales, the Lake District and Kerry. Final disintegration was into a number of separate ice caps, rather than reduction as a single mass, and paradoxically, retreat was not always back to high ground. By 23 ka BP ice withdrew along its northern boundaries at the same time as the southern margins were expanding, including transient ice streaming down the Irish Sea and advances of lobes in the Cheshire Basin, Vale of York and east coast of England. Ice divides migrated south. By 19 ka the ice sheet was in crisis with widespread marine-based ice losses, particularly in the northern North Sea and the Irish Sea. Considerable dynamic-thinning occurred during this phase. Final collapse of all marine sectors occurred by 17 ka BP and with most margins beginning to back-step onshore. Disintegration of the North Sea 'ice bridge' between Britain and Norway remains loosely constrained in time but the possibility of catastrophic collapse of this sector is highlighted. The North Channel and Irish Sea ice streams had finally cleaved the ice sheet into separate Irish and Scottish ice sheets by 16 ka BP. Rates of ice loss were found to vary widely over space and time (e.g., 65-260 km(3) per year). The role of ice streams and calving losses of marine-based sectors are examined. Retreat rates of up to ca 150 ma(-1) were found for some ice stream margins. That large parts (2/3) of the BIIS were marine-based, drained by ice streams, and possibly with fringing ice shelves in places, makes it a useful analogue for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). This is especially so because the BIIS deglaciated in response to rising temperatures and a rising sea level (driven by melting of other ice masses) which are the current forcings that might cause collapse of the WAIS. Our reconstruction, when viewed from the opposite perspective, documents when fresh land became exposed for exploitation by plants, animals and Man, and records for how long such land has been available for soil and geochemical development and ecological succession.

The resultant images are processed to identify the litter using projective transformation method and color difference in the CIELUV color space. Low-altitude remote sensing experimental observations were conducted on two locations in Japan. Although the sizes of the litter and the areas covered are distorted in the original photographs taken at various angles and heights, the proposed image process system is capable of identifying object positions with a high degree of accuracy (1-3 m). Furthermore, the color difference approach in the CIELUV color space used in this study is well capable of extracting pixels of litter objects of various colors allowing us to estimate the number of objects from the photographs.

The characterization of suspended particles is important for understanding regional primary productivity and rates of carbon sequestration, the fate of anthropogenic materials released to the coastal environment, as well as its effects on bulk optical properties, which influence the passive optical remote sensing of the coastal ocean. Here, the extensive bio-optical Plumes and Blooms data set is used to characterize the surface particle assemblage in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, a highly productive, upwelling-dominated, coastal site affected by episodic sediment inputs. Available variables sensitive to characteristics of the particle assemblage include particle beam attenuation and backscattering coefficients, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigment concentration observations, chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon concentration, particulate and phytoplankton absorption coefficients, and Laser In-situ Scattering and Transmissometry (LISST) 100-X particle sizer observations. Comparisons among these particle assemblage proxy variables indicate good agreement and internal consistency among the data set. Correlations among chlorophyll concentration, particulate organic carbon concentration (POC), HPLC pigments, and proxies sensitive to the entire particle assemblage such as backscattering and LISST data strongly indicate that in spite of its coastal character, variability in the particle assemblage in the Santa Barbara Channel is dominated by its marine biogenic component. Relatively high estimates of the bulk real index of refraction and its positive correlation with chlorophyll and lithogenic silica concentration tentatively indicate that there is minerogenic particle influence in the Santa Barbara Channel that tends to covary with the phytoplankton blooms. Limitations of each particle assemblage proxy and remote-sensing applications are discussed.

A time series of contoured frequency by optical depth diagrams (CFODDs), which were proposed by previous studies, are calculated for the first time by a 3D model assuming two types of aerosol conditions (i.e., polluted and pristine). This contrasts with previous studies that obtained CFODDs using either a two-dimensional model or an accumulation of monthly and global observation data. The results show that the simulated CFODDs are characterized by distinctive patterns of radar reflectivities, similar to the patterns often observed by satellite remote sensing, even though the calculation domain of this study is limited to an area of 30 x 30 km(2), whereas the satellite observations are of a global scale. A cloud microphysical box model is then applied to the simulated cloud field at each time step to identify the dominant process for each of the patterns. The results reveal that the wide variety of satellite-observed CFODD patterns can be attributed to different microphysical processes occurring in multiple cloud cells at various stages of the cloud life cycle.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 aerosol products (2000-2007) were used to study aerosol spatial and temporal distributions, as well as their variations with local meteorological conditions over East China. By combining Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and aerosol Fine Mode Fraction (FMF), we found that the urban/industrial aerosol and soil dust are possibly two dominant species over northern part, whereas continental and marine aerosols possibly dominate the southern part of East China. Both annual mean AOD and area with high AOD increased from 2000 to 2007, with the largest increase seen in Yangtze River Delta region (YRD). In summer, AOD in East China reached the maximum of about 0.8 in YRD, dominated by fine mode particles. The minimum AOD occurred in winter with mostly coarse mode particles. Local aerosol properties were analyzed in three typical zones: the northern dry zone (I), the central urban/industrial zone (II) and the southern natural background zone (III). Monthly mean AODs in zone I and II were above 0.5 throughout the entire year, with the maximum AOD in June. High FMFs in this period indicated heavy urban and industrial pollution. Monthly mean AODs and FMFs in zone III reached maximum of 0.51 in April and September (up to 90.7%) respectively. High AOD in spring in zone III appears mostly due to the long-range dust transport from the North.

However, products derived from satellite ocean color data continue to suffer from high levels of inaccuracy when compared with in situ measurements of the surface layer of the ocean. This has been particularly pronounced for coastal waters and waters optically classified as Case-II. The early success of using empirical relationships between chlorophyll and simple band ratios to derive estimates of surface layer chlorophyll from the first ocean color satellite sensors' data (i.e. CZCS), has led mainstream ocean color remote sensing and standard ocean color products towards following this approach for subsequent sensors (e.g. SeaWiFS and MODIS). Chlorophyll has continued to be the main focus product but is only related to one of the optical properties of sea water, namely the absorption of light by phytoplankton, whereas empirical band ratio approaches use wavelength banded water leaving radiance resultant from all absorption and scattering of light by all the optically active components of the ocean surface layer. We suggest that using approaches that do not fully exploit remote sensing optical data through a parameterization of the optical properties of sea water, is the main reason for the poor performance of many ocean color products when compared with in situ data. This is in concordance with the International Ocean Color Coordinating Group (IOCCG) and following their recent guidelines, novel inherent optical properties approaches (e.g. for MERIS) and the lines of research that are being used in atmospheric remote sensing, we present a demonstration 'observation operator' system that is based on biogeochemical model output, optical properties (apparent and inherent), and radiative transfer modeling. In the forward mode we demonstrate the system by producing MODIS and SeaWiFS synthetic images of water leaving radiance for the coastal test sites of INSEA. We show that the observation operator approach has the potential to allow the consistent mapping of model variables into observed quantities which simplifies the transport of measurement errors and reduces the need for approximations inherent in previous approaches. In conclusion we discuss the future development and potential of inversion of the system in order to obtain more accurate ocean color biogeochemical products (including chlorophyll) from satellite radiance data for eutrophication assessment. We also highlight the additional advantages there may be for ecological models from having stronger links to bio-optics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mateus, M; Leitao, PC; de Pablo, H; Neves, R				Mateus, M.; Leitao, P. C.; de Pablo, H.; Neves, R.			Is it relevant to explicitly parameterize chlorophyll synthesis in marine ecological models?	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Oceanographers and modelers often relate chlorophyll concentrations with phytoplankton carbon invoking a suitable C:Chla ratio. However C:Chl ratios are not constant in natural systems, thus making chlorophyll a deceptive measure of true biomass. In this paper we report on the adaptation of an algorithm for chlorophyll synthesis to a complex ecological model for the marine environment. Based on this model we have developed several simulation experiments to assess the performance of the chlorophyll synthesis and the phytoplankton photoadaptation strategy. The model was applied to three distinct settings, comprising distinctive model geometries and ambient conditions: a schematic setting corresponding to a virtual mesocosm without any transport scheme (0D), a 1D vertical open-ocean application to a 150 m deep water-column, and an application to an estuary using a 2D configuration. Conditions vary from spatially stable in the first case to a strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the case of the estuary. Our results fall within the range and reproduce some of the trends found in published data, supporting the idea that when conditions have strong changes of nutrient availability and light conditions, a photoacclimation mechanism becomes an essential requirement for reliable chlorophyll biomass estimates. This is particularly relevant if model simulations are to be used to study natural systems complemented by data retrieved from direct measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessing chlorophyll variability in relation to the environmental regime in Pagasitikos Gulf, Greece	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Pagasitikos Gulf (Greece), presents an interesting area as it depicts strongly non-linear ecosystem characteristics. It is a shallow coastal area where the marine ecosystem picture is strongly influenced by non-linear hydrodynamic interactions and instabilities. In this study, we explore and assess the major influential variables of the surface phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll-a). Several different physical and biogeochemical parameters were used (sea surface temperature [SST], mixed layer depth [MLD], salinity, phosphates and nitrates) to identify which variables control or significantly affect the surface Chl-a of Pagasitikos Gulf for the period of 2001-2005. The variables were derived from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model and remotely sensed data from SeaWiFS and AVHRR sensor. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) were used to examine the relationships between Chlorophyll-a and the environmental regime. GAM analysis showed that the combined effects of the variables used, explained 71% of the surface chlorophyll variation. The order of importance of the variables (based on GAM probability) is p = 0.01 (for both phosphate and nitrate), MLD: p = 0.0197, salinity: p = 0.022, and SST: p = 0.046. The results clearly indicated the importance of deep mixing for Pagasitikos Gulf, as the surface phytoplankton blooms appeared to be favoured by cold, nutrient rich, well mixed and higher salinity waters. GAMs indicated that SST plays a significant role having a strong negative relationship with Chl-a, where the highest concentration is reached at 12-15 degrees C and minimum at 22-26 degrees C. Chl-a ceases to increase after 37.9 parts per thousand of salinity and 40 m of MID, while minimum concentration is found at 10 m of MLD, with a subsequent increase as the waters become more mixed. Phosphate and nitrates appeared to be of equal importance with Chl-a exhibiting an increase along with the nutrients. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Predicting euphotic-depth-integrated chlorophyll-a from discrete-depth and satellite-observable chlorophyll-a off central California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Predicting water column integrated phytoplankton biomass from near-surface measurements has been an important effort in marine ecological research, particularly since the advent of satellite remote sensing of ocean color. Quantitative relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) at the surface and its depth-integrated magnitude have thus far only been developed for open-ocean waters. Here we develop and test for the first time an extension of open-ocean relationships into ocean-margin waters, specifically the highly productive and variable eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem off the central California coast. This region was chosen because of the unique availability of a 30-year record of ship-based Chl-a profiles measured using consistent methods. The extended relationship allows accurate prediction of integrated biomass from surface measurements. Further, we develop a new set of relationships for predicting the depth-integrated Chl-a from Chl-a measured over a range of discrete depths (i.e., as measured by fluorometers on moorings). The newly developed relationships are tested against 15,000 fluorometric Chl-a profiles obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle. Surprisingly, the relationship between surface Chl-a and depth-integrated Chl-a holds for profiles with high concentrations of Chl-a in persistent subsurface thin phytoplankton layers (layers <3 m thick and located below the first optical depth). The results have implications for monitoring of algal blooms and for quantifying ocean primary productivity from satellite observations of ocean color.

Remote sensing is an efficient tool for monitoring these harmful algal blooms (HABs) and studying concerned marine conditions. This study investigated two intensive S. costatum HABs in the ECS by analysis of water distribution and spatial-temporal pattern of four oceanographic parameters derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and QuickSCAT satellite data using multiple remote sensing approaches (composite imagery interpretation, classification, and parameters retrieval). Results show that high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and net primary production (NPP) decrease from the HAB areas toward the open sea. A peak of Chl-a (>10 mg m(-3)) and NPP (>5000 mg.C.m(-2).d(-1)) are considered indicators of large-scale S. costatum blooms in the ECS. Low sea surface temperature (SST; approximately 23 degrees C) are observed in S. costatum HAB areas. In early stages, winds in terms of direction and speed can bring nutrients to facilitate the formation of S. costatum blooms, but then sharply change into unfavorable conditions to cause the final disappearance of HABs. This study also explored multiple oceanographic explanations in the ECS from biochemical, meteorological, physical, and geological perspectives for a better understanding of such S. costatum HABs mechanisms.

Remote sensing of coastal and ocean currents: an overview. Journal of Coastal Research, 28(3), 576-586. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Ocean currents influence the global heat transport; weather and climate; larval transport; drift of water pollutants; sediment transport; and marine transportation. As a result, oceanographers, coastal managers, and ships need up-to-date information on ocean and coastal currents. Arrays of current meter moorings can measure currents at local scales. Shore-based high-frequency radars are able to map coastal currents over a range of up to 200 km. Ocean drifters can be tracked to obtain circulation patterns over larger areas, but may take months to accomplish it. Only satellite remote sensors can determine currents synoptically over extensive ocean and coastal regions. Satellite altimetry is one of the essential remote-sensing techniques for monitoring dynamic ocean conditions, including surface currents, local wind speed, and significant wave height. Satellite altimetry measures sea surface heights, providing data on geostrophic circulation, including major ocean currents. Ocean currents can also be determined by satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or tracking the movement of thermal and color features in the ocean. The flow patterns of currents like the Gulf Stream are being mapped with satellite infrared scanners. The objective of this paper is to review practical remote-sensing techniques for measuring and mapping coastal and ocean currents.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2012	28	3					576	586		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00197.1								WOS:000304283200006

Seasonal and spatial heterogeneity of recent sea surface temperature trends in the Caribbean Sea and southeast Gulf of Mexico	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Recent changes in ocean temperature have impacted marine ecosystem function globally. Nevertheless, the responses have depended upon the rate of change of temperature and the season when the changes occur, which are spatially variable. A rigorous statistical analysis of sea surface temperature observations over 25 years was used to examine spatial variability in overall and seasonal temperature trends within the wider Caribbean. The basin has experienced high spatial variability in rates of change of temperature. Most of the warming has been due to increases in summer rather than winter temperatures. However, warming was faster in winter in the Loop Current area and the south-eastern Caribbean, where the annual temperature ranges have contracted. Waters off Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas had a tendency towards cooling in winter, increasing the amplitude of annual temperature ranges. These detailed patterns can be used to elucidate ecological responses to climatic change in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of surface irradiance on the absorption spectrum of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the global ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												The cycling pathways of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) within marine systems must be constrained to better assess the impact of CDOM on surface ocean photochemistry and remote sensing of ocean color. Photobleaching, the loss of absorption by CDOM due to light exposure, is the primary sink for marine CDOM. Herein the susceptibility of CDOM to photobleaching by sea surface-level solar radiation was examined in 15 samples collected from wide-ranging open ocean regimes. Samples from the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans were irradiated over several days with full-spectrum light under a solar simulator at in situ temperature in order to measure photobleaching rate and derive an empirical matrix, epsilon(surf) (m(-1) mu Ein(-1)), which quantifies the effect of surface irradiance on the spectral absorption of CDOM. Irradiation responses among the ocean samples were similar within the ultraviolet (UV) region of the spectrum spanning 300-360 nm, generally exhibiting a decrease in the CDOM absorption coefficient (m(-1)) and concomitant increase in the CDOM spectral slope parameter, S (nm(-1)). However, an unexpected irradiation-induced increase in CDOM absorption between approximately 360 and 500 nm was observed for samples from high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) environments. This finding was linked to the presence of dissolved nitrate and may explain discrepancies in action spectra for dimethylsulfide (DMS) photobleaching observed between the Equatorial Pacific and Subtropical North Atlantic Oceans. The nitrate-to-phosphate ratio explained 27-70% of observed variability in epsilon(surf) at observation wavelengths of 330-440 nm, while the initial spectral slope of the samples explained up to 52% of variability in epsilon(surf) at observation wavelengths of 310-330 nm. These results suggest that the biogeochemical and solar exposure history of the water column, each of which influence the chemical character and thus the spectral quality of CDOM and its photoreactivity, are the main factors regulating the susceptibility of CDOM to photodegradation in the surface ocean. The epsilon(surf) parameter reported herein may be applied to remote sensing retrievals of CDOM to estimate photobleaching at the surface on regional to global scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism behind MODIS oil feature detection, as well as the type of information that might be retrieved, strictly depends on the illumination conditions. In the presence of sunglint contamination, MODIS can just locate the oil spill as a sea surface roughness anomaly, in similarity with radar observations, and no additional spectral information can be retrieved. MODIS detection in the absence of sunglint contamination however might allow extraction of oil feature spectral properties, which, in turn, may help in oil discrimination and classification. Careful atmospheric correction must be applied. An example of oil spill spectral property extraction from MODIS images is here shown for the Deepwater Horizon accidental oil spill.																	1545-598X					MAY	2012	9	3					398	402		10.1109/LGRS.2011.2169647								WOS:000301236900016

Ian			Reconciling classifications of ecologically and biologically significant areas in the world's oceans	MARINE POLICY												The classification of marine habitats is a critical first step towards the protection of marine biodiversity and the sustainable management of the world's oceans. Recently, the topic has received heightened attention as the 2012 deadline for meeting international commitments under the convention on biological diversity (CBD) approaches. These commitments require the development of a unified approach to identifying high-seas areas in need of protection. To determine the best approach, criteria for identifying sensitive areas proposed by the CBD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations were compared to the ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) criteria developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The comparison demonstrates that, with some minor refinements, the EBSA criteria are parsimonious and encompass all other criteria proposed to date. To identify the most suitable approach for defining EBSAs, 16 classifications of the world's oceans, ranging from coastal regions to the high-seas, were reviewed for their suitability to define EBSAs. The classifications differed in substantive ways, including analytical methods (from quantitative analyses to subjective interpretations), data sources (either physical or biological), and the realm to which they were applied (high-seas, coastal, or deep-ocean). No method currently provides an integrated, whole-ecosystem approach to identifying a comprehensive set of important marine areas. To move to a singular, multi-attribute, description of EBSAs requires an explicit, reproducible methodology. Here, the EBSA approach is formalised as an adaptive method that integrates existing classifications in an efficient, holistic, and transparent manner, by explicitly considering important marine features (IMFs) and biologically sensitive areas (BSAs). The proposed approach directly addresses the EBSA criteria, and is applicable across the different realms of the world's oceans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a inference model based on the fuzzy logic technique was developed for estimating the generation possibility of internal waves. The marine environmental factors causing the occurrence of internal waves were distilled from ocean data and used as the inputs of the fuzzy inference model, and the generation possibilities of internal waves were used as the output of the model. The developed model was applied to the northwest Pacific, and the results were verified using satellite remote sensing images. The satisfactory results indicate that the inference model based on fuzzy logic is a useful first step in the development of generation estimation of internal waves and can be used as a supplement of traditional methods, which will be helpful for the risk assessment of ocean engineering.																	1023-2796					APR	2012	20	2					237	244										WOS:000303847300016

Julian			Multi-scale marine biodiversity patterns inferred efficiently from habitat image processing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Cost-effective proxies of biodiversity and species abundance, applicable across a range of spatial scales, are needed for setting conservation priorities and planning action. We outline a rapid, efficient, and low-cost measure of spectral signal from digital habitat images that, being an effective proxy for habitat complexity, correlates with species diversity and requires little image processing or interpretation. We validated this method for coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, across a range of spatial scales (1 m to 10 km), using digital photographs of benthic communities at the transect scale and high-resolution Landsat satellite images at the reef scale. We calculated an index of image-derived spatial heterogeneity, the mean information gain (MIG), for each scale and related it to univariate (species richness and total abundance summed across species) and multivariate (species abundance matrix) measures of fish community structure, using two techniques that account for the hierarchical structure of the data: hierarchical (mixed-effect) linear models and distance-based partial redundancy analysis. Over the length and breadth of the GBR, MIG alone explained up to 29% of deviance in fish species richness, 33% in total fish abundance, and 25% in fish community structure at multiple scales, thus demonstrating the possibility of easily and rapidly exploiting spatial information contained in digital images to complement existing methods for inferring diversity and abundance patterns among fish communities. Thus, the spectral signal of unprocessed remotely sensed images provides an efficient and low-cost way to optimize the design of surveys used in conservation planning. In data-sparse situations, this simple approach also offers a viable method for rapid assessment of potential local biodiversity, particularly where there is little local capacity in terms of skills or resources for mounting in-depth biodiversity surveys.

Phytoplankton of the Peter the Great Bay and its remote sensing problem	OCEANOLOGY												The problem of recognition of algal genera based on the remote sensing data requires the analysis of the algae biomass's distribution. This study provides the analysis of the algae spatial and temporal variations in the Peter the Great Bay. While 116 algal genera were observed, only a few genera have dominated. Usually, the dominant genus contributed about 60% of the sample's biomass (the minimal value is 20% usually) and 4 dominant genera contributed about 90% of the total phytoplankton biomass. The effective scattering crosssection of the algae in the samples is very changeable and this feature looks promising for the recognition problem. It was found that the spatial and temporal variations of the algal biomass are significant, but the percentage characteristics of a few dominant genera are relatively stable with no significant dependence on a region and a biomass value. The algae's composition analysis has demonstrated that the same algal genera are propagated in different parts of the Bay. For a given region and month, the set of algae dominated that constitutes about 90% of the monthly biomass is rather small (not more than 10 genera usually). Most of the alga genera similar to 75%) do not ever reach a mono domination state (more than 50% of the sample's biomass).																	0001-4370	1531-8508				APR	2012	52	2					219	230		10.1134/S0001437012020014								WOS:000302812300008

With the help of these data it is possible to understand certain variations in biological responses of marine phytoplankton on ecological time scales. Here, we implement a sequential data-assimilation technique to estimate from a conventional nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model the time variations of observed and unobserved variables. In addition, we estimate the time evolution of two biological parameters, namely, the specific growth rate and specific mortality of phytoplankton. Our study demonstrates that: (i) the series of time-varying estimates of specific growth rate obtained by sequential data assimilation improves the fitting of the NPZ model to the satellite-derived time series: the model trajectories are closer to the observations than those obtained by implementing static values of the parameter; (ii) the estimates of unobserved variables, i.e., nutrient and zooplankton, obtained from an NPZ model by implementation of a pre-defined parameter evolution can be different from those obtained on applying the sequences of parameters estimated by assimilation; and (iii) the maximum estimated specific growth rate of phytoplankton in the study area is more sensitive to the sea-surface temperature than would be predicted by temperature-dependent functions reported previously.

J	Saravia, LA; Giorgi, A; Momo, F				Saravia, Leonardo Ariel; Giorgi, Adonis; Momo, Fernando			Multifractal Spatial Patterns and Diversity in an Ecological Succession	PLOS ONE												We analyzed the relationship between biodiversity and spatial biomass heterogeneity along an ecological succession developed in the laboratory. Periphyton (attached microalgae) biomass spatial patterns at several successional stages were obtained using digital image analysis and at the same time we estimated the species composition and abundance. We show that the spatial pattern was self-similar and as the community developed in an homogeneous environment the pattern is self-organized. To characterize it we estimated the multifractal spectrum of generalized dimensions D-q. Using D-q we analyze the existence of cycles of heterogeneity during succession and the use of the information dimension D-1 as an index of successional stage. We did not find cycles but the values of D-1 showed an increasing trend as the succession developed and the biomass was higher. D-1 was also negatively correlated with Shannon's diversity. Several studies have found this relationship in different ecosystems but here we prove that the community self-organizes and generates its own spatial heterogeneity influencing diversity. If this is confirmed with more experimental and theoretical evidence D-1 could be used as an index, easily calculated from remote sensing data, to detect high or low diversity areas.

A pure marine aerosol model, for use in remote sensing applications	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and related parameters from satellite measurements typically involve prescribed models of aerosol size and composition, and are therefore dependent on how well these models are able to represent the radiative behavior of real aerosols. This study uses aerosol volume size distributions retrieved from Sun-photometer measurements at 11 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) island sites, spread throughout the world's oceans, as a basis to define such a model for pure (unpolluted) maritime aerosol. Volume size distributions are observed to be bimodal and approximately lognormal, although the coarse mode is skewed with a long tail on the low-radius end. The relationship of AOD and size distribution parameters to meteorological conditions is also examined. As wind speed increases, so do coarse-mode volume and radius. The AOD and angstrom ngstrom exponent show linear relationships with wind speed, although with considerable scatter. Links between aerosol properties and near-surface relative humidity, columnar water vapor, and sea surface temperature are also explored. A recommended bimodal maritime model, which is able to reconstruct the AERONET AOD with accuracy of order 0.01-0.02, is presented for use in aerosol remote sensing applications. This accuracy holds at most sites and for wavelengths between 340 nm and 1020 nm. Calculated lidar ratios are also provided, and are in the range of other studies, although differ more strongly from those currently used in Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) processing.

The brightness and spectrum of this light depends on the biomass content of the ocean, such that variations in the color of the ocean can be observed even from space. Rayleigh scattering by pure sea water, and Rayleigh-Gans type scattering by plankton, causes this light to be polarized with a distinctive angular distribution. To study the contribution of this underwater light polarization to multiangle, multispectral observations of polarized reflectance over ocean, we previously developed a hydrosol model for use in underwater light scattering computations that produces realistic variations of the ocean color and the underwater light polarization signature of pure sea water. In this work we review this hydrosol model, include a correction for the spectrum of the particulate scattering coefficient and backscattering efficiency, and discuss its sensitivity to variations in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and in the scattering function of marine particulates. We then apply this model to measurements of total and polarized reflectance that were acquired over open ocean during the MILAGRO field campaign by the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Analyses show that our hydrosol model faithfully reproduces the water-leaving contributions to RSP reflectance, and that the sensitivity of these contributions to Chlorophyll a concentration [Chl] in the ocean varies with the azimuth, height, and wavelength of observations. We also show that the impact of variations in CDOM on the polarized reflectance observed by the RSP at low altitude is comparable to or much less than the standard error of this reflectance whereas their effects in total reflectance may be substantial (i.e. up to >30%). Finally, we extend our study of polarized reflectance variations with [Chl] and CDOM to include results for simulated spaceborne observations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Messager, C; Faure, V				Messager, Christophe; Faure, Vincent			Validation of remote sensing and weather model forecasts in the Agulhas ocean area to 57 degrees S by ship observations	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The region south of South Africa, encompassing the Agulhas Current and Retroflection, and part of the Southern Ocean, is known for its severe meteorological conditions. Because of these conditions, in-situ observations are rare. Consequently, remote-sensing satellite observations and high-resolution regional weather forecasts at the ocean surface are difficult to assess. However, atmospheric data collected in the southern hemisphere summer of 2008 during the International Polar Year-BONUS-GoodHope campaign were used to validate two satellite data sets: the twice daily QuikSCAT winds and the daily OAflux data set of latent and sensible heat fluxes. The surface winds and heat fluxes forecasts produced by a regional atmospheric model were also assessed along the ship track. In this study, we have shown that the two data sets exhibited a very good accordance with daily in-situ observations. During the campaign, the correlation coefficients for wind speed and direction were 0.97 and 0.91, respectively, and those for latent and sensible heat fluxes were 0.92 and 0.90, respectively. The QuikSCAT wind speed was underestimated by 1.37 m/s relative to in-situ data, south of the Subtropical Front. Large differences in heat fluxes in both OAflux and the atmospheric model were observed when crossing the Subtropical Front and a warm eddy, as well as during a storm, when gale force winds reached more than 20 m/s. The two data sets were then used to assess the regional model forecasts over a larger area south of South Africa, not limited to the ship track. Most of the model errors were located in a region north of the Subtropical Front, where the sea surface temperature used by the model was not accurate enough to reproduce the relevant mesoscale oceanic features driving the spatial variability of the surface winds and heat fluxes. Finally, compared to in-situ and remote sensing observations, the numerical modelling weather forecast produced realistic atmospheric conditions over the sea south of the Subtropical Front.																	0038-2353					MAR-APR	2012	108	3-4					78	87		10.4102/sajs.v108i3/4.735								WOS:000303633100014

This study was performed to determine the apparent and inherent optical properties of coastal waters of the Mahakam Delta, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Inherent optical properties (IOPs) were derived from above-water radiometric measurements and ocean color model inversion. Retrieved IOPs and measured concentrations show good agreement both for total suspended matter (TSM) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) (R-2 = 0.72 and 0.80 respectively). The linear relationship between the retrieved IOPs and the measured concentrations was then used to estimate the specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) using the basic equation of the Lambert-Beer law. The specific backscattering coefficient of TSM (b(b,TSM)*(550)) was found to be 0.0087 m(2) g(-1), and the specific absorption coefficient of Chl a (a(Chl)*(440)) was found to be 0.023 m(2) g(-1) in the Mahakam Delta. The estimated values of SIOP for TSM and Chl a could be considered spatially constant for the Mahakam Delta, and resulted in reliable estimates of TSM and Chl a concentrations (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.85 respectively). The specific backscattering coefficient of TSM found in this study is similar to that of the Barito Estuary (in the southern part of Kalimantan) but lower than that of the Berau Estuary (in the northern part of Kalimantan), whereas the specific backscattering coefficient of Chl a is similar to that found in the Berau Estuary. This study contributes to the development of an operational method based on remote sensing data to map water constituent concentrations in the Mahakam Delta, as well as to enrich the information about the optical properties of Indonesian waters.

Krishna			Role of circulation parameters in long range aerosol transport: Evidence from Winter-ICARB	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												This study explores the inevitable role of wind parameters such as wind speed, wind convergence and wind vorticity in the long range transport and distribution of aerosols in the winter time atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the campaign Winter ICARB. MODIS observed aerosol optical depth (AOD), with an excellent agreement with ship borne Microtops AOD, was found to increase over the BoB particularly, in the eastern parts during the course of the campaign. The influence of atmospheric circulation on this increase is examined using the wind field from NCEP reanalysis and computed wind convergence and vorticity for first and second halves (FH and SH) of the campaign along with a back trajectory analysis using HYSPLIT transport and dispersion model. While surface winds over the BoB remained nearly the same throughout the campaign denying the possibility of enhancement in marine aerosol generation, the higher altitude winds altered significantly in SH providing a channel for aerosol transport from the Indian landmass to the BoB in addition to the increased forest fire contribution from south Asia. This suggested mechanism is supported by CALIPSO aerosol extinction profiles over the eastern BoB and the surrounding land masses. Fine particle dominance in MODIS AOD and diminished correlation between ship borne AOD and surface aerosol mass measurements during SH corroborate this inference by indicating the presence of elevated aerosol layers, which can contribute substantially to the radiative effects of the earth-atmosphere system. This study throws light on the importance of wind convergence and vorticity in the investigations on the long range transport and spatial distribution of aerosols.

J	Chen, LQ; Chen, XL; Tian, LQ; Qiu, F				Chen Li-qiong; Chen Xiao-ling; Tian Li-qiao; Qiu Feng			Partitioning of the Suspended Particulate Spectral Scattering Coefficient in Poyang Lake	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												A model for partitioning the particulate scattering coefficient into the contributions of suspended mineral particle and organic particle was proposed based on the measured data. The independent variables, i. e. the concentrations of mineral particles and organic particles in this study, were used to determine the mass-specific scattering cross section with the concurrent total suspended particulate scattering coefficients collected during the field trip in Poyang Lake 2009. Results show that the scattering spectra of inorganic particles and organic particles can be successful derived by the proposed model, and the reconstructed total particulate scattering coefficients are in better agreement with the measured values by the ordinary least square linear regression. For the whole South Poyang Lake, mean absolute percentage errors between the measured scattering coefficients and reconstructed value were less than 25% over the main remote sensing effective wavebands such as 440, 532, 555 and 676 nm. A remarkable lower predicted error, which can be controlled within 15%, were found at all stations with higher concentration of total suspended matters, while the spectral partitioning is less efficient at stations with total suspended particle concentration less than 15 mg . L-1. Particulate scattering spectrum retrieved by RMA shows that illite and montmorillonite are the major constituents of inorganic matters which dominate the light scattering properties of Poyang Lake. It is possible that scattering spectrum partitioned by the model could infer the major effective components in waters, and could be used to predict particulate scattering properties for highly turbid waters.																	1000-0593					MAR	2012	32	3					729	733		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2012)03-0729-05								WOS:000301329300035

However, valid relationships between ground level and columnar ground based quantities should be known beforehand. In this study we have performed a comparison between particulate matter measurements at ground level at different cut sizes (10, 2.5 and 1.0 mu m), and the aerosol optical depth obtained by means of a ground based sunphotometer during a multiinstrumental field campaign held in El Arenosillo (Huelva, Spain) from 28 June to 4 July 2006. All the PM fractions were very well correlated with AOD with correlation coefficients that ranged from 0.71 to 0.81 for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. Furthermore, the influence of the mixing layer height in the correlations was explored. The improvement in the correlation when the vertical distribution is taken into account was significant for days with a homogeneous mixing layer. Moreover, the chemical analysis of the individual size fractions allowed us to study the origin of the particulate matter. Secondary components were the most abundant and also well correlated in the three size fractions; but for PM10 fraction, chemical species related to marine origin were best correlated. Finally, we obtained a relationship between MODIS L3 AOD from collection 5.1 and the three PM cut sizes. In spite of being a relatively clean environment, all the techniques were able to capture similar day to day variations during this field campaign.

J	Al Kwatli, MA; Gillot, PY; Al Gharib, I; Lefevre, JC				Al Kwatli, Mohamad Amer; Gillot, Pierre Yves; Al Gharib, Iyad; Lefevre, Jean Claude			Integration of K-Ar geochronology and remote sensing: Mapping volcanic rocks and constraining the timing of alteration processes (Al-Lajat Plateau, Syria)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Al-Lajat plateau (southern Syria) is a Quaternary volcanic field hosting numerous historical and archaeological sites. Based on the integration of K-Ar geochronology and remote sensing methods, a new map is presented for Al-Lajat plateau volcanic field, and a chronological model for alteration processes (such as weathering) in relation to Quaternary paleoclimatic changes. Potential use of the geological data in archaeological investigations is discussed. The alteration patterns of ferric, ferrous, and clay minerals were identified by using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper data (ETM+) methods and ratio images of 3/1, 5/4 and 5/7. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), combined with "Crosta technique" interpretation was used to gauge the response of weathered minerals. Using this technique, high concentrations of ferrous minerals appear brightly colored in the third axis of the Principal Components Analysis ('PC3'), while oxides show the opposite in PC4. Composite images consisting of ratio images (3/1, 4/5, and 5/7), shown in blue, green, and red respectively, appear to be the most useful for mapping the lithologic boundaries of the main lava flows. Based on new K-Ar ages, the timing of the volcanic activity appears to have been between 56 +/- 9 ka and 266 +/- 6 ka. Three distinct groups of ages can be identified, confirming the sequence of the basaltic units defined by remote sensing: 1) the youngest unit belongs to Tyrrhenian, between 71 ka and 56 ka, 2) the intermediate unit, Pre-Tyrrhenian to Tyrrhenian between 114 ka and 139 ka, and 3) the oldest basaltic unit, surrounding the Al-Lajat plateau, is dated to at least 266 ka. A chrono-alteration model highlights the role of climatic changes in the distribution of the minerals at the surface of the volcanic rocks as a function of the ages. Weathering conditions during the post-glaciation phase are responsible for clay removal in the study area. Integrating dating and remote sensing data are important for mapping the location and timing of past volcanic activity, but can also be used to identify the sources of archaeological tools and architecture in volcanic areas such as the Al-Lajat plateau.

Ten years of monthly composite maps of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration and the PHYSAT database of four Phytoplanktonic Functional Types (PFTs), both from SeaWiFS, are used to investigate characteristics of phytoplankton seasonality in the trades and westerlies wind oceanic biomes, where data density is adequate. We use a combination of wavelet transform and statistical techniques that allow us to quantify both intensity and duration of the seasonal oscillation of chlorophyll-a concentration and PFTs relative occurrence, and to map these relationships. Next, the seasonal oscillations detected are related to four PFTs revealing six major global phytoplanktonic associations. Our results elucidate the intensity and duration of the seasonal dynamic of the chlorophyll-a concentration and of the relative occurrence of four PFTs at a global scale. Thus, the typology of the different types of seasonality is investigated. Finally, an overall agreement between the results and the biogeochemical provinces partition proposed by Longhurst is found, revealing a strong environmental control on the seasonal oscillation of primary producers and a clear latitudinal organization in the succession of the phytoplankton types. Results provided in this study quantify the seasonal oscillation of key structural parameters of the global ocean, and their potential implications for our understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

From an ecological perspective, this is light pollution, which causes changes in reproductive physiology, migration and foraging of many species and ultimately leads to loss of biodiversity. Some seabirds are intimately linked with the light features of their environments because they are nocturnally active. We report light-induced groundings of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) during a 2-year study (2008 and 2009) in Sao Miguel Island, in the Azores archipelago, and investigate the spatial correlation of locations of grounded birds with an annual composite of remotely sensed stable lights. Results indicate that 16.7% of fledglings are attracted to lights. The exposure of shearwater colonies in the study area to artificial night lighting is low overall. Four colonies account for 87% of the grounded birds. The distance each bird was found from the closest colony was best explained by the ratio of the satellite-measured light levels at the grounding spot to the light levels at the assigned colony of origin. These results demonstrate that satellite-observed nighttime lights are sufficient to assess risk to marine birds at the scale of oceanic islands and indicate their utility for monitoring the effectiveness of programs to manage lighting to reduce risk for these species and conducting global assessments of species vulnerability. To minimize the impact on Cory's shearwater and other marine birds, we recommend measures such as reduction and control of lighting intensity near colony locations, while continuing and re-enforcing rescue campaigns.

The establishment of jetties in portion to urban seaside, urban and marine transportation network is seemed to be very much interrelated. With respect to this issue, location of jetties had given several impacts to various fields. As such, the emitted air pollution by ships has been considered as one of the major effective environmental elements by many urban planners. Increasing jetties has both positive (accessibility) and negative (air pollution) impacts for coastal cites. Therefore, there is a need to manage a scientifically based approach to convert conceptual configuration of non polluted and accessible areas into strategic locations of jetties to explain the linkage between accessibility and air quality. The mathematical models are widely used to evaluate the air quality near the seaside and roadways. Many models have been applied to describe the pollutants from vehicles. These models provide theoretical estimation of air pollution levels as well as temporal and spatial variations for present, proposed and estimated conditions. The estimates are actually functioning meteorology, path geometry, and downwind receptor location. The arrival of new technologies such as Geographic Information System (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) gave a digital tool for Coastal cities mapping and planning.

The regeneration process of aerosols was implemented into the SBM and was found to be necessary for simulating the satellite-observed microphysical properties of warm clouds by the SBM model used in this study. The results showed that the aerosol amount changed the correlation statistics in a way that changes the cloud particle number concentration, whereas the inversion height of the boundary layer, which is related to the atmospheric stability and the cloud-top height, changed the correlation statistics in a way that changes the liquid water path. These results showed that the dominant mechanisms that control the correlation statistics are similar to those suggested by previous modeling studies based on two-dimensional idealized simulations. On the other hand, the present three-dimensional modeling was also able to simulate some realistic patterns of the correlation statistics, namely, mixtures of characteristic patterns and the "high-heeled" pattern as observed by satellite remote sensing.

This investigation was also assisted by satellite imagery using SeaWiFS and concurrent measurement of salinity. The target chemicals were measured in SPM, sampled near Yangtze River mouth to stations that were close to Jeju Island, Korea. Sigma DDTs and Sigma PCBs in SPM were at ultra trace levels (parts-per-quadrillion) ranging from 3.3 to 39 and from 20 to 68 pg L-1, respectively; while Sigma sterols occurred from 3200 to 32,000 pg L-1 range. The spatial distribution and molecular compositions were studied. This study illustrated the effectiveness of unconventional molecular tracers in identifying water masses and movement of riverine plumes to regional seas in the transport of sediments and contaminants. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of long range-longitudinal transport of contaminants (transboundary pollution) in regional seas and their impact on the ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cullen, JJ; Davis, RF; Huot, Y				Cullen, John J.; Davis, Richard F.; Huot, Yannick			Spectral model of depth-integrated water column photosynthesis and its inhibition by ultraviolet radiation	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Depth-integrated models of primary production (DIMs) are used to estimate water column photosynthesis as a function of chlorophyll concentration, irradiance at the surface, the penetration of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), and parameters of the relationship between photosynthesis and PAR. These models are inherently unable to account for variability in the ratio of photosynthetically utilizable radiation (PUR) to PAR with depth and water type, and they cannot account for the inhibition of photosynthesis by ultraviolet radiation, UVR. These important spectral effects - all sensitive to climate change - are readily described with numerical models that require many computations and are unsuitable for some important applications, including the estimation of aquatic productivity from remote sensing. We present a simple DIM that accounts for the spectral effects of irradiance on photosynthesis, including inhibition by UVR. Water column photosynthesis, normalized to surface chlorophyll and scaled to the maximum rate per unit chlorophyll, is described as a function of four dimensionless derived variables: E*(PUR), PUR at the surface scaled to the saturation irradiance for photosynthesis; T*(PUR), water transparency, normalized to a depth scale and weighted spectrally for photosynthetic absorption; E*(PIR), surface irradiance weighted spectrally for inhibition of photosynthesis; and T*(PIR), scaled transparency weighted for photosynthesis-inhibiting radiation. Simple functions of these variables closely approximate (within 6%) the results of a full-spectral numerical model of instantaneous and daily integrated water column photosynthesis with and without UVR for a broad range of water types, solar angles, stratospheric ozone concentrations and biological properties of phytoplankton. The spectral DIM is suitable for examining patterns in global ocean productivity and can be used to assess the biological effects of variations in solar radiation (e.g., ozone depletion) and water clarity in climate-change scenarios for lakes and oceans.

Modification of the vertically generalized production model for the turbid waters of Ariake Bay, southwestern Japan	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The vertically generalized production model (VGPM), which was designed for open ocean waters (Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997a; henceforth BF), was evaluated using in situ measurements of primary productivity (PP) in the characteristically turbid coastal waters of Ariake Bay, southwestern Japan, to develop a regionally modified version of the model. The euphotic depth (Z(eu))-integrated PP (IPP) calculated from the VGPM using in situ chlorophyll a (Chl a) and sea surface temperature (SST) was significantly overestimated (by factors of 2-3), but 52% of the observed variability was explained. The weak correlation could have partially resulted from overestimations by the sub-models embedded in the original VGPM model for estimation of Z(eu) (Morel and Berthon, 1989; henceforth MB) and the optimal Chl a-normalized PP (p(opt)(B)). The sub-model estimates of p(opt)(B) and Z(eu) with in situ p(opt)(B) and Z(eu) showed significant improvement, accounting for 84% of the variability and causing less overestimation. Z(eu) was the most important parameter influencing the modeled IPP variation in Ariake Bay. Previous research suggested that the Z(eu) model, which was based on surface Chl a, overestimated in situ Z(eu) by a factor of 2 -3, resulting in weak correlation between the modeled and in situ IPP. The Z(eu) sub-model was not accurate in the present study area because it was basically developed for clear (case I) waters. A better estimation of Z(eu) could be obtained from the in situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) using a quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) in this turbid water ecosystem. Among the parameters of PP models, p(opt)(B) is conventionally considered the most important. However, in this study p(opt)(B) was of secondary importance because the contribution of p(opt)(B) to the variation in modeled IPP was less than the contribution of Z(eu). The modeled and in situ p(opt)(B) were weakly correlated with 50% of the data points that overestimated the in situ values. The estimation of Chl a was improved by optimizing the Chl a algorithm with in situ R-rs data. Incorporating the QAA-based Z(eu) and the optimized Chl a and constant (median) p(opt)(B) value led to improved performance of the VGPM for the study area. Thus, even though the VGPM is a global open ocean model, when coupled with turbid water algorithms for Z(eu) and Chl a and constant (median) p(opt)(B), it provided realistic estimates of IPP in the turbid water ecosystem of Ariake Bay.

J	Xie, HX; Aubry, C; Belanger, S; Song, GS				Xie, Huixiang; Aubry, Cyril; Belanger, Simon; Song, Guisheng			The dynamics of absorption coefficients of CDOM and particles in the St. Lawrence estuarine system: Biogeochemical and physical implications	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Absorption spectra of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and particles were obtained in May 2007 in the St. Lawrence estuary (SLE. Canada), the northwestern Gulf of St. Lawrence (NWG), and the Saguenay Fjord (CDOM only), the main tributary of the SLE. CDOM absorption generally decreased downstream and with depth and showed an inverse relationship to tidal cycles. Phytoplankton absorption in surface water of the SLE increased seaward while non-algal particle absorption trended oppositely; both variables declined with depth. Surface water CDOM absorption surpassed particle absorption in the SLE while phytoplankton absorption dominated in the NWG. Elevated non-algal and CDOM absorption were found in the turbidity maximum zone near the head of the SLE. Enriched CDOM absorption also occurred in the bottom water of the lower SLE and NWG. The spectral slope ratio of CDOM absorption, defined as the ratio of the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm to that between 350 and 400 nm. was confirmed to be an indicator of the source and molecular weight of CDOM. This surrogate functionality, however, failed for absorption spectra exhibiting shoulders in short ultraviolet wavelengths observed in deep waters of the SLE and NWG. CDOM absorption mainly displayed conservative mixing behavior in both the SLE and the Saguenay Fjord. CDOM was employed to trace the source identity of the Fjord's deepwater. It was found that the marine end member of the Fjord's deepwater possessed a salinity of 32.92 and a temperature of ca. 1 degrees C and originated from the intermediate cold layer of the lower SLE. The marine end member contributed 94% of the deepwater by volume while freshwater mainly flown from the Saguenay River supplied the remaining 6%. Implications of our results for remote sensing-based assessments of primary productivity, surface water circulation, and water column photochemistry in the SLE are also discussed.

Changes in Humpback Whale Song Occurrence in Response to an Acoustic Source 200 km Away	PLOS ONE												The effect of underwater anthropogenic sound on marine mammals is of increasing concern. Here we show that humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) song in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) was reduced, concurrent with transmissions of an Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) experiment approximately 200 km away. We detected the OAWRS experiment in SBNMS during an 11 day period in autumn 2006. We compared the occurrence of song for 11 days before, during and after the experiment with song over the same 33 calendar days in two later years. Using a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model (GLM), we demonstrate a significant difference in the number of minutes with detected song between periods and years. The lack of humpback whale song during the OAWRS experiment was the most substantial signal in the data. Our findings demonstrate the greatest published distance over which anthropogenic sound has been shown to affect vocalizing baleen whales, and the first time that active acoustic fisheries technology has been shown to have this effect. The suitability of Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing technology for in-situ, long term monitoring of marine ecosystems should be considered, bearing in mind its possible effects on non-target species, in particular protected species.

QUANTIFICATION OF SOUTHERN OCEAN PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY VIA SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODELS	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper reviews Southern Ocean primary productivity within the framework of satellite remote sensing and the development of food-web models. The satellite ocean colour (chlorophyll) data record is described, from the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) in the late 1970s through to the Ocean Colour and Temperature Scanner (OCTS), the Sea-viewing, Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The characteristics of these data and limitations, such as cloud cover and high solar zenith angle, are discussed with regard to their use in the Southern Ocean. A brief history of algorithms linking ocean colour to primary productivity is presented, focusing on the vertically generalised production model (VGPM) and more recent regional approaches. Using monthly climatologies of SeaWiFS chlorophyll, a phenology of phytoplankton blooms is presented for the major provinces surrounding Antarctica. Some of the published information regarding phytoplankton species composition and succession is summarised. A review of ecosystem and biogeochemical models for the Southern Ocean is presented, with a focus on those models that have been validated using satellite ocean colour data.

J	Neckel, N; Drews, R; Rack, W; Steinhage, D				Neckel, Niklas; Drews, Reinhard; Rack, Wolfgang; Steinhage, Daniel			Basal melting at the Ekstrom Ice Shelf, Antarctica, estimated from mass flux divergence	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												We characterize the basal mass balance of the Ekstrom Ice Shelf, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, using interferometrically derived surface velocities and ice thickness measurements from radio-echo sounding (RES). The surface velocities are based on data from European Remote-sensing Satellites-1 and -2 (ERS similar to 1/2) during 1994-97. The ice thickness grid consists of 136 RES profiles acquired between 1996 and 2006. Mass fluxes are calculated along selected RES profiles where possible, to reduce uncertainties from ice thickness interpolation. Elsewhere large-scale mass fluxes are calculated using interpolated ice thickness data. The mass flux into the Ekstrom Ice Shelf from the main grounded drainage basins is estimated to be 3.19+/-0.4 Gt a(-1). The mass flux near the ice shelf front is 2.67+/-0.3 Gt a(-1). Assuming steady state, and based on the equation of continuity, we interpret the residual mass flux as a combined effect of snow accumulation and subglacial melting/refreezing. Using net snow accumulation rates from previous studies, we link the mass flux divergence in irregular-shaped polygons to processes beneath the ice shelf. The highest subglacial melt rates of similar to 1.1 m a(-1) are found near the grounding zone of two main inflow glaciers, and around the German station Neumayer III. The detection of unlikely refreezing in a small area similar to 15 km west of Neumayer III is attributed to both dataset inaccuracies and a (possibly past) violation of the steady-state assumption. In general, the method and input data allow mapping of the spatial distribution of basal melting and the results are in good agreement with several previous studies.

Comparison of MODIS cloud microphysical properties with in-situ measurements over the Southeast Pacific	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Utilizing the unique characteristics of the cloud over the Southeast Pacific (SEP) off the coast of Chile during the VOCALS field campaign, we compared satellite remote sensing of cloud microphysical properties against in-situ data from multi-aircraft observations, and studied the extent to which these retrieved properties are sufficiently constrained and consistent to reliably quantify the influence of aerosol loading on cloud droplet sizes. After constraining the spatial-temporal coincidence between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements, we selected 17 non-drizzle comparison pairs. For these cases the mean aircraft profiling times were within one hour of Terra overpasses at both projected and un-projected (actual) aircraft positions for two different averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km. Retrieved quantities that were averaged over a larger domain of 25 km compared better statistically with in-situ observations than averages over a smaller domain of 5 km. Comparison at projected aircraft positions was slightly better than un-projected aircraft positions for some parameters. Overall, both MODIS-retrieved effective radius and LWP were larger but highly correlated with the in-situ measured effective radius and LWP, e. g., for averaging domains of 5 km, the biases are up to 1.75 mu m and 0.02 mm whilst the correlation coefficients are about 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. The observed effective radius difference between the two decreased with increasing cloud drop number concentration (CDNC), and increased with increasing cloud geometrical thickness. Compared to the absolute effective radius difference, the correlations between the relative effective radius difference and CDNC or cloud geometric thickness are weaker. For averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km, the correlation coefficients between MODIS-retrieved and in-situ measured CDNC are 0.91 and 0.93 with fitting slopes of 1.23 and 1.27, respectively. If the cloud adiabaticity is taken into account, better agreements are achieved for both averaging domains (the fitting slopes are 1.04 and 1.07, respectively). Our comparison and sensitivity analysis of simulated retrievals demonstrate that both cloud geometrical thickness and cloud adiabaticity are important factors in satellite retrievals of effective radius and cloud drop number concentration. The large variabilities in cloud geometrical thickness and adiabaticity, the dependencies of cloud microphysical properties on both quantities (as demonstrated in our sensitivity study of simulated retrievals), and the inability to accurately account for either of them in retrievals lead to some uncertainties and biases in satellite retrieved cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration. However, strong correlations between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements suggest that satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration can be used to investigate aerosol indirect effects qualitatively.

Predictions for oil slicks detected from satellite images using MyOcean forecasting data	OCEAN SCIENCE												The pan-European capacity for the Ocean Monitoring and Forecasting (MyOcean) Marine Core Service, implementing the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) objectives, targets the provision of ocean state observations from various platforms and analysis and forecasting products to assist, among other downscaling activities, the needs of the operational response to marine safety, particularly concerning oil spills. The MEDSLIK oil spill and trajectory prediction system makes use of the MyOcean regional and Cyprus Coastal Ocean Forecasting and Observing System (CYCOFOS) downscaled forecasting products for operational application in the Mediterranean and pre-operational use in the Black Sea. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) satellite remote sensing images from the European Space Agency (ESA) and European Maritime Safety Agency CleanSeaNet (EMSA-CSN) provide the means for routine monitoring of the southern European seas for the detection of illegal oil discharges. MEDSLIK offers various ways, to be described in this paper, of coupling the MyOcean forecasting data with ASAR images to provide both forecasts and hindcasts for such remotely observed oil slicks. The main concern will be the drift of the oil slick and also, in the case of the forecast mode, its diffusive spreading, although some attempt is also made to estimate the changes in the state of the oil. The successful link of the satellite-detected oil slicks with their operational predictions using the MyOcean products contributes to the operational response chain and the strengthening of maritime safety for accidental or illegal spills, in implementation of the Mediterranean Decision Support System for Marine Safety (MEDESS-4MS) regarding oil spills.

The Biogeography of Marine Invertebrate Life Histories	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 43	Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics											Biologists have long sought to identify and explain patterns in the diverse array of marine life histories. The most famous speculation about such patterns is Gunnar Thorson's suggestion that species producing planktonic larvae are rarer at higher latitudes (Thorson's rule). Although some elements of Thorson's rule have proven incorrect, other elements remain untested. With a wealth of new life-history data, statistical approaches, and remote-sensing technology, new insights into marine reproduction can be generated. We gathered life-history data for more than 1,000 marine invertebrates and examined patterns in the prevalence of different life histories. Systematic patterns in marine life histories exist at a range of scales, some of which support Thorson, whereas others suggest previously unrecognized relationships between the marine environment and the life histories of marine invertebrates. Overall, marine life histories covary strongly with temperature and local ocean productivity, and different regions should be managed accordingly.

A comparison of spatially explicit and classic regression modelling of live coral cover using hyperspectral remote-sensing data in the Al Wajh lagoon, Red Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Live coral is a key component of the Al Wajh marine reserve in the Red Sea. The management of this reserve is dependent on a sound understanding of the existing spatial distribution of live coral cover and the environmental factors influencing live coral at the landscape scale. This study uses remote-sensing techniques to develop ordinary least squares and spatially lagged autoregressive explanatory models of the distribution of live coral cover inside the Al Wajh lagoon, Saudi Arabia. Live coral was modelled as a response to environmental controls such as water depth, the concentration of suspended sediment in the water column and exposure to incident waves. Airborne hyperspectral data were used to derive information on live coral cover as a response (dependent) variable at the landscape scale using linear spectral unmixing. Environmental controls (explanatory variables) were derived from a physics-based inversion of the remote-sensing dataset and validated against field-collected data. For spatial regression, cases referred to geographical locations that were explicitly drawn on in the modelling process to make use of the spatially dependent nature of coral cover controls. The transition from the ordinary least squares model to the spatially lagged model was accompanied by a marked growth in explanatory power (R-2 = 0.26 to 0.76). The theoretical implication that follows is that neighbourhood context interactions play an important role in determining live coral cover. This provides a persuasive case for building geographical considerations into studies of coral distribution.

Optical characterization and tests of closure for Oneida Lake, New York, USA	INLAND WATERS												Optical characteristics are a central feature of water quality and are increasingly used as a basis for monitoring concentrations of optically active constituents (OACs) through satellite-based remote sensing. This study presents a robust optical characterization of the near-surface waters of eutrophic Oneida Lake, New York, USA, that features in situ spectral measurements of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)), an apparent optical property (AOP) critical to remote sensing initiatives. The IOP measurements included the absorption coefficient, (a(lambda)), and particulate scattering (b(p)(lambda)) and backscattering (b(bp)(lambda)) coefficients. Supporting measurements included Secchi depth (SD), the OACs, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, suspended particulate material, and laboratory determinations of components of a(lambda) (a(x)(lambda)), including colored dissolved organic matter, nonalgal particles, and phytoplankton. The strong spectral patterns of a, a(x), and R-rs, and more modest wavelength dependencies of b(p) and b(bp), are documented. The credibility of the optical characterizations is demonstrated through (1) the consistency of relationships between SD-1 and b(p), and a(x) and the OACs; (2) the extent of closure between in situ and laboratory measurements of a and a(x); and (3) the extent of closure between predicted R-rs spectra, based on the observed IOP (a and b(bp)) spectra and application of a widely used radiative transfer relationship, and observations. Major temporal and substantial spatial variations in OACs, IOPs, SD, and R-rs(lambda) are documented. Much of the variability in the OACs and SD were well predicted by system- specific empirical relationships that used R-rs values at specified wavelengths (consistent with the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer [MERIS]) as the independent variables, supporting the potential for effective monitoring of these features through remote sensing in the future.																	2044-2041						2012	2	4					211	228		10.5268/IW-2.4.503								WOS:000310881900006

Estimating marine aerosol particle volume and number from Maritime Aerosol Network data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												As well as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol composition and concentration (number, volume, or mass) are of interest for a variety of applications. However, remote sensing of these quantities is more difficult than for AOD, as it is more sensitive to assumptions relating to aerosol composition. This study uses spectral AOD measured on Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) cruises, with the additional constraint of a microphysical model for unpolluted maritime aerosol based on analysis of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) inversions, to estimate these quantities over open ocean. When the MAN data are subset to those likely to be comprised of maritime aerosol, number and volume concentrations obtained are physically reasonable. Attempts to estimate surface concentration from columnar abundance, however, are shown to be limited by uncertainties in vertical distribution. Columnar AOD at 550 nm and aerosol number for unpolluted maritime cases are also compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, for both the present Collection 5.1 and forthcoming Collection 6. MODIS provides a best-fitting retrieval solution, as well as the average for several different solutions, with different aerosol microphysical models. The "average solution" MODIS dataset agrees more closely with MAN than the "best solution" dataset. Terra tends to retrieve lower aerosol number than MAN, and Aqua higher, linked with differences in the aerosol models commonly chosen. Collection 6 AOD is likely to agree more closely with MAN over open ocean than Collection 5.1. In situations where spectral AOD is measured accurately, and aerosol microphysical properties are reasonably well-constrained, estimates of aerosol number and volume using MAN or similar data would provide for a greater variety of potential comparisons with aerosol properties derived from satellite or chemistry transport model data. However, without accurate AOD data and prior knowledge of microphysical properties, such attempts are fraught with high uncertainties.

Automated remote sensing of sediment plumes for identification of runoff from the Greenland ice sheet	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The viability of employing sediment plumes emanating from outlets along the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet as indicators of runoff is assessed. An automated sediment plume quantification system based on daily 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) band 1 reflectance imagery is developed. Coherent plumes are identified using spectral thresholds and polygon tracing. Validation employs imagery quality-control procedures and manual verification of plume areas. Outlets at land-terminating margins with wide and straight fjord geometries deliver the most accurate and consistent results. Plume area observations are also possible at marine-terminating margins with relatively static fronts and low proximal sea-ice concentrations. Variability in plume area is examined with reference to Special Satellite Microwave Imager (SSM/I)-derived daily melt extent at the hydrologic catchment scale. At annual timescales, plume areas tend to co-vary with surface melt extent, indicating that more mass is lost by runoff during years of extensive melting. Some synchronicity in plume areas from different catchments is apparent. At seasonal and daily timescales, plumes from individual outlets primarily relate to catchment-specific melting.

Optical characterisation of suspended particles in the Mackenzie River plume (Canadian Arctic Ocean) and implications for ocean colour remote sensing	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate change significantly impacts Arctic shelf regions in terms of air temperature, ultraviolet radiation, melting of sea ice, precipitation, thawing of permafrost and coastal erosion. Direct consequences have been observed on the increasing Arctic river flow and a large amount of organic carbon sequestered in soils at high latitudes since the last glacial maximum can be expected to be delivered to the Arctic Ocean during the coming decade. Monitoring the fluxes and fate of this terrigenous organic carbon is problematic in such sparsely populated regions unless remote sensing techniques can be developed and proved to be operational. The main objective of this study is to develop an ocean colour algorithm to operationally monitor dynamics of suspended particulate matter (SPM) on the Mackenzie River continental shelf (Canadian Arctic Ocean) using satellite imagery. The water optical properties are documented across the study area and related to concentrations of SPM and particulate organic carbon (POC). Robust SPM and POC : SPM proxies are identified, such as the light backscattering and attenuation coefficients, and relationships are established between these optical and biogeochemical parameters. Following a semi-analytical approach, a regional SPM quantification relationship is obtained for the inversion of the water reflectance signal into SPM concentration. This relationship is reproduced based on independent field optical measurements. It is successfully applied to a selection of MODIS satellite data which allow estimating fluxes at the river mouth and monitoring the extension and dynamics of the Mackenzie River surface plume in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Good agreement is obtained with field observations representative of the whole water column in the river delta zone where terrigenous SPM is mainly constrained (out of short periods of maximum river outflow). Most of the seaward export of SPM is observed to occur within the west side of the river mouth. Future work will require the validation of the developed SPM regional algorithm based on match-ups with field measurements, then the routine application to ocean colour satellite data in order to better estimate the fluxes and fate of SPM and POC delivered by the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean.

In situ measurements of aerosol optical properties and number size distributions in a coastal region of Norway during the summer of 2008	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												In situ measurements of aerosol optical properties and particle size distributions were made in the summer of 2008 at the ALOMAR station facility (69 degrees 16 ' N, 16 degrees 00 ' E), located in a rural site in the north of the island of Andoya (VesterAyenlen archipelago), approximately 300 km north of the Arctic Circle. The extended three-month campaign was part of the POLARCAT Project (Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport) of the International Polar Year (IPY-2007-2008). Our goal was to characterize the aerosols of this sub-Arctic area, which are frequently transported to the Arctic region. Data from 13 June to 26 August 2008 were available and the statistical data for all instruments were calculated based on the hourly averages. The overall data coverage was approximately 72%. The hourly mean values of the light-scattering coefficient, Sigma(s), and the light-absorption coefficient, Sigma(a), at 550 nm were 5.41 Mm(-1) (StD = 3.55 Mm(-1)) and 0.40 Mm(-1) (StD = 0.27 Mm(-1)), respectively. The scattering/absorption Angstrom exponents, alpha(s,a), were used in a detailed analysis of the variations of the spectral shape of Sigma(s,a). While alpha(s) indicates the presence of two particle sizes corresponding to two types of aerosols, alpha(a) indicates only one type of absorbing aerosol particle. alpha(a) values greater than 1 were not observed. The single-scattering albedo, omega(0), ranged from 0.62 to 0.99 (mean = 0.91, StD = 0.05), and the relationships between this parameter and the absorption/scattering coefficients and the Angstrom exponents are presented. Any absorption value may lead to the lowest values of omega(0), whereas only the lowest scattering values were observed in the lowest range of omega(0). For a given absorption value, lower omega(0) were observed for smaller alpha(s). The submicrometer, micrometer and total concentrations of the particles presented hourly mean values of 1277 cm(-3) (StD = 1563 cm(-3)), 1 cm(-3) (StD = 1 cm(-3)) and 2463 cm(-3) (StD = 4251 cm(-3)), respectively, and the modal correlations were also investigated. The optical and microphysical parameters, as well as their relationship with each other, are reported. Sigma(s) correlated strongly with the number concentration of accumulation mode particles and more strongly with the micrometer fraction of particles, but weak correlations were observed for the Aitken and nucleation modes. The origins and pathways of the air masses were examined, and based on sector classification, a relationship between the air mass origin, the optical parameters and the size distributions was established. The low values of the optical and microphysical parameters indicate that the predominant regional aerosol is mostly clean and the shape of the size distribution is characterized by bimodal median size distributions. However, the relationships between the air mass origins and the parameters studied allow us to describe two characteristic situations: the one of the northern and western air masses, which were predominantly composed of marine aerosols and presented the lowest optical and microphysical values observed, indicating predominantly non-absorbent and coarser particles; and the one of the eastern and southern air masses, in which continental aerosols were predominant and exhibited higher values for all parameters, indicating the presence of smaller absorbent particles. The north-northeastern air masses presented the strongest Aitken mode, indicating more recently formed particles, and the southeastern air masses presented the strongest accumulation mode (however, the southeastern air masses were the least common, accounting for only 3% of occurrences).

To measure and report on progress towards the targets set a program has been established that combines monitoring and modelling at paddock through to catchment and reef scales; the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (Paddock to Reef Program). This program aims to provide evidence of links between land management activities, water quality and reef health. Five lines of evidence are used: the effectiveness of management practices to improve water quality; the prevalence of management practice adoption and change in catchment indicators; long-term monitoring of catchment water quality; paddock & catchment modelling to provide a relative assessment of progress towards meeting targets; and finally marine monitoring of GBR water quality and reef ecosystem health. This paper outlines the first four lines of evidence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Knowledge of the variability of the freshwater extent into the GBR lagoon is relevant for marine park management to develop strategies for improving ecosystem health and risk assessments. In this study, freshwater extent has been estimated for the entire GBR lagoon area from daily satellite observations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 2002 and 2010. To enable a reliable mapping of freshwater plumes we applied a physics-based coastal ocean colour algorithm, that simultaneously retrieves chlorophyll-a, non-algal particulate matter and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), from which we used CDOM as a surrogate for salinity (S) for mapping the freshwater extent.

No significant changes were found in marine phytoplankton in the first few months after the oil spill. However, a big phytoplankton bloom was observed after 10 months, when Chl-a increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mg m(-3). After considering the time-series variability of Chl-a and SST and the spatial variability of Chl-a and bathymetry, we concluded that this phytoplankton bloom was probably related to the Lebanon oil spill.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013	Pan, Gang/0000-0003-0054-6516												0143-1161						2012	33	23			SI		7482	7490		10.1080/01431161.2012.685982								WOS:000306286200012

Under the premises that the scarcity of field measurement data and the abundant but overlapped multiple satellites detect information, in this article the consistency of multiple source information is used to verify the accuracy and reliability of satellite remote sensing data. Due to the limitation of Grubbs test when analyzing multi-source satellites SST, an improved algorithm is proposed, which is found to be more effectively than the traditional variance method when quantifying the differences and conflicts of SST. And the method is applied to the data extracted from 11 SST products in East China Sea, so a large amount of points set with high consistent can be confirmed, the outlying data can be discovered and eliminated, the waters (not include the outlying data) with confliction can be dig out and the conflicting level also can be quantized. It provides reference for the subsequent researchers to evaluate the quality of marine information.																	1705-5105						2012	9	2					338	350										WOS:000305392000015

The coming of age of marine ornithology INTRODUCTION	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The founders of the at-sea study of marine birds were scientists who had the opportunity to go to sea on cruises designed for other purposes. Likewise, the first studies of seabirds in colonies were parts of larger expeditions or programs. Data were obtained by direct observation and manual recording in the field. With the advent of the miniaturization of electronics, data acquisition has become largely automated, the types of questions addressed are more sophisticated, and the analysis of large data sets has greatly advanced. As the field has matured, at-sea observations have become collaborative efforts between ornithologists and traditional oceanographers, and colony studies have begun to address fundamental questions of evolution and ecology. The continued development of devices that reveal the behavior and physiology of free ranging birds provides exciting opportunities for the expansion of marine ornithology.

J	Andrefouet, S; Hamel, MA; Dalleau, M				Andrefouet, Serge; Hamel, Melanie A.; Dalleau, Mayeul			Distinction between effective pattern-based and selection-based biodiversity surrogates is essential: caveats for managers	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ecological concepts and data may justify the selection of biodiversity conservation plans among different options, but can also lead to poor conservation guidelines if not properly used. The use and meaning of the 'surrogate' concept in ecology and conservation planning contexts is a typical example. Surrogates are entities such as species, environmental variables or habitats, which are used to represent a target entity such as genes, species, ecosystems or related metrics. 'Pattern-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates using statistical congruence, while 'selection-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates through a notional conservation plan or prioritization analysis where sites are added to a set of protected areas, often using a complementarity criterion between sites. With this clear framework in mind, an investigation of the coral reef literature revealed that most published studies on surrogates of reef biodiversity refer in fact to pattern-based surrogates. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with both approaches. However, efficient pattern-based surrogates are often recommended for conservation planning, implying that they could be efficient selection-based surrogates. In fact, efficient pattern-based surrogates are not necessarily efficient selection-based surrogates and vice versa. The reason is the complementarity rules used by selection algorithms. We call for more clarity from authors on the context in which effective surrogates have to be used, and more caution from managers when surrogates are to be used in conservation plans.

These groups have been pointed out as keys to improve the knowledge on ecosystem dynamics and effects of climate and anthropogenic changes in the marine environment. Orbital remote sensing is stated as the only means capable of analysing spatio-temporal distribution of PFTs, over regional and global scales. Many research teams have focused their efforts on the development of PFT bio-optical models, presenting a great variety of approaches. Considerable advances have been achieved in a few years of research; however, challenges are still great. Further developments rely on improvements in the knowledge of PFTs' bio-optical characteristics and the possibility of integrating different bio-optical and ecological information. This article presents a new review of the state of the art of PFTs' characterization from space, with examples of the main models and a discussion of achievements, gaps and future perspectives.

Multi-scale, object-based image analysis for mapping geomorphic and ecological zones on coral reefs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Providing accurate maps of coral reefs where the spatial scale and labels of the mapped features correspond to map units appropriate for examining biological and geomorphic structures and processes is a major challenge for remote sensing. The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy and relevance of the process used to derive geomorphic zone and benthic community zone maps for three western Pacific coral reefs produced from multi-scale, object-based image analysis (OBIA) of high-spatial-resolution multi-spectral images, guided by field survey data. Three Quickbird-2 multi-spectral data sets from reefs in Australia, Palau and Fiji and georeferenced field photographs were used in amulti-scale segmentation and object-based image classification to map geomorphic zones and benthic community zones. A per-pixel approach was also tested for mapping benthic community zones. Validation of the maps and comparison to past approaches indicated the multi-scale OBIA process enabled field data, operator field experience and a conceptual hierarchical model of the coral reef environment to be linked to provide output maps at geomorphic zone and benthic community scales on coral reefs. The OBIA mapping accuracies were comparable with previously published work using other methods; however, the classes mapped were matched to a predetermined set of features on the reef.

To mitigate these impacts, the preemptive detection and removal of DFG at sea are being pursued. This special issue focuses on the North Pacific Ocean because of historic and ongoing research on DFG in the area, particularly as it relates to the Hawaiian Archipelago. In order to develop an effective detection strategy, information and expertise from three disciplines must be integrated: marine debris, oceanography, and remote sensing technology. Building upon results and discussions during a workshop held in December 2008, this special issue provides both results of original research and review papers, pursuing each discipline as it relates to DFG and outlining a multi-faceted strategy to effectively detect DFG at sea. This strategy serves as a roadmap, taking us closer to realizing the goal of detecting and removing DFG at sea. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

At-sea detection of DFG would support pelagic removal of this gear to prevent and minimize impacts on marine environments and species. In 2008, experts in marine debris, oceanography, remote sensing, and marine policy outlined a strategy to develop the capability to detect and ultimately remove DFG from the open ocean. The strategy includes three interrelated components: understanding the characteristics of the targeted DFG, indirectly detecting DFG by modeling likely locations, and directly detecting pelagic DFG using remote sensing. Together, these components aim to refine the search area, increase the likelihood of detection, and decrease mitigation response time, thereby providing guidance for removal operations. Here, we present this at-sea detection strategy, relate it to relevant extant research and technology, and identify gaps that currently prevent successful at-sea detection and removal of DFG.

J	Mace, TH				Mace, Thomas H.			At-sea detection of marine debris: Overview of technologies, processes, issues, and options	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												At-sea detection of marine debris presents a difficult problem, as the debris items are often relatively small and partially submerged. However, they may accumulate in water parcel boundaries or eddy lines. The application of models, satellite radar and multispectral data, and airborne remote sensing (particularly radar) to focus the search on eddies and convergence zones in the open ocean appear to be a productive avenue of investigation. A multistage modeling and remote sensing approach is proposed for the identification of areas of the open ocean where debris items are more likely to congregate. A path forward may best be achieved through the refinement of the Ghost Net procedures with the addition of a final search stage using airborne radar from an UAS simulator aircraft to detect zones of potential accumulation for direct search. Sampling strategies, direct versus indirect measurements, remote sensing resolution, sensor/platform considerations, and future state are addressed.

The goal of the GhostNet project is the detection of derelict nets at sea through the use of weather and ocean models, drifting buoys and satellite imagery to locate convergent areas where nets are likely to collect, followed by airborne surveys with trained observers and remote sensing instruments to spot individual derelict nets. These components of GhostNet were first tested together in the field during a 14-day marine debris survey of the Gulf of Alaska in July and August 2003. Model, buoy, and satellite data were used in flight planning.

J	Veenstra, TS; Churnside, JH				Veenstra, Timothy S.; Churnside, James H.			Airborne sensors for detecting large marine debris at sea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The human eye is an excellent, general-purpose airborne sensor for detecting marine debris larger than 10 cm on or near the surface of the water. Coupled with the human brain, it can adjust for light conditions and sea-surface roughness, track persistence, differentiate color and texture, detect change in movement, and combine all of the available information to detect and identify marine debris. Matching this performance with computers and sensors is difficult at best. However, there are distinct advantages over the human eye and brain that sensors and computers can offer such as the ability to use finer spectral resolution, to work outside the spectral range of human vision, to control the illumination, to process the information in ways unavailable to the human vision system, to provide a more objective and reproducible result, to operate from unmanned aircraft, and to provide a permanent record that can be used for later analysis.

Impact of volcanic ash plume aerosol on cloud microphysics	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This study focuses on the dispersion of the Eyjafjallajokull volcanic ash plume over the west of Ireland, at the Mace Head Supersite, and its influence on cloud formation and microphysics during one significant event spanning May 16th and May 17th, 2010. Ground-based remote sensing of cloud microphysics was performed using a K-a-band Doppler cloud RADAR, a LIDAR-ceilometer and a multi-channel microwave-radiometer combined with the synergistic analysis scheme SYRSOC (Synergistic Remote Sensing Of Cloud). For this case study of volcanic aerosol interaction with clouds, cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), liquid water content (LWC), and droplet effective radius (r(eff)) and the relative dispersion were retrieved. A unique cloud type formed over Mace Head characterized by layer-averaged maximum, mean and standard deviation values of the CDNC, r(eff) and LWC: N-max = 948 cm(-3), (N) over bar = 297 cm(-3), sigma(N) = 250 cm(-3), r(eff) max = 35.5 mu m, (r(eff)) over bar = 4.8 mu m, sigma(reff) = 4.4 mu m, LWCmax = 0.23 g m(-3), (LWC) over bar = 0.055 g m(-3), sigma(LWC) = 0.054 g m(-3), respectively. The high CDNC, for marine clean air, were associated with large accumulation mode diameter (395 nm) and a hygroscopic growth factor consistent with sulphuric acid aerosol, despite being almost exclusively internally mixed in submicron sizes. Additionally, the Condensation Nuclei (CN, d > 10 nm) to Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) ratio, CCN:CN similar to 1 at the moderately low supersaturation of 0.25%. This case study illustrates the influence of volcanic aerosols on cloud formation and microphysics and shows that volcanic aerosol can be an efficient CCN. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding how species respond to the dynamics of their environment is important for developing effective management strategies. In this study, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to determine habitat variables most important in explaining variation in fish and invertebrate communities sampled with bottom trawls. We also quantified the relative explanatory power of seabed habitat features, pelagic features measured in situ and pelagic features measured remotely, all of which can be used to explain species variability. Pelagic habitat features, most notably surface and bottom temperature and stratification, explained 76% of the community variation observed, compared with 40.9% explained by seabed features, mainly depth. Remotely sensed pelagic characteristics explained 46.9% of the variation that was accounted for and were redundant for features measured in situ; this suggests that remotely sensed features are representative of features measured in situ including certain subsurface features. Cross-shelf and seasonal variation in environmental variables were the major predictors of species distributions and accounted for 71.3% of the total explained community variation. We described the seasonal dynamics of important habitat gradients and the responses of species with different habitat requirements and geographic range distributions to those gradients. We argue that consideration of dynamic pelagic features in addition to slowly changing features is important. Dynamic approaches are necessary for effective management and ocean observing systems can be used to develop dynamic space-based management strategies.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2012	447						15	30		10.3354/meps09496								WOS:000300660600002						
J	Cardona, L; Fernandez, G; Revelles, M; Aguilar, A				Cardona, Luis; Fernandez, Gloria; Revelles, Monica; Aguilar, Alejandro			Readaptation to the wild of rehabilitated loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) assessed by satellite telemetry	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Satellite telemetry was used to assess the readaptation to the wild of six loggerhead sea turtles after a long and complicated rehabilitation process. Their behaviour in the wild after release was compared with that of 12 healthy control turtles captured in the same region and fitted with similar satellite tags. The behaviour of the rehabilitated turtles was more variable than that of the control turtles and an outlier analysis revealed that only two of the six rehabilitated turtles did not differ in their behaviour from that of the control turtles. For the other turtles, the following anomalies were detected: a higher speed of travel, a negative cosine of the turning angle (the turtle turns back very often), a higher percentage of shelf use, a longer time at the surface at night, a higher averaged latitude during tracking, a shorter total tracking time and lower percentage of good quality fixes. Nevertheless, none of the turtles exhibited simultaneously these anomalies and only one turtle exhibited more than two anomalies. These results suggest that most rehabilitated loggerhead sea turtles survive in the wild at least for several months after release, even after a long and complicated process of veterinarian treatment, but many may exhibit behavioural anomalies, which casts doubts on the success of readaptation in the long run.

Hydrologic controls on coastal suspended sediment plumes around the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Rising sea levels and increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet have heightened the need for direct observations of meltwater release from the ice edge to ocean. Buoyant sediment plumes that develop in fjords downstream of outlet glaciers are controlled by numerous factors, including meltwater runoff. Here, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery is used to average surface suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in fjords around similar to 80% of Greenland from 2000-2009. Spatial and temporal patterns in SSC are compared with positive-degree-days (PDD), a proxy for surface melting, from the Polar MM5 regional climate model. Over this decade significant geographic covariance occurred between ice sheet PDD and fjord SSC, with outlet type (land-vs. marine-terminating glaciers) also important. In general, high SSC is associated with high PDD and/or a high proportion of land-terminating glaciers. Unlike previous site-specific studies of the Watson River plume at Kangerlussuaq, temporal covariance is low, suggesting that plume dimensions best capture interannual runoff dynamics whereas SSC allows assessment of meltwater signals across much broader fjord environments around the ice sheet. Remote sensing of both plume characteristics thus offers a viable approach for observing spatial and temporal patterns of meltwater release from the Greenland ice sheet to the global ocean.

Basal crevasses in Larsen C Ice Shelf and implications for their global abundance	CRYOSPHERE												Basal crevasses extend upwards from the base of ice bodies and can penetrate more than halfway through the ice column under conditions found commonly on ice shelves. As a result, they may locally modify the exchange of mass and energy between ice shelf and ocean, and by altering the shelf's mechanical properties could play a fundamental role in ice shelf stability. Although early studies revealed that such features may be abundant on Antarctic ice shelves, their geometrical properties and spatial distribution has gained little attention. We investigate basal crevasses in Larsen C Ice Shelf using field radar survey, remote sensing and numerical modelling. We demonstrate that a group of features visible in MODIS imagery are the surface expressions of basal crevasses in the form of surface troughs, and find that basal crevasses can be generated as a result of stresses well downstream of the grounding line. We show that linear elastic fracture mechanics modelling is a good predictor of basal crevasse penetration height where stresses are predominantly tensile, and that measured surface trough depth does not always reflect this height, probably because of snow accumulation in the trough, marine ice accretion in the crevasse, or stress bridging from the surrounding ice. We conclude that all features visible in MODIS imagery of ice shelves and previously labelled simply as "crevasses", where they are not full thickness rifts, must be basal crevasse troughs, highlighting a fundamental structural property of many ice shelves that may have been previously overlooked.

J	Wilcox, EM				Wilcox, E. M.			Direct and semi-direct radiative forcing of smoke aerosols over clouds	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Observations from Earth observing satellites indicate that dark carbonaceous aerosols that absorb solar radiation are widespread in the tropics and subtropics. When these aerosols mix with clouds, there is generally a reduction of cloudiness owing to absorption of solar energy in the aerosol layer. Over the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean, where smoke from savannah burning in southern Africa resides above a persistent deck of marine stratocumulus clouds, radiative heating of the smoke layer leads to a thickening of the cloud layer. Here, satellite observations of the albedo of overcast scenes of 25 km(2) size or larger are combined with additional satellite observations of clouds and aerosols to estimate the top-of-atmosphere direct radiative forcing attributable to presence of dark aerosol above bright cloud, and the negative semi-direct forcing attributable to the thickening of the cloud layer. The average positive direct radiative forcing by smoke over an overcast scene is 9.2 +/- 6.6 Wm(-2) for cases with an unambiguous signal of absorbing aerosol over cloud in passive ultraviolet remote sensing observations. However, cloud liquid water path is enhanced by 16.3 +/- 7.7 gm(-2) across the range of values for sea surface temperature for cases of smoke over cloud. The negative radiative forcing associated with this semi-direct effect of smoke over clouds is estimated to be -5.9 +/- 3.5 Wm(-2). Therefore, the cooling associated with the semi-direct cloud thickening effect compensates for greater than 60% of the direct radiative effect. Accounting for the frequency of occurrence of significant absorbing aerosol above overcast scenes leads to an estimate of the average direct forcing of 1.0 +/- 0.7 Wm(-2) contributed by these scenes averaged over the subtropical southeast Atlantic Ocean during austral winter. The regional average of the negative semi-direct forcing is -0.7 +/- 0.4 Wm(-2). Therefore, smoke aerosols overlaying the decks of overcast marine stratocumulus clouds considered here yield a small net positive radiative forcing, which results from the difference of two larger effects.																	1680-7316						2012	12	1					139	149		10.5194/acp-12-139-2012								WOS:000300320200006

MAMS did not have the IMU/POS equipment, so it brought severe challenge for. the geometry correction. One airborne geometry correction method is introduced for marine multispectrum data without the attitude information. First, it is the coarse geometry correction, which simulates the roll angle and pitch angle of plane according to the ideal flying model; the second step is the precise geometry correction by using the SPOT orthogonal projected data as the reference of registration, based on maximization of alignment metric method. With the validation, relative error of coarse correction is 81.42 in compared with SPOT data, and 11.3 m for precise correction. This method provides the high precision localization information for the oceanic remote sensing and application, and establishes the foundation for monitoring the marine resource and environment.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JAN	2012	31	1					59	65		10.1007/s13131-012-0176-1								WOS:000299492700007

A search for large-scale effects of ship emissions on clouds and radiation in satellite data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Ship tracks are regarded as the most obvious manifestations of the effect of anthropogenic aerosol particles on clouds (indirect effect). However, it is not yet fully quantified whether there are climatically relevant effects on large scales beyond the narrow ship tracks visible in selected satellite images. A combination of satellite and reanalysis data is used here to analyze regions in which major shipping lanes cut through otherwise pristine marine environments in subtropical and tropical oceans. We expect the region downwind of a shipping lane is affected by the aerosol produced by shipping emissions but not the one upwind. Thus, differences in microphysical and macrophysical cloud properties are analyzed statistically. We investigate microphysical and macrophysical cloud properties as well as the aerosol optical depth and its fine-mode fraction for the years 2005-2007 as provided for by retrievals of the two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments. Water-cloud properties include cloud optical depth, cloud droplet effective radius, cloud top temperature, and cloud top pressure. Large-scale meteorological parameters are taken from ERA-Interim reanalysis data and microwave remote sensing (sea surface temperature). We analyze the regions of interest in a Eulerian and Lagrangian sense, i.e., sampling along shipping lanes and sampling along wind trajectories, respectively. No statistically significant impacts of shipping emissions on large-scale cloud fields could be found in any of the selected regions close to major shipping lanes. In conclusion, the net indirect effects of aerosols from ship emissions are not large enough to be distinguishable from the natural dynamics controlling cloud presence and formation.

The spaceborne ocean color sensors provide synoptic and regular radiometric data and can be used for applying environmental policies if the data is converted into relevant biogeochemical properties. We adapted and developed semi-analytical and empirical algorithms to estimate the Secchi depth from satellite ocean color data in both coastal and oceanic waters. The development of the algorithms is based on the use of a comprehensive in situ bio-optical dataset The algorithms are validated using an extensive set of coincident satellite estimates and in situ measurements of the Secchi depth (so-called matchups). More than 400 matchups are compiled for the MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors. The comparison between Secchi depth retrievals from remote sensing data and in situ measurements yields determination coefficients (R-2) between 0.50 and 0.73, depending on the sensor and algorithm. The type II linear regression slopes and intercepts vary between 0.95 and 1.46, and between -0.8 and 6.2 in, respectively. While semi-analytical algorithms provide the most promising results on in situ data, the empirical one proves to be more robust on remote sensing data because it is less sensitive to error due to erroneous atmospheric corrections. Using ocean color archives, one can derive maps of ocean transparency for different areas. Our climatology of the Secchi depth based on ocean color for the transition zone between the North Sea and Baltic Sea is compared to an historical dataset (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In agreement with the strategy applied for other sensors, a vicarious calibration is conducted using in situ data from the Marine Optical BuoY offshore Hawaii, and leads to vicarious adjustment factors departing from 1 by 0.2% to 1.6%. The three field data sets used for validation have been collected at fixed stations in the northern Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea, and in a variety of European waters in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean and North Seas. Excluding Baltic waters, the mean absolute relative difference vertical bar psi vertical bar between satellite and field data is 10-14% for the spectral interval 490-560 nm, 16-18% at 443 nm, and 24-26% at 413 nm. In the Baltic Sea, the vertical bar psi vertical bar values are much higher for the blue bands characterized by low R-RS amplitudes, but similar or lower at 560 and 665 nm. For the three validation sets, the root-mean-square differences decrease from approximately 0.0013 sr(-1) at 413 nm to 0.0002 sr(-1) at 665 nm, and are found similar or lower than those obtained for SeaWiFS or MODIS-Aqua. As derived from SeaDAS, the R-RS records associated with these three missions thus provide a multi-mission data stream of consistent accuracy.

J	Ohtsu, K; Uye, SI				Ohtsu, Kohzoh; Uye, Shin-Ichi			Anomalous Infrared Taxis of an Aquatic Animal, the Giant Jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai (Scyphozoa, Rhizostomeae)	BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Remote sensing of thermal radiation (infrared wavelengths) has been reported only in some terrestrial animals and is known to have significant physiological and ecological meaning. In aquatic animals, however, it has not even been discussed because water almost completely absorbs infrared (IR) wavelengths, and such sensitivity has been regarded as useless in aquatic environments. Here we report, for the first time, an anomalous behavior-swimming toward an IR-radiating source-in an aquatic animal, the giant jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai. Experiments were performed with laboratory-reared juvenile medusae of Nemopilema in a small experimental chamber. In all 52 trials, the majority (average: 78.3%; variation: 63.3%-94.3%) of the medusae gathered on the IR-irradiated half of the chamber. Near-IR (850/940 nm) and visible light neither attracted the medusae nor induced taxis. A series of results indicated that the juveniles of Nemopilema tended to flock toward a mass of warmer water. Although the exact physiological and ecological meaning of this behavior is uncertain, it might be possible to consider infrared taxis as one of the behaviors in marine ecosystems. It may thus he useful to re-examine the swarming behavior reported in some jellyfish species from the viewpoint of IR taxis.																	0006-3185					DEC	2011	221	3					243	247		10.1086/BBLv221n3p243								WOS:000298440400002	22186912

The data from the new Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite TerraSAR-X with high resolution up to 1 m are used to render the ocean waves. As bathymetry is reflected by long swell wave refraction governed by underwater structures in shallow areas, it can be derived using the dispersion relation from observed swell properties. To complete the bathymetric maps, optical satellite data of the QuickBird satellite are fused to map extreme shallow waters, e.g., in near-coast areas. The algorithms for bathymetry estimation from optical and SAR data are combined and integrated in order to cover different depth domains. Both techniques make use of different physical phenomena and mathematical treatment. The optical methods based on sunlight reflection analysis provide depths in shallow water up to 20 m in preferably calm weather conditions. The depth estimation from SAR is based on the observation of long waves and covers the areas between about 70- and 10-m water depths depending on sea state and acquisition quality. The depths in the range of 20 m up to 10 m represent the domain where the synergy of data from both sources arises. Thus, the results derived from SAR and optical sensors complement each other. In this study, a bathymetry map near Rottnest Island, Australia, is derived. QuickBird satellite optical data and radar data from TerraSAR-X have been used. The depths estimated are aligned on two different grids. The first one is a uniform rectangular mesh with a horizontal resolution of 150 m, which corresponds to an average swell wavelength observed in the 10 x 10-km SAR image acquired. The second mesh has a resolution of 150 m for depths up to 20 m (deeper domain covered by SAR-based technique) and 2.4 m resolution for the shallow domain imaged by an optical sensor. This new technique provides a platform for mapping of coastal bathymetry over a broad area on a scale that is relevant to marine planners, managers, and offshore industry.																	1616-7341					DEC	2011	61	12					2099	2120		10.1007/s10236-011-0460-1								WOS:000297622600007						
J	Bell, PS; Osler, JC				Bell, Paul S.; Osler, John C.			Mapping bathymetry using X-band marine radar data recorded from a moving vessel	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Marine radars mounted on ships can provide remarkable insights into ocean behaviour from distances of several kilometres, placing other in situ observations and the environment around a ship into a wider oceanographic context. It has been known for some time that it is possible to map shallow water bathymetry and currents using radar image sequences recorded from shore based stations. However, a long standing question from military and hydrographic communities has been whether such techniques can be applied to radar data collected by moving vessels. If so, this presents the possibility of mapping large areas of shallow or coastal seas (albeit with a somewhat coarse horizontal resolution of 50-100 m) prior to the surveying vessel actually having to travel into potentially uncharted or dangerous shallow water areas. Trial sets of radar data were recorded by the Canadian Forces Auxiliary Vessel Quest using a Wamos radar digitiser connected to a Decca navigation radar during a number of deployments around Nova Scotia in 2008 and 2009. Georeferencing corrections derived from the existing ship navigation systems were sufficient to allow the application of the existing depth inversion analysis designed for static radar installations. This paper presents the results of bathymetry analyses of two datasets recorded from CFAV Quest while the vessel was travelling at speeds of up to 14 knots.

J	Galbraith, PS; Larouche, P				Galbraith, Peter S.; Larouche, Pierre			Sea-surface temperature in Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait in relation to air temperature and ice cover breakup, 1985-2009 (Reprinted from Journal of Marine Systems vol 87, pg 66-78, 2011)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Sea-surface weekly average temperatures derived from NOAA-AVHRR remote sensing data are analyzed for the period 1985-2009 for Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, and compared to weekly ice cover data obtained from the Canadian Ice Service for the period 1971-2009 as well as to monthly average air temperature at four stations around Hudson Bay and to four around Hudson Strait. Results show a decreasing trend in the breakup date of the sea-ice in Hudson Strait of 5.6 days per decade since 1971 as well as an interannual variability of 5 degrees C in the Hudson Bay average SST in August between extreme years. There is good correlation in Hudson Bay between average SST in August and average air temperature anomalies at four meteorological weather stations (R(2)=0.80) and with the percentage of open water from June to August (R(2)=0.80). Climatology for SST of the warmest week of the year is presented, and the variability of different regions within Hudson Bay is discussed. One area in southwestern Hudson Bay is shown to exhibit the highest interannual variability, having nearly the warmest surface waters in some years and nearly the coldest in others. The historical observed variability of SST and ice cover is compared to expected changes in the literature that are associated with climate change. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we show how the combination of biooptical data from satellites, analysis of water samples, and a ship-mounted automatic flow-through sensor system (Ferrybox) can be used to detect and monitor phytoplankton blooms both spatially and temporally. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) data and turbidity from Ferrybox are combined with remotely sensed Chl a and total suspended matter from the MERIS instrument aboard the satellite ENVISAT (ENVIronmental SATellite) European Space Agency. Data from phytoplankton speciation and enumeration obtained by a national coastal observation network consisting of fish farms and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority are supplemented with data on phytoplankton pigments. All the data sets are then integrated in order to describe phytoplankton bloom dynamics in a Norwegian fjord over a growth season, with particular focus on Emiliania huxleyi. The approach represents a case example of how coastal environmental monitoring can be improved with existing instrument platforms. The objectives of the paper is to present the operative phytoplankton monitoring scheme in Norway, and to present an improved model of how such a scheme can be designed for a large part of the world's coastal areas.

J	Heumann, BW				Heumann, Benjamin W.			An Object-Based Classification of Mangroves Using a Hybrid Decision Tree-Support Vector Machine Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Mangroves provide valuable ecosystem goods and services such as carbon sequestration, habitat for terrestrial and marine fauna, and coastal hazard mitigation. The use of satellite remote sensing to map mangroves has become widespread as it can provide accurate, efficient, and repeatable assessments. Traditional remote sensing approaches have failed to accurately map fringe mangroves and true mangrove species due to relatively coarse spatial resolution and/or spectral confusion with landward vegetation. This study demonstrates the use of the new Worldview-2 sensor, Object-based image analysis (OBIA), and support vector machine (SVM) classification to overcome both of these limitations. An exploratory spectral separability showed that individual mangrove species could not be spectrally separated, but a distinction between true and associate mangrove species could be made. An OBIA classification was used that combined a decision-tree classification with the machine-learning SVM classification. Results showed an overall accuracy greater than 94% (kappa = 0.863) for classifying true mangroves species and other dense coastal vegetation at the object level. There remain serious challenges to accurately mapping fringe mangroves using remote sensing data due to spectral similarity of mangrove and associate species, lack of clear zonation between species, and mixed pixel effects, especially when vegetation is sparse or degraded.

GIS Modelling of Intertidal Wetland Exposure Characteristics	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												CROWELL, N.; WEBSTER, T., and O'Driscoll, N.J., 2011. GIS modelling of intertidal wetland exposure characteristics. Journal of Coastal Research, 27(6A), 44-51. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Exposure to solar radiation and tidal inundation are important factors for a wide variety of chemical and ecological processes in coastal ecosystems. Accurate quantification of these factors is often difficult on a local scale. To address this research gap, a remote-sensing approach was developed to model inundation and radiation characteristics within an intertidal zone located in the Minas Basin (Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada). A light detection and ranging (LIDAR) derived elevation model was subjected to tidal modelling based on hourly sea level predictions and solar modelling based on sunrise and sunset times for 2009. Model results indicated an intertidal zone of 145.8 km(2) with an elevation between 6.9 m and 6.8 m. The intertidal zone was determined to contain three unique wetland classes: (1) 4.4 km(2) of high salt marsh, dominated by Spartina patens; (2) 5.0 km(2) of low salt marsh, dominated by Spartina alterniflora; and (3) 63.1 km(2) of nonvegetated marine flat (73.3 km(2) unclassified intertidal). Detailed exposure characteristics were calculated for each of the classes within the intertidal zone at 10-cm vertical intervals. Exposure calculations for 2009 showed that an average of 4.2 km(2) of salt marsh were exposed to solar radiation and 8.4 km(2) were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. Similarly, 11.7 km(2) of marine flat were exposed to solar radiation and 22.9 km(2) were exposed to the atmosphere each hour. The developed remote-sensing techniques successfully established intertidal zones, uniquely identified wetland classes, and modelled inundation and solar exposure characteristics within the study area.

Our method infers the 3-D waveform and radiance of oceanic sea states via a variational stereo imagery formulation. In this setting, the shape and radiance of the wave surface are given by minimizers of a composite energy functional that combines a photometric matching term along with regularization terms involving the smoothness of the unknowns. The desired ocean surface shape and radiance are the solution of a system of coupled partial differential equations derived from the optimality conditions of the energy functional. The proposed method is naturally extended to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of ocean waves and applied to three sets of stereo video data. Statistical and spectral analysis are carried out. Our results provide evidence that the observed omnidirectional wavenumber spectrum S(k) decays as k(-2.5) is in agreement with Zakharov's theory (1999). Furthermore, the 3-D spectrum of the reconstructed wave surface is exploited to estimate wave dispersion and currents.

Satellite imagery can be used to detect variation in abundance of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay, Antarctica	POLAR BIOLOGY												The Weddell seal population in Erebus Bay, Antarctica, represents one of the best-studied marine mammal populations in the world, providing an ideal test for the efficacy of satellite imagery to inform about seal abundance and population trends. Using high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery, we compared counts from imagery to ground counts of adult Weddell seals and determined temporal trends in Erebus Bay during November 2004-2006 and 2009, and December 2007. Seals were counted from Quick-Bird-2 and WorldView-1 images, and these counts were compared with ground counts at overlapping locations within Erebus Bay during the same time. Counts were compared across years and within individual haul-out locations. We counted a total of 1,000 adult Weddell seals from five images across all years (for a total of 21 satellite-to-ground count comparisons), approximately 72% of the total counted on the ground at overlapping locations. We accurately detected an increase in abundance during 2004-2009. There was a strong, positive correlation (r = 0.98, df = 3, P < 0.003) between ground counts and counts derived from the imagery. The correlation between counts at individual haul-out locations was also strong (r = 0.80, df = 19, P < 0.001). Detection rates ranged from 30 to 88%. Overall, our results showed the utility of high-resolution imagery to provide an accurate way to detect the presence and variation in abundance of Weddell seals. Our methods may be applied to other species in polar regions, such as walruses or polar bears, particularly in areas where little is known about population status.																	0722-4060					NOV	2011	34	11					1727	1737		10.1007/s00300-011-1023-0								WOS:000297202900010

Multi-sensor satellite time series of optical properties and chlorophyll-a concentration in the Adriatic Sea	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Advanced remote sensing techniques and regional algorithms are combined to produce and analyze a 12-year multi-sensor time series of bio-optical properties for the Adriatic Sea. First, a multi-sensor series of normalized water-leaving radiance L-WN is created with an optically-based merging technique applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS data, then distributions of inherent optical properties (IOPs) are obtained with a semi-analytical bio-optical model. Additionally, Chla is computed by two regional empirical algorithms associated with two classes of optical properties representative of open ocean waters and Adriatic coastal regions (Classes 1 and 2, respectively). The domain of applicability of each algorithm is dynamically determined on the basis of the L-WN input spectrum by a novelty detection approach. The various satellite products are validated using a comprehensive bio-optical time series collected in the northern Adriatic. At the basin level, the frequency of occurrence of Classes 1 and 2 are 61% and 10%, respectively, with Class 2 waters particularly located in the northern part and characterized by higher levels of Chla and IOPs. The annual cycle of Chla over the 12-year period exhibits significant variations in amplitude and phase: moreover, the annual cycle shows a reduced amplitude during a period centered on 2004 for a time interval that varies with the region. In the northern Adriatic, the overall level of Chla appears lower between 2003 and 2008 compared to the beginning of the series. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mengistu			Aerosol climatology over South Africa based on 10 years of Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In this paper, we present a detailed study of the spatial and seasonal aerosol climatology over South Africa (SA), based on Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data. We have used 10 years (2000-2009) of MISR monthly mean aerosol extinction (tau(ext)), absorption (tau(a)) optical depths at 558 nm, Angstrom exponents in visible (VIS; 446-672 nm) and near-infrared (NIR; 672-866 nm) spectral bands, and the extracted spectral curvature. The study has shown that, in terms of aerosol load level spatial variation, SA can be classified into three parts: the upper, central, and lower, which illustrate high, medium, and low aerosol loadings, respectively. The results for the three parts of SA are presented in detail. The prevailing sources of aerosols are different in each part of SA. The lower part is dominated by the air mass transport from the surrounding marine environment and other SA or neighboring regions, while the central and upper parts are loaded through wind-ablated mineral dust and local anthropogenic activities. During the biomass burning seasons (July-September), the central part of SA is more affected than the rest of SA by the biomass-burning aerosols (based on tau(a), similar to 20% higher than the rest of SA). In alignment with the observed higher values of tau(ext), aerosol size distributions were found to be highly variable in the upper part of SA, which is due to the high population and the industrial/mining/agricultural activities in this area.

J	Zhang, ZB; Platnick, S				Zhang, Zhibo; Platnick, Steven			An assessment of differences between cloud effective particle radius retrievals for marine water clouds from three MODIS spectral bands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product provides three separate 1 km resolution retrievals of cloud particle effective radii (r(e)), derived from 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m band observations. In this study, differences among the three size retrievals for maritime water clouds (designated as r(e,1.6) r(e,2.1) and r(e,3.7)) were systematically investigated through a series of case studies and global analyses. Substantial differences are found between r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) retrievals (Delta r(e,3.7-2.1)), with a strong dependence on cloud regime. The differences are typically small, within +/- 2 mu m, over relatively spatially homogeneous costal stratocumulus cloud regions. However, for trade wind cumulus regimes, r(e,3.7) was found to be substantially smaller than r(e,2.1), sometimes by more than 10 mu m. The correlation of Delta r(e,3.7-2.1) with key cloud parameters, including the cloud optical thickness (tau), r(e) and a cloud horizontal heterogeneity index (H-sigma) derived from 250m resolution MODIS 0.86 mu m band observations, were investigated using one month of MODIS Terra data. It was found that differences among the three r(e) retrievals for optically thin clouds (tau < 5) are highly variable, ranging from -15 mu m to 10 mu m, likely due to the large MODIS retrieval uncertainties when the cloud is thin. The Delta r(e),(3.7-2.1) exhibited a threshold-like dependence on both r(e,2.1) and H-sigma. The r(e,3.7) is found to agree reasonably well with re,(2.1) when r(e,2.1) is smaller than about 15 mu m, but becomes increasingly smaller than r(e,2.1) once r(e,2.1) exceeds this size. All three r(e) retrievals showed little dependence when cloud is relatively homogenous (H-sigma < 0.3 defined as standard deviation divided by the mean for the 250 m pixels within a 1 km pixel retrieval). However, for inhomogeneous clouds (H-sigma > 0.3), both r(e, 1.6) and r(e,2.1) were seen to increase quickly with H-sigma. On the other hand, r(e,3.7) statistics showed little dependence on H-sigma and remained relatively stable over the whole range of H-sigma values. Potential contributing causes to the substantial r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) differences are discussed. In particular, based on both 1-D and 3-D radiative transfer simulations, we have elucidated mechanisms by which cloud heterogeneity and 3-D radiative effects can cause large differences between r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) retrievals for highly inhomogeneous clouds. Our results suggest that the contrast in observed Delta r(e,3.7-2.1) between cloud regimes is correlated with increases in both cloud re and Hs. We also speculate that in some highly inhomogeneous drizzling clouds, vertical structure induced by drizzle and 3-D radiative effects might operate together to cause dramatic differences between r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) retrievals.

Long-term changes in light scattering in Chesapeake Bay inferred from Secchi depth, light attenuation, and remote sensing measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The relationship between the Secchi depth (Z(SD)) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation (K-d(PAR)), and in particular the product of the two, Z(SD)center dot K-d(PAR), is governed primarily by the ratio of light scattering to absorption. We analyzed measurements of Z(SD) and K-d(PAR) at main stem stations in Chesapeake Bay and found that the Z(SD)center dot K-d(PAR) product has declined at rates varying from 0.020 to 0.033 yr(-1) over the 17 to 25 years of measurement, implying that there has been a long-term increase in the scattering-to-absorption ratio. Remote sensing reflectance at the green wavelength most relevant to Z(SD) and K-d(PAR) in these waters, R-rs(555), did not exhibit an increasing trend over the 10 years of available measurements. To reconcile the observations we constructed a bio-optical model to calculate Z(SD), K-d(PAR), Z(SD)center dot K-d(PAR), and R-rs(555) as a function of light attenuating substances and their mass-specific absorption and scattering coefficients. When simulations were based exclusively on changes in concentrations of light attenuating substances, a declining trend in Z(SD)center dot K-d entailed an increasing trend in R-rs(555), contrary to observations. To simulate both decreasing Z(SD center dot)K(d)(PAR) and stationary R-rs(555), it was necessary to allow for a declining trend in the ratio of backscattering to total scattering. Within our simulations, this was accomplished by increasing the relative proportion of organic detritus with high mass-specific scattering and low backscattering ratio. An alternative explanation not explicitly modeled is an increasing tendency for the particulate matter to occur in large aggregates. Data to discriminate between these alternatives are not available.

In this study we assessed spatial variability and temporal dynamics of benthic habitat types in a relatively turbid northeastern Baltic Sea coastal environment using the space-borne multispectral sensor QuickBird. Seven broad habitat classes were defined for the study area representing the most typical habitats of the coastal environment. The studied classes were bare sand, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, hard bottom with ephemeral algae, higher-order plants and/or charophytes on soft bright bottom, dense higher-order plant habitats, and drifting algal mats and deep water (>3m). Two QuickBird images acquired over a 3 year interval (2005 to 2008) of Western-Estonian archipelago were processed and change detection analysis applied. Although there was a relatively large scatter in reflectance variability within each habitat type, the analyses allowed a clear differentiation of most habitat types. Exceptions were the lack of statistical differences among deep water, drifting algae, and dense higher-order plant communities, as well as among low density higher-order plant and algal communities. Major changes in the spatial patterns of benthic habitats occurred in hydrodynamically active areas. Differences in water properties caused some confusion in classification and therefore resulted in inaccuracies in maps of change. Thus, the used broad habitat classes represent the limit of the method and the multispectral sensors do not allow finer elements of habitats to be captured.

A unitary physical model, based on the covariance matrix C, is exploited to design two new SAR marine polarimetric value-added products, one for oil slicks and the other for manmade metallic target observation. Both make use of a new physical SAR processing methodology that relies on: a) Cloude-Pottier target decomposition theorem, b) the symmetry properties of the observed scene, and c) the availability of the RADARSAT-2 fine quad-polarization mode. Experimental results demonstrated the powerful capabilities of both procedures that take full advantage of fine quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data for polarimetric SAR observation of oil fields.

Molecular ecology meets remote sensing: environmental drivers to population structure of humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean	HEREDITY												Genetic analyses of population structure can be placed in explicit environmental contexts if appropriate environmental data are available. Here, we use high-coverage and high-resolution oceanographic and genetic sequence data to assess population structure patterns and their potential environmental influences for humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA data from 94 dolphins from the coasts of South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Oman, employing frequency-based and maximum-likelihood algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. The genetic data were combined with 13 years of remote sensing oceanographic data of variables known to influence cetacean dispersal and population structure. Our analyses show strong and highly significant genetic structure between all putative populations, except for those in South Africa and Mozambique. Interestingly, the oceanographic data display marked environmental heterogeneity between all sampling areas and a degree of overlap between South Africa and Mozambique. Our combined analyses therefore suggest the occurrence of genetically isolated populations of humpback dolphins in areas that are environmentally distinct. This study highlights the utility of molecular tools in combination with high-resolution and high-coverage environmental data to address questions not only pertaining to genetic population structure, but also to relevant ecological processes in marine species.

Samples were collected along three cruise transects from Jaeren, Lista and Oksoy on the south coast of Norway and into the North Sea and Skagerrak. We also followed a drifting buoy for 55 h in Skagerrak in order to observe diel variations. Satellite ocean color images (SeaWiFS) of the chlorophyll a (chl a) distribution compared favorably to in situ measurements in open waters, while closer to the shore remote sensing chl a data was overestimated compared to the in situ data. Using light microscopy, we identified 49 micro- and 15 nanoplankton sized phototrophic forms as well as 40 micro- and 12 nanoplankton sized heterotrophic forms. The only picoeukaryote (0.2-2.0 mu m) we identified was Resultor micron (Pedinophyceae). Along the transects a significant variation in the distribution and abundance of different plankton forms were observed, with Synechococcus spp and autotrophic picoeukaryotes as the most notable examples. There was no correlation between viruses and chl a, but between viruses and bacteria, and between viruses and some of the phytoplankton groups, especially the picoeukaryotes. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between nutrients and small viruses (Low Fluorescent Viruses) but a positive correlation between nutrients and large viruses (High Fluorescent Viruses). The abundance of autotrophic picoplankton, bacteria and viruses showed a diel variation in surface waters with higher values around noon and late at night and lower values in the evening. Synechococcus spp were found at 20 m depth 25-45 nautical miles from shore apparently forming a bloom that stretched out for more than 100 nautical miles from Skagerrak and up the south west coast of Norway. The different methods used for assessing abundance, distribution and diversity of microorganisms yielded complementary information about the plankton community. Flow cytometry enabled us to map the distribution of the smaller phytoplankton forms, bacteria and viruses in more detail than has been possible before but detection and quantification of specific forms (genus or species) still requires taxonomic skills, molecular analysis or both.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the use of R-rs(443)/R-rs(490) (hereafter R1) skewness (psi) as an indicator of vertical optical structure in different marine regions. Measurements of inherent optical properties were obtained using a remotely operated towed vehicle and R1 was theoretically derived from optical profiles. Although the broad range of trophic status and water stratification, a common statistical pattern consisting of lower psi R1-a deeper optical layer was found in all study cases. This variation was attributed to optical changes above the opticline and related to horizontal variability of particulates and spectral variations with depth. We recommend more comparisons in stratified coastal waters with different phytoplankton communities before the use of psi R1 can be generalized as a noninvasive optical proxy for screening depth changes on subsurface optical layers.

Recent developments in regional climate modelling and remote sensing, especially altimetry, gravimetry and InSAR feature tracking, have enabled us to specifically resolve the ice sheet mass balance components at a near-annual timescale. The results reveal significant mass losses for both ice sheets, caused by the acceleration of marine-terminating glaciers in southeast, west and northwest Greenland and coastal West Antarctica, and increased run-off in Greenland. At the same time, the data show that interannual variability is very significant, masking the underlying trends.

The data volume and processing requirements associated with remote sensing are rapidly expanding as a result of the increasing number of satellite and airborne sensors, greater data accessibility, and expanded utilization of data intensive technologies such as imaging spectroscopy. However, due to the limited ability of current computing systems to gracefully scale with application requirements, particularly in the desktop level market, large amounts of data are currently underutilized or never explored. Computing limitations thus constrain our ability to efficiently and accurately address key science questions using remote sensing. The current evolution in general purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), an emerging technology that is redefining the field of high performance computing, facilitates significantly improved computing capabilities for current and future image analysis needs. We demonstrate the advantages of this technology by accelerating an imaging spectroscopy algorithm for submerged marine habitats using GPU computing. Results indicate that considerable improvement in performance can be achieved using a single GPU on a standard desktop computer. This technology has enormous potential for continued growth exploiting high performance computing, and provides the foundation for significantly enhanced remote sensing capabilities.																	1939-1404					SEP	2011	4	3			SI		669	676		10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2108269								WOS:000294550600014

In lagoon cities the pollution from maritime traffic is greater than in other coastal areas. Therefore monitoring and evaluation of pollutants produced by ships navigating through the principal transport channles become necessary. In the case of Venice, the Giudecca channel, crossing the city centre, is used both by urban maritime traffic and by large vessels docking in the port. In this work, the FE-DOAS (Flow Rate Emission with Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) methodology developed to evaluate gaseous pollutant flow rates from moving sources is presented. This methodology is applied to a set of spectral measurements performed with a Multi axis DOAS remote sensing system, allowing a determination of vessel emissions and evaluation of their impact on pollution in Venice. Two on-month measurement campaigns were carried out: from June 12 2007 to July 12 2007 and from September 12 2007 to October 12 2007. The individual flow rates released by large and medium-sized vessels and the total flow rate emissions due to the total traffic along the Giudecca Channel for every day with appropriate meteo conditions during the campaigns are estimated. The average daily mass of gas emitted by large and medium-sized ships during their passage through the Channel was evaluated as about 205 kg for SO(2) and 284 Kg for NO(2). These values make up only about 30% of total daily traffic emission. These results are extremely interesting, because they demonstrate inequivocably the effectiveness of the proposed system for remote measurements, opening a new frontier in maritime traffic emmission control in harbour areas or in those coastal zones subject to heavy maritime traffic. Moreover, the low values obtained for some large modern cruise ships indicate the use of Low Sulphur Fuels, even though these are not yet required by local regulation. (C) Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of space adequateness of shrimp farms in Southern Brazil	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												In Rio Grande do Sul State, there are four marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) farms in the municipal districts of Sao Jose do Norte and Rio Grande, and other four with previous license for operation. Thus, the present study aimed to identify and characterize areas for marine shrimp farming located in the Southern portion of the Patos Lagoon estuary (32 degrees 00'S 52 degrees 00'W) by employing the analysis of satellite remote sensing (Landsat TM and ETM+/Google Earth), airborne remote sensing (35mm system ADAR 1000), terrestrial remote sensing (RICOH 500SE), and field expeditions, integrating data in a Geographical Information System (IDRISI Andes). As a result, the enterprises were built on coastal fields or in obliterated dune areas, which are favorable for cultivation. The proximity of possible consuming markets and local labor, relatively good access roads and local technical support also favor the projects. However, there must be caution in terms of changes in the original projects, which could cause environmental impacts and noncompliance of environmental norms, such as the occupation of salt marsh areas. Based on the obtained information, instruments can be created to help inherent legal decision-making to manage the activity for futures enterprises.				freitas, rodrigo/H-3130-2011	Poersch, Luis/0000-0002-1663-6252; Digorandow, Rodrigo Randow de Freitas/0000-0003-0170-6892												0001-3765					SEP	2011	83	3					1069	1076		10.1590/S0001-37652011005000024								WOS:000294126600025	21808923

Epipelagic fish distributions in relation to thermal fronts in a coastal upwelling system using high-resolution remote-sensing techniques	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Coastal upwelling systems are characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variability with respect to surface conditions, with fauna patchily distributed and high abundances in localized areas. Examining habitat associations on finer spatial scales than previous studies have been able to achieve would advance the understanding of important marine coastal ecosystems. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal relationships of single fish and fish schools with sea surface temperature (SST) fronts in the northern California Current upwelling system, using lidar (light detection and ranging) from an aircraft to sample surface waters over the continental shelf. High-resolution data were collected on the distribution of surface nekton and SST, then the locations of fish were analysed with respect to their proximity to SST fronts using GIS spatial analyses. Both fish schools and solitary fish were located significantly closer to fronts than would be expected by chance. The association of fish to fronts varied with the progression of the upwelling season such that fish associated less with fronts under stronger upwelling conditions. The relationships observed indicate the importance of thermal features to fish as a habitat component in a variable upwelling environment and have implications for management and conservation.

This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties in the visible from the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region assuming that the seawater is totally absorbant in this latter part of the spectrum. However, the non-negligible water-leaving radiance in the NIR which is characteristic of turbid waters may lead to an overestimate of the atmospheric radiance in the whole visible spectrum with increasing severity at shorter wavelengths. This may result in significant errors, if not complete failure, of various algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration, inherent optical properties and biogeochemical parameters of surface waters. This paper presents results of an inter-comparison study of three methods that compensate for NIR water-leaving radiances and that are based on very different hypothesis: 1) the standard Sea WiFS algorithm (Stumpfet al., 2003; Bailey et al., 2010) based on a bio-optical model and an iterative process; 2) the algorithm developed by Ruddick et al. (2000) based on the spatial homogeneity of the NIR ratios of the aerosol and water-leaving radiances; and 3) the algorithm of Kuchinke et al. (2009) based on a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean spectral optimization inversion. They are compared using normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w) in the visible. The reference source for comparison is ground-based measurements from three AERONET-Ocean Color sites, one in the Adriatic Sea and two in the East Coast of USA. Based on the matchup exercise, the best overall estimates of the nL(w) are obtained with the latest SeaWiFS standard algorithm version with relative error varying from 14.97% to 35.27% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 670 nm respectively. The least accurate estimates are given by the algorithm of Ruddick, the relative errors being between 16.36% and 42.92% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 412 nm, respectively. The algorithm of Kuchinke appears to be the most accurate algorithm at 412 nm (30.02%), 510 (15.54%) and 670 nm (32.32%) using its default optimization and bio-optical model coefficient settings. Similar conclusions are obtained for the aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical thickness tau(865) and the Angstrom exponent, alpha(510, 865)). Those parameters are retrieved more accurately with the SeaWiFS standard algorithm (relative error of 33% and 54.15% for tau(865) and alpha(510, 865)). A detailed analysis of the hypotheses of the methods is given for explaining the differences between the algorithms. The determination of the aerosol parameters is critical for the algorithm of Ruddick et al. (2000) while the bio-optical model is critical for the algorithm of Stumpf et al. (2003) utilized in the standard SeaWiFS atmospheric correction and both aerosol and bio-optical model for the coupled atmospheric-ocean algorithm of Kuchinke. The Kuchinke algorithm presents model aerosol-size distributions that differ from real aerosol-size distribution pertaining to the measurements. In conclusion, the results show that for the given atmospheric and oceanic conditions of this study, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm is most appropriate for estimating the marine and aerosol parameters in the given turbid waters regions.

Cross-site consistent in situ measurements for satellite ocean color applications: The BiOMaP radiometric dataset	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The development and assessment of satellite ocean color products require quality assured in situ data representative of the variety of bio-optical regimes encountered in the different seas. The measurement program named Bio-Optical mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) fulfills this requirement by using identical instruments and applying cross-site consistent methods for the characterization of seawater inherent and apparent optical properties in the various European seas. This work introduces the BiOMaP radiometric data and describes their application to the validation of primary ocean color products. Within this framework, the radiometric data are discussed through the spectral shape and amplitude of normalized water-leaving radiances (L-WN). Specifically, the spectral shape is expressed through the Principal Component Analysis of L-WN(lambda)/L-WN(555) while the amplitude is represented by L-WN(555). The resulting distribution of BiOMaP data in a three dimensional feature space demonstrates a continuity of cases across the investigated marine regions confirming a wide representativity of bio-optical regimes. The application of BiOMaP data to the validation of remote sensing reflectance from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S), indicates improved performance of the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS, version 6.1) atmospheric correction. In particular, the comparison of satellite and in situ matchups in the blue spectral region shows biases of a few percent with respect to the much larger reported in studies relying on earlier SeaDAS versions. Matchup analyses, restricted to the Eastern Mediterranean, Black and Baltic Seas, indicate marked regional differences likely explained by the diversity of water and aerosol types.

J	Tiwari, SP; Shanmugam, P				Tiwari, S. P.; Shanmugam, P.			An optical model for the remote sensing of coloured dissolved organic matter in coastal/ocean waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												An optical model is developed for the remote sensing of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a wide range of waters within coastal and open ocean environments. The absorption of CDOM (denoted as a(g)) is generally considered as an exponential form model, which has two important parameters - the slope S and absorption of CDOM at a reference wavelength a(g)(lambda(0)). The empirical relationships for deriving these two parameters are established using in-situ bio-optical datasets. These relationships use the spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) ratio at two wavelengths R-rs(670)/R-rs(490), which avoids the known atmospheric correction problems and is sensitive to CDOM absorption and chlorophyll in coastal/ocean waters. This ratio has tight relationships with a(g)(412) and a(g)(443) yielding correlation coefficients between 0.77 and 0.78. The new model, with the above parameterization applied to independent datasets (NOMAD SeaWiFS match-ups and Carder datasets), shows good retrievals of the a(g)(lambda) with regression slopes close to unity, little bias and low mean relative and root mean square errors. These statistical estimates improve significantly over other inversion models (e.g., Linear Matrix-LM and Garver-Siegel-Maritorena-GSM semi-analytical models) when applied to the same datasets. These results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed model in both coastal and open ocean waters, which has the potential to improve our knowledge of the biogeochemical cycles and processes in these domains.

Geomorphological models of these intertidal flats and estuaries require site-specific bio-physicochemical sediment parameters as input. Hyperspectral remote sensing can be used as a tool providing synoptic maps of these properties. However, the interpretation of hyperspectral remotely sensed images over mudflats is only possible if the appropriate bio-geophysical or empirical models for information extraction are available. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to model the effects of varying sediment properties on the reflectance in laboratory conditions. The methodology consisted of (i) hyperspectral measurements of sediment mixtures with varying physical and biological characteristics in laboratory conditions, (ii) determination and quantification of specific absorption features and (iii) regression between the absorption features and physical parameters. In laboratory conditions, quantification of clay in dry sediment, moisture in unsaturated sediment and chlorophyll a in sediment mixtures was achieved with coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.98, 0.90 and of 0.96 using the scaled band area of absorption features at 2204, 1450 and 673 nm, respectively. Additionally, the water absorption at 1190 nm was identified as suitable to predict moisture content in very wet sediment and preliminary results showed the potential of hyperspectral signals to assess the effect of bioturbation on sediment properties. Future work will consider the applicability of this methodology in field situations to relate biophysical sediment parameters to the hyperspectral signal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Forward modeling and remote sensing applications	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Several aspects of spectral broadening and drizzle growth in shallow liquid clouds remain not well understood. Detailed, cloud-scale observations of microphysics and dynamics are essential to guide and evaluate corresponding modeling efforts. Profiling, millimeter-wavelength (cloud) radars can provide such observations. In particular, the first three moments of the recorded cloud radar Doppler spectra, the radar reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity, and spectrum width, are often used to retrieve cloud microphysical and dynamical properties. Such retrievals are subject to errors introduced by the assumptions made in the inversion process. Here, we introduce two additional morphological parameters of the radar Doppler spectrum, the skewness and kurtosis, in an effort to reduce the retrieval uncertainties. A forward model that emulates observed radar Doppler spectra is constructed and used to investigate these relationships. General, analytical relationships that relate the five radar observables to cloud and drizzle microphysical parameters and cloud turbulence are presented. The relationships are valid for cloud-only, cloud mixed with drizzle, and drizzle-only particles in the radar sampling volume and provide a seamless link between observations and cloud microphysics and dynamics. The sensitivity of the five observed parameters to the radar operational parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio and Doppler spectra velocity resolution are presented. The predicted values of the five observed radar parameters agree well with the output of the forward model. The novel use of the skewness of the radar Doppler spectrum as an early qualitative predictor of drizzle onset in clouds is introduced. It is found that skewness is a parameter very sensitive to early drizzle generation. In addition, the significance of the five parameters of the cloud radar Doppler spectrum for constraining drizzle microphysical retrievals is discussed.																	2169-897X					JUL 2	2011	116								D13201	10.1029/2010JD015237								WOS:000292380900003

In such cases, neural network (NN) techniques have a long history in inverting complex nonlinear systems. The process we adopt utilizes two NNs in parallel. The first NN is used to relate the remote sensing reflectance at available MODIS-visible wavelengths (except the 678 nm fluorescence channel) to the absorption and backscatter coefficients at 442 nm (peak of chlorophyll absorption). The second NN separates algal and nonalgal absorption components, outputting the ratio of algal-to-nonalgal absorption. The resulting synthetically trained algorithm is tested using both the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data Set (NOMAD), as well as our own field datasets from the Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound, New York. Very good agreement is obtained, with R-2 values of 93.75%, 90.67%, and 86.43% for the total, algal, and nonalgal absorption, respectively, for the NOMAD. For our field data, which cover absorbing waters up to about 6 m(-1), R-2 is 91.87% for the total measured absorption.

To evaluate the importance of atmospheric deposition, we estimate marine nitrogen and carbon fixation from present-day simulations of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron. These are compared with observed rates of marine nitrogen and carbon fixation. We find that Fe deposition is more important than P deposition in supporting N fixation. Estimated rates of atmospherically supported carbon fixation are considerably lower than rates of marine carbon fixation derived from remote sensing, indicating the subsidiary role atmospheric deposition plays in total C uptake by the oceans. Nonetheless, in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll areas, the contribution of atmospheric deposition of Fe to the surface ocean could account for about 50% of C fixation. In marine areas typically thought to be N limited, potential C fixation supported by atmospheric deposition of N is only similar to 1%-2% of observed rates. Although these systems are N-limited, the amount of N supplied from below appears to be much larger than that deposited from above. Atmospheric deposition of Fe has the potential to augment atmospherically supported rates of C fixation in N-limited areas. In these areas, atmospheric Fe relieves the Fe limitation of diazotrophic organisms, thus contributing to the rate of N fixation.

J	Winterfeldt, J; Geyer, B; Weisse, R				Winterfeldt, Joerg; Geyer, Beate; Weisse, Ralf			Using QuikSCAT in the added value assessment of dynamically downscaled wind speed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY					3rd JCOMM Workshop on Advances in Marine Climatology (CLIMAR-III)	MAY, 2008	Gdynia, POLAND					Hindcasts with reanalysis-driven regional climate models (RCMs) are a common tool to assess weather statistics (i.e. climate) and recent changes and trends. A remote sensing-based method to investigate the added value of surface marine RCM wind speed is introduced. The capability of the dynamical downscaling approach (with spectral nudging applied) to add value to the reanalysis wind speed forcing is assessed by the comparison with QuikSCAT Level 2B 12.5 km (L2B12) swath data in European waters for 2000-2007. Co-location criteria are within 0.1 degrees and 0.06 degrees in longitudinal and latitudinal distance from RCM grid points and within 10 min. In the wind speed range, QuikSCAT L2B12 is reliably reproducing (3-20 m s(-1)), dynamically downscaled wind speed does not show an added value in 'open ocean' areas. However, in coastal areas with complex topography, the regional models show an added value, especially around Iceland and the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Irish Seas, validating the findings of previous in situ data-based studies on the added value. Strong interseasonal differences exist, in winter enhanced cyclonic and meso-cyclonic activity increases the potential of dynamical downscaling. In winter time, the added value is more pronounced around Iceland and Greenland, south of Iceland and within the Gulf of Lyon/Mistral region. Summarizing the presented method can be easily applied for other ocean areas, making QuikSCAT a valuable tool to identify marine regions where dynamical downscaling adds value to surface marine wind speed. A detailed comparison of 10 m winds from the National Centres of Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the newer NCEP/DOE-II reanalyses is presented in the annex, motivating the use of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis in the added value assessment.

By means of the sea ice proxy IP25 and phytoplankton derived biomarkers (e.g. brassicasterol and dinosterol) we reconstruct sea ice and sea surface conditions, respectively. The combination of IP25 with a phytoplankton marker (in terms of a phytoplankton marker-IP25 index; PIP25) proves highly valuable to properly interpret the sea ice proxy signal as an under- or overestimation of sea ice coverage can be circumvented. A comparison of this biomarker-based assessment of the sea ice distribution in the study area with (1) modern remote sensing data and (2) numerical modelling results reveal a good agreement between organic geochemical, satellite and modelling observations. The reasonable simulation of modern sea ice conditions by means of a regional ocean-sea ice model demonstrates the feasibility to effectively integrate the complex atmospheric and oceanic circulation features as they prevail in the study area. The good correlation between modelled sea ice parameters and the biomarker-based estimate of sea ice coverage substantiates that linking proxy and model data occurs to be a promising concept in terms of a cross-evaluation. This combinatory approach may provide a first step towards quantitative sea ice reconstructions by means of IP25. Future IP25 studies on marine surface sediments from the Arctic realm, however, are recommended to extend and validate this new attempt of using IP25 in combination with a phytoplankton marker as a quantitative measure for sea ice reconstructions.

Two-component modeling of the optical properties of a diatom bloom in the Southern Ocean	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Diatom cells have distinctive optical characteristics, originating from their relatively large cell size, fucoxanthin content and silica cell wall. It has been proposed that diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms can be identified by optical remote sensing and that specifically tuned chlorophyll and primary production algorithms should be applied in regions where these blooms are present. However there have been few studies on how the optical properties of diatom blooms change as they progress from active growth to senescence, and it is unlikely that measurements on laboratory cultures encompass the full range of physiological states found in natural waters. We have therefore examined the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the waters around the island of South Georgia at the end of the spring diatom bloom. Considerable variability was found in the relationships between the inherent optical properties and analytically determined chlorophyll a concentrations even in the surface layer, which meant that the usual bio-optical assumptions for Case 1 waters did not apply. To account for this variability, phytoplankton absorption and scattering were modeled as a two-component mixture, with the components representing actively growing and senescent material. The specific inherent optical properties of the two components were derived by linear regression of total IOPs against chlorophyll concentration and a fraction of the suspended mineral concentration. These specific IOPs were used to develop radiative transfer models of diatom blooms in varying stages of growth and senescence. Remote sensing reflectances calculated using this technique confirmed the tendency of the standard algorithms employed in SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS data processing to under-estimate near-surface chlorophyll concentrations in diatom blooms. However the inclusion of increasing proportions of senescent material had a significant effect on algorithm performance only at chlorophyll concentrations below 10 mg m(-3). Optical depths predicted by the model around South Georgia were 9+/-2 m at 512 nm, indicating that a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass was located below the depth from which the remote sensing signals originated.

The objective was to provide European countries with practical guidelines for implementing the MSFD, and to produce a Commission Decision that encapsulated key points of the work in a legal framework. This paper presents a review of work carried out by the eutrophication task group, and reports our main findings to the scientific community. On the basis of an operational, management-oriented definition, we discuss the main methodologies that could be used for coastal and marine eutrophication assessment. Emphasis is placed on integrated approaches that account for physico-chemical and biological components, and combine both pelagic and benthic symptoms of eutrophication, in keeping with the holistic nature of the MSFD. We highlight general features that any marine eutrophication model should possess, rather than making specific recommendations. European seas range from highly eutrophic systems such as the Baltic to nutrient-poor environments such as the Aegean Sea. From a physical perspective, marine waters range from high energy environments of the north east Atlantic to the permanent vertical stratification of the Black Sea. This review aimed to encapsulate that variability, recognizing that meaningful guidance should be flexible enough to accommodate the widely differing characteristics of European seas, and that this information is potentially relevant in marine ecosystems worldwide. Given the spatial extent of the MSFD, innovative approaches are required to allow meaningful monitoring and assessment. Consequently, substantial logistic and financial challenges will drive research in areas such as remote sensing of harmful algal blooms, in situ sensor development, and mathematical models. Our review takes into account related legislation, and in particular the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD - 2000/60/EC), which deals with river basins, including estuaries and a narrow coastal strip, in order to examine these issues within the framework of integrated coastal zone management.

A mesocosm tool to optically study phytoplankton dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The accuracy of remote sensing algorithms for phytoplankton biomass and physiology is difficult to test under natural conditions due to rapid changes in physical and biological forcings and the practical inability to manipulate nutrient conditions and phytoplankton composition in the sea. Therefore, an indoor mesocosm was designed to examine the optical properties of phytoplankton under controlled and manipulated conditions of irradiance, temperature, turbulence, and nutrient availability. Equipped with hyperspectral radiometers and bottom irradiance meters, it is shown that under semi-natural environmental conditions biogeochemically relevant species as Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis globosa can be grown with good precision (+/- 20%) between duplicate mesocosms and between duplicate sensors (< 5% deviation). The accuracy of chlorophyll estimates by absorption, using an Integrating Cavity Absorption Meter, and fluorescence using water-leaving radiance was 74% to 80%, respectively, as it was negatively influenced by changes in phytoplankton physiology. Biomass detection was limitedto 1 to 2 mu g chlorophyll/L with an apparent linearity to 50 mu g chlorophyll/L. Estimates of the quantum efficiency of fluorescence (phi approximate to 0.01) were comparable to real-world estimates derived from satellite observations. It is concluded that the mesocosms adequately simulate natural conditions with sufficient accuracy and precision and that they offer an important tool in validating assumptions and hypotheses underlying remote sensing algorithms and models.				van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013; Peperzak, Louis/A-2295-2009	van der Woerd, Hans/0000-0002-8901-7567; Peperzak, Louis/0000-0003-0691-2521												1541-5856					JUN	2011	9						232	244		10.4319/lom.2011.9.232								WOS:000294604600001

A novel Satellite-based Ocean Monitoring System for Mexico	CIENCIAS MARINAS												To analyze patterns in marine productivity, harmful algal blooms, thermal stress in coral reefs, and oceanographic processes, optical and biophysical marine parameters, such as sea surface temperature, and ocean color products, such as chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient, total suspended matter concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence line height, and remote sensing reflectance, are required. In this paper we present a novel automatic Satellite-based Ocean Monitoring System (SATMO) developed to provide, in near real-time, continuous spatial data sets of the above-mentioned variables for marine-coastal ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico, northeastern Pacific Ocean, and western Caribbean Sea, with 1 km spatial resolution. The products are obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images received at the Direct Readout Ground Station (located at CONABIO) after each overpass of the Aqua and Terra satellites. In addition, at the end of each week and month the system provides composite images for several ocean products, as well as weekly and monthly anomaly composites for chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature. These anomaly data are reported for the first time for the study region and represent valuable information for analyzing time series of ocean color data for the study of coastal and marine ecosystems in Mexico, Central America, and the western Caribbean.

The effect of landscape composition and configuration on the spatial distribution of temperate demersal fish	ECOGRAPHY												In contrast to the terrestrial environment, where the use of landscape analyses has been clearly demonstrated, the influence of landscape composition and configuration on the abundance and spatial distribution of marine organisms remains poorly understood. Development of this area of marine research has been limited by the lack of accurate benthic habitat maps, particularly for marine environments deeper than can be penetrated by optical remote sensing (< 10 m). However, the recent availability of detailed (1:25 000) and accurate habitat maps derived from hydroacoustic surveys of deeper marine waters has redressed this situation. The aim of this research was to establish the strength and significance of derived landscape composition and configuration indices on the demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution. A combination of depth and 6 landscape measures were found to explain 34.8% of the variation in the fish assemblage. Depth contributed the highest percentage of the variance explained, accounting for 23.7%. Distance to reef was the most important landscape index explaining 7.1% of the variability, followed by total length of edge environment (the interface between different benthic substrates) explaining 1.5%. Species responsible for driving the structure of the fish assemblage were also examined and found to respond not only to the proximity of reef but also to the configuration of the reef. For example, Parika scaber and Pseudolabrus psittaculus characterised more heterogeneous landscapes offering clusters of small interconnected patches of reef with a lot of edge environment, whilst juvenile Trachyurus novaezelandiae and Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus preferred more homogeneous landscapes offering little reef or edge environment. This research demonstrated that a broad scale landscape analysis, employing indices of landscape composition and configuration, is important for understanding demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution.

J	Yamakita, T; Watanabe, K; Nakaoka, M				Yamakita, Takehisa; Watanabe, Kentaro; Nakaoka, Masahiro			Asynchronous local dynamics contributes to stability of a seagrass bed in Tokyo Bay	ECOGRAPHY												It is known that asynchronous temporal variations in local populations can contribute to the stability of metapopulations. However, studies evaluating the hierarchical organization of multiple spatial scales are rare for continuous marine landscapes, especially for marine vegetation such as seagrass beds. In this study, long-term observation (26 yr) of temporal changes and nested spatial analyses were combined for an extensive seagrass meadow in Tokyo Bay, Japan, using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. We examined how the dynamics at the whole-bed scale (similar to 1 km2) are related to those at a local scale (0.04 km2), and investigated the relationship between the seagrass dynamics and long-term changes in environmental conditions using data on oceanography, water quality, and sediment dynamics. The seagrass bed size fluctuated between a maximum of 1.28 km2 (in 1987) and a minimum of 0.39 km2 (in 2001), with an average of 0.90 km2. The temporal variation in seagrass bed size at the whole-bed scale correlated with sand movement within the seagrass bed related to changes in the position of a sandbar. Seagrass bed size fluctuated asynchronously at a local scale. Multivariate analyses recognized clusters of local areas showing similar patterns of fluctuation. Temporal patterns in the various clusters responded differently to changes in environmental factors, e.g. the position of the sandbar was highly correlated with seagrass bed size in shallow habitats but not in deeper areas. The magnitudes of the temporal variations for the local clusters were greater than that of the entire bed, suggesting that asynchronous fluctuation in different areas of the bed plays an important role in the overall stability of the seagrass bed. The results of the present study also highlight the importance of physical processes in regulating the temporal dynamics of seagrass beds in shallow sedimentary landscapes.																	0906-7590					JUN	2011	34	3					519	528		10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06490.x								WOS:000291228300017

Optical and Microwave Detection of Wave Breaking in the Surf Zone	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Synchronous and colocated optical and microwave signals from waves in the surf zone are presented and analyzed. The field data were collected using a high-resolution video system and a calibrated horizontally polarized marine radar during the decaying phase of a storm. The resulting changes in the received signals from varying environmental conditions were analyzed. The analysis of the optical signal histograms showed functional shapes that were in accordance with the expected imaging mechanisms from the breaking and nonbreaking waves. For the microwave returns, the histogram shape showed a little dependence on the environmental parameters and exhibited an inflexion point at high returned power that is attributed to a change in the scattering mechanism. The high intensity signals were clearly associated with active wave breaking. However, with either sensor, it can be difficult to effectively isolate the wave breaking signature from other sources, such as a remnant foam or the highly steepened nonbreaking waves. A combined method was developed using the joint histograms from both sensors, and it is shown to effectively discriminate between active breaking, remnant foam, and steepened waves. The new separation method allows a further analysis of the microwave scattering from the breaking waves and a better quantification of the length scales of the breaking wave roller and the spatial/temporal distribution of wave breaking and wave dissipation in the surf zone.

Multi-Scale Approach for Predicting Fish Species Distributions across Coral Reef Seascapes	PLOS ONE												Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.																	1932-6203					MAY 26	2011	6	5							e20583	10.1371/journal.pone.0020583								WOS:000291052200079	21637787

However, efforts towards methane plume imaging have yet to provide convincing results for concentrated sources. Although atmospheric CH(4) mapping did not motivate the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) design, recent studies suggest its potential for studying concentrated CH(4) sources such as the Coal Oil Point (COP) seep field (similar to 0.015 Tg CH(4) yr(-1)) offshore Santa Barbara, California. In this study, we developed a band ratio approach on high glint COP AVIRIS data and demonstrate the first successful local-scale remote sensing mapping of natural atmospheric CH(4) plumes. Plume origins closely matched surface and sonar-derived seepage distributions, with plume characteristics consistent with wind advection. Imaging spectrometer data may also be useful for high spatial-resolution characterization of concentrated, globally-significant CH(4) emissions from offshore platforms and cattle feedlots.

J	Roy, S; Sathyendranath, S; Platt, T				Roy, Shovonlal; Sathyendranath, Shubha; Platt, Trevor			Retrieval of phytoplankton size from bio-optical measurements: theory and applications	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE												The absorption coefficient of a substance distributed as discrete particles in suspension is less than that of the same material dissolved uniformly in a medium-a phenomenon commonly referred to as the flattening effect. The decrease in the absorption coefficient owing to flattening effect depends on the concentration of the absorbing pigment inside the particle, the specific absorption coefficient of the pigment within the particle, and on the diameter of the particle, if the particles are assumed to be spherical. For phytoplankton cells in the ocean, with diameters ranging from less than 1 mm to more than 100 mm, the flattening effect is variable, and sometimes pronounced, as has been well documented in the literature. Here, we demonstrate how the in vivo absorption coefficient of phytoplankton cells per unit concentration of its major pigment, chlorophyll a, can be used to determine the average cell size of the phytoplankton population. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to evaluate the errors in the estimated diameter owing to potential errors in the model assumptions. Cell sizes computed for field samples using the model are compared qualitatively with indirect estimates of size classes derived from high performance liquid chromatography data. Also, the results are compared quantitatively against measurements of cell size in laboratory cultures. The method developed is easy-to-apply as an operational tool for in situ observations, and has the potential for application to remote sensing of ocean colour data.

Benthic habitat mapping: A review of progress towards improved understanding of the spatial ecology of the seafloor using acoustic techniques	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This review examines the various strategies and methods used to produce benthic habitat maps using acoustic remote sensing techniques, coupled with in situ sampling. The applications of three acoustic survey techniques are examined in detail: single-beam acoustic ground discrimination systems, sidescan sonar systems, and multi-beam echo sounders. Over the past decade we have witnessed the nascence of the field of benthic habitat mapping and, on the evidence of the literature reviewed in this paper, have seen a rapid evolution in the level of sophistication in our ability to image and thus map seafloor habitats. As acoustic survey tools have become ever more complex, new methods have been tested to segment, classify and combine these data with biological ground truth sample data. Although the specific methods used to derive habitat maps vary considerably, the review indicates that studies can generally be categorized into one of three over-arching strategies; 1) Abiotic surrogate mapping; 2) Assemble first, predict later (unsupervised classification); 3) Predict first, assemble later (supervised classification). Whilst there is still no widely accepted agreement on the best way to produce benthic habitat maps, all three strategies provide valuable map resources to support management objectives. Whilst there is still considerable work to be done before we can answer many of the outstanding technological, methodological, ecological and theoretical questions that have been raised here, the review concludes that the advent of spatial ecological studies founded on high-resolution environmental data sets will undoubtedly help us to examine patterns in community and species distributions. This is a vital first step in unraveling ecological complexities and thus providing improved spatial information for management of marine systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This problem has been defined at the broader strategic level. We evaluate key aspects of environmental security in ice-covered waters, focusing on tactical and operational information needs, which have received less attention. Monitoring of environmental hazards and effective emergency response in sea ice environments require high-resolution data of ice hazard distributions (e.g., multiyear ice, landfast ice breakout, and ice push events), ice movement and deformation, as well as ice characteristics and dynamics relevant to emergency response. We have developed a prototype coastal observing system at Barrow, Alaska, that addresses such information needs. Imagery obtained from a marine X-band radar with a digital controller is combined with data from on-ice sensors (ice thickness, ice and water temperature, sea level) and; assessments of potentially hazardous ice conditions by local experts. Digital imagery and data are processed and disseminated in near-real time. Using a combination of image processing approaches (optical flow, Lucas-Kanade tracker), ice velocity fields, floe trajectories, and boundaries of stationary ice are derived automatically. Early onset of hazardous events is detected through Hidden Markov Modeling, providing potential decision support in operational settings. We evaluate the utility of the system and strategies towards integration with broader emergency response efforts.

Remote sensing of wetlands: case studies comparing practical techniques. Journal of Coastal Research, 27(3), 418-427. West Palm Beach (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. To plan for wetland protection and sensible coastal development, scientists and managers need to monitor the changes in coastal wetlands as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. Advances in sensor design and data analysis techniques are making remote sensing systems practical and attractive for monitoring natural and man-induced wetland changes. The objective of this paper is to review and compare wetland remote sensing techniques that are cost-effective and practical and to illustrate their use through two case studies. The results of the case studies show that analysis of satellite and aircraft imagery, combined with on-the-ground observations, allows researchers to effectively determine long-term trends and short-term changes of wetland vegetation and hydrology.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2011	27	3					418	427		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00174.1								WOS:000290645600002

It produces a dataset package called CORA (China ocean reanalysis). The regional ocean model used is based on the Princeton Ocean Model with a generalized coordinate system (POMgcs). The model is parallelized by NMDIS with the addition of the wave breaking and tidal mixing processes into model parameterizations. Data assimilation is a sequential three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) scheme implemented within a multigrid framework. Observations include satellite remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST), altimetry sea level anomaly (SLA), and temperature/salinity profiles. The reanalysis fields of sea surface height, temperature, salinity, and currents begin with January 1986 and are currently updated every year. Error statistics and error distributions of temperature, salinity and currents are presented as a primary evaluation of the reanalysis fields using sea level data from tidal gauges, temperature profiles, as well as the trajectories of Argo floats. Some case studies offer the opportunity to verify the evolution of certain local circulations. These evaluations show that the reanalysis data produced provide a good representation of the ocean processes and phenomena in the coastal waters of China and adjacent seas.

J	Lu, YC; Tian, QJ; Li, XA				Lu YingCheng; Tian QingJiu; Li Xiang			The remote sensing inversion theory of offshore oil slick thickness based on a two-beam interference model	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												Offshore oil slicks are significant for both the monitoring of marine spill accidents and the detection of marine oil resources. The use of remote sensing technology to detect the thickness of oil slicks is a major area of research. The reflected light from oil slicks changes with the thickness of the oil. This is the theoretical basis of research on optical remote sensing of offshore oil slicks. A two-beam interference model that considers the offshore oil slick as a flat plate has been developed in this study. A quantitative remote sensing model which describes a series of processes that use oil slick thickness and reflectance as variables is established. The use of the Fresnel equation to analyze parameters in the model indicated that the key property of the quantitative relationship between the oil slick thickness and reflectance was ultimately the disappearance or extinction of the oil slick. This model has been tested and verified by data from offshore oil slick spectral response experiments. Results showed that the oil slick thickness remote sensing model can be theoretically analyzed and is efficient. The research indicated that the major cause of variations in the spectral response as a function of oil slick thickness was the different light-scattering characteristics. These characteristics can be used in remote sensing applications to identify the different types of offshore oil slicks. The theoretical interpretation of each parameter in this model led to the development of a look-up table of the model parameters which will improve the efficiency of future offshore oil slick remote sensing.																	1674-7313					MAY	2011	54	5					678	685		10.1007/s11430-010-4154-1								WOS:000289563000006

Spatial characterization of marine recreational boating: Exploring the use of an on-the-water questionnaire for a case study in the Pacific Northwest	MARINE POLICY												Information about spatial patterns of recreational boating is important for managing environmental, safety, and social impacts. However, traditional spatial mapping techniques such as remote sensing are often. unable to project entire vessel routes or to link with other important data such as demographics, activities, or purpose of trip. This study, conducted in a part of Canada's southern Strait of Georgia, uses an on-the-water-questionnaire to map recreational boating distribution/density in a complex, multiple-use marine setting. Goals of this study were to explore an on-the-water questionnaire as a means of capturing boating distribution and density, explore the potential contributions of such information to marine spatial planning, and assess the strengths and limitations of the method. Boaters (n=519) were intercepted while engaged in boating trips and were asked to plot the route of their trip on a map of the region. Information was imported into ArcGIS for analysis and display of vessel distribution and density. The resultant spatial dataset has a number of applications for marine spatial planning and management. Strengths of this method include collection of entire vessel routes, linking spatial data to questionnaire variables, and a high response rate. Limitations include some bias towards sample sites and issues of respondent accuracy, as well as cost and effort. Recommendations for management and research are made. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Optical diversity of thaw ponds in discontinuous permafrost: A model system for water color analysis	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Permafrost thaw ponds result from the irregular melting and erosion of frozen soils, and they are active sites of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere throughout the circumpolar North. In the discontinuous permafrost region of Nunavik, Canada, thaw ponds show pronounced differences in color even among nearby ponds, ranging from white to green, brown and black. To quantify this optical variation and to determine its underlying controlling mechanisms, we studied the apparent and inherent optical properties and limnological characteristics of the ponds. The pond colors were well separated on a color coordinate diagram, with axis values determined from above-water spectral reflectance measurements. Our analyses of optical properties and their empirical relationships with optically active substances showed that the differences in color could entirely be attributed to variations in the concentration of two optically active substances: dissolved organic carbon, which was a major contributor to spectral absorption, and nonalgal suspended particulate matter, which contributed to spectral scattering as well as absorption. The latter component was dominated by small sized particles that had unusually high mass-specific absorption and scattering properties. Analysis of high spatial resolution, multispectral satellite imagery of these ponds showed that these two optically important constituents could be estimated by multivariate modeling. The results indicate that remote sensing surveys will provide valuable synoptic observations of permafrost thaw ponds across the vast subarctic region, and may allow scaling up of local greenhouse gas flux measurements to regional and circumpolar scales.

Spatial characterization of the meltwater field from icebergs in the Weddell Sea	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												We describe the results from a spatial cyberinfrastructure developed to characterize the meltwater field around individual icebergs and integrate the results with regional- and global-scale data. During the course of the cyberinfrastructure development, it became clear that we were also building an integrated sampling planning capability across multidisciplinary teams that provided greater agility in allocating expedition resources resulting in new scientific insights. The cyberinfrastructure-enabled method is a complement to the conventional methods of hydrographic sampling in which the ship provides a static platform on a station-by-station basis. We adapted a sea-floor mapping method to more rapidly characterize the sea surface geophysically and biologically. By jointly analyzing the multisource, continuously sampled biological, chemical, and physical parameters, using Global Positioning System time as the data fusion key, this surface-mapping method enables us to examine the relationship between the meltwater field of the iceberg to the larger-scale marine ecosystem of the Southern Ocean. Through geospatial data fusion, we are able to combine very fine-scale maps of dynamic processes with more synoptic but lower-resolution data from satellite systems. Our results illustrate the importance of spatial cyberinfrastructure in the overall scientific enterprise and identify key interfaces and sources of error that require improved controls for the development of future Earth observing systems as we move into an era of peta- and exascale, data-intensive computing.																	0027-8424					APR 5	2011	108	14					5492	5497		10.1073/pnas.0909306108								WOS:000289265300007	21444769

Remote Sensing of Emissions from In-Use Small Engine Marine Vessels	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This paper reports the first use of a remote sensing device to measure emissions from in-use marine vessels. Emissions from 307 small marine vessels were measured as they passed through the Hiram M. Chittenden locks near Seattle, WA. Of these vessels, 89 were matched to state registration information to allow for further analysis of emissions vs model year, fuel type, and engine type. Emission factors are reported for CO, HC, and NOx in grams of pollutant per kilogram of fuel. The measured emission factors generally agreed with those derived from laboratory studies. HC emissions are disproportionately skewed across the fleet where 40% of the emissions come from just 10% of the fleet. These are most likely due to the remaining two-stroke engines in the fleet. CO and RC emissions show no improvement with newer vessels.

Here, we rationalize the mechanism behind this phenomenon and show that the same process may affect the propagation of light through the upper ocean. Analogous to the shaken test tubes, the ocean can be characterized by intense fluid motion and abundant microorganisms. We demonstrate that the swirl patterns arise when elongated microorganisms align preferentially in the direction of fluid flow and alter light scattering. Using a combination of experiments and mathematical modeling, we find that this phenomenon can be recurrent under typical marine conditions. Moderate shear rates (0.1 s(-1)) can increase optical backscattering of natural microbial assemblages by more than 20%, and even small shear rates (0.001 s(-1)) can increase backscattering from blooms of large phytoplankton by more than 30%. These results imply that fluid flow, currently neglected in models of marine optics, may exert an important control on light propagation, influencing rates of global carbon fixation and how we estimate these rates via remote sensing.

J	Fettweis, MP; Nechad, B				Fettweis, Michael P.; Nechad, Bouchra			Evaluation of in situ and remote sensing sampling methods for SPM concentrations, Belgian continental shelf (southern North Sea)	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Large sets of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration data from in situ and remote sensing (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, MODIS) samplings in the Belgian nearshore area (southern North Sea) are combined in order to evaluate their heterogeneity and the sampling techniques. In situ SPM concentration measurements are from a vessel (tidal cycle) and from a tripod. During the tidal cycle measurements, vertical profiles of SPM concentration have been collected; these profiles have been used as a link between satellite surface and near-bed tripod SPM concentrations. In situ time series at fixed locations using a tripod are excellent witnesses of SPM concentrations under all weather conditions and may catch SPM concentration variability with a much finer scale. The heterogeneity has been statistically assessed by comparing the SPM concentration frequency distributions. Tidal cycle, tripod and MODIS datasets have different distributions and represent a different subpopulation of the whole SPM concentrations population. The differences between the datasets are related to meteorological conditions during the measurements; to near-bed SPM concentration dynamics, which are partially uncoupled from processes higher up in the water column; to the sampling methods or schemes and to measurement uncertainties. In order to explain the differences between the datasets, the tripod data have been subsampled using wave height conditions and satellite and tidal cycle sampling schemes. It was found that satellites and low-frequent tidal cycle measurements are biased towards good weather condition or spring-summer seasons (satellite). The data show that the mean surface SPM concentration derived from satellite data is slightly lower than from in situ tidal cycle measurements, whereas it is significantly lower than the mean SPM concentration interpolated to the water surface from the tripod measurements. This is explained by the errors arising from the interpolation along the vertical profiles, but also by the fact that satellite-measured signal saturates in the visible band used to retrieve SPM concentration in very turbid waters.																	1616-7341	1616-7228				MAR	2011	61	2-3			SI		157	171		10.1007/s10236-010-0310-6								WOS:000289528200002

One of the most promising avenues for the use of satellite data for fisheries science in management lies in quantifying objectively the variables that result in large and small year classes of exploited stocks. The influence of fluctuations in the availability of food in the critical period of larval stages can be investigated through the application of ecological indicators describing the variability of the pelagic ecosystem at a given time and place. These indices can increase our understanding of the relationship between ecosystem factors and the recruitment of key species. Despite the many demonstration applications published to date, little use is being made of satellite data to support fisheries science in management. We discuss some of the obstacles that lie in the way of the operational use of satellite data and suggest actions that could facilitate its broader application.																	1054-3139					MAR	2011	68	4					644	650		10.1093/icesjms/fsq200								WOS:000287495200003

In the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM), global, daily, systematic, high-resolution images obtained from satellites provide a good data source for incorporating habitat considerations into marine fish population dynamics. An overview of the most common SRS datasets available to fishery scientists and state-of-the-art data-processing methods is presented, focusing on recently developed techniques for detecting mesoscale features such as eddies, fronts, filaments, and river plumes of major importance in productivity enhancement and associated fish aggregation. A comprehensive review of remotely sensed data applications in fisheries over the past three decades for investigating the relationships between oceanographic conditions and marine resources is provided, emphasizing how synoptic and information-rich SRS data have become instrumental in ecological analyses at community and ecosystem scales. Finally, SRS data, in conjunction with automated in situ data-acquisition systems, can provide the scientific community with a major source of information for ecosystem modelling, a key tool for implementing an EAFM.

The application of satellite remote sensing for assessing productivity in relation to fisheries yields of the world's large marine ecosystems	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												In 1992, world leaders at the historical UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) recognized that the exploitation of resources in coastal oceans was becoming increasingly unsustainable, resulting in an international effort to assess, recover, and manage goods and services of large marine ecosystems (LMEs). More than $3 billion in support to 110 economically developing nations have been dedicated to operationalizing a five-module approach supporting LME assessment and management practices. An important component of this effort focuses on the effects of climate change on fisheries biomass yields of LMEs, using satellite remote sensing and in situ sampling of key indicators of changing ecological conditions. Warming appears to be reducing primary productivity in the lower latitudes, where stratification of the water column has intensified. Fishery biomass yields in the Subpolar LMEs of the Northeast Atlantic are also increasing as zooplankton levels increase with warming. During the current period of climate warming, it is especially important for space agency programmes in Asia, Europe, and the United States to continue to provide satellite-borne radiometry data to the global networks of LME assessment scientists.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				MAR	2011	68	4					667	676		10.1093/icesjms/fsq177								WOS:000287495200005

General relationships between cell size and biophysical processes (such as sinking, grazing, and primary production) of phytoplankton were included in the model through a bottom-up approach. Time-dependent, mixed-layer depth was used as a forcing variable, and a sequential data-assimilation scheme was implemented to derive model trajectories. From a given time-series, the method produces estimates of size-structured biomass at every observation, so estimates seasonal succession of individual phytoplankton size, derived here from remote sensing for the first time. From these estimates, normalized phytoplankton biomass size spectra over a period of 9 years were calculated for one location in the North Atlantic. Further analysis demonstrated that strong relationships exist between the seasonal trends of the estimated size spectra and the mixed-layer depth, nutrient biomass, and total chlorophyll. The results contain useful information on the time-dependent biomass flux in the pelagic ecosystem.

Analyses of pigment and absorption data revealed that the phytoplankton community was dominated by pico- and nanophytoplankton, particularly at the deep chlorophyll maximum. Based on cluster analysis of remotely sensed data, three dynamic provinces were defined for the region. A 5-year time-series of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration provided information on the annual cycle of these properties. To implement the computation of primary production on a synoptic scale, parameters characterizing the biomass profiles and photosynthesis-irradiance relationships were assigned using four protocols: two regional approaches, a regression with surface chlorophyll, and the nearest-neighbour method (NNM), which has the advantage of assigning parameters on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Monthly images of primary production were computed over an annual cycle using MODIS chlorophyll a concentration. The NNM and the use of dynamic provinces emerged as the methods of choice for parameter assignment. Finally, a new approach from remotely sensed data was developed to estimate production-to-carbon ratios, a key input to Ecopath models. The results contribute to ecotrophic analysis of the Lesser Antilles Pelagic Ecosystem project.																	1054-3139					MAR	2011	68	4					751	765		10.1093/icesjms/fsq182								WOS:000287495200014

Our study area has contrasting hydrographic regimes that include the dynamic southern Benguela upwelling system and the stratified waters of the Agulhas Bank. Cluster analysis is used to identify "typical" Chl a profiles from an archive of profiles recorded in 2002-2008. Bayesian networks were then used to relate characteristic profiles to remotely sensed surface features, sub-regions, seasons, and depths. The proposed method could be used to predict daily Chl a profiles for each pixel of a satellite image to estimate biomass and subsurface light fields, and these combined with a light algorithm to model primary production for the Benguela large marine ecosystem.																	1054-3139					MAR	2011	68	4					792	799		10.1093/icesjms/fsq169								WOS:000287495200018

At each site, in situ rugosity (ISR) was estimated using the "chain and tape" method, and acoustic roughness (E1) was acquired using RoxAnn. The relationships between E1 and ISR, and between both E1 and ISR and the abundance of 17 common species and the presence of 10 uncommon species were tested. E1 was a significant predictor of the topographic complexity (r (2) = 0.66), the abundance of 10 common species of surgeonfishes, pomacentrids, scarids, grunts and serranids and the presence of 4 uncommon species of pomacentrids and snappers. Small differences in E1 (i.e. a dagger 0.05-0.07) reflected in subtle but significant differences in fish abundance (similar to 1 individual 200 m(-2) and 116 g 200 m(-2)) among sites. Although we required the use of IKONOS data to obtain a large number of echoes per site, future studies will be able to utilise RoxAnn data alone to detect spatial patterns in substrate complexity and fish abundance, provided that a minimum of 50 RoxAnn echoes are collected per site.

For this purpose, the information contained in the marine images obtained by a measuring and monitoring marine system is used. The ship detection is done by multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). In the first approach, the MLP processes the information extracted from the images using horizontal or vertical integration modes. However, if a suitable combination of these integration modes is done, better detection performances are achieved. Therefore, the use of an improved integration mode is proposed, which is based on a square shape. These modes are also used in a commonly used detector, the cell averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector, which is taken as reference in our experiments. The comparison of the performances of both detectors shows how the MLP-based detector outperforms the CA-CFAR detector in all the cases under study. This comparison is based on objective (probabilities of false alarm and detection) and subjective estimations of their performances. The MLP-based detector also presents another advantage, particularly when the square integration mode is considered: high-performance robustness against changes in the marine environmental conditions.

Comprehensive maps of marine resources, including those important for local fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, provide a crucial foundation of information for the planning process. Using a combination of field and high spatial resolution satellite data, we use an empirical procedure to create a bathymetric map (RMSE 1.76 m) and object-based image analysis to produce accurate maps of geomorphic and benthic coral reef classes (Kappa values of 0.80 and 0.63; 9 and 33 classes, respectively) covering a large (>260 km(2)) traditional fisheries management area in Fiji. From these maps, we derive per-pixel information on habitat richness, structural complexity, coral cover and the distance from land, and use these variables as input in models to predict fish species richness, diversity and biomass. We show that random forest models outperform five other model types, and that all three fish community variables can be satisfactorily predicted from the high spatial resolution satellite data. We also show geomorphic zone to be the most important predictor on average, with secondary contributions from a range of other variables including benthic class, depth, distance from land, and live coral cover mapped at coarse spatial scales, suggesting that data with lower spatial resolution and lower cost may be sufficient for spatial predictions of the three fish community variables.

Airborne Remote Sensing of a Biological Hot Spot in the Southeastern Bering Sea	REMOTE SENSING												Intense, ephemeral foraging events within localized hot spots represent important trophic transfers to top predators in marine ecosystems, though the spatial extent and temporal overlap of predators and prey are difficult to observe using traditional methods. The southeastern Bering Sea has high marine productivity along the shelf break, especially near marine canyons. At a hot spot located near Bering Canyon, we observed three foraging events over a 12 day period in June 2005. These were located by aerial surveys, quantified by airborne lidar and visual counts, and characterized by ship-based acoustics and net catches. Because of the high density of seabirds, the events could be seen in images from space-based synthetic aperture radar. The events developed at the shelf slope, adjacent to passes between the Aleutian Islands, persisted for 1 to 8 days, then abruptly disappeared. Build-up and break down of the events occurred on 24 hr time scales, and diameters ranged from 10 to 20 km. These events comprised large concentrations of euphausiids, copepods, herring, other small pelagic fishes, humpback whales, Dall's porpoise, short-tailed shearwaters, northern fulmars, and other pelagic seabirds. The lidar and acoustic remote sensing data demonstrated that prey densities inside the events were several times higher than those outside, indicating the importance of including events in forage fish surveys. This implies a need for either very intensive traditional surveys covering large expanses or for adaptive surveys guided by remote sensing. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an Alaskan hot spot was monitored with the combination of airborne and satellite remote sensing.

Allen; Ko, Dong S.; Chen, Jen-Ping			Fertilization potential of volcanic dust in the low-nutrient low-chlorophyll western North Pacific subtropical gyre: Satellite evidence and laboratory study	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												In the western North Pacific subtropical ocean, the Anatahan volcano of the Mariana Islands erupted on 10 May 2003 for the first time in recorded history. Based on nine different types of remote sensing data provided by NASA, laboratory experiment of the Anatahan samples, and a 3-D ocean circulation model developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the postvolcanic ocean biogeochemical response to the Anatahan eruption was explored. It was observed that soon after the eruption, the aerosol optical depth abruptly increased from the pre-eruption loading of similar to 0.1 to similar to 2. In the week following the eruption, a "bloom-like" patch was observed by NASA's Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ocean color sensor. Based on the chlorophyll a, fluorescence line height (FLH), at-sensor total radiance, and normalized water-leaving radiance data obtained by MODIS, the cause of the bloom-like patch was diagnosed. The results suggest that the patch was most likely a mixture of suspended volcanic particles and a phytoplankton bloom. FLH was found to be similar to 9-17 x 10(-3) mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) in the patch and similar to 3-5 x 10-3 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) in the ambient water, indicating that a 2-5-fold increase in biological activity occurred during the week following the eruption. Satellite altimetry indicated that the bloom took place in the presence of downwelling and was not a result of upwelled nutrients in this oligotrophic ocean. Analysis of satellite ocean color spectra of the bloom region found similar spectra as the reference Trichodesmium spectra. Laboratory experiments further substantiate the satellite observations which show elevated concentrations of limiting nutrients provided by the Anatahan samples, and the averaged soluble nitrate, phosphate, and Fe were 42, 3.1, and 2.0 nM, respectively. Though it was not possible to obtain in situ observations of the ocean biogeochemical responses that followed the Anatahan eruption, this study provided evidence based on remote sensing data and laboratory experiment that fertilization of volcanic aerosols occurred following this eruption in one of the most oligotrophic low-nutrient low-chlorophyll ocean deserts on Earth.

TECTONICS												An open problem concerning the Mw 7.4, 1999 Izmit earthquake along the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) system is the apparent conflict between estimates of strike-slip deformation based on field and remote sensing data. This is due to the fact that the main strand of the NAF west of the epicenter lies below the Sea of Marmara. Seismological evidence and models based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry suggest that coseismic and early postseismic displacement accumulated after the earthquake could have reached the western end of the Izmit Gulf and possibly the southern edge of the Cinarcik Basin, tapering off along the northern coast of the Armutlu Peninsula, more than 60 km from the epicenter. This scenario is not confirmed by onshore field observations that point toward a termination of the surface rupture around 30 km to the east. These discrepancies convey high uncertainties in the estimate of the tectonic load produced by the Izmit earthquake on the adjacent fault segment toward Istanbul. We analyzed data from different sources, including high-resolution marine geophysical surveys and two Nautile dives along the fault-controlled canyon that connects Izmit Cinarcik basins. Our observations suggest that the surface rupture of the 1999 Izmit earthquake propagated through the shallow Gulf but did not reach the deep Marmara basins. In fact, along the slope between Cinarcik and the western end of the Izmit Gulf, we do not observe fault-related ruptures affecting the sea-floor but rather a series of active gas seeps and "black patches" that mark the presence of known active faults. Our findings have implications for seismic risk assessment in the highly populated region of Istanbul, both for the estimate of tectonic load transferred to the next fault segments and the location of the next earthquake.

Geomorphological modelling of tropical marine landscapes: Optical remote sensing, patches and spatial statistics	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The relation of structural responses to underlying functional processes at the landscape scale helps develop our understanding of geomorphological phenomena at the coastline. This paper demonstrates how a habitat map derived from remotely sensed imagery was used as the basis for the development of an explanatory model to investigate factors influencing the linearity of alternating carbonate sand and seagrass patches on a reef flat in the Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. In combination with techniques established in landscape ecology for interrogating broad scale processes and spatial statistical procedures that bring geography explicitly into the analysis, an emergent framework for the quantification and investigation of geomorphological processes is illustrated. The combined influence of adjacent spur and groove amplitude and incident wave power accounted for 81% of the variation in sand and seagrass patch linearity across the habitat map. A series of steps in model development are examined, including observation, measurement, experimentation and interpretation. These steps both define and permit an empirical approach to geomorphology and the case study highlights how each can be achieved by adopting an interdisciplinary framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediment samples and high-resolution seismic data are used for ground-truthing. SonarScope (R) software is used to process the data, including signal corrections from sensor bias, specular reflection compensation and speckle noise filtering aiming at attenuating the effects of recording equipment, seafloor topography, and water column. The processing is completed by correlating a quantitative description (the Generic Seafloor Acoustic Backscatter-GSAB model) with the backscatter data. The calibrated Backscattering Strength (BS) is used to provide information on the physical characteristics of the seafloor. The imagery obtained from the BS statistical compensation is used for qualitative interpretation only; it helps characterizing sediment facies variations as well as geological and topographic features such as sediment waves and erosional bedforms, otherwise not recognised with the same level of detail using conventional surveying. The physical BS angular response is a good indicator of the sediment grain size and provides a first-order interpretation of the substrate composition. BS angular response for eight reference areas in the Narrows Basin are selected and parameterised using the GSAB model, and BS angular profiles for gravelly, sandy, and muddy seafloors are used as references for inferring the grain size in the reference areas. We propose to use the calibrated BS at 45 degrees incidence angle (BS45) and the Specular-To-Oblique Contrast (STOC) as main global descriptors of the seafloor type. These two parameters enable global backscatter studies by opposition to compensated imagery whose intensity is not comparable from one zone to the other. The results obtained highlight the interest of BS measurements for seafloor remote sensing in a context of habitat-mapping applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, a variety of bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use satellite data to identify and differentiate between either phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs). In this study, several of these techniques were evaluated against in situ observations to determine their ability to detect dominant phytoplankton size classes (micro-, nano- and picoplankton). The techniques are applied to a 10-year ocean-colour data series from the SeaWiFS satellite sensor and compared with in situ data (6504 samples) from a variety of locations in the global ocean. Results show that spectral-response, ecological and abundance-based approaches can all perform with similar accuracy. Detection of microplankton and picoplankton were generally better than detection of nanoplankton. Abundance-based approaches were shown to provide better spatial retrieval of PSCs. Individual model performance varied according to PSC, input satellite data sources and in situ validation data types. Uncertainty in the comparison procedure and data sources was considered. Improved availability of in situ observations would aid ongoing research in this field. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The optical efficiency of flocs in shelf seas and estuaries	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A correct understanding of the way in which light interacts with suspended particles is essential for quantitative interpretation of satellite visible band imagery of turbid shelf seas and estuaries. In this paper we describe new optical observations at 90 stations in the tidally energetic waters along the south and west coasts of Britain. The cross sectional area of the particles in suspension has been measured with a LISST laser diffraction instrument. Light scattering and absorption coefficients have been determined by applying Kirk's method to radiometric measurements, at 6 wavelengths. Results show that the scattering coefficient increases linearly with particle cross sectional area A per unit volume of water with a slope (scattering efficiency) of 1.96 (standard error 0.08) at 665 nm. Particle absorption coefficients a(P) also increase with particle cross sectional area but at the most turbid stations, particle absorption per unit area (a(P)/A) is observed to increase with the mean size of the particles in suspension. The particles are mostly mineral flocs which become more opaque as they grow larger and the photon path length through them increases. The implication of these results for remote sensing is that reflectance in the red part of the spectrum, which mainly depends on light scattering, is proportional to the cross sectional area of particles in suspension. Reflectance measurements in the green and blue parts of the spectrum, where particle absorption becomes more important, depend on the diameter of the particles as well as their cross sectional area. We show that simultaneous measurements of reflectance in the red and green parts of the spectrum can be used to derive both the area and size of the particles in suspension. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, recent statistical advances mean that such data can be used to test ecological hypotheses and estimate species' distributions. Black-browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys are highly mobile marine predators with a circumpolar breeding and foraging distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Although they remain relatively abundant, increased fisheries bycatch has led to their listing as endangered by conservation bodies. We satellite-tracked 163 breeding Black-browed Albatrosses and eight closely related Campbell Albatrosses T. impavida from nine colonies. We then quantified habitat usage, and modeled population-level spatial distribution at spatiotemporal scales >50 km and 1 month, as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference, and intraspecific competition, using mixed-effects generalized additive models (GAMM). During incubation, birds foraged over a wider area than in the post-brood chick-rearing period, when they are more time constrained. Throughout breeding, the order of habitat preference of Black-browed Albatrosses was for neritic (0-500 m), shelf-break and upper shelf-slope (500 1000 m), and then oceanic (>1000 m) waters. Black-browed Albatrosses also preferred areas with steeper (>3 degrees) bathymetric relief and, in addition, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures (peak preference similar to 16 degrees C). Although this suggests specialization in neritic habitats, incubation-stage Black-browed Albatrosses from South Georgia also foraged extensively in oceanic waters, preferring areas with high eddy kinetic energy (>250 cm(2)/s(2)), especially the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of intense mesoscale turbulence. During chick-rearing, this species had a more southerly distribution, and following the seasonal retreat of sea ice, birds from some populations utilized neritic polar waters. Campbell Albatrosses showed similar bathymetric preferences but also preferred positive sea level anomalies. Black-browed Albatross foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, with birds preferring locations distant from neighboring colonies, presumably in order to reduce competition between parapatric conspecifics. At the global scale, the greatest concentrations of breeding Black-browed Albatrosses are in southern South American neritic, shelf-break, and shelf-slope waters. These regions also hold large fisheries and should therefore be a priority for introduction of bycatch mitigation measures.

J	Dunhill, AM				Dunhill, Alexander M.			Using remote sensing and a geographic information system to quantify rock exposure area in England and Wales: Implications for paleodiversity studies	GEOLOGY												Rock outcrop area and number of sedimentary formations have been widely used as sampling proxies in paleodiversity studies and have often been found to correlate with apparent paleodiversity. However, rock exposure area is a better proxy for the amount of sedimentary rock available for study than the widely used measures of outcrop area (i.e., map area) or number of formations. With the use of remote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS), it is possible to quantify rock exposure area accurately on a regional scale. Rock exposure area does not correlate well with either outcrop area or number of sedimentary formations, and the proportion of rock exposed in different areas can vary considerably with proximity to the coast, bedrock age, lithology, land use, and elevation. Therefore, this suggests that the correlation of paleodiversity and rock volume estimates is best explained by a common-cause hypothesis, rather than a geologic sampling bias hypothesis. GIS methods offer an efficient and accurate method of quantifying regional sedimentary rock exposure and may provide a helpful approach to assessing rock record bias on patterns in the fossil record.																	0091-7613					FEB	2011	39	2					111	114		10.1130/G31503.1								WOS:000286505300004						
J	Bagheri, S				Bagheri, Sima			Nearshore Water Quality Estimation Using Atmospherically Corrected AVIRIS Data	REMOTE SENSING												The objective of the research is to characterize the surface spectral reflectance of the nearshore waters using atmospheric correction code-Tafkaa for retrieval of the marine water constituent concentrations from hyperspectral data. The study area is the nearshore waters of New York/New Jersey considered as a valued ecological, economic and recreational resource within the New York metropolitan area. Comparison of the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) measured radiance and in situ reflectance measurement shows the effect of the solar source and atmosphere in the total upwelling spectral radiance measured by AVIRIS. Radiative transfer code, Tafkaa was applied to remove the effects of the atmosphere and to generate accurate reflectance (R(0)) from the AVIRIS radiance for retrieving water quality parameters (i.e., total chlorophyll). Chlorophyll estimation as index of phytoplankton abundance was optimized using AVIRIS band ratio at 675 nm and 702 nm resulting in a coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.98.

The physical and biological composition and distribution of benthic habitats within these ecosystems determines their contribution to ecosystem services and biodiversity as well as their connections to neighbouring terrestrial and marine ecosystem processes. The capacity to accurately and consistently map and monitor these benthic habitats is critical to developing and implementing management applications. This paper presents a method for integrating field survey data and high spatial resolution, multi-spectral satellite image data to map bathymetry and seagrass in shallow coastal waters. Using Quickbird 2 satellite images from 2004 and 2007, acoustic field survey data were used to map bathymetry using a linear and ratio algorithm method; benthic survey field data were used to calibrate and validate classifications of seagrass percentage cover and seagrass species composition; and a change detection analysis of seagrass cover was performed. The bathymetry mapping showed that only the linear algorithm could effectively and accurately predict water depth; overall benthic map accuracies ranged from 57-95%; and the change detection produced a reliable change map and showed a net decrease in seagrass cover levels, but the majority of the study area showed no change in seagrass cover level. This study demonstrates that multiple spatial products (bathymetry, seagrass and change maps) can be produced from single satellite images and a concurrent field survey dataset. Moreover, the products were produced at higher spatial resolution and accuracy levels than previous studies in Moreton Bay. The methods are developed from previous work in the study area and are continuing to be implemented, as well as being developed to be repeatable in similar shallow coastal water environments.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 1336 - 1339. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 Environmental maps showing marine ecosystems are very useful for providing baseline information for coastal management. The cartographic information of this kind of thematic map should explore the real scenario to understand the ecosystems. In this particularly case of Brazil, with continental extension there is a potential for impacts from activities developed near the shoreline, among which as an example are those related to the oil industry. The cartographic documents can be used for environmental analyses and management and should contain relevant information about coastal zones. Two methods are applied for the production of the cartographic documents. The first one used traditional methods of interpretation, manual vectorization, generalization and edition. And the second used a supervised classification technique to obtain information of the pre-selected classes like hydrograph, vegetation, mangrove, main roads, and urban zones. In this regard high resolution images are important for update and get more detail information of an estuary. The materials used for experimental tests were high resolution satellite images with spatial resolution of 0.60m. This contribution makes the assessment of both techniques showing the maps and a list of advantages and disadvantages. The results of the study provide users the option to visualize a classified image that contains more detailed information than the traditional maps and also the results are important in a case of environmental management.

Derived from remote sensing data and validated by three field surveys, it has been compiled in order to understand the past and recent evolution of the area with particular reference to sea-level oscillation studies, for which this map is the basic tool. The very low human impact and rates of dynamic landscape change allow the preservation of extensive palaeo deposits and landforms, including those indicative of sea-level variations. The relative change of sea level dominates landscape evolution, allowing the formation of widespread marine and lagoon deposits often interfingering with fluvial deposits and reworked by aeolian process in the framework of consequent beach progradation.

Due to complexities in water clarity and attenuation of spectral reflection with water depth, this study focused on visual interpretation of IKONOS satellite images in an effort to ascertain the general nature of bottom types. Development of a seafloor topology for a portion of the Key West National Wildlife Refuge in Monroe County, Florida (between Key West, Florida, and the Dry Tortugas) resulted in 96 mapping units. The natural complexity of this environment required classification units that were defined by numeric codes that were keyed to a classification system developed for this area. These units, defined in a stepwise procedure, were predicated on the geomorphologic base, context of the geomorphological zone, biological cover, and percentage of that cover. The GIS attribute table, built with a multi-discipline interpretation in mind, was constructed to allow end user flexibility when extracting the information related to major biological cover, detailed geological cover, etc. Suffixes were added to further interpret areas with diverse biological cover. The IKONOS satellite images were found to be useful tools for mapping coastal marine environments at a nominal scale of 1:6000.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		731	735										WOS:000302824900149

Interpretation of seafloor topologies based on IKONOS satellite imagery of a shallow-marine carbonate platform: Florida Bay to the Florida Reef Tract. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 825 - 830. Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 The shallow low-energy waters of the extensive coastal zone in sub-tropical south Florida permits the discrimination of seabed features and benthic covers acquired from remotely sensed data. A benthic environments classification system is devised from digital interpretations of multi-spectral IKONOS satellite imagery for 1,360 km(2) of the carbonate platform and presented in a comprehensive digitized map. The classification scheme is designed as a 7th order hierarchical structure that integrates 5 Physiographic Realms, 17 Morphodynamic Zones, 11 Geoforms, 38 Landforms, 6 dominant surface sediment types, 9 dominant biological covers and 3 densities of biological covers for the description of benthic environments. Digital analysis of the high-resolution (4 m) IKONOS imagery employed ESRI's ArcMap to manually digitize 412 mapping units at a scale of 1:6,000. Digital classification of environments is executed by the analyst contingent with the grouping of relative spectral reflectance, color tone variations, and the texture and pattern of the benthic unit. The mapping area incorporates a large diversity of geomorphic forms that range from coastal plains in the southern Florida Peninsula to coral reef formations along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). The context of each Morphodynamic Zone is characterized by the content and areal distribution (in km(2)) of geomorphic forms and biological covers. Florida Bay is the most widely distributed Realm and is largely characterized by polygonal lattices of salient sediment banks and sediment flats. Over 58% of the mapping area is occupied by sediment flats, and seagrasses are colonized in almost 80% of the topologies.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		825	830										WOS:000302824900169

Seven geomorphologic units were recognized, these being: recent shore ridges and marine beaches, schist and phyllite highlands, limestone highlands, foot slopes, alluvial fans, young alluvial plains and drainage basins. The data were integrated with topographic maps covering the area by using GIS tools. Contour lines were used to generate a digital terrain model (DTM) of the area. The DTM was processed to generate shaded relief. A Landsat 7 ETM satellite image was draped on the DTM to display the spatial scope of the investigated area. For the purpose of creating a soil map 15 observation points were dug representing the different physiographic units belonging to the study area. Soil mapping units have been identified by integrating physiographic units, field survey observations, morphologic description and laboratory analyses. Seven soil taxonomic units have been recognized, namely: Typic Xeropsamments, Aquic Xeropsamments, Typic Xerofluvents, Aquic Haploxerepts, Typic Xerorthents, Typic Calcixerepts and Fluventic Haploxerepts. Physiographic and soil maps with a scale of 1:25.000 were produced.																	1392-3196						2011	98	1					93	104										WOS:000291072600012

The important role of spatial structure in ecology and management is now commonly recognized, and recent advances in marine remote sensing technology have facilitated the application of spatial pattern metrics to the marine environment. However, it is not yet clear whether concepts, metrics, and statistical techniques developed for terrestrial ecosystems are relevant for marine species and seascapes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we reviewed, synthesized, and evaluated the utility and application of spatial pattern metrics in the marine science literature over the past 30 yr (1980 to 2010). In total, 23 studies characterized seascape structure, of which 17 quantified spatial patterns using a 2-dimensional patch-mosaic model and 5 used a continuously varying 3-dimensional surface model. Most seascape studies followed terrestrial-based studies in their search for ecological patterns and applied or modified existing metrics. Only 1 truly unique metric was found (hydrodynamic aperture applied to Pacific atolls). While there are still relatively few studies using spatial pattern metrics in the marine environment, they have suffered from similar misuse as reported for terrestrial studies, such as the lack of a priori considerations or the problem of collinearity between metrics. Spatial pattern metrics offer great potential for ecological research and environmental management in marine systems, and future studies should focus on (1) the dynamic boundary between the land and sea; (2) quantifying 3-dimensional spatial patterns; and (3) assessing and monitoring seascape change.																	0171-8630						2011	427						219	232		10.3354/meps09119								WOS:000289489800017						
J	Alvarez, A				Alvarez, Alberto			Volumetric Reconstruction of Oceanographic Fields Estimated From Remote Sensing and In Situ Observations From Autonomous Underwater Vehicles of Opportunity	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												A main challenge of military oceanography (MILOC) is to assess the oceanographic conditions of denied/high-risk marine regions. Monitoring technologies are limited to those that can provide access to these regions. Remote sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can support MILOC requirements. Unfortunately, the environmental information gathered by these technologies is not complete: remote sensing provides information about some surface conditions and water-column integrated variables, whereas operational priorities often constrain AUVs use during real crisis situations to missions with higher priority than environmental assessment. Under this scenario, data fusion techniques to maximize the information of the collected data are essential. This paper attempts to reconstruct thermal fields fusing data gathered by remote sensing platforms and AUVs performing missions not specifically designed for environmental data collection. The technique estimates the state that maximizes the posterior probability subjected to some smoothing constraints. A variational methodology allows remote sensing information to serve as boundary constraints. The approach uses 3-D finite elements to solve the maximization problem. The procedure investigated has been tested with different smoothing constraints in a simulated environment and in a real field experiment conducted by the Muscle AUV in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) on April 19, 2008. Results highlight the relevance of incorporating the surface information provided by remote sensors into the estimation.

Unusual diurnal variation in surface ozone observed after the 26 December 2004 tsunami over the rural site of Bay of Bengal, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Measurements of surface ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were studied from December 2004 to February 2005, covering the giant tsunami event on 26 December 2004 at Tranquebar (11 degrees N, 79.9 degrees E, 9 m) over the west coast of the Bay of Bengal, India. An unusual maximum O-3 concentration of 28 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) was observed in the morning and a minimum (16 ppbv) in the evening, indicating that pronounced chemical loss of O-3 occurred in the daytime after the tsunami over this coastal region. An increase in NO2 concentration from 5.6 ppbv before the tsunami to 10.5 ppbv after the tsunami was observed in the daytime. The observed unusual diurnal changes in O-3 were not due to mass transport processes as the five-day back trajectories of air parcels transport before and after the tsunami remained unchanged. Similarly, meteorological and micrometeorological parameters were found to be normal before and after the tsunami. The unusual low O-3 level during the daytime was possibly due to prolonged excess emission of iodocarbons from the sea surface after the tsunami, which resulted in enhanced inorganic iodine (I-x) concentration, leading to massive destruction of O-3. Similarly, unusually high O-3 levels during the night-time were possibly due to the intrusion of ozone-rich air after the tsunami from the free troposphere into the surface layer when the boundary layer height shrinks after midnight. The present work can be extended on a regional scale by incorporating modelling studies using recent remote sensing tools.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2011	32	4					951	971		10.1080/01431160903493806								WOS:000288065100004

Vertical and horizontal habitat preferences of post-nesting leatherback turtles in the South Pacific Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Leatherback turtles are the largest and widest ranging turtle species, and spend much of their time in the offshore pelagic environment. However, the high seas have thus far received little management attention to protect their ecosystems and biodiversity. We tagged 46 female leatherback turtles with satellite transmitters at Playa Grande, Costa Rica from 2004 to 2007. In the present study, we analyzed the vertical and horizontal habitat preferences of these leatherback turtles in the South Pacific Ocean. The turtles exhibited short, shallow dives during their migration southward (mean depth: 45 m; mean duration: 23.6 min), followed by deeper, longer dives (mean depth: 56.7 m; mean duration: 26.4 min) in the South Pacific Gyre that probably indicated searching for prey. We integrated the horizontal movements with remotely sensed oceanographic data to determine the turtles' response to the environment, and applied this information to recommendations for conservation in the pelagic environment. A generalized additive mixed model applied to the daily turtle travel rates confirmed that slower travel rates occurred at cooler sea surface temperatures, higher chlorophyll a concentration and stronger vertical Ekman upwelling, all of which are considered favorable foraging conditions. The southern terminus (35 to 37 degrees S) of the leatherback tracks was also in an area of increased mesoscale activity that might act as a physical mechanism to aggregate their prey, gelatinous zooplankton. However, this could also act as a thermal limit to their distribution. This characterization of leatherback habitat use could aid the development of management efforts within the South Pacific Ocean to reduce mortality of leatherback turtles from fisheries interactions.

Nitrogen uptake and primary productivity rates in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Nutrient concentrations, primary productivity, and nitrogen uptake rates were measured in coastal waters of the Mid-Atlantic Bight over a two-year period that included measurements from all four seasons. In order to assess carbon productivity and nitrogen demand within the context of the physical environment, the region was divided into three distinct hydrographic regimes: the Chesapeake and Delaware Bay outflow plumes (PL), the southern Mid-Atlantic shelf influenced by the Gulf Stream (SS), and the mid-shelf area to the north of the Chesapeake Bay mouth (MS). Annual areal rates of total nitrogen (N) uptake were similar across all regions (10.9 +/- 2.1 mol N m(-2) y(-1)). However, annual areal rates of net primary productivity were higher in the outflow plume region (43 mol C m(-2) y(-1)), than along the Mid-Atlantic shelf and in areas influenced by the Gulf Stream (41 and 34 mol C m(-2) y(-1), respectively). Rates of net primary productivity were not well correlated with Chl a concentrations and were uncoupled with net N uptake rates. Seasonally averaged annual areal rates of net primary productivity for the Mid-Atlantic Bight measured in this study were higher than those calculated in previous decades and provide important validation information for biogeochemical models and satellite remote sensing algorithms developed for the region.

However, applications are hampered by the incompleteness of imagery and by some quality problems. The Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions methodology (DINEOF) allows calculation of missing data in geophysical datasets without requiring a priori knowledge about statistics of the full dataset and has previously been applied to SST reconstructions. This study demonstrates the reconstruction of complete space-time information for 4 years of surface chlorophyll a (CHL), total suspended matter (TSM) and sea surface temperature (SST) over the Southern North Sea (SNS) and English Channel (EC). Optimal reconstructions were obtained when synthesising the original signal into 8 modes for MERIS CHL and into 18 modes for MERIS TSM. Despite the very high proportion of missing data (70%), the variability of original signals explained by the EOF synthesis reached 93.5% for CHL and 97.2% for TSM. For the MODIS TSM dataset, 97.5% of the original variability of the signal was synthesised into 14 modes. The MODIS SST dataset could be synthesised into 13 modes explaining 98% of the input signal variability. Validation of the method is achieved for 3 dates below 2 artificial clouds, by comparing reconstructed data with excluded input information. Complete weekly and monthly averaged climatologies, suitable for use with ecosystem models, were derived from regular daily reconstructions. Error maps associated with every reconstruction were produced according to Beckers et al. (2006). Embedded in this error calculation scheme, a methodology was implemented to produce maps of outliers, allowing identification of unusual or suspicious data points compared to the global dynamics of the dataset Various algorithm artefacts were associated with high values in the outlier maps (undetected cloud edges, haze areas, contrails, and cloud shadows). With the production of outlier maps, the data reconstruction technique becomes also a very efficient tool for quality control of optical remote sensing data and for change detection within large databases.

Global distribution of sea salt aerosols: new constraints from in situ and remote sensing observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We combine in situ measurements of sea salt aerosols (SS) from open ocean cruises and ground-based stations together with aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from MODIS and AERONET, and the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to provide new constraints on SS emissions over the world's oceans. We find that the GEOS-Chem model using the Gong (2003) source function overestimates cruise observations of coarse mode SS mass concentrations by factors of 2-3 at high wind speeds over the cold waters of the Southern, North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Furthermore, the model systematically underestimates SS over the warm tropical waters of the Central Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. This pattern is confirmed by SS measurements from a global network of 15 island and coastal stations. The model discrepancy at high wind speeds (>6 m s(-1)) has a clear dependence on sea surface temperature (SST). We use the cruise observations to derive an empirical SS source function depending on both wind speed and SST. Implementing this new source function in GEOS-Chem results in improved agreement with in situ observations, with a decrease in the model bias from +64% to +33% for the cruises and from +32% to -5% for the ground-based sites. We also show that the wind speed-SST source function significantly improves agreement with MODIS and AERONET AOD, and provides an explanation for the high AOD observed over the tropical oceans. With the wind speed-SST formulation, global SS emissions show a small decrease from 5200 Mg yr(-1) to 4600 Mg yr(-1), while the SS burden decreases from 9.1 to 8.5 mg m(-2). The spatial distribution of SS, however, is greatly affected, with the SS burden increasing by 50% in the tropics and decreasing by 40% at mid- and high-latitudes. Our results imply a stronger than expected halogen source from SS in the tropical marine boundary layer. They also imply stronger radiative forcing of SS in the tropics and a larger response of SS emissions to climate change than previously thought.

Simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties during the MILAGRO field campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Estimation of Direct Climate Forcing (DCF) due to aerosols in cloudy areas has historically been a difficult task, mainly because of a lack of appropriate measurements. Recently, passive remote sensing instruments have been developed that have the potential to retrieve both cloud and aerosol properties using polarimetric, multiple view angle, and multi spectral observations, and therefore determine DCF from aerosols above clouds. One such instrument is the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP), an airborne prototype of a sensor on the NASA Glory satellite, which unfortunately failed to reach orbit during its launch in March of 2011. In the spring of 2006, the RSP was deployed on an aircraft based in Veracruz, Mexico, as part of the Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) field campaign. On 13 March, the RSP over flew an aerosol layer lofted above a low altitude marine stratocumulus cloud close to shore in the Gulf of Mexico. We investigate the feasibility of retrieving aerosol properties over clouds using these data. Our approach is to first determine cloud droplet size distribution using the angular location of the cloud bow and other features in the polarized reflectance. The selected cloud was then used in a multiple scattering radiative transfer model optimization to determine the aerosol optical properties and fine tune the cloud size distribution. In this scene, we were able to retrieve aerosol optical depth, the fine mode aerosol size distribution parameters and the cloud droplet size distribution parameters to a degree of accuracy required for climate modeling. This required assumptions about the aerosol vertical distribution and the optical properties of the coarse aerosol size mode. A sensitivity study was also performed to place this study in the context of future systematic scanning polarimeter observations, which found that the aerosol complex refractive index can also be observed accurately if the aerosol optical depth is larger than roughly 0.8 at a wavelength of (0.555 mu m).

Ground-based retrieval of continental and marine warm cloud microphysics	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												A technique for retrieving warm cloud microphysics using synergistic ground based remote sensing instruments is presented. The SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Cloud) technique utilises a K-a-band Doppler cloud RADAR, a LIDAR (or ceilometer) and a multichannel microwave radiometer. SYRSOC retrieves the main microphysical parameters such as cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), droplets effective radius (r(eff)), cloud liquid water content (LWC), and the departure from adiabatic conditions within the cloud. Two retrievals are presented for continental and marine stratocumulus advected over the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station. Whilst the continental case exhibited high CDCN ((N) over bar = 382 cm(-3); 10th-to-90th percentile [9.4-842.4] cm(-3)) and small mean effective radius ((r(eff)) over bar = 4.3; 10th-to-90th percentile [2.9-6.5] mu m), the marine case showed low CDNC and large mean effective radius ((N) over bar = 25 cm(-3), 10th-to-90th percentile [1.5-69] cm(-3); (r(eff)) over bar = 28.4 mu m, 10th-to-90th percentile [11.2-42.7] mu m) as expected since continental air at this location is typically more polluted than marine air. The mean LWC was comparable for the two cases (continental: 0.19 gm(-3); marine: 0.16 gm(-3)) but the 10th-90th percentile range was wider in marine air (continental: 0.11-0.22 gm(-3); marine: 0.01-0.38 gm(-3)). The calculated algorithm uncertainty for the continental and marine case for each variable was, respectively, sigma(N) = 161.58 cm(-3) and 12.2 cm(-3), sigma(reff) = 0.86 mu m and 5.6 mu m, sigma(LWC) = 0.03 gm(-3) and 0.04 gm(-3). The retrieved CDNC are compared to the cloud condensation nuclei concentrations and the best agreement is achieved for a supersaturation of 0.1% in the continental case and between 0.1 %-0.75% for the marine stratocumulus. The retrieved r(eff) at the top of the clouds are compared to the MODIS satellite r(eff): 7 mu m (MODIS) vs. 6.2 mu m (SYRSOC) and 16.3 mu m (MODIS) vs. 17 mu m (SYRSOC) for continental and marine cases, respectively. The combined analysis of the CDNC and the r(eff), for the marine case shows that the drizzle modifies the droplet size distribution and (r(eff)) over bar especially if compared to r(eff)(MOD). The study of the cloud subadiabaticity and the LWC shows the general sub-adiabatic character of both clouds with more pronounced departure from adiabatic conditions in the continental case than in the marine.

J	Bierman, P; Lewis, M; Ostendorf, B; Tanner, J				Bierman, Paul; Lewis, Megan; Ostendorf, Bertram; Tanner, Jason			A review of methods for analysing spatial and temporal patterns in coastal water quality	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Coastal environments contain some of the marine world's most important ecosystems and represent significant resources for human industry and recreation. Water quality in the coastal environment is extremely important for a number of reasons from the protection of marine organisms and the well being of marine ecosystems to the health of people in the region and the safety of industries such as aquaculture. As a result it is essential that environmental health in coastal environments is monitored. Traditional monitoring methods include assessment of biological indices or direct measurements of water quality, which are based on in situ data collection and hence are often spatially or temporally limited. Remote sensing imagery is increasingly used as a rich source of spatial information, providing more detailed coverage then other methods. But the complexity of information in the imagery requires new analysis techniques that allow us to identify the components and possible causes of spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a review of methods to analyse spatial and temporal variations in remote sensing data of coastal water quality and discusses and compares these methods and the outcomes they achieve. Selected techniques are illustrated by using a sample dataset of MODIS chlorophyll-a imagery. We consider classification methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) that may be used in exploratory, confirmatory and predictive ways, methods that summarize and identify patterns within complex datasets (factor analysis, principal components analysis, self-organizing maps), and techniques that explicitly analyse spatial relationships (the semivariogram and geographically weighted regression). Each technique has a different purpose and addresses different questions. This review identifies how these methods can be utilized to address water quality variability in order to foster a wider application of such techniques for coastal water quality assessment and monitoring.

Using remote sensing and imagery exploitation to monitor the dynamics of East Timbalier Island, LA: 2000-2010	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												In 1999, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Marine Fisheries Service and the State of Louisiana jointly undertook the restoration of East Timbalier, a barrier island along a sediment-starved portion of the Gulf of Mexico coast of Louisiana. High-resolution overhead imagery was used to monitor the course of this restoration effort. This article describes the changes in area and movement of East Timbalier Island and compares these changes with the previous measurements. Between 2000 and 2010, East Timbalier Island lost 52-66% of its area and moved northwards 12-105 m/year. The area of East Timbalier Island is less today than at any time since 1887. Understanding of the physical processes in nature that control the size, shape and movement of the island, as well as the human impacts that have hastened its degradation, is critical for accomplishing any future restoration.																	1010-6049						2011	26	8			SI		613	632		10.1080/10106049.2011.623791								WOS:000208631900003

Macroscale factors affecting diatom abundance: a synergistic use of Continuous Plankton Recorder and satellite remote sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Diatoms exist in almost every aquatic regime; they are responsible for 20% of global carbon fixation and 25% of global primary production, and are regarded as a key food for copepods, which are subsequently consumed by larger predators such as fish and marine mammals. A decreasing abundance and a vulnerability to climatic change in the North Atlantic Ocean have been reported in the literature. In the present work, a data matrix composed of concurrent satellite remote sensing and Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) in situ measurements was collated for the same spatial and temporal coverage in the Northeast Atlantic. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to recognize and learn the complex non-monotonic and non-linear relationships between diatom abundance and spatiotemporal environmental factors. Because of their ability to mimic non-linear systems, ANNs proved far more effective in modelling the diatom distribution in the marine ecosystem. The results of this study reveal that diatoms have a regular seasonal cycle, with their abundance most strongly influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) and light intensity. The models indicate that extreme positive SSTs decrease diatom abundances regardless of other climatic conditions. These results provide information on the ecology of diatoms that may advance our understanding of the potential response of diatoms to climatic change.

The Bay of Biscay is affected by major river discharges, which alter the constituents of the marine waters. Chlorophyll-a algorithms, designed for use at global scales, are less accurate due to the variability of optically active in-water constituents. Hence, regionally parameterized empirical algorithms are necessary. The main objective of the present study was to develop a regional algorithm to retrieve chl-a in surface water using in situ R-rs, for a subsequent application to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite images. To address this objective, a platform was developed initially and a measurement procedure adapted for the field HR4000CG Spectrometer. Subsequently, the procedure was tested during a survey over the south-eastern Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic Ocean), to establish a MERIS chl-a algorithm for the area, by comparing different global remote sensing chl-a algorithms, with band ratios. Results validated with the jackknife resampling procedure show a satisfactory relationship between the R-rs(510)/R-rs(560) and chl-a (R-jac(2) = 0.681). This ratio is better correlated to chl-a than those obtained with established chl-a remote sensing algorithms. High content in coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM > 0.4 m(-1)) and suspended particulate matter (SPM > 2.8 mg l(-1)) influenced this relationship, with yellow substances having a stronger effect.

The measurements were conducted in the upper Gulf of Thailand. The backscattering coefficient of the ISS was calculated using the Lorenz-Mie scattering theory. On the basis of the measurement, the ISS size distribution was parameterized as a function of ISS concentration, and both the spherical and non-spherical particle shape models were evaluated. For ISS concentrations of 10 g m(-3), an estimate of the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration within a factor of 2 on a logarithmic scale is possible in a [chl-a] range of 4-30 mg m(-3). The differential coefficient of remote sensing reflectance was calculated to evaluate its respective sensitivities for chl-a and ISS concentrations. The use of radiometric data at 670 nm (700-900 nm) is valid for in-water algorithms used to estimate chl-a (ISS) concentration in highly turbid coastal waters.																	0143-1161						2011	32	23					8393	8420		10.1080/01431161.2010.542193								WOS:000298374200027

Due to possible inhomogeneities from remotely sensed images, the current work proposes issues concerning ocean wave image analysis using the two-dimensional continuous wavelet transforms (2-D CWTs) to calculate local wave image spectra from inhomogeneous images. To optimize the algorithm of the 2-D CWT for wave image analysis, this work explores ideal parameter values for the wavelet function. The current study also analyses the limits of spatial image resolution and wave image size. After implementing the 2-D CWT on satellite and X-band radar images, this study presents local image spectra and ocean wave information from all the ocean images. These local image spectra reveal the phenomenon of wave refraction and wave nonlinearity nearshore. Compared to real wave spectra, the wavelet spectra present accurate results to describe local wave features in the spatial frequency domain.																	0143-1161						2011	32	23					8779	8798		10.1080/01431161.2010.534511								WOS:000298374200048						
J	Ohde, T; Mohrholz, V				Ohde, Thomas; Mohrholz, Volker			Interannual variability of sulphur plumes off the Namibian coast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Coastal sulphur plumes in the upper water layer are frequently observed off the Namibian coast. However, their temporal and spatial development, strength, size and impact on marine life differ at a wide range. This study compares the events of years 2007/2008 to the years 2004/2005 along the Namibian coast, including regional features on the basis of remote sensing satellite data, in situ measurements of a mooring and local observations. The remotely sensed derived intensity of coastal sulphur plumes of year 2008 was very weak compared to 2004 and especially to 2005, the year with the highest activity during the study period. In 2008, the overall maximum of sulphur plumes was observed in February, about 2 months earlier than in 2004 and 2005 when highest intensity was detected in April. Locally, differences in timing and strength of sulphur plumes occurred in the area of the Walvis Bay. There, the maximum intensity was observed in March 2004 and in April 2005, but in 2008 no clear maximum was found. The remotely sensed identified coastal sulphur plumes correlate with periods of low oxygen concentrations in bottom water and high fraction of South Atlantic central water (SACW) at a mooring 20 nautical miles off the central Namibian coast. An exception is the area in the vicinity of the Walvis Bay lagoon that seems to be driven by different local dynamics. The total variability of the sulphur plumes could not be explained by the observed oceanographic conditions alone. Additionally, microbiological and chemical processes in the sediment and the bottom water layer should be included in future investigations related to annual and interannual variability. Disastrous local events were observed in the year 2008 although the averaged intensity was low compared to the years 2004/2005. Therefore, the remotely sensed derived averaged intensity gives probably no real impression of the local impact of sulphur plumes on marine life. A combination of all available methods like the detection by local observations, in situ measurements and remote sensing approaches is required.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Remote Sensing Techniques for Studying Coastal Ecosystems: An Overview	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Advances in sensor design and data analysis techniques are making remote sensing systems practical and attractive for use in research and management of coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, estuaries, and coral reefs. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers are available for mapping coastal land cover, concentrations of organic/inorganic suspended particles, and dissolved substances in coastal waters. Thermal infrared scanners can map sea surface temperatures accurately and chart coastal currents, while microwave radiometers can measure ocean salinity, soil moisture, and other hydrologic parameters. Radar imagers, scatterometers, and altimeters provide information on ocean waves, ocean winds, sea surface height, and coastal currents, which strongly influence coastal ecosystems. Using airborne light detecting and ranging systems, one can produce bathymetric maps, even in moderately turbid coastal waters. Since coastal ecosystems have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they frequently have to be observed from both satellite and aircraft in order to obtain the required spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. A reliable field data collection approach using ships, buoys, and field instruments with a valid sampling scheme is required to calibrate and validate the remotely sensed information. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of practical remote sensing techniques that can be used in studies of coastal ecosystems.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2011	27	1					2	17		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00103.1								WOS:000286952900001

Antarctic ice-shelf thickness from satellite radar altimetry	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Ice-shelf thickness is an important boundary condition for ice-sheet and sub-ice-shelf cavity modelling. It is required near the grounding line to calculate the ice flux used to determine ice-sheet mass balance by comparison with the upstream accumulation. In this mass budget approach, the accuracy of the ice thickness is one of the limiting factors in the calculation. We present a satellite retrieval of the ice thickness for all Antarctic ice shelves using satellite radar altimeter data from the geodetic phases of the European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS-1) during 1994-95 supplemented by ICESat data for regions south of the ERS-1 latitudinal limit. Surface elevations derived from these instruments are interpolated on to regular grids using kriging, and converted to ice thicknesses using a modelled firn-density correction. The availability of a new spatial variable firn-density correction significantly reduces the error in ice thickness as this was previously the dominant error source. Comparison to airborne data shows good agreement, particularly when compared to SOAR CASERTZ data on the largest ice shelves. Biases range from -13.0 m for areas where the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium breaks down, to 53.4m in regions where marine ice may be present.

Mobilization and transport of coarse woody debris to the oceans triggered by an extreme tropical storm	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A significant consequence of Typhoon Morakot in August 2009 was the production of vast volumes of driftwood in Pacific Asia. We have quantified the flux of this coarse woody debris (CWD) to the oceans from typhoon-triggered landslides in Taiwan, where Morakot made landfall, by combining remote sensing (using FORMOSAT-2 imagery and aerial photography), analysis of forest biomass, and field observations. A total of 3.8-8.4 Tg CWD was transported to the oceans, carrying 1.8-4.0 Tg of organic carbon. In addition to the local effects on the marine and coastal environment from such a highly concentrated flux of carbon and nutrients, storm-driven mobilization of CWD may represent a significant, if infrequent, transfer of terrestrial biomass to the oceans. If the frequency of relatively rare, extreme storms such as Morakot increases in a changing climate, this transport mechanism may play an important role in feedbacks between global climate, storm intensity, and carbon cycling.

This area is an essential habitat for ABFT reproduction and growth. We present here an approach for deriving the daily mapping of potential ABFT feeding and spawning habitats based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chl a concentration. The feeding habitat was mainly derived from the simultaneous occurrence of oceanic fronts of temperature and chl a content while the spawning habitat was mostly inferred from the heating of surface waters. Generally, higher chl a contents were found to be preferred for the feeding habitat and a minimum SST value was found for the spawning habitat. Both habitats were defined by the presence of relevant oceanographic features and are therefore potential and functionally-linked habitats. This approach provides, for the first time, a synoptic view of the potential ABFT habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. The model performs well in areas where both satellite data and ABFT observations are available, as 80% of presence data are in the vicinity of potential habitats. The computed monthly, seasonal and annual maps of potential feeding and spawning habitat of ABFT from 2003 to 2009 are in good agreement with current knowledge on ABFT. Overall, the habitat size of ABFT is about 6% of the Mediterranean Sea surface. The results displayed a strong seasonality in habitat size and locations as well as high year-to-year variations (30 to 60%), particularly for the potential spawning habitat, which is key information for evaluating the utility of ABFT Marine Protected Areas in the Mediterranean Sea.

As an important branch of remote sensing, satellite based synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR) is the most effective way to accomplish these tasks. Since a marine surface with oil spill seems as a dark object because of much lower backscattered energy, the main problem is to recognize and differentiate the dark objects of oil spills from others to be formed by oceanographic and atmospheric conditions. In this study, Radarsat-1 images covering Lebanese coasts were employed for oil spill detection. For this purpose, a powerful classifier, Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (ANN MLP) was used. As the original contribution of the paper, the network was trained by a novel heuristic optimization algorithm known as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) method besides the conventional Backpropagation (BP) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) learning algorithms. A comparison and evaluation of different network training algorithms regarding reliability of detection and robustness show that for this problem best result is achieved with the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC).

Remote sensing algorithms and modeling approaches proposed in the literature indicate significant methodological uncertainties, leading to different ice age values and physical interpretations. In this work, we focus on the vertical age distribution in sea ice. Based on the age theory developed for marine modeling, we propose a vertically-variable sea ice age definition which gives a measure of the time elapsed since the accretion of the ice particle under consideration. An analytical solution is derived from Stefan's law for a horizontally homogeneous ice layer with a periodic ice thickness seasonal cycle. Two numerical methods to solve the age equation are proposed. In the first one, the domain is discretized adaptively in space thanks to Lagrangian particles in order to capture the age profile and its discontinuities. The second one focuses on the mean age of the ice using as few degrees of freedom as possible and is based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) spatial discretization and the finite element method. We observe an excellent agreement between the Lagrangian particles and the analytical solution. The mean value and the standard deviation of the finite element solution agree with the analytical solution and a linear approximation is found to represent the age profile the better, the older the ice gets. Both methods are finally applied to a stand-alone thermodynamic sea ice model of the Arctic. Computing the vertically-averaged ice age reduces by a factor of about 2 the simulated ice age compared to the oldest particle of the ice columns. A high correlation is found between the ice thickness and the age of the oldest particle. However, whether or not this will remain valid once ice dynamics is included should be investigated. In addition, the present study, based on thermodynamics only, does not support a single age-thickness functional relationship. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main aim of the five-year SatBaltyk (2010-2014) research project (Satellite Monitoring of the Baltic Sea Environment) is to prepare the technical infrastructure and set in motion operational procedures for the satellite monitoring of the Baltic environment. This system is to characterize on a routine basis the structural and functional properties of this sea on the basis of data supplied by the relevant satellites. The characterization and large-scale dissemination of the following properties of the Baltic is anticipated: the solar radiation influx to the sea's waters in various spectral intervals, energy balances of the short- and long-wave radiation at the Baltic Sea surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere over the Baltic, sea surface temperature distribution, dynamic states of the water surface, concentrations of chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigments in the Baltic water, distributions of algal blooms, the occurrence of upwelling events, and the characteristics of primary organic matter production and photosynthetically released oxygen in the water. It is also intended to develop and, where feasible, to implement satellite techniques for detecting slicks of petroleum derivatives and other compounds, evaluating the state of the sea's ice cover, and forecasting the hazards from current and future storms and providing evidence of their effects in the Baltic coastal zone. The ultimate objective of the project is to implement an operational system for the routine determination and dissemination on the Internet of the above-mentioned features of the Baltic in the form of distribution maps as well as plots, tables and descriptions characterizing the state of the various elements of the Baltic environment. The main sources of input data for this system will be the results of systematic recording by environmental satellites and also special-purpose ones such as TIROS N/NOAA, MSG (currently Meteosat 9), EOS/AQUA and ENVISAT. The final effects of the SatBaltyk project are to be achieved by the end of 2014, i.e. during a period of 60 months. These two papers present the results obtained during the first 15 months of the project. Part 1 of this series of articles contains the assumptions, objectives and a description of the most important stages in the history of our research, which constitute the foundation of the current project. It also discusses the way in which SatBaltyk functions and the scheme of its overall operations system. The second article (Part 2), will discuss some aspects of its practical applicability in the satellite monitoring of the Baltic ecosystem (see Wozniak et al. (2011) in this issue).

Part 2: Practical applicability and preliminary results	OCEANOLOGIA												This paper is the second part of the description of the first stage of the SatBaltyk project's implementation. Part 1 (Wozniak et al. 2011, in this issue) presents the assumptions and objectives of SatBaltyk and describes the most important stages in the history of our research, which is the foundation of this project. It also discusses the operation and general structure of the SatBaltyk system. Part 2 addresses various aspects of the practical applicability of the SatBaltyk Operational System to Baltic ecosystem monitoring. Examples are given of the Baltic's characteristics estimated using the preliminary versions of the algorithms in this Operational System. At the current stage of research, these algorithms apply mainly to the characteristics of the solar energy influx and the distribution of this energy among the various processes taking place in the atmosphere-sea system, and also to the radiation balance of the sea surface, the irradiance conditions for photosynthesis and the condition of plant communities in the water, sea surface temperature distributions and some other marine phenomena correlated with this temperature. Monitoring results obtained with these preliminary algorithms are exemplified in the form of distribution maps of selected abiotic parameters of the Baltic, as well as structural and functional characteristics of this ecosystem governed by these parameters in the Baltic's many basins. The maps cover practically the whole area of the Baltic Sea. Also given are results of preliminary inspections of the accuracy of the magnitudes shown on the maps. In actual fact, the errors of these estimates are relatively small. The further practical application of this set of algorithms (to be gradually made more specific) is therefore entirely justified as the basis of the SatBaltyk system for the effective operational monitoring of the state and functioning of Baltic ecosystems. This article also outlines the plans for extending SatBaltyk to include the recording of the effects and hazards caused by current and expected storm events in the Polish coastal zone.

Marine Geomorphology in the Design of Marine Reserve Networks	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Marine environments, key life-support systems for the earth, are under severe threat. Issues associated with managing these common property resources are complex and interrelated. Networks of marine reserves can be valuable for mitigating threats to marine systems, yet the successful design and implementation of such networks has been limited. Efficient ways to conserve marine environments are urgently needed. This Focus Section of The Professional Geographer explores the development of marine reserve networks based on geomorphology, fish biology, ecological connectivity, and appropriate governance. The articles in this Focus Section offer examples of the following: (1) distinctive reef geomorphology dictating the spawning locations of reef fishes, which in turn serve as critical source sites for the replenishment of distant reefs by means of larval transport; (2) an example of a simplified oceanographic model that predicts larval transport from fish breeding sites to important nursery areas; and (3) a case study of the development of a marine reserve network that illustrates key elements of a successful strategy. In sum, this Focus Section offers case studies that show the value of marine geomorphology, oceanographic connectivity, and stakeholder involvement as key elements of multidisciplinary geographic studies applied to the design of marine reserve networks. Geographers can further contribute to the conservation and management of coastal and marine ecosystems in many ways that involve subdisciplines of remote sensing and geographic information systems, political and economic geography, political ecology, and ethnography.

We explored the importance of different variables to predict habitat suitability for the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos Bechstein), a proposed umbrella species in deciduous forest. Specifically, we tested whether biophysical proxy variables indicating management intensity and the occurrence of natural processes constituted a useful complement to traditional remotely sensed data on tree species composition and forest stand age for modelling the woodpecker's habitat. Presence-absence of the woodpecker during the study period (1986-2006) in southwestern Sweden was explained by the area of edge habitats (forest bordering water or farmland) and wetland forest, and location relative to the historical marine limit. The number of years with occurrence of the woodpecker in a territory was explained by the area of forest bordering water and wetland forest. Among traditional forest variables, the area of deciduous forest had a strong positive effect on both woodpecker presence-absence and the number of years with occurrence. The results support the hypothesis that edge habitats and forest types subject to natural processes favouring deciduous trees and dead wood creation are valuable to the woodpecker and should be prioritised in conservation planning.

According to our data, the Comoro islands are inhabited by two amphibian species and at least 28 species of reptiles although ongoing genetic studies and unconfirmed historical records suggest an even higher species diversity. 14 of the 28 currently recognized species of terrestrial reptiles (50%) and the two amphibians are endemic to a single island or to the Comoro archipelago. The majority of species are most abundant at low elevation. However, a few endemic species, like the gekkonid lizards Paroedura sanctijohannis and Phelsuma nigristriata, are more common in or even confined to higher altitudes. We created habitat maps from remotely sensed data in combination with detailed species distribution maps produced using comprehensive data from field surveys between 2000 and 2010, literature, and historical locality records based on specimens in zoological collections. Using these data, we assessed the conservation status of the endemic terrestrial reptiles and amphibians according to the IUCN Red List criteria. Our results show that although little area of natural forest remains on the Comoros, many species are abundant in degraded forest or plantations. Competition and predation by invasive species appears to be the most important threat factor for the endemic herpetofauna, together with habitat degradation and destruction, which further favours invasive species. We propose the status Endangered for three species, Vulnerable for one species, Near Threatened for six species, Least Concern for four and Data Deficient for two species. The endemic subspecies Oplurus cuvieri comorensis is proposed for the status Critically Endangered. Based on the results of this study, seven areas of importance for reptile and amphibian conservation on the Comoros are identified. This study shows how remote sensing data can contribute to increasing accuracy and objectiveness of conservation assessments.																	1313-2989	1313-2970					2011		144					21	79		10.3897/zookeys.144.1648								WOS:000299592100002	22207785

Recurrent frontal slicks of a coastal ocean upwelling shadow	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Marine ecosystems are greatly influenced by the structure and dynamics of fronts. In coastal upwelling systems, frontogenesis occurs frequently by upwelling and transport of cold water and warming in sheltered "upwelling shadow" retention sites. Monterey Bay, in the California Current upwelling system, hosts a dynamic upwelling shadow environment. Using a decade of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations with ancillary remote sensing and in situ data, we describe recurrent surface slicks that develop along the seaward periphery of the Monterey Bay upwelling shadow, and we examine their relationships with fronts. Slick median dimensions, 17.5 km long and 0.8 km wide, describe their elongated structure. Although the typical pattern is a single slick, multiple slicks may concurrently develop in association with different types of fronts. Repeated volume surveys through a front, underlying a slick, revealed lateral mixing and interleaving of regional water types. Velocity fields from coastal HF radar show that slicks may coincide with a variety of surface circulation patterns, that they may extend contiguously across regions having very different surface velocity, and that they may be separated from the shear front of upwelling filaments by 5-10 km. Slicks occur in all seasons and may coincide with both upwelling and downwelling wind forcing. Surfactant accumulation in small-scale convergence zones is indicated as the primary mechanism of slick formation, not ocean current shear or small-scale air-sea coupling. The results of this study emphasize the role of upwelling system fronts in creating small-scale structure and dynamics that influence plankton ecology.

We use repeat-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques to investigate the form and flow of the FIIC. European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1 and ERS-2) data acquired in winter 1996 were used to form a 100 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM), which we constrained using Ice Cloud and Elevation satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter elevation measurements from 2007. This InSAR DEM was used to isolate the phase due to motion from seven ERS-tandem (1 day) pairs of SAR scenes acquired between 15 August 1995 and 7 February 1996, to produce one wintertime and two summertime velocity maps. Five of the eight major outlet glaciers draining the FIIC are marine terminating, and two terminate at a lake margin. A maximum ice velocity of 581 m yr(-1) was observed in mid-August 1995. Six of the eight major outlet glaciers exhibit seasonal velocity variations between late summer and winter, and flow speeds vary by up to 20% over a 10 day period in August 1995. Our findings show that while marine terminating glaciers flow faster than land terminating glaciers, there is no simple relationship between glacier type and seasonality of ice motion.

It features a nested large-eddy simulation in a hindcasting mode that allows a direct comparison between simulations and observations. Using this approach, we simulated two stratocumulus cases observed at the southern Great Plains observing site. The simulation-observation comparisons demonstrate that the multiple nested WRF well reproduces the cloud properties and vertical velocity fields detected by cloud radar and other remote sensing instruments. The simulations show that (1) the cloud fields can be strongly modulated by mesoscale organizations; (2) the vertical velocity variance and skewness in the boundary layer have well-defined diurnal variations and are strongly dependent on external forcings, but the in-cloud turbulent statistics appears to be more controlled by the internal turbulent processes; (3) the organized structures of stratocumulus are only slightly skewed, which is consistent with the cloud radar observations that the updraft fraction is close to 50%; and (4) the vertical distribution of cloud water and the associated high-order moments of continental stratocumulus can be substantially different from its marine counterpart due to different ambient thermodynamic structures. This study suggests that the multiple-scale WRF modeling system provides a great numerical framework that can be used to address various issues regarding the parameterization of boundary layer clouds.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 3	2010	115								D23201	10.1029/2010JD014400								WOS:000285017100010

Optical characterizations and pursuit of optical closure for the western basin of Lake Erie through in situ measurements	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In situ measurements of inherent (IOPs) and apparent optical properties (AOPs), along with laboratory measurements of optically active constituents, were made at sites (n=14) in western Lake Erie following a wind event to advance the characterization of the underwater and emergent light fields of these waters and to support related IOP-based model development and testing. Modern instrumentation was used to make spectral (wavelength, lambda) measurements of the IOPs of absorption [a(lambda)], particulate scattering [b(p)(lambda)], and particulate backscattering [b(bp)(lambda)] coefficients, and the AOPs of remote sensing reflectance [R(rs)(lambda)], and the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance [K(d)(lambda)]. Optical closure analyses were conducted to demonstrate the credibility of the measurements, by comparing AOP observations to predictions based on radiative transfer expressions that utilized IOP measurements as inputs. Substantial spectral variations in a and its contributing components, and more modest wavelength dependencies for b(p) and b(bp), were documented that are consistent with observations reported for marine case 2 systems. The backscattering ratio, b(bp):b(p), was strongly positively related to the contribution of minerogenic particles to the overall concentration of suspended particulate material. Major spatial differences in both IOPs and AOPs were observed that were driven by the attendant differences in the concentrations and composition of the optically active constituents, but particularly minerogenic particles, mediated in part by sediment resuspension. Good optical closure between the independently measured IOPs and AOPs was achieved. Direct measurement of b(bp)(lambda) was found to be critical to pursue closure for R(rs)(lambda) and thereby support related remote sensing initiatives.

Stochastic modeling of particle movement with application to marine biology and oceanography	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE												We consider some stochastic models that have been proposed for the trajectories of moving objects, including Brownian motion. This leads to the development of a general approach for dealing with paths including the use of functional stochastic differential equations. We then present an empirical example based on the surface drifting movements of a small satellite-linked radio transmitter tag after it detached from a whale shark in the western Indian Ocean. The daily estimates of the tag's locations were determined from transmissions received at irregular times by polar-orbiting satellites of the Argos Data Collection and Location Service system. An aspect of the empirical analysis is a study of how well the sea surface currents that are derived from remote sensing and sea surface models compare to the movements of the drifting tag. A second is to develop a predictive model using the past tag locations, the currents and the winds. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Satellite ocean color radiometry (OCR) provides a unique perspective for studying the processes regulating marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry at scales difficult to study with ships and moorings. Satellite OCR is especially useful when supported by other in situ and space observations. In this review, we highlight three areas related to marine ecosystems and biogeochemical processes to which satellite observations have made important and unique contributions understanding the responses of ocean ecosystems to physical processes operating at meso- to global scales, coupled physical-ecosystem-biogeochemical modeling and marine living resource management.

This area of little relief, situated in the New Siberian Archipelago, connects the geomorphologically well-structured islands of Kotel'ny and Fadeevsky. A buried thermokarst landscape was found in the northwest region of the Bunge Land low terrace sand plain, whereas the Bunge Land high terrace seems to be an exposed residue of a similar late Quaternary thermokarst landscape. That is confirmed especially by radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometry and optically stimulated luminescence age determinations, and by pollen analyses. Palaeogeographically, the late Pleistocene periglacial landscape and sedimentation of Bunge Land was closely connected to Kotel'ny and Fadeevslcy; only later on seismotectonical block movements resulted in reshaping parts of Bunge Land. The Bunge Land low terrace area first subsided and the original landscape there was destroyed by marine inundation, followed by marine sedimentation. Subsequent block heave of the low terrace region exposed a vast sheet of marine sands which is continuously surficially reworked by aeolian processes, while the original alluvial plain landscape in the high terrace area was preserved and started degrading only by early Holocene thermokarst development. The studied exposures contain one of the northernmost (74.88 degrees N) environmental records for the late Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the Eurasian Arctic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial coherence between remotely sensed ocean color data and vertical distribution of lidar backscattering in coastal stratified waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Detection of sub-surface optical layers in marine waters has important applications in fisheries management, climate modeling, and decision-based systems related to military operations. Concurrent changes in the magnitude and spatial variability of remote sensing reflectance (R(rs)) ratios and submerged scattering layers were investigated in coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska during summer of 2002 based on high resolution and simultaneous passive (MicroSAS) and active (Fish Lidar Oceanic Experimental, FLOE) optical measurements. Principal Component Analysis revealed that the spatial variability of total lidar backscattering signal (5) between 2.1 and 20 m depth was weakly associated with changes in the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of surface waters. Also based on a 250-m footprint, the vertical attenuation of S was inversely related to the IOPs (Spearman Rank Correlation up to -0.43). Low (arithmetic average and standard deviation) and high (skewness and kurtosis) moments of R(rs)(443)/R(rs)(490) and R(rs)(508)/R(rs)(555) ratios were correlated with vertical changes in total lidar backscattering signal (5) at different locations. This suggests the use of sub-pixel ocean color statistics to infer the spatial distribution of sub-surface scattering layers in coastal waters characterized by stratified conditions, well defined S layers (i.e., magnitude of S maximum comparable to near surface values), and relatively high vertically integrated phytoplankton pigments in the euphotic zone (chlorophyll a concentration >150 mg m(-2)).

J.; Hedley, John D.; Sotheran, Ian			Combining optical and acoustic data to enhance the detection of Caribbean forereef habitats	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

J	Song, HJ; Ji, RB; Stock, C; Wang, ZL				Song, Hongjun; Ji, Rubao; Stock, Charles; Wang, Zongling			Phenology of phytoplankton blooms in the Nova Scotian Shelf-Gulf of Maine region: remote sensing and modeling analysis	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Remotely sensed ocean color data and numerical modeling have been used to study the phenology of both spring and fall phytoplankton blooms (FPBs) in the Nova Scotian Shelf (NSS)-Gulf of Maine (GoM) region. The ocean color data reveal a general pattern of westward progression of the spring phytoplankton bloom (SPB), and an eastward progression of the FPB in the NSS-GoM region. The spatial pattern of mean chlorophyll concentration in spring is similar to that in fall, with a lower concentration in the NSS and higher in the GoM. Interannually, there is a weak but significant tendency for years with earlier (delayed) SPBs to be followed by delayed (earlier) FPBs, but the mean chlorophyll concentrations during SPBs are not correlated with those during FPBs. The interannual variability of SPB timing is significantly correlated with sea surface salinity (SSS), but the FPB timing is correlated with both SSS and sea surface temperature. The process-oriented numerical modeling experiments suggest that (i) salinity is the main factor influencing the bloom timing and magnitude in the NSS-GoM region, especially for the timing of SPBs; (ii) compared to buoyancy forcing induced by vertical salinity gradients, the impact of surface heating and surface wind stress on the blooms variability is much weaker; and (iii) the nutrient level controls the bloom magnitude, but only has a minor effect on bloom timing. This study provides a quantitative estimation of relationship between changes in local/remote environmental forcing and phytoplankton phenological shifts, thus improving our understanding on the possible impact of climate change on coastal/shelf ecosystems.

Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS (R)) Supports Marine Operations: A Look from the US Coast Guard	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is primarily a user of ocean observations but is also a provider of observations especially in high-latitude regions. USCG has a long history of making ocean observations for mission activities and in support of other federal agencies. USCG uses the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS (R)) to understand maritime conditions while conducting the Coast Guard's roles of Maritime Safety, Maritime Security, and Maritime Stewardship. IOOS data are critical in planning search and rescue operations, ensuring safe navigation at high latitudes, responding to oil and hazardous spills, providing vessel traffic services, and maintaining maritime domain awareness (MDA). The International Ice Patrol makes and uses ocean observations to estimate drift and deterioration of icebergs. The North American Ice Service products are needed in polar and domestic ice operations. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the USCG are developing a way to disseminate the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System data via the USCG Automatic Identification System. The Coast Guard provides personnel and vessel support for the National Data Buoy Center observational program, a component of the IOOS. Many key oceanographic, biologic, and geologic discoveries in the Arctic and Antarctic have been made from Coast Guard cutters. As oceanographic data acquisition moves from vessel observations to satellite remote sensing and unmanned in situ data acquisition systems, the USCG will continue to support this effort.																	0025-3324					NOV-DEC	2010	44	6					156	165		10.4031/MTSJ.44.6.22								WOS:000286649500020

Evaluation of shortwave infrared atmospheric correction for ocean color remote sensing of Chesapeake Bay	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua platform (MODIS-Aqua) provides a viable data stream for operational water quality monitoring of Chesapeake Bay. Marine geophysical products from MODIS-Aqua depend on the efficacy of the atmospheric correction process, which can be problematic in coastal environments. The operational atmospheric correction algorithm for MODIS-Aqua requires an assumption of negligible near-infrared water-leaving radiance, nL(w)(NIR). This assumption progressively degrades with increasing turbidity and, as such, methods exist to account for non-negligible nL(w)(NIR) within the atmospheric correction process or to use alternate radiometric bands where the assumption is satisfied, such as those positioned within shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum. We evaluated a decade-long time-series of nL(w)(lambda) from MODIS-Aqua in Chesapeake Bay derived using NIR and SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. Low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the SWIR bands of MODIS-Aqua added noise errors to the derived radiances, which produced broad, flat frequency distributions of nL(w)(lambda) relative to those produced using the NIR bands. The SWIR approach produced an increased number of negative nL(w)(lambda) and decreased sample size relative to the NIR approach. Revised vicarious calibration and regional tuning of the scheme to switch between the NIR and SWIR approaches may improve retrievals in Chesapeake Bay, however, poor SNR values for the MODIS-Aqua SWIR bands remain the primary deficiency of the SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach.

The data collected include spectral normalized water-leaving radiance L(wn)(lambda) and concentrations of suspended particulate matter-(SPM) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). A strict spatio-temporal match-up method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of the turbid coastal area, resulting in 13, 48 and 18 match-ups for MERIS L(wn)(lambda), SPM and Chl-a estimates, respectively. For MERIS L(wn)(lambda), the match-ups showed mean absolute percentage differences (APD) of 17%-20% in the 412, 443, 620 and 665 nm bands, whereas L(wn)(lambda) at bands from 490 and 560 nm had better APD of 15-16%. The band ratio of L(wn)(490) to L(wn)(560) of the satellite data was in good agreement with in situ observations with an APD of 4%. MERIS SPM and Chl-a products overestimated the in situ values, with the APD of approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. When match-up criteria were relaxed, the assessment results degraded systematically. Hence, in turbid coastal areas where temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of bio-optical properties may be pronounced as the result of terrestrial influences and local dynamics, the strict spatio-temporal match-up is recommended.

Discriminating between natural and anthropogenic aerosol contributions to optical depth over Afro-Asian region	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS												To accurately assess the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on climate, spatial and temporal distribution of its radiative properties is essential. The first step towards separating the radiative impact of natural aerosol from its anthropogenic counterparts is to gather information on natural aerosols. In this paper, we have used data from multiple satellites to derive the anthropogenic aerosol fraction (AAF) over the Afro-Asian region. The AAF was largest during the pre-monsoon season (May-June) and lowest during winter. We have shown that over desert locations the AAF was unexpectedly large (>0.4) and the regionally (and annually) averaged anthropogenic fraction over the Afro-Asian region was 0.54 +/- 0.12.

Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools: An integrated framework for ecological geoprocessing with ArcGIS, Python, R, MATLAB, and C plus	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												With the arrival of GPS, satellite remote sensing, and personal computers, the last two decades have witnessed rapid advances in the field of spatially-explicit marine ecological modeling. But with this innovation has come complexity. To keep up, ecologists must master multiple specialized software packages, such as ArcGIS for display and manipulation of geospatial data, R for statistical analysis, and MATLAB for matrix processing. This requires a costly investment of time and energy learning computer programming, a high hurdle for many ecologists. To provide easier access to advanced analytic methods, we developed Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET), an extensible collection of powerful, easy-to-use, open-source geoprocessing tools that ecologists can invoke from ArcGIS without resorting to computer programming. Internally, MGET integrates Python, R, MATLAB, and C++, bringing the power of these specialized platforms to tool developers without requiring developers to orchestrate the interoperability between them. In this paper, we describe MGETs software architecture and the tools in the collection. Next, we present an example application: a habitat model for Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) that predicts dolphin presence using a statistical model fitted with oceanographic predictor variables. We conclude by discussing the lessons we learned engineering a highly integrated tool framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The normal faults typically consist of 4-30-km-long dip-slip segments locally organised in more complex fault zones. They separate carbonate and/or metamorphic massifs, in the footwall block, from loose to poorly consolidated alluvial and colluvial materials within the hangingwall. All these faults show clear evidences of recent re-activations and trend parallel to two principal directions: WNW-ESE and NNE-SSW. Based on all available data for both onland and offshore structures (morphological and structural mapping, satellite imagery and airphotographs remote sensing as well as the analysis of seismic profiles and the investigation of marine terraces and Holocene raised notches along the island coasts), for each fault we estimate and constrain some of the principal seismotectonic parameters and particularly the fault kinematics, the cumulative amount of slip and the slip-rate. Following simple assumptions and empirical relationships, maximum expected magnitudes and mean recurrence periods are also suggested. Summing up the contribution to crustal extension provided by the two major fault sets we calculate both arc-normal and arc-parallel long-term strain rates. The occurrence of slightly deeper and more external low-angle thrust planes associated with the incipient continental collision occurring in western Crete is also analysed. Although these contractional structures can generate stronger seismic events (M approximate to 7.5.) they are probably much rarer and thus providing a minor contribution to the overall morphotectonic evolution of the island and the forearc. A comparison of our geologically-based results with those obtained from GPS measurements show a good agreement, therefore suggesting that the present-day crustal deformation is probably active since Middle Quaternary and mainly related to the seismic activity of upper crustal normal faults characterized by frequent shallow (< 20 km) moderate-to-strong seismic events seldom alternating with stronger earthquakes occurring along blind low-angle thrust planes probably ramping from a deeper aseismic detachment (ca. 25 km). This apparently contradicting co-existence of juxtaposed upper tensional and lower compressional tectonic regimes is in agreement with the geodynamics of the region characterised by continental collision with Nubia and the Aegean mantle wedging.

Surface-Wavefield Estimation From Coherent Marine Radars	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												One major impediment to using marine radars for real-time shipboard measurements of evolving ocean wavefields is the uncertainty in the transfer function that relates the radar cross section to sea-surface height. In this letter, a more direct approach is proposed to infer nonlinear sea-surface heights by using radial-velocity measurements from coherent marine radars. The radial velocities are initially integrated along range lines to obtain a scalar potential function. The velocity potential field is then differentiated with respect to time to yield the sea-surface height. Numerical simulations have been conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed scheme to sampling errors and noise. Under idealized conditions, the results demonstrate that the sea-surface elevation can be reliably estimated from the radial-velocity field provided that the antenna-rotation period is much smaller than a characteristic wave period.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				OCT	2010	7	4					631	635		10.1109/LGRS.2010.2043712								WOS:000283446700003						
J	Rankey, EC; Reeder, SL				Rankey, Eugene C.; Reeder, Stacy Lynn			Controls on platform-scale patterns of surface sediments, shallow Holocene platforms, Bahamas	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Isolated carbonate platforms occur throughout geological history, and commonly exhibit considerable spatial variability. To evaluate the controls on the nature of sediment accumulation across the expansive, shallow platform tops, this study systematically compares and contrasts patterns in surface sediments from several shallow (< 10 m) Holocene Bahamian examples. Remote-sensing data, field observations, petrographic characterization and quantitative grain-size analyses reveal the spatial patterns of sediment accumulation on Crooked-Acklins Platform and the Berry Islands Bank. Integration of these data with synoptic observations of waves, tides and currents, along with regional geochemical data, provides a means to explore the factors that influence platform-scale sedimentary patterns. These data illustrate that the platform interiors of both Crooked-Acklins Platform and Berry Islands Bank are blanketed with medium to coarse sand size sediment. Peloids are most common in the interior of Crooked-Acklins Platform, whereas the Berry Islands Bank includes more abundant composite grains. In both areas, very little mud is present, with surface sediments averaging < 2% mud. Comparison of these results with published data from Little Bahama Bank, Great Bahama Bank and Caicos Platform suggest that, contrary to previous interpretations, the presence of open margins and/or brisk winds are not necessary for the occurrence of a platform top with little mud. Although the muddy sediment fraction of the interior can be suspended by elevated wave energy, wind-generated current speeds in protected platform interiors are relatively low. Instead, in parts of the platform interiors, transport and winnowing of fines is enhanced greatly by tidal currents, which carry suspended sediments off the shallow platforms, even if shielded by islands. Beyond physical influences, however, regional geochemical compilations suggest that the Bahamian tides supply highly supersaturated waters rich in dissolved oxygen to these platform interiors. This exchange is interpreted to facilitate favourable conditions for calcium carbonate precipitation in the form of ooids, marine cements and hardened peloids across vast expanses of the platform interiors. Such fundamental controls on Holocene platform-scale sediment dynamics are likely to have influenced carbonate systems through the geological record.

J	Fontana, C; Grenz, C; Pinazo, C				Fontana, Clement; Grenz, Christian; Pinazo, Christel			Sequential assimilation of a year-long time-series of SeaWiFS chlorophyll data into a 3D biogeochemical model on the French Mediterranean coast	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The objective of this paper was to explore the potentialities of sequential statistical estimation methods to assimilate ocean color observations in a primary production model coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic model. The study site was the gulf of Fos-Rhone delta region on the French Mediterranean coast. The high rate of primary production generally observed in this area is mainly due to strong nutrient inputs of the Rhone River. The assimilation method is derived from the singular evolutive extended Kalman filter (SEEK), which uses an error subspace represented by multivariate empirical orthogonal functions (EOF). SeaWiFS chlorophyll data were assimilated by the ecosystem model during a simulation performed under realistic meteorological conditions for the year 2001. An 'adaptive' computing method of the EOF was applied in order to lower the instabilities of the filter. Data assimilation system permitted to reduce the mean absolute error between model and data from 1.51 to 0.77 mg m(-3) thanks to the SEEK filter, showing a substantial 49% gain. Efficiency of the SEEK filter was then investigated considering several areas of interest inside the modelled domain. Finally, impact of the assimilation scheme on non-observed variables was illustrated and discussed. Throughout this experimentation the data assimilation system showed its potential regarding operational systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dissolved inorganic carbon dynamics and air-sea carbon dioxide fluxes during coccolithophore blooms in the northwest European continental margin (northern Bay of Biscay)	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												[1] We report a data set of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) obtained during three cruises in the northern Bay of Biscay carried out in June 2006, May 2007, and May 2008. During these cruises, blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi occurred, as indicated by patches of high reflectance on remote sensing images, phytoplankton pigment signatures, and microscopic examinations. Total alkalinity showed a nonconservative behavior as a function of salinity due to the cumulative effect of net community calcification (NCC) on seawater carbonate chemistry during bloom development. The cumulative effect of NCC and net community production (NCP) on DIC and the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) were evaluated. The decrease of DIC (and increase of pCO(2)) due to NCC was overwhelmingly lower than the decrease of DIC (and decrease of pCO(2)) due to NCP (NCC: NCP << 1). During the cruises, the northern Bay of Biscay acted as a sink of atmospheric CO2 (on average similar to-9.7 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) for the three cruises). The overall effect of NCC in decreasing the CO2 sink during the cruises was low (on average similar to 12% of total air-sea CO2 flux). If this is a general feature in naturally occurring phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic Ocean (where blooms of coccolithophores are the most intense and recurrent), and in the global ocean, then the potential feedback on increasing atmospheric CO2 of the projected decrease of pelagic calcification due to thermodynamic CO2 "production" from calcification is probably minor compared to potential feedbacks related to changes of NCP.

The approach first identifies possible bloom patches in MODIS FAI (floating algae index) 250 m resolution imagery derived from the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at 667, 859, and 1240 nm. Then, spectral analysis examines the unique reflectance characteristics of Trichodesmium at 469, 488, 531, 551, and 555 nm clue to specific optical properties (absorption, backscattering, and fluorescence) of the unusual pigments in Trichodesmium. These spectral characteristics (i.e., high-low-high-low-high reflectance at 469-488-531-551-555 nm, respectively) differentiate Trichodesmium mats unambiguously from other features observed in the FAI imagery, such as Sargassum spp. Tests in other coastal locations show that the approach is robust and applicable to other optically complex waters. Results shown here can help study Trichodesmium bloom dynamics (e.g., initiation and bloom formation) and may also help design future sensors to better detect and quantify Trichodesmium, an important N(2) fixer in the global oceans.

Therefore, we investigated phytoplankton abundance, size structure, and primary productivity from April to June 2007. Significant changes were observed. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations in surface waters fluctuated between 0.37 and 17 mg m(-3). Micro-sized (> 10 mu m) phytoplankton dominated the phytoplankton community when Chl a was > 1 mg m(-3). Depth-integrated daily primary production within the euphotic layer ranged between 328 and 3231 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Higher values of the water-column light utilization index (Psi) for phytoplankton photosynthesis were observed in May and June. Although no significant relationships were found between surface primary productivity and macronutrient concentrations or photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), surface primary productivity correlated significantly with Chl a concentration during April, indicating that algal productivity depended on phytoplankton biomass. Furthermore, significant linear relationships were found throughout the observations of phytoplankton absorption coefficient to surface primary productivity and of that coefficient to the optimum algal photosynthetic rate normalized by Chl a level (P-opt(B)) in the water column. Modeling P-opt(B) with the empirical equations of Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997) or Kameda and lshizaka (2005) did not accurately reproduce in situ P-opt(B). These results suggest that the phytoplankton absorption properties could become useful indicators for estimating primary productivity in the Oyashio region during spring. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Tracking Oil Slicks and Predicting their Trajectories Using Remote Sensors and Models: Case Studies of the Sea Princess and Deepwater Horizon Oil Spills	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Oil spills can harm marine life in the oceans, estuaries, and wetlands. To limit the damage by a spill and facilitate cleanup efforts, emergency managers need information on spill location, size and extent, direction and speed of oil movement, and wind, current, and wave information for predicting oil drift and dispersion. The main operational data requirements are fast turn-around time and frequent imaging to monitor the dynamics of the spill. Remote sensors on satellites and aircraft meet most of these requirements by tracking the spilled oil at various resolutions, over wide areas, and at frequent intervals. They also provide key inputs to drift prediction models and facilitate targeting of skimming and booming efforts. Satellite data are frequently supplemented by information provided by aircraft, ships, and remotely-controlled underwater robots. The Sea Princess tanker grounding off the coast of Wales and the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico provide good examples for studying the effectiveness of remote sensors during oil-spill emergencies.																	0749-0208					SEP	2010	26	5					789	797		10.2112/10A-00012.1								WOS:000282358200001

Observations of chromophoric dissolved and detrital organic matter distribution using remote sensing in the Southern Ocean: Validation, dynamics and regulation	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Chromophoric dissolved and detrital organic matter (CDM), the optically active fraction of organic matter, affects significantly the underwater light environment and interferes with ocean color algorithms. Here, we studied the distribution and dynamics of CDM in waters around the Antarctic Peninsula, Southern Ocean, using remotely sensed data in austral summers from 1997 to 2005. First, we validated the global semi-analytic algorithm Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) by comparing simultaneous field and satellite measurements of CDM. These comparisons confirmed the validity of CDM satellite measurements obtained by the GSM algorithm (r(2) = 0.74, slope value = 1.01 +/- 0.16, n = 15). We found a higher (20%) contribution of detrital particles to the CDM signal compared to other studies in lower latitudes (average 12%). Patches of higher CDM were observed in coastal areas and zones with recent ice melting. The seasonal variability of CDM, with maximum values at the end of austral summer, appeared to be ultimately controlled by the dynamics of ice, both directly and indirectly through the growth of phytoplankton and other organisms which are potential sources of CDM. At an interannual timescale, CDM dynamics may be driven by climatic forcing such as the Antarctic Oscillation. (C)2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hamel, MA; Andrefouet, S				Hamel, Melanie A.; Andrefouet, Serge			Using very high resolution remote sensing for the management of coral reef fisheries: Review and perspectives	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Coral reef fisheries are critical for food security and as a source of income in developing and developed countries, but they are collapsing in many areas. Following the emergence and routine availability of commercial very high spatial resolution (0.6-10 m) multispectral satellite images, we reviewed the use of these new high-quality remote sensing data and products for coral reef fisheries management. The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements.

Feasibility of Monitoring Gas-Hydrate Production With Time-Lapse Vertical Seismic Profiling	SPE JOURNAL												Many studies involving the application of geophysical methods in the field of gas hydrates have focused on determining rock-physics relationships for hydrate-bearing sediments, with the goal being to delineate the boundaries of gas-hydrate accumulations and to estimate the quantities of gas hydrate that such accumulations contain using remote-sensing techniques. However, the potential for using time-lapse geophysical methods to monitor the evolution of hydrate accumulations during production and, thus, to manage production has not been investigated. In this work, we begin to examine the feasibility of using time-lapse seismic methods specifically, the vertical-seismic-profiling (VSP) method for monitoring changes in hydrate accumulations that are predicted to occur during production of natural gas. A feasibility study of this nature is made possible through the coupled simulation of large-scale production in hydrate accumulations and time-lapse geophysical (seismic) surveys. We consider a hydrate accumulation in the Gulf of Mexico that may represent a promising target for production. Although the current study focuses on one seismic method (VSP), this approach can be extended easily to other geophysical methods, including other seismic methods (e.g., surface seismic or crosshole measurements) and electromagnetic surveys. In addition to examining the sensitivity of seismic attributes and parameters to the changing conditions in hydrate accumulations, our long-term goals in this work are to determine optimal sampling strategies (e.g., source frequency, time interval for data acquisition) and measurement configurations (e.g., source and receiver spacing for VSP), while taking into account uncertainties in rock-physics relationships. The numerical-modeling strategy demonstrated in this study may be used in the future to help design cost-effective geophysical surveys to track the evolution of hydrate properties. Here, we describe the modeling procedure and present some preliminary results.

J	Castro, DF; Rossetti, DD; Pessenda, LCR				Castro, Darcilea Ferreira; Rossetti, Dilce de Fatima; Ruiz Pessenda, Luiz Carlos			Facies, delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N analyses in a late Quaternary compound estuarine fill, northern Brazil and relation to sea level	MARINE GEOLOGY												The present work integrates sedimentary facies, C-14 dating, delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N with geologic and geomorphologic data available from literature. The aim was to characterize the depositional settings of a late Quaternary estuary in northeastern Marajo Island and analyze its evolution within the context of relative sea level fluctuations. The data derive from four continuous cores along a proximal-to-distal transect of a paleoestuary, previously recognized using remote sensing information. Fifteen sediment samples recorded ages ranging from 42,580 +/- 1430 to 3184 +/- 37 C-14 yr B.P. Fades analysis indicated fine- to coarse-grained sands with parallel lamination or cross stratification, massive or laminated muds and heterolithic deposits. delta C-13 (-28.1 parts per thousand to -19.7 parts per thousand, mean = -23.0 parts per thousand), delta N-15 (+ 14.8 parts per thousand to + 4.7 parts per thousand, mean = + 9.2 parts per thousand) and C/N (14.5 to 1.5, mean = 7.9) indicate mostly marine and freshwater phytoplankton sources for the organic matter. The results confirm a large late Quaternary paleoestuary in northeastern Marajo Island. The distribution of delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N, together with fades associations, led to identify depositional settings related to fluvial channel, floodplain, tidal channel/tidal flat, central basin, tidal delta, and tidal inlet/sand barrier. These deposits are consistent with a wave-dominated estuary. Variations in stratigraphy and geochemistry are controlled by changes in relative sea level, revealing a main transgression from an undetermined time around 42,000 C-14 yr B.P. and 29,340 (+/- 200) C-14 yr B.P., which is synchronous to the overall drop in sea level after the last interglacial. Following this period, and probably until 9110 +/- 37 C-14 yr B.P., i.e., during a time interval encompassing two glacial episodes including the Last Glacial and the Younger Dryas, there was a pronounced drop in sea level, recorded by the development of a major erosional discontinuity due to valley re-incision. Sea level rose again until 5464 +/- 40 C-14 yr B.P, just before the main worldwide mid-Holocene transgressive peak. Mid to late Holocene coastal progradation ended the Marajo paleoestuarine history, and promoted the establishment of continental conditions throughout the island. The divergence comparing the Marajo sea level behavior with the eustatic curve allows hypothesizing that post-rifting tectonics along the Brazilian Equatorial margin influenced the sedimentary evolution of the studied paleoestuary. Considering that sedimentary facies in estuarine settings are highly variable both laterally and vertically, the present integration of facies with isotope and elemental analyses was crucial to provide a more precise interpretation of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene Marajo paleoestuary, and analyze its sea level history within the eustatic and tectonic context.

Compression of Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) vocalizations using fast orthogonal search	APPLIED ACOUSTICS												Remote sensing of beaked whale vocalizations poses significant problems due to limited communications bandwidths. Many beaked whales vocalize (click) at frequencies up to 50 kHz Hence high bandwidth sampling (typically 100+ kHz) and processing is required in order to detect the clicks, but transmitting the data from a remote sensor using a low-bandwidth (4800 baud) satellite link results in a real-time bottleneck. Even if auto-detection algorithms were used on the remote sensor, some data would need to be relayed to a human operator to verify the classification. Hence, the ability to compress the data in a manner that does not impede the ability to detect and classify the transient signal is required. Typical audio compression techniques have a maximum sampling rate of 48 kHz which is too low to collect beaked whale clicks and still obey the Nyquist criterion. In addition, audio compression algorithms also have a psycho-acoustic model that aids in the compression of the signal but distorts the audio signal. This paper presents a compression algorithm that uses a non-linear modelling technique called fast orthogonal search (FOS) to create a functional expansion of the acoustic data. The candidate functions used in the functional expansion are transient signals that model Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) clicks as well as sinusoidal functions for modelling whale songs. A compression ratio of 93 is achieved by transmitting candidate identification numbers and weights for only the candidate functions that are chosen by the FOS algorithm. The acoustic signal is recreated using the weights and candidate numbers transmitted. The reconstructed time series is used as an input to a band-limited energy detector for whale vocalizations. The raw data and the reconstructed data have comparable probability of detection and missed detections, with fewer false alarms for the reconstructed signal.

Remote sensing of radiative and microphysical properties of clouds during TC4: Results from MAS, MASTER, MODIS, and MISR	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) and MODIS/Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Airborne Simulator (MASTER) were used to obtain measurements of the bidirectional reflectance and brightness temperature of clouds at 50 discrete wavelengths between 0.47 and 14.2 mu m (12.9 mu m for MASTER). These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment conducted over Central America and surrounding Pacific and Atlantic Oceans between 17 July and 8 August 2007. Multispectral images in eleven distinct bands were used to derive a confidence in clear sky (or alternatively the probability of cloud) over land and ocean ecosystems. Based on the results of individual tests run as part of the cloud mask, an algorithm was developed to estimate the phase of the clouds (liquid water, ice, or undetermined phase). The cloud optical thickness and effective radius were derived for both liquid water and ice clouds that were detected during each flight, using a nearly identical algorithm to that implemented operationally to process MODIS cloud data from the Aqua and Terra satellites (Collection 5). This analysis shows that the cloud mask developed for operational use on MODIS, and tested using MAS and MASTER data in TC4, is quite capable of distinguishing both liquid water and ice clouds during daytime conditions over both land and ocean. The cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals use five distinct bands of the MAS (or MASTER), and these results were compared with nearly simultaneous retrievals of marine liquid water clouds from MODIS on the Terra spacecraft. Finally, this MODIS-based algorithm was adapted to Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data to infer the cloud optical thickness of liquid water clouds from MISR. Results of this analysis are compared and contrasted.

Optical complexity in Long Island Sound and implications for coastal ocean color remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The optical properties of estuaries can vary considerably with the delivery of pigmented materials from surrounding watersheds and marine waters. In this study, optical properties sampled at 158 stations throughout the Long Island Sound (LIS) estuary between 2004 and 2007 show significant regional variability. Chlorophyll, total suspended matter, light absorption, and scattering are exceptionally high compared to other coastal data. Inherent optical properties and sea surface reflectances revealed at least two optical domains: a phytoplankton-dominated regime in western LIS and New York Bight and a sediment-dominated regime in central and eastern LIS. Multivariate ordination analysis identified clusters of stations conforming to these optical domains, as well as stations near the Hudson and Connecticut rivers representing optical end-members in LIS characterized by high chromophoric dissolved material (CDM) and biomass (Hudson River) and high sediment loads (Connecticut River). However, winds, tides, and subtidal estuarine circulation redistribute optical constituents throughout the major basins of LIS and homogenize riverine influence. Ocean color parameters, used to define the spectral quality of optical constituents, such as the spectral slopes of particulate backscattering and CDM absorption, and the chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption did not cluster and are relatively constant throughout the region at all times of year. Therefore, variability in spectral reflectance in LIS is principally controlled by the relative magnitudes of the optical properties at each station rather than by significant differences in spectral quality of optically significant constituents. Consistency in these ocean color parameters minimizes the necessity for subregional or seasonal "tuning" of ocean color algorithms.				aurin, dirk/E-1597-2013													0148-0227					JUL 17	2010	115								C07011	10.1029/2009JC005837								WOS:000280048200001						
J	Fichot, CG; Miller, WL				Fichot, Cedric G.; Miller, William L.			An approach to quantify depth-resolved marine photochemical fluxes using remote sensing: Application to carbon monoxide (CO) photoproduction	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents a model to calculate depth-resolved marine photochemical fluxes from remotely sensed ocean color and modeled solar irradiance. The basic approach uses three components: 1) below-sea-surface spectral downward scalar irradiance calculated from a radiative transfer model (STAR) and corrected for clouds using TOMS UV reflectivities; 2) surface-ocean spectral diffuse attenuation coefficients and absorption coefficients for chromophoric dissolved organic matter retrieved from SeaWiFS ocean color using the SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms: and (3) spectral apparent quantum yield for the photochemical reaction considered. The output of the model is a photochemical rate profile, Psi(PR)(z), where z represents depth. We implemented the model for carbon monoxide (CO) photochemistry using an average apparent quantum yield spectrum and generated a monthly climatology of depth-resolved CO photoproduction rates in the global ocean. The climatology was used to compute global budgets and investigate the spatial and seasonal variabilities of CO photoproduction in the ocean. The model predicts a global CO photoproduction rate of about 41 TgC yr(-1), in good agreement with other recent published estimates ranging from 30 to 84 TgC yr(-1). The fate of photochemically derived CO and its role in global biogeochemical cycles remains uncertain however, with biological consumption and sea-air exchange competing for its removal in the surface ocean. Knowledge of the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction is critical in the quantification of the relative magnitudes of these sink mechanisms. The depth-resolution capabilities of this model, together with US Naval Research Laboratory climatology for mixed layer depths allowed further estimation that >95% of the total water-column CO photoproduction occurs within the mixed layer on a global, yearly basis. Despite this compelling figure, the model also suggests significant spatio-temporal variability in the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction in the subtropical gyres, where up to 40% of water-column CO can be produced below the mixed layer during summertime. While the approach can be applied to other photochemical fluxes (e.g. DIC formation or DMS removal), accurate quantification of such processes with remote sensing will be limited until the mechanisms regulating observed oceanic variability in the apparent quantum yields are better understood. Minor modification to this model can also make it applicable for the determination of the effects of UV and visible solar radiation on sensitive biological systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Du, CF; Shang, SL; Dong, QA; Hu, CM; Wu, JY				Du, Cuifen; Shang, Shaoling; Dong, Qiang; Hu, Chuanmin; Wu, Jingyu			Characteristics of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the nearshore waters of the western Taiwan Strait	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Absorption and fluorescence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the nearshore waters of the western Taiwan Strait were examined in April and October of 2008. CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (a(g)(412) in m(-1)) showed an inversed linear relationship with salinity, indicating conservative mixing between freshwater and seawater, although the relationship changed with seasons and locations. On average, except in the vicinity of two major rivers (Minjiang River and Jiulongjiang River), a(g)(412) was higher in October (dry season) (0.173 +/- 0.036 m(-1)) than in April (wet season) (0.123 +/- 0.059 m(-1)). This observation is counter intuitive but consistent with those derived from MODIS satellite measurements. Combined with the CDOM EEM spectra (fluorescence excitation-emission matrix), the results suggest that 1) Minjiang River and jiulongjiang River were the primary land-based CDOM sources; 2) The marine end-members were controlled by the South China Sea Warm Current in April and the Zhe-Min Coastal Water in October; 3) The land-based CDOM was more from sewage than from soil leaching; and 4) Light absorption in the blue wavelengths was dominated by CDOM and detritus.

We used logistic regression to compare paired radiotelemetry (presence) with random (pseudo-absence) location-associated habitat variables derived from (1) satellite remote-sensing of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration and (2) bathymetry. Compared with random locations within their foraging area and after controlling for distance to colony, odds ratios indicated that Cassin's Auklets with dependent young occurred in relatively shallower, warmer, and chlorophyll-rich water associated with chlorophyll fronts near the insular shelf break. These oceanographic features characterize habitats that support key euphausiid prey (e.g., Thysanoessa spinifera) and also other krill predators. Radiotelemetry combined with satellite remote-sensing of the ocean provides an alternative to vessel-based surveys for evaluating seabird foraging habitats. In the absence of information on the actual distribution, abundance, and, hence, availability of zooplankton prey for seabirds, environmental factors can serve as proxies to help elucidate distributional patterns of seabirds at sea.

J	Zavalaga, CB; Halls, J; Dell'Omo, G				Zavalaga, Carlos B.; Halls, Joanne; Dell'Omo, Giacomo			Marine habitat use of Peruvian boobies: a geographic and oceanographic comparison between inshore and offshore islands	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Foraging areas of Peruvian boobies (Sula variegata) from Isla Lobos de Tierra (LT, inshore) and Isla Lobos de Afuera (LA, offshore) were overlaid with concurrent data on wind patterns and remotely sensed hydrographic features to identify the main abiotic factors that affect booby distribution and to compare habitat use between birds from inshore and offshore islands. Birds used across winds and across headwinds when commuting to their feeding grounds and across tailwinds when returning to their colonies. This strategy increased flight speeds by 38-53% in relation to headwinds, probably resulting in a reduction in energy costs when birds returned to their nests with heavy loads of food. Sea surface temperature of the foraged and the available areas were similar around LT and LA. Boobies from LT fed over the continental shelf and alongshore in areas with chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration higher than expected from a random distribution. Conversely, birds from LA never came inshore, feeding over the shelf break and in waters with concentrations of Chl a similar to those in the available area. Remote-sensing measurements of primary productivity predicted the distribution of Peruvian boobies only for LT. Plumes of enriched water alongshore are formed during the austral summer, favouring the aggregation of anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), the main prey of Peruvian boobies. Boobies from LA may have potentially foraged inshore in an area also used by birds from LT, but it is likely that competition for food and energy constraints to raise three-chick broods restricted foraging range to waters far from the mainland.																	1054-3139					JUL	2010	67	5					940	951		10.1093/icesjms/fsp298								WOS:000279870500010

Archaeological geophysics in arid environments: Examples from Israel	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Israel is a country with mostly arid environments where is localized extremely large number of archaeological objects of various age, origin and size. The archaeological remains occur in multi-layered and variable geological-archaeological media. In many cases physical properties of the ancient objects are disturbed by long-term influence of arid conditions. These disturbances strongly complicate interpretation of observed geophysical anomalies since the useful signal/noise ratio is often sufficiently reduced. Another disturbing factors are the influence of uneven topography, oblique polarization (especially, for magnetic field analysis) and industrial-engineering objects of different kinds situating in the vicinity of studied remains. From a rich arsenal of the developed techniques (the most part of them is described in Khesin et al. (1996)) in the paper are presented the methods of advanced quantitative analysis of potential geophysical fields and 3D magnetic field modelling. A brief archaeological-geophysical review indicates that in Israeli archaeological sites were applied practically all near-surface geophysical methods: beginning from the paleomagnetic examination and ending by microwave remote sensing. Such a diversity of applied methods and constant accomplishing of geophysical, archaeological and other data stipulate creating of a multi-linkage as between the various geophysical methods, so also with other archaeologically related databases.

Satellite monitoring of climatic factors regulating phytoplankton variability in the Arabian (Persian) Gulf	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Possible factors regulating phytoplankton variability in the Arabian (Persian) Gulf were analyzed on the basis of satellite observations and meteorological data (1997-2009), including remotely-sensed chlorophyll a concentration (CHL), sea surface temperature, wind, solar radiation, precipitation, and aerosols. Shallow waters of northwestern Gulf influenced by Shatt Al-Arab River discharge were more productive than open Gulf waters, although seasonal CHL patterns in this and other shallow regions looked unrealistic likely because the CHL signal was obscured by bottom reflection. Therefore our further analyses focused on the open Gulf waters, which show a subtropical seasonal CHL cycle with maximum in winter and minimum in spring-summer. This cycle, however, was decoupled from the seasonal extremes of wind mixing. Interannual variations of CHL in the open Gulf regions were correlated with precipitation and aerosol data rather than with wind and sea surface temperature, consistent with the hypothesis of atmospheric deposition as a factor regulating phytoplankton growth. The effect of dust fertilization was likely observed in 2000 and 2008, when low precipitation and aerosol properties indicating elevated level of aeolian dust transport were followed by phytoplankton blooms.

J	Dinoi, A; Perrone, MR; Burlizzi, P				Dinoi, Adelaide; Perrone, Maria Rita; Burlizzi, Pasquale			Application of MODIS Products for Air Quality Studies Over Southeastern Italy	REMOTE SENSING												Aerosol optical thicknesses (AOTs) by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Aqua and Terra satellites, and ground-based measurements of PM10 mass concentrations, collected over three years (2006-2008) at two suburban sites which are 20 km apart, are correlated to assess the use of satellite data for regional air quality studies over Southeastern Italy, in the central Mediterranean. Due to the geographical location, this area is affected by local and long-range transported marine, desert (from Sahara), and anthropogenic (from continental Europe) aerosols. 24-hour averaged PM10 mass concentrations span the 1.6-152 mu g/m(3) range. Yearly means of PM10 mass concentrations decrease from 2006 to 2008 and vary within the 26-36 mu g/m(3) range. Daily mean values of MODIS AOTs vary up to 0.8 at 550 nm, while yearly means span the 0.15-0.17 range. A first assessment of the regression relationship between daily averaged PM10 mass concentrations and MODIS-AOTs shows that linear correlation coefficients (R) vary within the 0.20-0.35 range and are affected by the sampling year and the site location. The PM10-AOT correlation becomes stronger (0.34 <= R <= 0.57) when the analysis is restricted to clear-sky MODIS measurements. The cloud screening procedure adopted within the AERONET network is used in this study to select clear-sky MODIS measurements, since it allows obtaining larger R values than the ones obtained using the cloud fraction MODIS product to select clear-sky MODIS measurements. Using three years of clear-sky measurements to estimate PM10 mass concentrations from MODIS-AOTs, the empirical relation we have found is: PM10 (mu g/m(3)) = 25 (mu g/m(3)) + 65 (mu g/m(3)) x AOT. Over 80% of the differences between the measured and satellite estimated PM10 mass concentrations over the three years are within +/- 1 standard deviation of the yearly means. The differences between yearly means of calculated and measured mass concentrations that are close to zero in 2006, increase up to 4 mu g/m(3) at one site and 8 mu g/m(3) at the other site in 2008. The PM10 mass concentration decrease from 2006 to 2008 contributes to this last result. Our results demonstrate the potential of MODIS data for deriving indirect estimates of PM10 over Southeastern Italy. It is also shown that a stronger relationship between PM10 and MODIS-AOTs is obtained when the AOT is divided by the product of the mixing layer height with the ground wind speed and the analysis restricted to clear sky MODIS measurements. However, we have found that the stronger correlation (0.52 <= R <= 0.66) does not allow a significant improvement of MODIS-based-estimates of PM10 mass concentrations.

J	Knudby, A; LeDrew, E; Brenning, A				Knudby, Anders; LeDrew, Ellsworth; Brenning, Alexander			Predictive mapping of reef fish species richness, diversity and biomass in Zanzibar using IKONOS imagery and machine-learning techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During the last three decades, the large spatial coverage of remote sensing data has been used in coral reef research to map dominant substrate types, geomorphologic zones, and bathymetry. During the same period, field studies have documented statistical relationships between variables quantifying aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Although the results of these studies are ambiguous, some habitat variables have frequently been found to correlate with one or more aspects of the fish community. Several of these habitat variables, including depth, the structural complexity of the substrate, and live coral cover, are possible to estimate with remote sensing data. In this study, we combine a set of statistical and machine-learning models with habitat variables derived from IKONOS data to produce spatially explicit predictions of the species richness, biomass, and diversity of the fish community around two reefs in Zanzibar. In the process, we assess the ability of IKONOS imagery to estimate live coral cover, structural complexity and habitat diversity, and we explore the importance of habitat variables, at a range of spatial scales, in the predictive models using a permutation-based technique. Our findings indicate that structural complexity at a fine spatial scale (similar to 5 to 10 m) is the most important habitat variable in predictive models of fish species richness and diversity, whereas other variables such as depth, habitat diversity, and structural complexity at coarser spatial scales contribute to predictions of biomass. In addition, our results demonstrate that complex model types such as tree-based ensemble techniques provide superior predictive performance compared to the more frequently used linear models, achieving a reduction of the cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error of 3-11%. Although aerial photographs and airborne lidar instruments have recently been used to produce spatially explicit predictions of reef fish community variables, our study illustrates the possibility of doing so with satellite data. The ability to use satellite data may bring the cost of creating such maps within the reach of both spatial ecology researchers and the wide range of organizations involved in marine spatial planning.

A three-component model of phytoplankton size class for the Atlantic Ocean	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A three-component model was developed which calculates the fractional contributions of three phytoplankton size classes (micro-, nano- and picoplankton) to the overall chlorophyll-a concentration in the Atlantic Ocean. The model is an extension of the Sathyendranath et al. (2001) approach, based on the assumption that small cells dominate at low chlorophyll-a concentrations and large cells at high chlorophyll-a concentrations. Diagnostic pigments were used to infer cell size using an established technique adapted to account for small picoeukaroytes in ultra-oligotrophic environments. Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) pigment data taken between 1997 and 2004 were split into two datasets; 1935 measurements were used to parameterise the model, and a further 241 surface measurements, spatially and temporally matched to chlorophyll-a derived from SeaWiFS satellite data, were set aside to validate the model. Comparison with an independent global pigment dataset (256 measurements) also supports the broader-scale application of the model. The effect of optical depth on the model parameters was also investigated and explicitly incorporated into the model. It is envisaged that future applications would include validating multi-plankton biogeochemical models and improving primary-production estimates by accounting for community composition.

On the use of abiotic surrogates to describe marine benthic biodiversity	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A growing need to manage marine biodiversity sustainably at local, regional and global scales cannot be met by applying existing biological data. Abiotic surrogates of biodiversity are thus increasingly valuable in filling the gaps in our knowledge of biodiversity patterns, especially identification of hotspots, habitats needed by endangered or commercially valuable species and systems or processes important to the sustained provision of ecosystem services. This review examines the use of abiotic variables as surrogates for patterns in benthic biodiversity with particular regard to how variables are tied to processes affecting species richness and how easily those variables can be measured at scales relevant to resource management decisions. Direct gradient variables such as salinity, oxygen concentration and temperature can be strong predictive variables for larger systems, although local stability of water quality may prevent usefulness of these factors at fine spatial scales. Biological productivity has complex relationships with benthic biodiversity and although the development of local and regional models cannot accurately predict outside the range of their biological sampling, remote sensing may provide useful information. Indeed, interpolated values are available for much of the world's seas, and these are continually being refined by the collection of remote sensing and field data. Sediment variables often exhibit complex relationships with benthic biodiversity. The strength of the relationship between any one sediment variable and biodiversity may depend on the state of another sediment variable in that system. Percentage mud, percentage gravel, rugosity and compaction hold the strongest independent predictive power. Rugosity and the difference between gravel and finer sediments can be established using acoustic methods, but to quantify grain size and measure compaction, a sample is necessary. Pure spatial variables such as latitude, longitude and depth are not direct drivers of biodiversity patterns but often correspond with driving gradients and can be of some use in prediction. In such cases it would be better to identify what the spatial variable is acting as a proxy for so boundaries for that variable are not overlooked. The utility of these potential surrogates vary across spatial scales, quality of data, and management needs. A continued focus on surrogate research will address the need of marine scientists and resource managers worldwide for accurate and robust predictions, extending from simple measures of diversity to species distributions and patterns of assemblage.

Super-refraction effects on GPS radio occultation refractivity in marine boundary layers	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												With the combination of global coverage, high vertical resolution, and all-weather capability, GPS radio occultation (RO) is an emerging satellite remote sensing technique that can probe the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on a global basis. However, a systematic negative bias (commonly referred to as N-bias) remains in derived refractivity profiles in the ABL. In this paper we present the N-biases in COSMIC RO soundings with respect to ECMWF analyses, which show a seasonally varying pattern clustered over the oceans where super-refraction (SR) often occurs. A case study of coincident COSMIC RO and radiosonde sounding confirms that the N-bias is primarily caused by SR. We also show that the high-rate RO bending angle measurements can resolve the ABL top at a vertical resolution better than 100 m. A reconstruction method is applied to one case where SR occurs and significantly reduces the negative refractivity error in the ABL. Citation: Xie, F., D. L. Wu, C. O. Ao, E. R. Kursinski, A. J.

The study was based on analyzing two satellite images Landsat-TM, taken in 1999 and 2003 and the database composed by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) marine data/observations taken in August, September, and October of 1999, 2000 and 2001. The methodology consists of four phases: 1) a geographical study of Kuwait Bay; 2) statistical analysis of the biophysical indicator database; 3) satellite imagery processing using RS techniques; and finally 4) Integration of RS results with biophysical indicator database using GIS techniques. The first phase revealed that Kuwait Bay has suffered from many environmental challenges. Phase two pointed out that SST has exceeded the maximum standard average, while DO at the opposite exceeded the minimum standard average. The third phase, analyzing images using ERDAS Imagine software, produced two land use/cover maps for 1999 and 2003 with statistical inventory of land use. Changes occurrINGed between 1999 and 2003 were estimated using ArcGIS software. The same process was replased using image differencing technique, proving deep water areas have decreased and shallow water areas increased in the south of Kuwait Bay. These specific areas are characterized also by high SST and low DO, and simultaneously correspond to locations of fish kill accidents happening in 1999 due to "Red Tide" and in of 2001 due to "Streptococcus Bacteria". In conclusion, the study proved integrating GIS and RS techniques, along with biophysical indicators suitable for handling and monitoring the fish kill phenomenon in Kuwait Bay																	1015-4442					JUN	2010	28	2					126	+										WOS:000288405300006

Extremely high concentrations of suspended matter, chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter, local differences, seasonal and tidal variations and resuspension are important factors influencing the optical properties in such areas. This review gives an overview of the processes in estuaries and tidal flat areas and the implications of these for remote sensing in such areas, using the Wadden Sea as a case study area. Results show that remote sensing research in extremely turbid estuaries and tidal areas is possible. However, this requires sensors with a large ground resolution, algorithms tuned for high concentrations of various substances and the local specific optical properties of these substances, a simultaneous detection of water colour and land-water boundaries, a very short time lag between acquisition of remote sensing and in situ data used for validation and sufficient geophysical and ecological knowledge of the area.				de Boer, Jacob/L-5094-2013; Peters, Steef/A-7433-2011	de Boer, Jacob/0000-0001-6949-4828; 												1438-387X					JUN	2010	64	2					75	92		10.1007/s10152-010-0191-6								WOS:000277713000001

As we enhance our understanding about the structuring of natural populations, it becomes important that we also understand the processes behind these patterns. However, there are few rigorous assessments of the influence of environmental factors on genetic patterns in mobile marine species. Given their dispersal capabilities and localized habitat preferences, coastal cetaceans are adequate study species for evaluating environmental effects on marine population structure. The franciscana dolphin, a rare coastal cetacean endemic to the Western South Atlantic, was studied to examine these issues. We analysed genetic data from the mitochondrial DNA and 12 microsatellite markers for 275 franciscana samples utilizing frequency-based, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. This information was combined with 10 years of remote sensing environmental data (chlorophyll concentration, water turbidity and surface temperature). Our analyses show the occurrence of genetically isolated populations within Argentina, in areas that are environmentally distinct. Combined evidence of genetic and environmental structure suggests that isolation by distance and a process here termed isolation by environmental distance can explain the observed correlations. Our approach elucidated important ecological and conservation aspects of franciscana dolphins, and has the potential to increase our understanding of ecological processes influencing genetic patterns in other marine species.

J	Wang, GF; Cao, WX; Yang, YZ; Zhou, W; Liu, S; Yang, DT				Wang, Guifen; Cao, Wenxi; Yang, Yuezhong; Zhou, Wen; Liu, Sheng; Yang, Dingtian			Variations in light absorption properties during a phytoplankton bloom in the Pearl River estuary	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												From 15 to 28 August in 2007, a Chaetoceros socialis bloom was detected in the Pearl River Estuary water with chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) up to 30 mg m(-3) and cell density up to 10(6) cells L-1. Time series of bio-optical measurements was obtained at a single site (114.29 degrees E, 22.06 degrees N) with the mooring of marine optical buoy. Light absorption properties of seawater experienced large variability throughout the algal bloom. Absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was one of the dominant optical components of the light absorption (30-70%) especially for pre- and post-bloom waters, and it tended to decrease with Chl a during the algal bloom. Absorption by phytoplankton was another dominant optical component (18-50%) and increased rapidly with Chl a. Phytoplankton and accompanying material played dominant roles in light absorption as indicated by the relationship between absorption coefficient and Chl a. At high pigment concentrations, water samples showed significantly lower specific phytoplankton absorption, compared with pre- and post-bloom conditions, with the specific phytoplankton concentration at 443 nm varied between 0.011 and 0.022 m(2) mg(-1) and that at 676 nm between 0.007 and 0.018 m(2) mg(-1); small values of blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton were also observed. These lower values were associated with variations in phytoplankton size structure. Spectral variability of phytoplankton absorption and total absorption (not including the fixed background absorption by pure water itself) could be expressed as simple linear functions linking absorption at one wavelength to the absorption at the other wavelengths, with the slope of the relationship changing with wavelength. The absorption coefficients by non-algal particles and CDOM follow the general exponential functions with remarkably limited variability in the exponent with means of 0.0105 and 0.0166 nm(-1), respectively. These spectral dependencies of absorption coefficients provide useful information for retrieving inherent optical properties from reflectance data in a remote-sensing context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ohde, T; Siegel, H				Ohde, T.; Siegel, H.			Biological response to coastal upwelling and dust deposition in the area off Northwest Africa	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Nutrient supply in the area off Northwest Africa is mainly regulated by two processes, coastal upwelling and deposition of Saharan dust. In the present study, both processes were analyzed and evaluated by different methods, including cross-correlation, multiple correlation, and event statistics, using remotely sensed proxies of the period from 2000 to 2008 to investigate their influence on the marine environment. The remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentration was used as a proxy for the phytoplankton biomass stimulated by nutrient supply into the euphotic zone from deeper water layers and from the atmosphere. Satellite-derived alongshore wind stress and sea-surface temperature were applied as proxies for the strength and reflection of coastal upwelling processes. The westward wind and the dust component of the aerosol optical depth describe the transport direction of atmospheric dust and the atmospheric dust column load. Alongshore wind stress and induced upwelling processes were most significantly responsible for the surface chlorophyll-a variability, accounting for about 24% of the total variance, mainly in the winter and spring due to the strong north-easterly trade winds. The remotely sensed proxies allowed determination of time lags between biological response and its forcing processes. A delay of up to 16 days in the surface chlorophyll-a concentration due to the alongshore wind stress was determined in the northern winter and spring. Although input of atmospheric iron by dust storms can stimulate new phytoplankton production in the study area, only 5% of the surface chlorophyll-a variability could be ascribed to the dust component in the aerosol optical depth. All strong desert storms were identified by an event statistics in the time period from 2000 to 2008. The 57 strong storms were studied in relation to their biological response. Six events were clearly detected in which an increase of chlorophyll-a was caused by Saharan dust input and not by coastal upwelling processes. Time lags of <8 days, 8 days, and 16 days were determined. An increase in surface chlorophyll-a concentration of up to 2.4 mg m(-3) after dust storms in which the dust component of the aerosol optical depth was up to 0.9 was observed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Examining the impact of overlying aerosols on the retrieval of cloud optical properties from passive remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Haywood et al. (2004) show that an aerosol layer above a cloud can cause a bias in the retrieved cloud optical thickness and effective radius. Monitoring for this potential bias is difficult because space-based passive remote sensing cannot unambiguously detect or characterize aerosol above cloud. We show that cloud retrievals from aircraft measurements above cloud and below an overlying aerosol layer are a means to test this bias. The data were collected during the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-A) study based out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States, above extensive, marine stratus cloud banks affected by industrial outflow. Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) irradiance measurements taken along a lower level flight leg above cloud and below aerosol were unaffected by the overlying aerosol. Along upper level flight legs, the irradiance reflected from cloud top was transmitted through an aerosol layer. We compare SSFR cloud retrievals from below-aerosol legs to satellite retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to detect an aerosol-induced bias. In regions of small variation in cloud properties, we find that SSFR and MODIS-retrieved cloud optical thickness compares within the uncertainty range for each instrument while SSFR effective radius tend to be smaller than MODIS values (by 1-2 mu m) and at the low end of MODIS uncertainty estimates. In regions of large variation in cloud properties, differences in SSFR and MODIS-retrieved cloud optical thickness and effective radius can reach values of 10 and 10 mu m, respectively. We include aerosols in forward modeling to test the sensitivity of SSFR cloud retrievals to overlying aerosol layers. We find an overlying absorbing aerosol layer biases SSFR cloud retrievals to smaller effective radii and optical thickness while nonabsorbing aerosols had no impact.

This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.																	0364-152X					MAY	2010	45	5					985	997		10.1007/s00267-010-9471-9								WOS:000277771400009	20336296

New strategies are required to more effectively select MPA locations and increase the pace of their implementation. Many criteria exist to design MPA networks, but generally, it is recommended that networks conserve a diversity of species selected for, among other attributes, their representativeness, rarity, or endemicity. Because knowledge of species' spatial distribution remains scarce, efficient surrogates are urgently needed. We used five different levels of habitat maps and six spatial scales of analysis to identify under which circumstances habitat data used to design MPA networks for Wallis Island provided better representation of species than random choice alone. Protected-area site selections were derived from a rarity-complementarity algorithm. Habitat surrogacy was tested for commercial fish species, all fish species, commercially harvested invertebrates, corals, and algae species. Efficiency of habitat surrogacy varied by species group, type of habitat map, and spatial scale of analysis. Maps with the highest habitat thematic complexity provided better surrogates than simpler maps and were more robust to changes in spatial scales. Surrogates were most efficient for commercial fishes, corals, and algae but not for commercial invertebrates. Conversely, other measurements of species-habitat associations, such as richness congruence and composition similarities provided weak results. We provide, in part, a habitat-mapping methodology for designation of MPAs for Pacific Ocean islands that are characterized by habitat zonations similar to Wallis. Given the increasing availability and affordability of space-borne imagery to map habitats, our approach could appreciably facilitate and improve current approaches to coral reef conservation and enhance MPA implementation.

J	Behrenfeld, MJ				Behrenfeld, Michael J.			Abandoning Sverdrup's Critical Depth Hypothesis on phytoplankton blooms	ECOLOGY												The Critical Depth Hypothesis formalized by Sverdrup in 1953 posits that vernal phytoplankton blooms occur when surface mixing shoals to a depth shallower than a critical depth horizon defining the point where phytoplankton growth exceeds losses. This hypothesis has since served as a cornerstone in plankton ecology and reflects the very common assumption that blooms are caused by enhanced growth rates in response to improved light, temperature, and stratification conditions, not simply correlated with them. Here, a nine-year satellite record of phytoplankton biomass in the subarctic Atlantic is used to reevaluate seasonal plankton dynamics. Results show that (1) bloom initiation occurs in the winter when mixed layer depths are maximum, not in the spring, (2) coupling. between phytoplankton growth (mu) and losses increases during spring stratification, rather than,decreases, (3) maxima in net population growth rates (r) are as likely to occur in midwinter as in spring, and (4) r is generally inversely related to mu. These results are incompatible with the Critical Depth Hypothesis as a functional framework for understanding bloom dynamics. In its place, a "Dilution-Recoupling Hypothesis" is described that focuses on the balance between phytoplankton growth and grazing, and the seasonally varying physical processes influencing this balance. This revised view derives from fundamental concepts applied during field dilution experiments, builds upon earlier modeling results, and is compatible with observed phytoplankton blooms in the absence of spring mixed layer shoaling.																	0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	2010	91	4					977	989		10.1890/09-1207.1								WOS:000277525300006	20462113

The aerosol size distributions in clean marine environment were dominated by an accumulate mode with radius of 0.15 mu m and a coarse mode with radius of 4.5 mu m. The mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent were 0.26 and 1.26, respectively. In the frontal zone the aerosol size distribution was dominated by an accumulate mode with radius of 0.25 mu m and two coarse modes with radii of 1.69 and 7.73 mu m, and the AOD and Angstrom exponent were 2.46 and 0.84, respectively. In the nonfrontal dust conditions, the concentration of coarse modes with radii of 2.5 mu m increased to a maximum of 0.3 mu m(3)/mu m(2), and the mean AOD and Angstrom exponent were 0.70 and 0.30, respectively. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations combined with shipboard measurements reveal the decreasing concentration of dust aerosol during its transport from continent to Japan. The spatial distribution of dust aerosol was studied using the Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) and Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) products. On 22 April, for frontal dust, their AOD and UV aerosol index (UVAI) increased with decreasing distance to the frontal line, peaked with values of 4.36 and 5.21 in the frontal zone, and decreased rapidly with increasing distance off the frontal line. On 23 April, nonfrontal dust showed the lower AOD and UVAI with peak values of 2.0 and 2.7, respectively.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 17	2010	115								D00K04	10.1029/2009JD012684								WOS:000275857400003

The GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This article presents the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud Product (GOCCP) designed to evaluate the cloudiness simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). For this purpose, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization L1 data are processed following the same steps as in a lidar simulator used to diagnose the model cloud cover that CALIPSO would observe from space if the satellite was flying above an atmosphere similar to that predicted by the GCM. Instantaneous profiles of the lidar scattering ratio (SR) are first computed at the highest horizontal resolution of the data but at the vertical resolution typical of current GCMs, and then cloud diagnostics are inferred from these profiles: vertical distribution of cloud fraction, horizontal distribution of low, middle, high, and total cloud fractions, instantaneous SR profiles, and SR histograms as a function of height. Results are presented for different seasons (January-March 2007-2008 and June-August 2006-2008), and their sensitivity to parameters of the lidar simulator is investigated. It is shown that the choice of the vertical resolution and of the SR threshold value used for cloud detection can modify the cloud fraction by up to 0.20, particularly in the shallow cumulus regions. The tropical marine low-level cloud fraction is larger during nighttime (by up to 0.15) than during daytime. The histograms of SR characterize the cloud types encountered in different regions. The GOCCP high-level cloud amount is similar to that from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The low-level and middle-level cloud fractions are larger than those derived from passive remote sensing (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy System Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances, TOVS Path B, AIRS-Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique) because the latter only provide information on the uppermost cloud layer.

In this paper a new algorithm is developed for detecting three dominant phytoplankton size classes based on distinct differences in their optical signatures. The technique is validated against an independent coupled satellite reflectance and in situ pigment dataset and run on the 10-year NASA Sea viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data series. Results indicate that on average 3.6% of the global oceanic surface layer is dominated by microplankton, 18.0% by nanoplankton and 78.4% by picoplankton. Results, however, are seen to vary depending on season and ocean basin.

Spatial distribution and habitat selection of Barrow's and Common goldeneyes wintering in the St. Lawrence marine system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Our study addresses winter spatial distribution of Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica (Gmelin, 1789)) and Common Goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula (L.. 1758)) at the scale of the St. Lawrence marine system (estuary and northwestern gulf), eastern Canada. Our objectives were (i) to identify and compare the physical factors that control their distributions, (ii) to quantify the level of sympatry between the two species, and (iii) to compare their distribution patterns. We analyzed large-scale synoptic views of winter distribution of both goldeneye species obtained through helicopter-borne surveys. Habitat description was obtained through spatial analyses and remote sensing. Both species showed strong preference for the tidal zone and river mouths. A multiscale analysis showed a decreasing level of sympatry as spatial resolution was refined. The distribution of the Barrow's Goldeneye was more clustered compared with that of the Common Goldeneye, and Barrow's Goldeneye was repeatedly observed in the same few areas. A use-availability analysis identified the northern coast of the St. Lawrence estuary as the main wintering ground for Barrow's Goldeneye in eastern North America.																	0008-4301					MAR	2010	88	3					306	314		10.1139/Z09-144								WOS:000276484900009

Even though there has been progress recently, there is still a great deal of research needed to gain a better understanding of seagrass. In this article we review and discuss the advances in seagrass research in China from two aspects: (1) seagrass species and their distribution; (2) seagrass research in China, including studies on their taxonomy, ecology, photosynthesis, applications in aquaculture, salt-tolerance mechanisms and other research topics. A total of 18 seagrass species belonging to 8 genera are distributed in nine provinces and regions in China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), as well as the Xisha and Nansha Archipelagos. They can be divided into two groups: a North China Group and a South China Group. Based on the seagrass distribution, the Chinese mainland coast can be divided into three sections: North China Seagrass Coast, Middle China Seagrass Coast, and South China Seagrass Coast. Ecological studies include research on seagrass communities, nutrient cycling in seagrass ecosystems, genetic diversity, pollution ecology and research in the key regions of Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. Seagrass species and their locations, community structure, ecological evaluation, epiphytes, ecological functions and threats in the key regions are also summarized. Other studies have focused on remote sensing of seagrass, threatened seagrass species of China, and pollen morphology of Halophila ovalis.																	0254-4059					MAR	2010	28	2					329	339		10.1007/s00343-010-9183-2								WOS:000275781400019

Clustering of Approaches to Microbiological Image Enhancement and Classification Based on Buser & Baroni-Urbani's Algorithm and Dragomirescu's Homogeneity	CONTROL ENGINEERING AND APPLIED INFORMATICS												Even though microbial imagery had constantly benefited upon technical developments, the analysis of microbial images did not record the same progress. However, analytical tools had been developed in conjunction with remote sensing imagery, and are available for other fields of study as well. When importing such approaches, it is necessary to understand their detailed functioning in order to envisage eventual problems and improve the correctness and accuracy of results. The paper analyzes several approaches to microbial imagery enhancement, quantification, and classification. Approaches are classified using a numerical taxonomy instrument, i.e. Buser & Baroni-Urbani's algorithm and Dragomirescu's homogeneity. Results indicate the presence of three methodological groups and sustain the usage of the image classification/GIS methods in microbiology and other biological fields.

Spatial Synchrony in Intertidal Benthic Algal Biomass in Temperate Coastal and Estuarine Ecosystems	ECOSYSTEMS												Microphytobenthos plays a vital role in estuarine and coastal carbon cycling and food webs. Yet, the role of exogenous factors, and thus the effects of climate change, in regulating microphytobenthic biomass is poorly understood. We aimed to unravel the mechanisms structuring microphytobenthic biomass both within and across ecosystems. The spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass of intertidal benthic algae (dominated by diatoms) was estimated with an unprecedented spatial extent from time-series of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a 6-year period of daily Aqua MODIS 250-m images of seven temperate, mostly turbid, estuarine and coastal ecosystems. These NDVI time-series were related to meteorological and environmental conditions. Intertidal benthic algal biomass varied seasonally in all ecosystems, in parallel with meteorology and water quality. Seasonal variation was more pronounced in mud than in sand. Interannual variation in biomass was small, but synchronized year-to-year biomass fluctuations occurred in a number of disjointed ecosystems. Air temperature explained interannual fluctuations in biomass in a number of sites, but the synchrony was mainly driven by the wind/wave climate: high wind velocities reduced microphytobenthic biomass, either through increased resuspension or reduced emersion duration. Spatial variation in biomass was largely explained by emersion duration and mud content, both within and across ecosystems. The results imply that effects on microphytobenthic standing stock can be anticipated when the position in the tidal frame is altered, for example due to sea level rise. Increased storminess will also result in a large-scale decrease of biomass.				van der Wal, Daphne/A-8875-2011; Herman, Peter/A-9018-2011	van der Wal, Daphne/0000-0002-2319-056X; Herman, Peter/0000-0003-2188-6341												1432-9840					MAR	2010	13	2					338	351		10.1007/s10021-010-9322-9								WOS:000275785700013

After selecting appropriate conditions for experiments, the authors tested UV reflective spectrum of four simulation targets for oil spill (gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, lubricating oil). The authors calculated the UV absolute spectrum reflectivity of all testing targets from the standard white board as reference, whose UV reflectivity was given. With processing and analyzing the data from experiments, the authors got the reflective characteristics of them in contrast to the reflectivity of water, which was measured in the same conditions. All targets were tested from 320 to 400 nm, and UV reflectivity wave-band between 360 and 380 nm was representative. Testing data were shown as follows: (1) The reflectivity of water was from 5.3% to 5. 5%. (2) When the thickness of oil film was 400 mu m, the reflectivity of gasoline was from 8. 5%o to 8. 8%, 5. 4%-5. 8% for kerosene, 8. 3%8. 4% for diesel fuel, and 9. 4%-9. 7% for lubricating oil in the same wave-band between 360 and 380 nm. Correspondingly, the indeterminacy of reflectivity was 0. 32%, 0. 45%, 0. 25%, and 0. 33% respectively. (3) Hence the thickness of oil film changed, the rule of the UV reflectivity varied depending on the sort of oil spill. The results show that there were some obvious reflectivity differences among oil films and water, which were mainly determined by the sort and thickness of oil film. This experiment method is also fit for the actual oil spill target, and it will fulfill some theory and experimental foundation for inspecting the marine oil spill by UV remote sensing in the future.																	1000-0593					MAR	2010	30	3					738	742		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2010)03-0738-05								WOS:000275299900037

Validation of SeaWiFS and MODIS aerosol products with globally distributed AERONET data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The validation of aerosol products derived from ocean color missions is required for the assessment of their uncertainties and as a diagnostic for the atmospheric correction schemes used for determining the ocean apparent optical properties. A comprehensive validation of the aerosol products obtained from the ocean color missions SeaWiFS and MODIS is presented; it relies on the field observations collected at 85 AERONET sites and is completed by preliminary results obtained with the data of the maritime AERONET component. A robust match-up selection protocol yields approximately 7000 match-ups for each sensor. The median absolute relative difference for the aerosol optical thickness tau(a) increases from 20-22% at 443 nm to 45-48% in the near-infrared. The validation statistics are comparable for both sensors but MODIS results appear degraded particularly for sites located on isolated islands. The median absolute difference is approximately 0.03 at all wavelengths. Results are further analyzed for specific geographic regions or groups of sites selected to represent oceanic, continental, or desert dust conditions. Importantly, the match-up sets appear generally representative of the regional natural variability in tau(a) amplitude and spectral shape, with the notable exception of high tau(a) conditions that are excluded. An important finding is the underestimate by the atmospheric correction of the Angstrom exponent alpha with a median bias of -0.52. This underestimate is apparent even at low alpha values and regularly increases with alpha. This discrepancy in tau(a) spectral shape might result from an inappropriate set of candidate aerosol models and/or uncertainties in the calibration at the near-infrared bands. As the validation data base is expanded and updated in relation to new versions of the processing chains, this work provides a benchmark for the assessment of the aerosol products derived from the SeaWiFS and MODIS ocean color missions.

There is a limited understanding of their chemical properties and even less is known about the relationships between fluorescent properties and widely used optical properties of aerosols in the vertical air column, such as aerosol optical depth (delta(A lambda)), aerosol size distribution, and single scattering albedo (omega(0A lambda)). In this study, we examined relationships between spectroscopic (fluorescence and absorbance) properties of the water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) in aerosol deposition and ground-based remote sensing measurements of aerosols in the atmospheric column. With both techniques, we found important differences between Saharan-and marine-dominated organic aerosols. Saharan-dominated WSOC had more intense fluorescence and higher content of reduced quinone-like fluorescent components than marine-dominated WSOC, and amino acid-like fluorescence was substantial in both types of deposition. Both particulate matter loading and molar absorption in the UV range were significantly related to iron content and may reflect a contribution from iron to light absorption. Saharan-dominated aerosols generally had higher delta(A lambda) and volume concentration of coarse mode particles (> 0.5 mu m; V(c2)) than marine-dominated aerosols. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and PARAFAC modeling, we found that reduced quinone-like compounds were significantly and positively related to delta(A lambda) and V(c2). The relationships that emerged from this study provide a basis for relating WSOC and columnar measurements in the future.

J	Guneroglu, A				Guneroglu, Abdulaziz			Marine litter transportation and composition in the Coastal Southern Black Sea Region	SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ESSAYS												Marine litter problem has gained great attetion in regional seas and lead to degredation and threaten aquatic life in marine environment. Coastal marine litter in the Black Sea is mainly caused by transportation and deposition of antropogenic waste resulting from river outflows. Measures and regulations remain inadequate to protect the coastal regions against pollution in the region. Geomorphology of the region creates many watersheds supplied by extensive stream networks. To estimate litter load on the Black Sea coastal areas 15 streams were surveyed. Study area is densely populated coastal region with scattered settlemets toward steep higher areas. Dry solid waste load is triggered by settlement plan and leads to accumulation of marine litter in coastal areas. Regional precipitation characteristic of the region determines flood timing and frequency with very high rainfall records. Composition and distrubution of sampled marine litter is carried out by identifying litter type propotionality to total load. Plastic has the highest ratio of 56% among all litter type. Yearly total litter load for Degirmendere stream is estimated 102.25 m(3)/year for 100 ha. Multispectral satellite images are used to asses transportation of floating or drifting litter from coastal areas to inner basin. Man made alterations of coastal areas are also evaluated in terms of aquatic living resources and pollution. Main problems are stressed and possible solutions and implications are given to reduce pollution problem in coastal areas.																	1992-2248					FEB 4	2010	5	3					296	303										WOS:000275269500005

A survey of spectrogram track detection algorithms	APPLIED ACOUSTICS												The detection of tracks in spectrograms is an important step in remote sensing applications such as the analysis of marine mammal calls and remote sensing data in underwater environments. Recent advances in technology and the abundance of data requires the development of more sensitive detection methods. This problem has attracted researchers' interest from a variety of backgrounds ranging between image processing, signal processing, simulated annealing and Bayesian filtering. Most of the literature is concentrated in three areas: image processing, neural networks, and statistical models such as the Hidden Markov model. There has not been a review paper which describes and critically analyses the application of these key algorithms. This paper presents an extensive survey and an algorithm taxonomy, additionally each algorithm is reviewed according to a set of criteria relating to their success in application. These criteria are defined to be their ability to cope with noise variation over time, track association, high variability in track shape, closely separated tracks, multiple tracks, the birth/death of tracks, low signal-to-noise ratios, that they have no a priori assumption of track shape and that they are computationally cheap. Our analysis concludes that none of these algorithms fully meets these criteria. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing data on sea surface temperature and height anomalies, as well as trajectories of surface drifters were used, to get simultaneous information on the currents encountered by the turtles during their long-range oceanic movements. Turtles mostly turned out to move in the same direction as the main currents, and their routes were often influenced by circulation features they encountered. A comparison between turtle ground speeds with that of drifters shows that in several instances, the turtles did not drift passively with the currents but contributed actively to the overall movement. Two turtles embarked on an oceanic crossing, probably induced by seasonal changes in surface temperatures, a crossing that was largely determined by the main currents existing in the area.

Physiological optimization underlies growth rate-independent chlorophyll-specific gross and net primary production	PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH												Characterization of physiological variability in phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiencies is one of the greatest challenges in assessing ocean net primary production (NPP) from remote sensing of surface chlorophyll (Chl). Nutrient limitation strongly influences phytoplankton intracellular pigmentation, but its impact on Chl-specific NPP (NPP*) is debated. We monitored six indices of photosynthetic activity in steady-state Dunaliella tertiolecta cultures over a range of nitrate-limited growth rates (mu), including photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)), O(2)-based gross and net production, 20 min and 24 h carbon assimilation, and carbon- and mu-based NPP. Across all growth rates, O(2)-based Chl-specific gross primary production (GPP(O2)*), NPP*, and F(v)/F(m) were constant. GPP(O2)* was 3.3 times greater than NPP*. In stark contrast, Chl-specific short-term C fixation showed clear linear dependence on l, reflecting differential allocation of photosynthate between short-lived C products and longer-term storage products. Indeed, (14)C incorporation into carbohydrates was five times greater in cells growing at 1.2 day(-1) than 0.12 day(-1). These storage products are catabolized for ATP and reductant generation within the period of a cell cycle. The relationship between Chl-specific gross and net O(2) production, short-term (14)C-uptake, NPP*, and growth rate reflects cellular-level regulation of fundamental metabolic pathways in response to nutrient limitation.

M.; Andreassen, Karin; Corner, Geoffrey D.; Laberg, Jan Sverre			Deglaciation of a marine-based ice sheet: Late Weichselian palaeo-ice dynamics and retreat in the southern Barents Sea reconstructed from onshore and offshore glacial geomorphology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Marine and terrestrial datasets (swath bathymetry, 2D and 3D seismic and remote sensing data) are used to map the megascale glacial geomorphology of the southern Barents Sea seafloor, northern Fennoscandia and the Kola Peninsula, giving new insights into the dynamics and behaviour of the Barents Sea Ice Sheet during retreat. The glacial geomorphology indicates clear spatial and temporal variations in ice dynamics, with evidence for both active ice streaming and frozen-bed conditions at the maximum and during deglaciation. A five-stage reconstruction of the Late Weichselian deglaciation is proposed. At the Late Weichselian maximum, ice covered the whole of the Barents Sea shelf and the configuration and dynamics of the ice sheet were controlled by the Bjornoyrenna (Bear Island Trough) Ice Stream. This was fed by source areas in the central and north-eastern Barents Sea and in the Fennoscandian mainland. Deglaciation was initiated along the western continental margin. Available dating results show that this occurred after 19 cal ka BP. The Bjornoyrenna Ice Stream retreated rapidly (ice margin retreat rates of similar to 275 m a(-1)), but was periodically grounded, as evidenced by a well-developed series of grounding zone wedges. This was followed by an advance of two short-lived ice streams from the eastern sector of the ice sheet into the south-western Barents Sea. These ice streams advanced and retreated very rapidly with no evidence for ice margin standstills. Correlation to dated cores suggests an age of around 16 000 cal ka BP for this readvance. The period of operation of these two ice streams was coincident with maximum ice extent along the eastern margin in Russia. The western Barents Sea ice margin then retreated onshore, with deglaciation continuing at a reduced rate. The initiation of deglaciation coincided with rising global eustatic sea level. Acceleration of calving, due to grounding line floatation rapidly opened up a major calving bay in Bjornoyrenna, encouraging rapid loss of the marine-based ice. The retreat rate stabilised only once the ice sheet retreated onshore, and calving ceased. We note that the observed pattern of rapid retreat, with high variability in ice streaming for the marine-based Barents Sea Ice Sheet, is similar to that of the marine-based sectors of the Late Weichselian British, Laurentide and West Antarctic Ice Sheets.

TEMPORAL CHANGE IN DEEP-SEA BENTHIC ECOSYSTEMS: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE FROM RECENT TIME-SERIES STUDIES	ADVANCES IN MARINE BIOLOGY, VOL 58	Advances in Marine Biology											Societal concerns over the potential impacts of recent global change have prompted renewed interest in the long term ecological monitoring of large ecosystems The deep sea is the largest ecosystem on the planet the least accessible and perhaps the least understood Nevertheless deep sea data collected over the last few decades are now being synthesised with a view to both measuring global change and predicting the future impacts of further rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations For many years it was assumed by many that the deep sea is a stable habitat buffered from short term changes in the atmosphere or upper ocean However recent studies suggest that deep seafloor ecosystems may respond relatively quickly to seasonal inter annual and decadal scale shifts in upper ocean variables In this review we assess the evidence for these long term (i e inter annual to decadal scale) changes both in biologically driven sedimented deep sea ecosystems (e g abyssal plains) and in chemosynthetic ecosystems that are partially geologically driven such as hydrothermal vents and cold seeps We have identified 11 deep sea sedimented ecosystems for which published analyses of long term biological data exist At three of these we have found evidence for a progressive trend that could be potentially linked to recent climate change although the evidence is not conclusive At the other sites we have concluded that the changes were either not significant or were stochastically variable without being clearly linked to climate change or climate variability indices For chemosynthetic ecosystems we have identified 14 sites for which there are some published long term data Data for temporal changes at chemosynthetic ecosystems are scarce with few sites being subjected to repeated visits However the limited evidence from hydrothermal vents suggests that at fast spreading centres such as the East Pacific Rise vent communities are impacted on decadal scales by stochastic events such as volcanic eruptions with associated fauna showing complex patterns of community succession For the slow spreading centres such as the Mid Atlantic Ridge vent sites appear to be stable over the time periods measured with no discernable long term trend At cold seeps inferences based on spatial studies in the Gulf of Mexico and data on organism longevity suggest that these sites are stable over many hundreds of years However at the Haakon Mosby mud volcano a large well studied seep in the Barents Sea periodic mud slides associated with gas and fluid venting may disrupt benthic communities leading to successional sequences over time For chemosynthetic ecosystems of biogenic origin (e g whale falls) it is likely that the longevity of the habitat depends mainly on the size of the carcass and the ecological setting with large remains persisting as a distinct seafloor habitat for up to loo years Studies of shallow water analogs of deep sea ecosystems such as marine caves may also yield insights into temporal processes Although it is obvious from the geological record that past climate change has impacted deep sea faunas the evidence that recent climate change or climate variability has altered deep sea benthic communities is extremely limited This mainly reflects the lack of remote sensing of this vast seafloor habitat Current and future advances in deep ocean benthic science involve new remote observing technologies that combine a high temporal resolution (e g cabled observatories) with spatial capabilities (e g autonomous vehicles undertaking image surveys of the seabed)				Copley, Jon/I-7076-2012; Colaco, Ana/A-3862-2009; Mestre, Nelia/C-1943-2009; Bailey, David/A-6240-2008; Lampadariou, Nikolaos/H-1201-2011; Soltwedel, Thomas/P-1852-2016; Lejeusne, Christophe/B-4470-2009	Copley, Jon/0000-0003-3333-4325; Colaco, Ana/0000-0002-6462-5670; Mestre, Nelia/0000-0001-6871-9984; Bailey, David/0000-0002-0824-8823; Soltwedel, Thomas/0000-0002-8214-5937; Lejeusne, Christophe/0000-0002-8821-3849; Cuvelier, Daphne/0000-0003-4042-8215												0065-2881		978-0-12-381015-1				2010	58						1	95		10.1016/S0065-2881(10)58001-5								WOS:000285482700001	20959156

Ocean Emission Effects on Aerosol-Cloud Interactions: Insights from Two Case Studies	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Two case studies are discussed that evaluate the effect of ocean emissions on aerosol-cloud interactions. A review of the first case study from the eastern Pacific Ocean shows that simultaneous aircraft and space-borne observations are valuable in detecting links between ocean biota emissions and marine aerosols, but that the effect of the former on cloud microphysics is less clear owing to interference from background anthropogenic pollution and the difficulty with field experiments in obtaining a wide range of aerosol conditions to robustly quantify ocean effects on aerosol-cloud interactions. To address these limitations, a second case was investigated using remote sensing data over the less polluted Southern Ocean region. The results indicate that cloud drop size is reduced more for a fixed increase in aerosol particles during periods of higher ocean chlorophyll A. Potential biases in the results owing to statistical issues in the data analysis are discussed.

Observed development of the vertical structure of the marine boundary layer during the LASIE experiment in the Ligurian Sea	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												In the marine environment, complete datasets describing the surface layer and the vertical structure of the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL), through its entire depth, are less frequent than over land, due to the high cost of measuring campaigns. During the seven days of the Ligurian Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (LASIE), organized by the NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) in the Mediterranean Sea, extensive in situ and remote sensing measurements were collected from instruments placed on a spar buoy and a ship. Standard surface meteorological measurements were collected by meteorological sensors mounted on the buoy ODAS Italia1 located in the centre of the Gulf of Genoa. The evolution of the height (z(i)) of the MABL was monitored using radiosondes and a ceilometer on board of the N/O Urania. Here, we present the database and an uncommon case study of the evolution of the vertical structure of the MABL, observed by two independent measuring systems: the ceilometer and radiosondes. Following the changes of surface flow conditions, in a sequence of onshore - offshore - onshore wind direction shifting episodes, during the mid part of the campaign, the overall structure of the MABL changed. Warm and dry air from land advected over a colder sea, induced a stably stratified Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) and a consequent change in the structure of the vertical profiles of potential temperature and relative humidity.

Evaluation of aerosol distributions in the GISS-TOMAS global aerosol microphysics model with remote sensing observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Coefficient (AC) predictions in the GISS-TOMAS model of global aerosol microphysics are evaluated against remote sensing data from MODIS, MISR, and AERONET. The model AOD agrees well (within a factor of two) over polluted continental (or high sulfate), dusty, and moderate sea-salt regions but less well over the equatorial, high sea-salt, and biomass burning regions. Underprediction of sea-salt in the equatorial region is likely due to GCM meteorology (low wind speeds and high precipitation). For the Southern Ocean, overprediction of AOD is very likely due to high sea-salt emissions and perhaps aerosol water uptake in the model. However, uncertainties in cloud screening at high latitudes make it difficult to evaluate the model AOD there with the satellite-based AOD. AOD in biomass burning regions is underpredicted, a tendency found in other global models but more severely here. Using measurements from the LBA-SMOCC 2002 campaign, the surface-level OC concentration in the model are found to be underpredicted severely during the dry season while much less severely for EC concentration, suggesting the low AOD in the model is due to underpredictions in OM mass. The potential for errors in emissions and wet deposition to contribute to this bias is discussed.

Testing remote sensing on artificial observations: impact of drizzle and 3-D cloud structure on effective radius retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Remote sensing of cloud effective particle size with passive sensors like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an important tool for cloud microphysical studies. As a measure of the radiatively relevant droplet size, effective radius can be retrieved with different combinations of visible through shortwave and midwave infrared channels. In practice, retrieved effective radii from these combinations can be quite different. This difference is perhaps indicative of different penetration depths and path lengths for the spectral reflectances used. In addition, operational liquid water cloud retrievals are based on the assumption of a relatively narrow distribution of droplet sizes; the role of larger precipitation particles in these distributions is neglected. Therefore, possible explanations for the discrepancy in some MODIS spectral size retrievals could include 3-D radiative transport effects, including sub-pixel cloud inhomogeneity, and/or the impact of drizzle formation. For three cloud cases the possible factors of influence are isolated and investigated in detail by the use of simulated cloud scenes and synthetic satellite data: marine boundary layer cloud scenes from large eddy simulations (LES) with detailed microphysics are combined with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations that explicitly account for the detailed droplet size distributions as well as 3-D radiative transfer to simulate MODIS observations. The operational MODIS optical thickness and effective radius retrieval algorithm is applied to these and the results are compared to the given LES microphysics. We investigate two types of marine cloud situations each with and without drizzle from LES simulations: (1) a typical daytime stratocumulus deck at two times in the diurnal cycle and (2) one scene with scattered cumulus. Only small impact of drizzle formation on the retrieved domain average and on the differences between the three effective radius retrievals is noticed for both cloud scene types for different reasons. For our, presumably typical, overcast stratocumulus scenes with an optical thickness of 8 to 9 and rain rates at cloud bottom up to 0.05 mm/h clear drizzle impact on the retrievals can be excluded. The cumulus scene does not show much drizzle sensitivity either despite extended drizzle areas being directly visible from above (locally >1 mm/h), which is mainly due to technical characteristics of the standard retrieval approach. 3-D effects, on the other hand, produce large discrepancies between the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m channel observations compared to 3.7 mu m retrievals in the latter case. A general sensitivity of MODIS particle size data to drizzle formation is not corroborated by our case studies.

Warming Seas in the Coral Triangle: Coral Reef Vulnerability and Management Implications	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The highest diversity coral reefs in the world, located in the Coral Triangle, are threatened by a variety of local stresses including pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing in addition to climate change impacts, such as increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and ocean acidification. As climate change impacts increase, coral reef vulnerability at the ecoregional scale will have an increasingly important influence on conservation management decisions. This project provides the first detailed assessment of past and future climatic stress, thermal variability, and anthropogenic impacts in the Coral Triangle at the ecoregional level, thus incorporating both local (e.g., pollution, development, and overfishing) and global threats (increasing SSTs). The development of marine protected area (MPA) networks across the Coral Triangle is critical for the region to address these threats. Specific management recommendations are defined for MPA networks based on the levels of vulnerability to thermal and local stress. For example, coral reef regions with potentially low vulnerability to thermal stress may be priorities for establishment of MPA networks, whereas high vulnerability regions may require selection and design principles aimed at building resilience to climate change. The identification of climate and other human threats to coral reef systems and ecoregions can help conservation practitioners prioritize management responses to address these threats and identify gaps in MPA networks or other management mechanisms (e. g., integrated coastal management).

Trichodesmium spp. trichomes were counted and measured, distinguishing free trichomes from those forming macroscopic colonies ("puffs" or "tufts"). Moreover, for both free and colonial individuals, abundance and size structure variation were quantified from single trichome-level data. Nitrogen fixation rates were estimated using an empirical approach based on abundance observations and a heuristic approach to incorporate variation in trichome size and environmental temperature. A gradual change towards greater sizes and increased abundances was observed as physical conditions became subtropical. An extreme response was detected at one station (29.8 degrees W, 26.3 degrees N), in which both in situ and remote sensing data revealed the presence of a Trichodesmium bloom. Despite the presence of a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy, a close examination of prior surface conditions using altimeter data indicated that the bloom was related to the advection of southern waters. In general, our results highlighted the importance of free trichomes in Trichodesmium spp. populations in this part of the North Atlantic. Furthermore. they suggested a possible role of both size and population structure on the wide range of NZ fixation estimates currently available in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The images were rectified and analysed by ERDAS IMAGINE 8.7. Image processing techniques were applied using ENVI 4.2 to analyse the SPOT image data (10 m resolution) for 2006. Image enhancement, principal component analysis (PCA), band ratios and supervised/unsupervised classifications were applied. Surface water samples were collected during the winter of 2005 and the summer of 2006. Water contamination was found to be higher in the summer than in the winter. SPOT image data from the summer, therefore, was selected to verify the results of metal analysis. Different pollutants detected along the El Manasra and El Debba sites are associated with industrial development, and discharge from natural gas companies and electric power generating stations. Significant water pollution is not unique to this region of the Mediterranean Sea, but is increasingly common at coastal locations throughout the globe. To protect both the marine environment and commercial interests that depend on clean water and beaches (e. g. beach resorts), effective wastewater management practices must be designed, implemented and maintained, along with reasonable development policies.

Application of Oceansat-1 MSMR analysed winds to marine navigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The launch of the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-P4 (Oceansat-1) has opened up many important applications. Meteorological navigation is one of the new avenues, which was suffering due to the lack of a synoptic wave database. The research in this area was hindered mainly by the unavailability of real-time wind data. Now, it has become feasible to carry out routine wave forecasting. The Multi-frequency Scanning Microwave Radiometer (MSMR) channel of the satellite gives scalar wind information. This is analysed at the National Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast (NCMWF), India and converted to vector wind information. The 6-hourly u- and v-components of wind in a 1.5 degrees grid covering both the north and south Indian Ocean are available to the research community for further application. In the present study the information has been used to force a third generation spectral wave model (WAM). The simulations are performed for the rough weather month of July 1999 for the regional grid system of the Indian Ocean. This simulated wave climate formed the basis for computing effective ship velocity in the irregular seaway. This study gives a quantitative estimation of change in ship velocity in the open Indian Ocean for a tanker. The optimal path is charted using Dijkstra's algorithm for the optimum route voyage from Calcutta to Singapore and vice versa.																	0143-1161						2010	31	10					2623	2637		10.1080/01431160903032919								WOS:000277999000007

Lyzenga's model has been traditionally used to explain the relationship between bottom surface reflectance and the radiance level measured by satellite. Due to its central assumption, this model lacks accuracy compared with the other radiative transfer models. Nonetheless, it enables, with a single and simple equation, representation of the multiple optical processes taking place in coastal areas. Mapping processes associated with this model may include radiometric correction, a technique previously pointed out as a major driver of mapping accuracy. Radiometric correction is generally based on a depth-invariant index, efficient for clear waters (Jerlov water type I to II) but largely unsuitable when transparency decreases (Jerlov water type II to III). In order to overcome this problem, we developed a new index for radiometric correction, which combines bathymetry data with attenuation coefficients. The improved efficiency of our model with regard to the traditional depth invariant index was demonstrated through two case studies: Funakoshi Bay (Japan; Jerlov water type II) and the Gabes Gulf part located off Mahares (Tunisia; Jerlov water type II to III).																	0143-1161						2010	31	12					3051	3064	PII 924588757	10.1080/01431160903154341								WOS:000280153800001

In this research, we examined the relationships between the reflectance from Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) satellite imagery and total suspended solids (TSS) based on the synchronous in situ spectra analysis of the river water, in an attempt to detect salinity using remote sensing technique. The study site was the Modaomen Waterway in the PRE, Guangdong Province, China. We found a strong negative linear relationship between in situ reflectance at 549 nm and TSS concentrations (R2 = 0.91, p 0.001) when the salinity of the river was less than 1.46 parts per thousand. It indicates that the TSS near Pinggang and Nanzhen in Modaomen Waterway of PRE tends to be dominated by organic mater carried by the particles and this is one major reason for the inverse relation between reflectance and TSS. Meanwhile, a strong correlation was observed between salinity and TSS (R2 = 0.70, p 0.001). The salinity-TSS model accounted for 70% of variation in salinity and allowed the estimation of salinity with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 0.036 parts per thousand when the TSS concentrations were between 7.4 and 28 mg l-1. Therefore, we were able to develop a new method of detecting surface salinity of the river estuary from the calibrated EO-1 ALI reflectance data. The EO-1 ALI derived surface salinity and TSS concentrations were validated using in situ data that were collected on 18 December 2005, synchronous with EO-1 ALI satellite imagery acquisition. The results showed that the semi-empirical relationships are capable of deducing the TSS concentrations and then salinity from EO-1 ALI imagery in the PRE under low salinity. The methodology of detecting salinity from ALI imagery provides potential to monitor coastal saltwater intrusion and provides the water supply and conservancy authorities with useful spatial information to spatially understand and manage the marine intrusion.

Ravi			Analysis of seagrass reflectivity by using a water column correction algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					9th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)	DEC, 2008	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA					Seagrass in optically shallow water can generate optical signals that can be tracked remotely. Unfortunately the signals from the bottom are relatively weak and can be affected by the water column when concentrations of suspended particles, chlorophyll and coloured dissolved organic matter are high. An optical model simulating the propagation of light for retrieving the bottom reflectance was developed. Implementation of the method was found to be effective for improving the accuracy of coastal habitat maps, and essential for deriving empirical relationships between remotely sensed data and interesting features in the marine environment. The appropriate wavebands for seagrass mapping, which generally lay between 500 and 630 nm and 680 and 710 nm, were obtained by means of full visual inspection and analysis of the correct spectra. Additionally, a strong relationship between the reflectance value at 715 nm and Leaf Area Index was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been proven to be a useful tool for oil spill detection under low to moderate wind conditions. SAR operates in the microwave band and the data is not affected by the cloud cover and day/night conditions. However, the operational application of SAR for oil spill detection in the ocean is limited by false alarm targets or lookalike phenomena such as low wind speed, natural films, etc. In this study, we develop analysis of variance (ANOVA) to extract the features based on their characteristic geometry, grey level and texture features in the SAR images. We further analysed a fuzzy logic algorithm to separate oil spills features from lookalikes. We trained this algorithm using 38 SAR images (11 ENVISAT-Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and 27 European Remote Sensing (ERS)-2 SAR images) with 120 known oil spills and 80 lookalikes to generate an oil spill probability of a dark pixel in a SAR image. An independent set of 26 SAR images were used to validate the algorithm and it was found that 80.9% of the oil spills were correctly classified, and 20.0% of the lookalikes were wrongly classified as oil spills. The complete algorithmic procedure was coded in Matlab7.0 using its Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.

AD) and supported a branch of the Via Egnatia road. However, few studies have considered the environmental context of the construction of the bridge. and until now, only two hypotheses have been presented: The bridge was built on or over a junction of the Aliakmon and Loudias Rivers, or on a coastal barrier. Within the framework of a geoarchaeological project developed in April 2008, five boreholes were drilled and the sediment cores analysed for microfauna and sedimentology. Seven (14)C AMS dates provided a chronostratigraphic sequence and helped to define the geomorphological evolution of the area. Spatial interpretation of the results was possible using a Landsat TM image (False Colour Composite - FCC). Our data indicate the gradual transition of the site from a marine to a terrestrial environment during Ancient Times. Lagoonal conditions dominated during the construction of the bridge and the presence of a palaeochannel of the Aliakmon River was later revealed (transition from Byzantine and Ottoman periods), overlying sediments of a coastal barrier.

Progress in the determination of the sea spray source function using satellite data	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Sea spray aerosol influences climate considerably through both direct and indirect aerosol effects. Climate models contain a sea spray source function, i.e. the emission rate of sea spray aerosol droplets per unit area of the sea surface, currently parameterised in terms of wind speed and sea surface temperature (SST). The uncertainty between different formulations of the sea spray source function, and thus associated with the calculated emission fluxes for sea spray aerosol, is more than a factor of 2. In addition, the fraction of organic material in sub-micrometer sea spray droplets is highly uncertain. It is expected that improved estimates can be obtained by inclusion of factors, such as wave conditions, whitecap fraction, improved SST, salinity, and chlorophyll concentration. We aim to incorporate these factors in a new sea spray emission model constrained by the use of satellite observations. Here, we present a methodology for estimating the global primary marine sub-micron organic matter emission. As a first estimate we found an annual global emission of about 20 TgC.																	1943-815X						2010	7			1	SI		159	166		10.1080/19438151003621466								WOS:000208437100017

Observational methods used in marine spatial monitoring of fishes and associated habitats: a review	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Management areas are used in marine spatial planning to conserve biodiversity of marine ecosystems and to protect fish from fishing pressure. To evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas, observational techniques are used to determine densities, sizes, biomass, habitat types and distribution of fish species in and around management areas. Two types of observational techniques are used in spatial monitoring: (1) fishery-independent techniques, which include underwater visual census (UVC), underwater video, remote sensing, acoustics, and experimental catch and effort data; and (2) fishery-dependent techniques, which include catch, effort and catch per unit effort data from commercial and recreational fisheries. This review summarises the applications, advantages, disadvantages and biases of each of these observational categories and highlights emerging technologies. The main finding from this review was that a combination of observational techniques, rather than a single method, was the most effective approach to marine spatial monitoring. For example, a combination of hydroacoustics for habitat mapping and UVC or video for fish surveys was one of the most cost-effective and efficient means of obtaining fish-habitat linkages and fish assemblage data. There are also emerging technologies that could increase the precision and efficiency of monitoring surveys. There is a need for continued development of non-intrusive technology for marine monitoring studies.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2010	61	2					236	252		10.1071/MF09068								WOS:000274913200012

The regional land use is dominated by sugarcane cultivation, beef grazing and urban uses. The high nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fluxes from these land uses via river runoff produced a massive phytoplankton bloom in the GBR lagoon, which, after 9 days, had spread 150 km offshore. The plume and algal bloom surrounded inner-shelf reefs of the GBR such as Brampton Island Reef and its spread was tracked with a variety of satellite sensors including MODIS, SeaWiFS and Landsat over the 9-day period. The ability to be able to access imagery from a large number of satellite sensors allowed almost daily estimates of the extent of plume to be made, despite periods of cloud. Analysis of water samples from the plume revealed elevated (2-50 times higher) concentrations of Chlorophyll a (and hence phytoplankton biomass), up to 50 times higher than in non-flood conditions, nutrients (2-100 times higher) and herbicide residues (10-100 times higher) compared with GBR lagoon waters in non-discharge conditions. The concentration data from the samples and estimated exposure periods from the satellite images allowed estimates of the exposure of GBR marine ecosystems (coral reefs, the pelagic community, seagrass beds and mangrove forests) to the terrestrial contaminants to be made.

J	Logan, GA; Jones, AT; Kennard, JM; Ryan, GJ; Rollet, N				Logan, Graham A.; Jones, Andrew T.; Kennard, John M.; Ryan, Georgina J.; Rollet, Nadege			Australian offshore natural hydrocarbon seepage studies, a review and re-evaluation	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Surprisingly few natural hydrocarbon seeps have been identified in Australia's offshore basins despite studies spanning thirty years. Early studies of natural hydrocarbon seepage around the Australian margin were generally based on the geochemical analysis of stranded bitumens, water column geochemical 'sniffer' sampling, synthetic aperture radar or airborne laser fluorosensor. Later studies involved the integration of these remote sensing and geochemical techniques with multi-channel and shallow seismic. A review of these earlier studies indicates that many seepage interpretations need to be re-evaluated and that previous data sets, when placed in a global context, often represent normal background hydrocarbon levels. Low Recent burial and subsidence rates are not favourable for high rates of seepage. There are also difficulties in proving seepage on high energy, shallow carbonate shelves, where seabed features may be rapidly re-worked and modern marine signatures are overprinted on authigenic seep carbonates. Thus, the relatively few sites of proven natural hydrocarbon seepage in Australia's offshore sedimentary basins can be reconciled relative to their geological occurrences and the dominantly passive margin setting. Active thermogenic methane seepage on the Yampi Shelf, the only proven documented occurrence in Australia, is driven by deposition of a thick Late Tertiary carbonate succession and Late Miocene tectonic reactivation. Therefore, to increase the success of detecting and correctly interpreting natural hydrocarbon seepage, data need to be analysed and integrated within the context of the local geological setting, and with an understanding of what is observed globally.

The data were used to (1) characterize the three-dimensional spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the water column, (2) to examine the relationships between whale foraging areas and productive zones, and (3) to examine the correlation between whale-derived in situ values of Chl-a and those from concurrent satellite images using the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EOS-AQUA satellite (MOD21, SeaWifs analogue OC3M and SST MOD37). Bowhead whales traversed 1600 km2, providing information on diving, Chl-a structure and temperature profiles to depths below 200 m. Feeding dives frequently passed through surface waters (50 m) and targeted depths close to the bottom, and whales did not always target patches of high concentrations of Chl-a in the upper 50 m. Five satellite images were available within the periods whales carried fluorometers. Whales traversed 91 pixels collecting on average 761 s (SD 826) of Chl-a samples per pixel (0-136 m). The depth of the Chl-a maximum ranged widely, from 1 to 66 m. Estimates of Chl-a made from the water-leaving radiance measurements using the OC3M algorithm were highly skewed with most samples estimated as 1 mg m-3 Chl-a, while data collected from whales had a broad distribution with Chl-a reaching 9 mg m-3. The correlation between the satellite-derived and whale-derived Chl-a maxima was poor, a linear fit explained only 10% of the variance.																	1745-1000						2010	6	6					519	529	PII 924373410	10.1080/17451000903505616								WOS:000282581100001

The vertical position of the SCM corresponded with the depth of the subsurface biomass maximum (SBM), at least in Baffin Bay, suggesting that SCM could be an important source of carbon for the food web. Most of these SCM were located well below the pycnocline in close association with the nitracline, implying that their vertical position was driven mainly by a shortage of inorganic nitrogen in the upper euphotic zone. The diversity of SCM configurations with respect to physical properties of the water column complicates the estimation of euphotic-zone chlorophyll and primary production from surface properties. High photosynthetic yields (F-v/F-m) showed the phytoplankton to be photosynthetically competent and well acclimated to conditions of irradiance and nutrient supply near the surface and at the SCM. A well-defined primary nitrite maximum was associated with the SCM in the southwest Canadian Arctic, but not in the northeast where nitrite concentrations were highest much below the euphotic zone. This contrast is consistent with differences in vertical stratification, the light-dark cycle and, possibly, the physiological state and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community at the SCM. This study demonstrates that the SCM, once regarded as anecdotal due to under-sampling, are a dominant feature of the Arctic Ocean that should be considered in remote sensing studies and biogeochemical models.

The input to 0C4v4 was Rrs measured in situ or modeled from water's inherent optical properties (2001-2007). At open ocean stations, backscattering and absorption coefficients were correlated with chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.31-0.51, respectively), in agreement with models for Case 1 waters. Taking spectrofluorometric measurement as reference, the 0C4v4 model leads to an average underestimation of 33% of the chlorophyll concentration. For the lagoon waters, 0C4v4 performed inadequately because the backscattering coefficient, highly correlated with turbidity and suspended matter (R2 = 0.98), was poorly correlated to chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.42). The 0C4v4 performance was better in deep lagoon waters for stations with a TOT index (Tchla x depth/turbidity) higher than 19 mg M-2 NTU-1 (R-2 = 0.974, bias = 10.2%). Global Imager Rrs provided a good estimate of Tchla (R-2 = 0.79, N = 28) in the deeper part of the lagoon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The erosion process is spatially characterized on the west coast of New Caledonia to assess potential sediment inputs in the marine area. This paper describes the methodologies that are used to map soil sensitivity to erosion using remote sensing and a geographic information system tool. A cognitive approach, multi-criteria evaluation model and Universal Soil Loss Equation are implemented. This article compares the relevance of each model in order to spatialize and quantify potential erosion at catchment basin scale. These types of studies provide valuable results for focusing on areas subject to erosion and serve as a decision-making tool for the minimization of lagoon vulnerability to the natural and human dynamics on the level of the catchment basins.

Characterizing the diversity of coral reef habitats and fish communities found in a UNESCO World Heritage Site: The strategy developed for Lagoons of New Caledonia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Since 1972, the UNESCO "World Heritage Convention" offers an international canvas for conservation and management that targets areas of high cultural and environmental significance. To support the designation of areas within the 36.000 km(2) of New Caledonia coral reefs and lagoons as a World Heritage Site, the natural value and diversity of the proposed zones needed to be demonstrated. To exhaustively identify each configuration of shallow habitats, high resolution remote sensing images were used to select the sampling sites. This optimal scheme resulted in the selection of nearly 1300 sampling sites, and was then simplified to render its application realistic. In the final sampling plan, only the most common or the most remarkable coral zones were selected. Following this selection, in situ habitat and fish surveys were conducted in 2006-2008 in five large areas spanning a 600 km-long latitudinal gradient. Habitats were described using line-intercept transects in parallel with underwater visual census of indicator and commercial coral reef fish species. We report here on the results achieved in terms of: (i) the actual diversity of coral habitats captured by the remote sensing based sampling strategy, (ii) the different reef fish communities captured from the different sites, and (iii) how well they represent New Caledonia diversity. We discuss the possible generalization of this scheme to other sites, in the context of World Heritage Site selection and for other large-scale conservation planning activities.

Remote sensing of sand distribution patterns across an insular shelf: Oahu, Hawaii	MARINE GEOLOGY												Sandy substrate is important as a resource, habitat, and dynamic region of the bathymetry. We find that sand storage across the insular shelf of Oahu, Hawaii is controlled most strongly by general insular shelf morphology and to a lesser degree by hydrodynamic energy. Shelf sand is predominantly found in water depths less than or crossing the 10 m contour. We use remote sensing to identify and classify 14,037 individual sand deposits in nine study regions. A supervised classification algorithm aggregates these into five classes with 14 subclasses. Almost 63% of all sandy surface area falls into two subclasses of the Channels and Connected Fields class, 1) Major Channels and 2) Unchannelized Drainage. These subclasses connect regions of sediment production to regions of sediment storage on the insular shelf surface. This study is the first to quantitatively analyze and classify shelf sand deposits, in a high volcanic island coral reef setting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Three AERONET-OC European coastal sites exhibiting different atmospheric and marine optical properties were considered for the study: the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) in the northern Adriatic Sea representing Case-1 and Case-2 moderately sediment dominated waters; and, the Gustaf Dalen Lighthouse Tower (GDLT) in the northern Baltic Proper and the Helsinki Lighthouse Tower (HLT) in the Gulf of Finland, both characterized by Case-2 waters dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The analysis of MODIS derived normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm, L-WN(551), has shown relatively good results for all sites with uncertainties of the order of 10% and biases ranging from -1 to -4%. Larger uncertainty and bias have been observed at 443 nm for the AAOT (i.e., 18 and -7%, respectively). At the same center wavelength, results for GDLT and HLT have exhibited much larger uncertainties (i.e., 56 and 67%, respectively) and biases (i.e., 18 and 25%, respectively), which undermine the possibility of presently using remote sensing L-WN data at the blue center wavelengths for bio-optical investigations in the Baltic Sea. An evaluation of satellite derived aerosol optical thickness, tau(a), has shown uncertainties and biases of the order of tens of percent increasing with wavelength at all sites. Specifically, MODIS derived tau(a) at 869 rim, has shown an overestimate of 71% at the AAOT, 101% at GDLT and 91% at HLT, respectively. This result highlights the effects of a limited number of aerosol models for the atmospheric correction process, and might also indicate the need of applying a vicarious calibration factor to the remote sensing data at the 869 nm center wavelength to remove the effects of uncertainties in the atmospheric optical model and the space sensor radiometric calibration. Similar results have been obtained from the analysis of SeaWiFS data. Finally, in view of illustrating the possibility of increasing the accuracy of satellite regional radiometric products, AERONET-OC data have been applied to reduce systematic errors in MODIS and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) L-WN data likely due to the atmospheric correction process. Results relying on MODIS match-ups for the Baltic Sites (i.e., GDLT and HLT) and MERIS matchups for the AAOT, have indicated a substantial reduction of both uncertainty and bias in the blue and red center wavelengths.

It is possible to augment sparse depth soundings with dense satellite-derived gravity data to provide additional bathymetric detail in regions devoid of sounding data. We demonstrate this method by using marine gravity derived from the European Remote Sensing (ERS-1) satellite altimeter, combined with depth soundings, to form a bathymetric prediction of the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica. We estimate the root mean square error of depth estimates at unsurveyed locations in our solution to be similar to 120 m. We use a Monte Carlo method to assess the value of gravity as a bathymetric predictor in sparsely surveyed regions by comparing our solution to predictions formed from depth soundings alone. When less than similar to 11% of 10-km grid cells contain depth soundings, inclusion of gravity data improves the depth accuracy of the solution by up to 17%, as compared to a minimum curvature surface interpolation of the depth soundings alone. When depth data are sparse, our gravity-derived prediction reveals additional short-wavelength bathymetric features, such as troughs on the continental shelf, which are not resolved by interpolations of the depth soundings alone.

Seabed habitat mapping techniques: an overview of the performance of various systems	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												Seabed mapping has become vital for effective management of marine resources. An important role in moving towards ecosystem based management is played by the defining and understanding of the relationships among marine habitat characteristics, species distribution and human activities. Mapping seabed characteristics by means of remote acoustic sensing, using seabed seismic profiling, sidescan sonar, or echo-sounder based classification systems, is becoming of increasing importance. This paper gives a brief overview, of existing marine habitat mapping technologies and their recent developments. In single-beam echo-sounders, using multiple frequencies will be useful in classifying the seabed. It must be observed that the resolution of a sidescan sonar with narrower along-track beam width and higher range sampling rates will be better than a multi-beam echo-sounder, although the specifications of the newer systems are much improved. Airborne LIDAR bathymetry is very useful for shallow water seabed mapping, particularly in challenging rocky areas vulnerable for ship-based mapping operations. Seabed maps are essential in any case for siting of bottom mounted energy devices. The utmost care should be taken at all stages of the classification process, such as input data, control of interfering factors, seabed acoustic attributes, classification methods and ground-truth observations. The results of seabed mapping depend mostly on instrument stability, settings, algorithms adopted, environmental factors and survey methods.

Agricultural and environmental information systems: the integrating role of area samples	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												This article aims to be a contribution to the improvement of agricultural and environmental official statistics. Methods are applied to integrate information from state agency registers regarding crop area with ground data observed in random area samples. To improve the precision of crop area estimates in small areas (municipalities), methods using ground survey and remote sensing are applied. To improve temporal resolution of crop area estimators, methods based on time series analysis are applied. Agro-meteorological models are applied to improve crop yields statistics. A method is shown whereby crop rotation models may be a useful tool to forecast changes in the dynamics of the use of natural resources (soil, water and air) by agriculture and to foresee their environmental impact. Finally, a method to update and disaggregate information from territorial censuses on land uses is applied. These methods and models are illustrated in the framework of an information system belonging to the Spanish Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs. The relative improvement offered by each method is assessed by evaluating the precision gain of the proposed crop area estimates versus those currently used by the aforementioned information system.

Therefore, a laboratory experiment was developed, using microcosms mimicking a marine intertidal water-sediment interface to test the influence of Corophium volutator densities on sediment properties. Three main variables (water content, clay content, and mean grain size) were measured in three treatments (no Corophium, 5,000 Corophium per square meter, and 20,000 Corophium per square meter) after 16 days of bioturbation. Results obtained with conventional-destructive-techniques showed a significant increase of water content and a significant, but small decrease of clay content in the presence of Corophium. The remote sensing technique detected the impact of Corophium on water content as an increase in absorption at 1,450 nm, but was not able to detect the animal impact on clay content. This study demonstrates that remote sensing data could be significantly modified by bioturbation activities and that remote sensing can be applied in the laboratory to address the impact of bioturbation on sediment properties. This possibly opens new perspectives for long-term experiments concerning the role of bioturbation on sedimentary processes.

Surface Signature of the Chesapeake Bay Outflow Variability Observed with Coastal Radar	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The present work is an observational analysis of the small-scale variations induced by Chesapeake Bay outflow on coastal surface circulation off Virginia. The variation in freshwater discharge into Chesapeake Bay is investigated as a triggering mechanism for local coastal jets. While it is known that an extra amount of freshwater received from the tributaries will lead to an increased total outflow, the effect on the outflow surface signature (the upper meter) has not been extensively explored. Our analysis is based on surface currents, wind data, and freshwater discharge records. The surface currents were derived from two high-frequency Doppler radars deployed on the Virginia coast during September and October 1996 and 1997. The wind data were obtained from a nearby weather Coastal-Marine Automated Network station, and the freshwater discharge data were from the U.S. Geological Survey stations located at the mouth of each tributary. The freshwater discharge into the bay observed during 1996 decreased from 4200 to 1000 m(3)/s in 10 days, while for the 1997 period it varied between 500 and 5500 m(3)/s in 1 week. The present analysis shows that sudden variations of freshwater flux will drive the plume further offshore before its normal southward turning, in the same way upwelling-favorable winds do as reported in all the available literature of the area. Strong freshwater variations on weekly scales are then shown to be an important factor in deter-mining the extent of the surface plume displacement and the fate of the shelf currents or jets.

J	Klemas, VV				Klemas, Victor V.			The Role of Remote Sensing in Predicting and Determining Coastal Storm Impacts	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Storm-induced flooding and other damage present a major problem as the coastal population continues to increase rapidly and sea level keeps rising. To predict the path and landfall of a hurricane or other coastal storm and assess the damage, emergency managers and scientists need continuous information on the storm's path, strength, predicted landfall, and expected damage over large areas. Satellite and airborne remote sensors can provide the required information in a timely and reliable way, as demonstrated by a case study of hurricane Katrina's impact on New Orleans and surrounding areas. Satellite images and hurricane hunter planes were used to track hurricane Katrina, with modelers predicting accurately its path, strength, surge level, and landfall location. Shore-based radars were used to confirm the data as the hurricane approached land. Medium- and high-resolution satellite sensors, helicopters, and aircraft were employed to assess damage to the city, including transportation, power, and communication infrastructures, and to adjacent wetlands and other coastal ecosystems. The lessons learned from hurricane Katrina are helping to optimize future approaches for tracking hurricanes and predicting their impact on coastal ecosystems and developed areas.																	0749-0208					NOV	2009	25	6					1264	1275		10.2112/08-1146.1								WOS:000272113700008

It is therefore still unclear how light climate shapes spatio-temporal patterns in near-coast chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. In order to identify an effective representation of light extinction due to suspended particulate matter (SPM) in ecosystem models, we integrate different formulations of light attenuation into a coupled physical-biological model of the German Bight. The model describes Chl-a as well as phytoplankton-zooplankton interactions and calculates physical transport using the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). Parameters of the ecosystem module were calibrated using a OD setup constrained by available measurements at Helgoland Roads. The comparison between data and simulations shows that the model, despite its simplicity, is capable of reproducing the development of the spring bloom in 2003. We propose a novel application that uses MERIS-derived spatial data to constrain the parameterisation of light extinction and compare different scenarios of light attenuation as determined by phytoplankton self-shading, yellow substances and SPM dynamics. our work highlights the sensitivity of calculated autotrophic growth to water depth, salinity fronts and sediment transport. We found that the accuracy of SPM-forcing is only critical at the onset of the bloom. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Challenges and solutions of remote sensing at offshore wind energy developments	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Radar is becoming an important tool used to gather data on bird and bat activity at proposed and existing land-based wind energy sites. Radar will likely play an even more important role at the increasing development of wind energy offshore, given both the lack of knowledge about bird and bat activity offshore and the increased difficultly in obtaining offshore information. Most radar studies to date have used off-the-shelf or modified marine radars. However, there are several issues that continue to hinder the potential usefulness of radar at wind energy sites, with offshore sites providing a particular suite of challenges. We identify these challenges along with current or developing solutions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A comprehensive set of optical data was collected during three cruises in June, August, and September 2005 in the Bohai Sea. The vertical profile measurements, such as chlorophyll concentration, water turbidity, downwelling irradiance, and diffuse attenuation coefficient, showed that the Bohai Sea was vertically stratified with a relative clear upper layer superimposed on a turbid lower layer. The upper layer was found to correspond to the euphotic zone and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) occurs at the base of this layer. By tuning a semi-analytical model (Lee et al., 1998, 1999) for the Bohai Sea, we developed a method to derive water inherent optical properties and the depth of DCM from above-surface measurements. Assuming a 'fake' bottom in the stratified water, this new method retrieves the 'fake' bottom depth, which is highly correlated with the DCM depth. The average relative error between derived and measured values is 33.9% for phytoplankton absorption at 440 nm, 25.6% for colored detrital matter (detritus plus gelbstoff) absorption at 440 nm, and 24.2% for the DCM depth. This modified method can retrieve water inherent optical properties and monitor the depth of DCM in the Bohai Sea, and the method is also applicable to other stratified waters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An oceanic cyclonic eddy on the lee side of Lanai Island, Hawai'i	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A young cold core cyclonic eddy displaying a significant increase in surface chlorophyll was observed offshore Lanai Island, Hawai'i, where the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) is located. During one of its deployments, MOBY broke free from its mooring. In the course of its 3-day free drifting period, MOBY followed a cyclonic eddy, which is manifested by satellite remote sensing data, chlorophyll data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and sea surface temperature (SST) from a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The time series of the SST show that the cold core eddy was in a formative stage. It existed as a stand-alone eddy for about 9 days before it merged with cold water south of Oahu Island. A high-resolution numerical model simulation reproduces similar eddies in terms of location, size, and intensity. An eddy detection algorithm is described and applied to locate and track the modeled eddies. The results demonstrate that mesoscale and submesoscale eddies are frequently generated on and pass through the lee side of Lanai Island and the statistical analysis quantifies the general features of eddies in the area.

Nyoman; Saitoh, Sei-Ichi			Biophysical models for Japanese scallop, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, aquaculture site selection in Funka Bay, Hokkaido, Japan, using remotely sensed data and geographic information system	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												Scallop aquaculture has grown to become the most successful marine shellfish farming venture in Japan. To ensure long-term sustainability of scallop production, suitable sites need to be selected. This study was conducted to identify the most suitable sites for hanging culture of Japanese scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) based on measured biophysical parameters and modeled using geographic information system (GIS) models. Four biophysical parameters that influence Japanese scallop aquaculture in Funka Bay were selected: sea temperature, food availability (chlorophyll-a), suspended solid, and bathymetry. The SeaWiFS and MODIS images were used to extract most of these parameters. A series of GIS models was developed to identify suitable sites for scallop culture using a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) known as weighted linear combination. Suitability scores were ranked on a scale from 1 (least suitable) to 8 (most suitable), and about 83% of the total potential area with bottom depths less than 60 m had scores of 7 and 8. The final model outputs were compared with field verification data and found to be consistent. Local sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model output. Based on this analysis, the order of importance of the variables affecting the model was as follows: suspended solid > chlorophyll-a > sea temperature.

Atmospheric composition change: Ecosystems-Atmosphere interactions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Ecosystems and the atmosphere: This review describes the state of understanding the processes involved in the exchange of trace gases and aerosols between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. The gases covered include NO, NO2, HONO, HNO3, NH3, SO2, DMS, Biogenic VOC, O-3, CH4, N2O and particles in the size range 1 nm-10 mu m including organic and inorganic chemical species. The main focus of the review is on the exchange between terrestrial ecosystems, both managed and natural and the atmosphere, although some new developments in ocean-atmosphere exchange are included. The material presented is biased towards the last decade, but includes earlier work, where more recent developments are limited or absent. New methodologies and instrumentation have enabled, if not driven technical advances in measurement. These developments have advanced the process understanding and upscaling of fluxes, especially for particles, VOC and NH3. Examples of these applications include mass spectrometric methods, such as Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (AMS) adapted for field measurement of atmosphere-surface fluxes using micrometeorological methods for chemically resolved aerosols. Also briefly described are some advances in theory and techniques in micrometeorology. For some of the compounds there have been paradigm shifts in approach and application of both techniques and assessment. These include flux measurements over marine surfaces and urban areas using micrometeorological methods and the up-scaling of flux measurements using aircraft and satellite remote sensing. The application of a flux-based approach in assessment of O-3 effects on vegetation at regional scales is an important policy linked development secured through improved quantification of fluxes. The coupling of monitoring, modelling and intensive flux measurement at a continental scale within the NitroEurope network represents a quantum development in the application of research teams to address the underpinning science of reactive nitrogen in the cycling between ecosystems and the atmosphere in Europe. Some important developments of the science have been applied to assist in addressing policy questions, which have been the main driver of the research agenda, while other developments in understanding have not been applied to their wider field especially in chemistry-transport models through deficiencies in obtaining appropriate data to enable application or inertia within the modelling community. The paper identifies applications, gaps and research questions that have remained intractable at least since 2000 within the specialized sections of the paper, and where possible these have been focussed on research questions for the coming decade.

The fluorescence lidar technique for the remote sensing of photoautotrophic biodeteriogens in the outdoor cultural heritage: A decade of in situ experiments	INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION												Fluorescence lidar is a non-invasive, remote sensing technique that makes it possible to extend the application of the laser-induced fluorescence technique to the outdoor environment where uncontrolled, external conditions must be met. Although initially developed for the investigation of marine environment and vegetation, in the past decade this technique has been successfully applied to the field of the cultural heritage. Among other applications, the detection and characterisation of photoautotrophic biodeteriogens has become very promising: the method is based on the detection of chlorophyll a fluorescence, while fluorescent accessory pigments can be exploited for a rough classification of the biodeteriogens present on the surface. Early experiments on monuments date back to the mid 1990s, when fluorescence lidar point measurements were conducted on the Cathedral and Baptistery of Parma, Italy. Subsequently, the technique has taken further advantage of the introduction of imaging capabilities in lidar instrumentation and this has led to the acquisition of hyperspectral fluorescence maps over extended areas of several monuments from distances as great as 80 m. Here, we present the main achievements obtained in the outdoor cultural heritage so far and the latest developments in the technique. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bradley			An improved procedure for detection and enumeration of walrus signatures in airborne thermal imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In recent years, application of remote sensing to marine mammal surveys has been a promising area of investigation for wildlife managers and researchers. In April 2006, the United States and Russia conducted an aerial survey of Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) using thermal infrared sensors to detect groups of animals resting on pack ice in the Bering Sea. The goal of this survey was to estimate the size of the Pacific walrus population. An initial analysis of the U.S. data using previously-established methods resulted in lower detectability of walrus groups in the imagery and higher variability in calibration models than was expected based on pilot studies. This paper describes an improved procedure for detection and enumeration of walrus groups in airborne thermal imagery. Thermal images were first subdivided into smaller 200 x 200 pixel "tiles." We calculated three statistics to represent characteristics of walrus signatures from the temperature histogram for each the. Tiles that exhibited one or more of these characteristics were examined further to determine if walrus signatures were present. We used cluster analysis on tiles that contained walrus signatures to determine which pixels belonged to each group. We then calculated a thermal index value for each walrus group in the imagery and used generalized linear models to estimate detection functions (the probability of a group having a positive index value) and calibration functions (the size of a group as a function of its index value) based on counts from matched digital aerial photographs. The new method described here improved our ability to detect walrus groups at both 2 m and 4 m spatial resolution. In addition, the resulting calibration models have lower variance than the original method. We anticipate that the use of this new procedure will greatly improve the quality of the population estimate derived from these data. This procedure may also have broader applicability to thermal infrared surveys of other wildlife species. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Radiative transfer theory applied to ocean bottom modeling	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Research on the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean bottom sediment is of interest for active sonar applications such as target detection and remote sensing. The interaction of acoustic energy with the sea floor sublayers is usually modeled with techniques based on the full solution of the wave equation, which sometimes leads to mathematically intractable problems. An alternative way to model wave propagation in layered media containing random scatterers is the radiative transfer (RT) formulation, which is a well established technique in the electromagnetics community and is based on the principle of conservation of energy. In this paper, the RT equation is used to model the backscattering of acoustic energy from a layered elastic bottom sediment containing distributions of independent scatterers due to a constant single frequency excitation in the water column. It is shown that the RT formulation provides insight into the physical phenomena of scattering and conversion of energy between waves of different polarizations.

To see in different seas: spatial variation in the rhodopsin gene of the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Aquatic organisms living in a range of photic environments require specific mechanisms to tune their visual pigments. Maximum absorbance (lambda(max)) of retinal rods in populations of the marine demersal sand goby, (Pomatoschistus minutus; Gobiidae, Teleostei) correlates with the local optic environment. It has been shown that this is not regulated through a physiological response by exchanging the rhodopsin chromophore. To test for evolutionary adaptation, the sequence of the rhodopsin (RH1) gene was analysed in 165 Pomatoschistus minutus individuals from seven populations across its distribution range. Analysis showed a high level of intraspecific polymorphism at the RH1 gene, including nonsynonymous mutations on amino acids, known as spectral tuning sites. Population differentiation at these sites was in agreement with the observed differentiation in lambda(max) values. Analyses of d(N)/d(S) substitution rate ratios and likelihood ratio tests under site-specific models detected a significant signal of positive Darwinian selection on the RH1 gene. A strong discrepancy in differentiation was noticed between RH1 gene variation and the presumably neutral microsatellites and mitochondrial data. Samples did not cluster according to geographical or historical proximity with regards to RH1, but according to the general photic conditions of the habitat environment of the sand goby. This study highlights the usefulness of sensory genes, like rhodopsin, for studying the characteristics of local adaptation in marine nonmodel organisms.

Monte Carlo Based simulations show that a water entrained bubble cloud generate a characteristic backscatter of incident laser light [M. Xia, J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 8, 350 (2006)]. This characteristic can be used to detect and localize bubble clouds, leading to wide ranging applications, especially in optical remote sensing. This paper describes tests of an underwater lidar system applied to detecting cloud of micro-bubbles. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that the system is capable of detecting bubbles ranging from diameter 10 mu m similar to 200 mu m, over a distance of 7-12m from the detector. The dependence of the lidar return signal on size distribution of bubbles, concentration, thickness and location of bubble clouds is studied and compared with simulation results.

It comprises an old fan sequence of inferred Miocene to Pliocene age termed Barzaman Formation, diagenetically highly altered to dolomitic clays, and a thin veneer of weakly cemented Quaternary gravels. A combination of remote sensing, lithological analyses and luminescence dating is used to interpret the complex aggradation history of the Quaternary alluvial fans from the interior of Oman in the context of independent regional climate records. From satellite imagery and clast analysis four fans can be discerned in the study area. While two early periods of fan formation are tentatively correlated to the Miocene-Pliocene and the Early Pleistocene, luminescence dating allows the distinction of five phases of fan aggradation during the Middle-Late Pleistocene. These phases are correlated with pluvial periods from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 through 3, when southern Arabia was affected by monsoonal precipitation. It is concluded that the aggradation of the alluvial fans was triggered by the interplay of increased sediment production during and periods and high rainfall with enhanced erosion of hillslopes and transport rates during strong monsoon phases. However, the lack of fine-grained sediments, bioturbation and organic material implies that although the Quaternary fans are sourced by monsoonal rains they formed in a semi-arid environment Thus, it appears that, in contrast to the Oman Mountains, the interior was not directly affected by monsoonal precipitation.

In this habitat mapping study, multibeam echosounder (MBES) data are integrated with precisely geo-referenced video ground-truth data to quantify benthic biotic communities at Cape Nelson, Victoria, Australia. Using an automated decision tree classification approach, 5 representative biotic groups defined from video analysis were related to hydro-acoustically derived variables in the Cape Nelson survey area. Using a combination of multibeam bathymetry, backscatter and derivative products produced highest overall accuracy (87%) and kappa statistic (0.83). This study demonstrates that decision tree classifiers are capable of integrating variable data types for mapping distributions of benthic biological assemblages, which are important in maintaining biodiversity and other system services in the marine environment.

We describe how approaches to knowledge in Roviana differ from prevailing models of knowledge that distinguish between cognitive aspects and other modalities of knowing. For many Roviana fishers, ecological knowledge is not analytically separated from the changing contexts of everyday activities such as navigating and fishing. Inspired by Roviana epistemologies, we argue that a practice-oriented approach provides a more sympathetic and informative theoretical framework for understanding knowledge and its role in contemporary marine-resource conservation efforts. The theoretical and methodological implications of the perspective are illustrated with examples from an ongoing marine conservation project in the western Solomon Islands that integrates indigenous knowledge, remote-sensing techniques, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies.																	0002-7294	1548-1433				SEP	2009	111	3					317	329		10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01135.x								WOS:000269490800005						
J	Ohde, T				Ohde, Thomas			Investigation of hydrogen sulphide eruptions along the Namibian coastline using different remote sensing systems	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Hydrogen sulphide eruptions with their typical turquoise discolorations at the water surface are a unique phenomenon along the Namibian coastline. The remote sensing techniques of ocean colour sensors and microwave scatterometers were used for the investigation of such events. The studies with ocean colour sensors showed that the turquoise discolorations near the Namibian coast were neither linked to dust deposition into the water column by desert storms nor to the reflection of bright material in shallow water areas. In addition, other coloured marine events like algae blooms and river outflows were differentiable from the hydrogen sulphide eruptions by their special optical properties. Quasi-true colour images and spectral identification methods were utilised to monitor and investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of sulphide events. In the past years, they were sometimes and locally limited discovered. Newest remote sensing observations including our own investigations have established that the occurrence of sulphide events is more frequent and longer lasting. The north-westerly direction of propagation and their velocity between 12 cm s(-1) and 15 cm s(-1) were derived from an event on 14 April 2004. Lastly, the microwave scatterometer remote sensing was applied to investigate the relation of sulphide events to oceanographic conditions. The events from May 2004 were clearly related to strong coastal upwelling.

A reappraisal of the diversity of geomorphological and genetic processes of New Caledonian coral reefs: a synthesis from optical remote sensing, coring and acoustic multibeam observations	CORAL REEFS												The diversity of oceanic and continental reef structures of New Caledonia is reviewed, taking into account their geological history and in particular, that since the last interglacial period. To guide this review, a new path is provided by following the diversity of units that have been mapped and characterized using high spatial resolution optical remote sensing data for the main New Caledonian coral reef complexes (banks, atolls, uplifted reefs, drowned reefs, fringing reefs, barrier reefs, patch reefs) and their individual reef-forming units. This interpretation, based on geomorphology, depth, and exposure has provided 161 unit types distributed across 4,537 km(2) of reef area and 31,336 km(2) of non-reef area. In addition to shallow reefs (0-30 m) described by optical remote sensing, the bathymetry of deep slopes between -20 to -1,000 m were recently mapped using multibeam acoustic data providing additional data to explain the morphological diversity. With the detailed three-dimensional topographic information acquired, hitherto unrecognized marine terraces and faulting became visible, indicating different episodes of formation of the barrier reef and of sea level variations. Finally, dating and coring corals provided a more accurate understanding of the genesis of the present reef structures. In contrast with the synoptic remote sensing data, cores provided only point data, but allowed the addition of a precise temporal dimension to the description of New Caledonian reefs. Cores provided a significant body of the information necessary for the establishment of models of reef settlement and development during the last interglacial ages in the New Caledonian region. The combined examination of the different sources of data, and the exhaustive description of remotely sensed reef units, allow a qualitative synoptic parallel to be drawn between the morphology of modern reefs and the contrasting patterns of reef growth, subsidence, and uplift rates occurring around New Caledonia.

Modeling marine protected areas for threatened eiders in a climatically changing Bering Sea	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Delineating protected areas for sensitive species is a growing challenge as changing climate alters the geographic pattern of habitats as well as human responses to those shifts. When human impacts are expected within projected ranges of threatened species, there is often demand to demarcate the minimum habitat required to ensure the species' persistence. Because diminished or wide-ranging populations may not occupy all viable (and needed) habitat at once, one must identify thresholds of resources that will support the species even in unoccupied areas. Long-term data on the shifting mosaic of critical resources may indicate ranges of future variability. We addressed these issues for the Spectacled Eider (Somateria fischeri), a federally threatened species that winters in pack ice of the Bering Sea. Changing climate has decreased ice cover and severely reduced the eiders' benthic prey and has increased prospects for expansion of bottom trawling that may further affect prey communities. To assess long-term changes in habitats that will support eiders, we linked data on benthic prey, sea ice, and weather from 1970 to 2001 with a spatially explicit simulation model of eider energy balance that integrated field, laboratory, and remote-sensing studies. Areas estimated to have prey densities adequate for eiders in 1970-1974 did not include most areas that were viable 20 years later (1993-1994). Unless the entire area with adequate prey in 1993-1994 had been protected, the much reduced viable area in 1999-2001 might well have been excluded. During long non-foraging periods (as at night), eiders can save much energy by resting on ice vs. floating on water; thus, loss of ice cover in the future might substantially decrease the area in which prey densities are adequate to offset the eiders' energy needs. For wide-ranging benthivores such as eiders, our results emphasize that fixed protected areas based on current conditions can be too small or inflexible to subsume long-term shifts in habitat conditions. Better knowledge of patterns of natural disturbance experienced by prey communities, and appropriate allocation of human disturbance over seasons or years, may yield alternative strategies to large-scale closures that may be politically and economically problematic.

Land Use Dynamics in a Marine Protected Area System in Lower Andaman Coast of Thailand, 1990-2005	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study has depicted a scenario on assessing spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in and adjacent to marine protected areas (MPA) in a study site in Thailand. The measurement of landscape stability and its implications for protection and conservation of coastal resources are emphasized in this study. The methods employed include interpretation and analysis of satellite images, aerial photographs, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Image analysis and GIS techniques have been used extensively, and a site-specific geospatial database was developed accordingly. Initial temporal changes inside and outside protected areas are captured from visual interpretation of three time series satellite images, where an increase of aquaculture ponds and abandoned areas is clearly visible. The output changes derived from the image differencing techniques demonstrated considerable changes in the whole study area as well as inside the protected area boundary during 1976 to 1990. Compared to the earlier time (1976-1990) the changes during 1990 to 2005 are found to be less extensive. Although the existing marine protected areas were declared earlier than the 1990s, the changes are still found inside the protected area boundary during 1990-2005. The result shows significant increases in agriculture areas, including aquaculture development, which are, however, less inside the protected areas than the buffer areas. While mangrove areas have noticeable negative changes, an increase in Malalueca forest areas is interesting. In the discussion, a quantitative comparison of legislative boundary and buffer effects on protecting land use and land cover is illustrated. In light of existing ecological context and socioeconomic activities, observations are made on agents of change and resource use conflicts.																	0749-0208					SEP	2009	25	5					1082	1095		10.2112/08-1058.1								WOS:000270369500002

Seasonal distribution of chlorophyll on mudflats in New South Wales, Australia measured by field spectrometry and PAM fluorometry	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Variability of chlorophyll (as an index of micro-algal abundance) between warm and cool seasons at different heights on (distances across) the shore was investigated on intertidal mudflats in warm-temperate Australia. Chlorophyll was measured using ratios of reflectances from field spectrometry and minimal fluorescence (F(0)) from PAM fluorometry to compare patterns obtained using these two methods. A single sampling period comprised 2 days of sampling, one for each mudflat, with 2 sampling periods nested within each month, 2 months within each of a cool and warm season in each of 2 years. Large differences in amounts of chlorophyll were found between the two mudflats, although spatial and temporal patterns of variation were generally similar. There were greater amounts of chlorophyll in the cooler months than in the warmer months in each location in each year, which contrasts with many of the patterns reported from elsewhere. There was more chlorophyll on the upper than on the lower shore and the increases from summer to winter were generally greater at the higher levels. Large variation in chlorophyll from week to week within each month demonstrated the need for adequate replication in studies of seasonal patterns of variability. Measurements made by a field spectrometer and a PAM fluorometer were largely consistent, but, at certain times, they showed an opposite pattern. The reasons for these differences were investigated further by looking at differences in other pigments, but the different results from the two methods could not to be explained by changes in composition of the micro-algal assemblage and, as yet, remain unexplained.

This study provides a proof of concept for mapping of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid coastal waters from geostationary platforms with the existing SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) meteorological sensor on the METEOSAT Second Generation platform. Data are available in near real time every 15 minutes. SEVIRI lacks sufficient bands for chlorophyll remote sensing but its spectral resolution is sufficient for quantification of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid waters, using a single broad red band, combined with a suitable near infrared band. A test data set for mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea was obtained covering 35 consecutive days from June 28 until July 31 2006. Atmospheric correction of SEVIRI images includes corrections for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering, absorption by atmospheric gases and atmospheric transmittances. The aerosol correction uses assumptions on the ratio of marine reflectances and aerosol reflectances in the red and near-infrared bands. A single band TSM retrieval algorithm, calibrated by non-linear regression of seaborne measurements of TSM and marine reflectance was applied. The effect of the above assumptions on the uncertainty of the marine reflectance and TSM products was analysed. Results show that (1) mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea is feasible with SEVIRI for turbid waters, though with considerable uncertainties in clearer waters, (2) TSM maps are well correlated with TSM maps obtained from MODIS AQUA and (3) during cloud-free days, high frequency dynamics of TSM are detected.

The layout, optics and software for the instrument control are described. Measurements of the mercury low-pressure lamp lines from 200 to 600 nm show the high performances of the spectrometer. Laboratory measurements of OH and NO(2) spectrums demonstrate that the system could be used for cross-section measurements and to detect these species in the atmosphere. The first atmospheric application of the system was the observation of direct solar and sky spectrums that shows a filling-in of the sky lines due to rotational Raman scattering. The measurements have been done with clear and cloudy sky and in both there was a strong dependence of the filling-in from the solar zenith angle whereas no dependence from the wavelengths was evident at low solar zenith angles (less than 85 degrees).

Estimation of global zooplankton biomass from satellite ocean colour	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												A changing Earth System requires knowledge on a global scale. The only way of obtaining detailed information at these scales is by using satellite remote sensing and/or modeling. In the marine environment, information on primary production (PP) is derivable from satellite data, whereas datasets of higher trophic levels are sparse. The challenge is to combine these two sources. A model relating the flow of energy from PP to zooplankton biomass, was used to address this problem. The model was parameterised with PP from the SeaWiFS satellite ocean colour record and a subset of a global dataset of zooplankton biomass. The model was then validated with the remaining zooplankton data. The model was used to: produce a map of annual global, zooplankton biomass, quantify the flow of carbon from PP to zooplankton and investigate the spatial variability of this flow. One of the more notable findings is that more energy is transferred to zooplankton when PP is low. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Light scattering by particles suspended in the sea: The role of particle size and density	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Optical scattering and particle size measurements are reported at 78 stations along the south and west coast of Britain. The composition of the particles is mainly mineral (70% by mass on average) and the light scattering per unit concentration of suspended particles, the specific scattering coefficient, was observed to vary by over an order of magnitude, from less than 0.1 to over 1 m(2) g(-1). More than 3/4 of this variance is explained by changes in the apparent density (dry weight/'wet' volume) and mean size of the particles. For this data set, the specific scattering coefficient can be written b*(M) = (2.35/rho D-A) where b*(M) is the scattering coefficient per unit concentration of mineral particles, rho the apparent density and D-A the mean particle diameter by area. The standard error of the numerator in this equation is 0.08. In fact, most (64%) of the variance in b*(M) is explained by differences in the apparent density of the particles, with variations in particle diameter alone accounting for only 15% of the variance. Because particles in coastal waters flocculate into aggregates containing mineral and organic material as well as water, the apparent density of the particles is variable and considerably less than solid mineral material. Provided a suitable atmospheric correction for visible-band imagery over shelf seas can be applied, it may be possible to estimate b* using satellite remote-sensing measurements of reflectance at two wavelengths. This work has shown that maps of b* produced in this way will be sensitive to variations in near-surface particle density as well as size. It may, however, be possible to use site-specific empirical relationships between particle size and density to derive both of these parameters from space. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An important part of the delta ecosystem is the riparian corridor, which is supported by agricultural return flows and waste spills of water originating in the U.S. and Mexico. These flows may be curtailed in the future due to climate change and changing land use practices (out-of-basin water transfers, increased agricultural efficiency, and more optimal management of dams) in the U.S. and Mexico, and resource managers need to monitor the effects of their water management practices on these ecosystems. We developed ground-validated, remote sensing methods to monitor the vegetation status, habitat value, and water use of wetland and riparian ecosystems using multi-temporal, multi-resolution images. The integrated methodology allowed us to project species composition, leaf area index, fractional cover, habitat value, and evapotranspiration over seasons and years throughout the delta, in response to variable water flows from the U.S. to Mexico. Waste spills of water from the U.S. have regenerated native cottonwood and willow trees in the riparian corridor and created backwater and marsh areas that support birds and other wildlife. However, the main source of water supporting the riparian vegetation is the regional aquifer recharged by underflow from U.S. and Mexico irrigation districts. Native trees have a short half-life in the riparian zone due to human-set fires and harvesting for timber. Active management, monitoring, and restoration programs are needed to maintain the habitat value of this ecosystem for the future.

On the precipitation susceptibility of clouds to aerosol perturbations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Atmospheric aerosol particles act as cloud condensation nuclei, affording them the ability to influence cloud microphysics, planetary albedo, and precipitation. Models of varying complexity and satellite observations from NASA's A-Train constellation of satellites are used to determine what controls the precipitation susceptibility of warm clouds to aerosol perturbations. Three susceptibility regimes are identified: (i) clouds with low liquid water path (LWP) generate very little rain and are least susceptible to aerosol; (ii) clouds with intermediate LWP where aerosol most effectively suppress precipitation; and (iii) clouds with high LWP, where the susceptibility begins to decrease because the precipitation process is efficient owing to abundant liquid water. Remarkable qualitative agreement between remote sensing observations and model predictions provides the first suggestions that certain regions of the Earth might be more vulnerable to pollution aerosol. Targeted pollution control strategies in such regions would most benefit water availability via precipitation. Citation: Sorooshian, A., G. Feingold, M. D. Lebsock, H. Jiang, and G. L.

Analysis of cover change (1995-2005) of Tanzania/Mozambique trans-boundary mangroves using Landsat imagery	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					5th Western-Indian-Ocean-Marine-Science-Association Symposium (WIOMSA)	OCT 22-26, 2007	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA	Western Indian Ocean Marine Sci Assoc, Oceanog Res Inst				1. Despite the ecological, environmental, and economic importance of mangroves, they are declining at an alarming rate worldwide, mostly as a result of human activities. 2. Along the eastern African coast, Mozambique has the largest mangrove area. Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in the area, and people harvest mangrove vegetation for tannins, fuel wood, traditional medicine, boat-building, carpentry, and crafting. 3. Landsat 5 TM imagery was used to map the distribution of trans-boundary mangrove areas along the Mtwara-Quirimbas Complex. Results for 1995 and 2005 are presented for the entire coastline and in more detail for the Ruvuma estuary, Quiterajo, Ibo/Quirimba islands, and Pemba Bay. Results were validated with a ground-truthing excursion in 2006, showing an overall thematic accuracy of 73%. 4. Total estimated area of mangrove was 357 km(2) in 1995 and 368 km(2) in 2005, with the small net gain of 3% corresponding to a total gain of 32 km(2) and a total loss of 21 km(2) over this decade. 5. Results suggest that although Landsat TM imagery can be effective in mapping mangrove distribution, caution must be used in inferring its ecological condition.

A Comparison of Oceanic Precipitation Estimates in the Tropics and Subtropics	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												A number of Earth remote sensing satellites are currently carrying passive microwave radiometers. A variety of different retrieval algorithms are used to estimate surface rain rates over the ocean from the microwave radiances observed by the radiometers. This study compares several different satellite algorithms with each other and with independent data from rain gauges on ocean buoys. The rain gauge data are from buoys operated by the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. Potential errors and biases in the gauge data are evaluated. Satellite data are from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager and from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager instruments on the operational Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F13, F14, and F15 satellites. These data have been processed into rain-rate estimates by the NASA Precipitation Measurement Mission and by Remote Sensing Systems, Inc. Biases between the different datasets are estimated by computing differences between long-term time averages. Most of the satellite datasets agree with each other, and with the gauge data, to within 10% or less. The biases tend to be proportional to the mean rain rate, but the geographical patterns of bias vary depending on the choice of data source and algorithm. Some datasets, however, show biases as large as about 25%, so care should be taken when using these data for climatological studies.

J	Anderson, DM				Anderson, Donald M.			Approaches to monitoring, control and management of harmful algal blooms (HABs)	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT					East Asian Seas Conference 2006	2006	Haikou, PEOPLES R CHINA					Virtually every coastal country in the world is affected by harmful algal blooms (HABs, commonly called "red tides"). These phenomena are caused by blooms of microscopic algae. Some of these algae are toxic. and can lead to illness and death in humans, fish, seabirds, marine mammals, and other oceanic life, typically as a result of the transfer of toxins through the food web. Sometimes the direct release of toxic compounds can be lethal to marine animals. Non-toxic HABs cause damage to ecosystems, fisheries resources, and recreational facilities, often due to the sheer biomass of the accumulated algae. The term "HAB" also applies to non-toxic blooms of macroalgae (seaweeds), which can cause major ecological impacts such as the displacement of indigenous species, habitat alteration and oxygen depletion in bottom waters. Globally, the nature of the HAB problem has changed considerably over the last several decades. The number of toxic blooms, the resulting economic losses, the types of resources affected, and the number of toxins and toxic species have all increased dramatically. Some of this expansion has been attributed to storms, currents and other natural phenomena, but human activities are also frequently implicated. Humans have contributed by transporting toxic species in ballast water, and by adding massive and increasing quantities of industrial, agricultural and sewage effluents to coastal waters. In many urbanized coastal regions, these inputs have altered the size and composition of the nutrient pool which has, in turn, created a more favorable nutrient environment for certain HAB species. The steady expansion in the use of fertilizers for agricultural production represents a large and worrisome source of nutrients in coastal waters that promote some HABs. The diversity in HAB species and their impacts presents a significant challenge to those responsible for the management of coastal resources. Furthermore, HABs are complex oceanographic phenomena that require multidisciplinary study ranging from molecular and cell biology to large-scale field surveys, numerical modelling, and remote sensing from space. Our understanding of these phenomena is increasing dramatically, and with this understanding comes technologies and management tools that can reduce HAB incidence and impact. Here I summarize the global HAB problem, its trends and causes, and new technologies and approaches to monitoring, control and management, highlighting molecular probes for cell detection, rapid and sensitive toxin assays, remote sensing detection and tracking of blooms, bloom control and mitigation strategies, and the use of large-scale physical/biological models to analyze past blooms and forecast future ones.

Impact of halides on the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Understanding absorbance photobleaching of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is important because DOM chromophores impact oceanic primary productivity by affecting the depth of the photic zone, absorb UV radiation and affect ocean color used in remote sensing. However, the fundamental mechanisms which account for this bleaching are largely unknown. Controlled laboratory studies demonstrated that the presence of seawater concentrations of chloride and bromide ions enhanced absorbance photobleaching reaction rates by similar to 40%, regardless of DOM source or the presence or absence of carbonate ions. In contrast, halide ions generally did not affect fluorescence bleaching rates. Variations in ionic strength did not alter the enhancement in absorbance photobleaching by halide ions. Accordingly, the enhancement in absorbance photobleaching was specific to halide ions, rather than a generalized salinity effect. We confirmed the formation of hydroxyl radical (HO(center dot)) in illuminated samples, and its significant scavenging in the presence of halide salts. Gamma-radiolysis experiments and associated modeling indicated that a small component (similar to 12%) of the photobleaching enhancement by halides was consistent with the hypothesis that halide scavenging of HO(center dot) will form reactive halogen radicals that target electron-rich chromophores within DOM more selectively than HO(center dot) The mechanism responsible for the major component of absorbance photobleaching rate enhancement by halides remains unresolved.

Physical connectivity in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System inferred from 9 years of ocean color observations	CORAL REEFS												Ocean color images acquired from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1998 to 2006 were used to examine the patterns of physical connectivity between land and reefs, and among reefs in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Connectivity was inferred by tracking surface water features in weekly climatologies and a time series of weekly mean chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from satellite imagery. Frequency of spatial connections between 17 pre-defined, geomorphological domains that include the major reefs in the MBRS and river deltas in Honduras and Nicaragua were recorded and tabulated as percentage of connections. The 9-year time series of 466 weekly mean images portrays clearly the seasonal patterns of connectivity, including river plumes and transitions in the aftermath of perturbations such as hurricanes. River plumes extended offshore from the Honduras coast to the Bay Islands (Utila, Cayo Cochinos, Guanaja, and Roatan) in 70% of the weekly mean images. Belizean reefs, especially those in the southern section of the barrier reef and Glovers Atoll, were also affected by riverine discharges in every one of the 9 years. Glovers Atoll was exposed to river plumes originating in Honduras 104/466 times (22%) during this period. Plumes from eastern Honduras went as far as Banco Chinchorro and Cozumel in Mexico. Chinchorro appeared to be more frequently connected to Turneffe Atoll and Honduran rivers than with Glovers and Lighthouse Atolls, despite their geographic proximity. This new satellite data analysis provides long-term, quantitative assessments of the main pathways of connectivity in the region. The percentage of connections can be used to validate predictions made using other approaches such as numerical modeling, and provides valuable information to ecosystem-based management in coral reef provinces.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0722-4028					JUN	2009	28	2					415	425		10.1007/s00338-009-0465-0								WOS:000265832100011

A combinated approach to investigate the biochemistry and hydrography of a shallow bay in the South Adriatic Sea: the Gulf of Manfredonia (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The main goal of this study is to understand the hydrological and biochemical set up and processes of a marine coastal area located in the western side of the south Adriatic sea (the gulf of Manfredonia) by the use of both satellite images and in situ investigations A water sampling in the gulf of Manfredonia was performed at 18 fixed stations in June 2003; physico-chemical and biological parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence) were measured along the water column and water samples were collected to analyse dissolved nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. Surface spatial distributions of field collected data were examined to characterize biochemical and hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Manfredonia and these results were related with the remote sensing analysis data. Remote sensed data (obtained by Landsat 7 TM and Modis Terra) were processed to obtain maps of chlorophyll a, temperature and optical characteristics of the gulf; these maps were compared to in situ data. From physico-chemical measurements no stratification was observed in the water column except for the south-eastern area. High concentrations of silicate and ammonia were observed in the northern zone of the gulf, while nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll a and total suspended solids distributions showed higher values in the central coastal zone. These results were confirmed by remote sensing analysis; Modis elaboration showed a distribution with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a near the coast and Landsat images highlighted the extension of the surrounding agricultural areas crossed by the two main rivers which discharge into the gulf. The integration between field data with the remote sensing analysis showed to be a valid support in coastal zone management.

An Integrated Field and Remote Sensing Approach for Mapping Seagrass Cover, Moreton Bay, Australia	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Creating accurate maps of seagrass cover is a challenging procedure in coastal waters with variable water clarity and depths. This paper presents an approach for mapping seagrass cover from data sources commonly collected by natural resource management agencies responsible for coastal environments. The aim of the study was to develop an approach for mapping classes of seagrass cover from field and/or image data for an area with variable water clarity and depths. The study was carried out in Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. A Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite image was acquired for the same area in August 2004. The image data were used to map seagrass cover in the exposed inter-tidal and clear shallow water areas to depths of 3 in. Field Survey data were collected, in July - August 2004, to map deep (> 3 m) and turbid sub-tidal areas, using: real time video, snorkeller observations and transect Surveys. The resulting maps were combined into a single layer of polygons, with the same seagrass cover classes used as existing mapping programs and with each polygon assigned to one of five cover classes (0 %, 1-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 %, 75-100 %). As independent field data were not available for accuracy assessment, a reliability assessment indicated that > 75 percent of the Bay was mapped with high categorical reliability. Most previously published seagrass mapping projects covered areas < 400 km(2), were based on single data sets, and lacked assessment of accuracy or reliability. Our approach and methods address this gap and present guidelines for a generally applicable method to integrate image and field data sets over large areas (> 1000 km(2)) commonly used for monitoring and management.

This effort brought together people from the operational forecasting and satellite remote-sensing communities, academia, and the private sector. This diverse gathering of skill and experience yielded documentation of the impacts of these data in the operational short-term warning and forecasting environment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Weather Service, improvement in the use of these data in the public and private sectors, and the transition of promising research results into the operational environment. This project helped create momentum that has continued to grow long after the formal effort ended; today, NOAA uses QuikSCAT operationally and is investigating how to best establish a sustained satellite OSVW observing capability.

Comparative evaluation of airborne LiDAR and ship-based multibeam SoNAR bathymetry and intensity for mapping coral reef ecosystems	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Large areas of the world's coastal marine environments remain poorly characterized because they have not been mapped with sufficient accuracy and at spatial resolutions high enough to support a wide range of societal needs. Expediting the rate of seafloor mapping requires the collection of multi-use datasets that concurrently address hydrographic charting needs and support decision-making in ecosystem-based management. While active optical and acoustic sensors have previously been compared for the purpose of hydrographic charting, few studies have evaluated the performance and cost effectiveness of these systems for providing benthic habitat maps. Bathymetric and intensity data were collected in shallow water (<50 m depth) coral reef ecosystems using two conventional remote sensing technologies: (1) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and (2) ship-based multibeam (MBES) Sound Navigation and Ranging (SoNAR). A comparative assessment using a suite of twelve metrics demonstrated that LiDAR and MBES were equally capable of discriminating seafloor topography (r = >0.9), although LiDAR depths were found to be consistently shallower than MBES depths. The intensity datasets were not significantly correlated at a broad 4 x 5 km spatial scale (r = -0.11), but were moderately correlated in flat areas at a fine 4 x 500 m spatial scale (r = 0.51), indicating that the LiDAR intensity algorithm needs to be improved before LiDAR intensity surfaces can be used for habitat mapping. LiDAR cost 6.6% less than MBES and required 40 fewer hours to map the same study area. MBES provided more detail about the seafloor by fully ensonifying high-relief features, by differentiating between fine and coarse sediments and by collecting data with higher spatial resolutions. Surface fractal dimensions and fast Fourier transformations emerged as useful methods for detecting artifacts in the datasets. Overall, LiDAR provided a more cost effective alternative to MBES for mapping and monitoring shallow water coral reef ecosystems (<50 m depth), although the unique advantages of MBES may make it a more appropriate choice for answering certain ecological or geological questions requiring very high resolution data.

An assessment of aerosol-cloud interactions in marine stratus clouds based on surface remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												An assessment of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) from ground-based remote sensing under coastal stratiform clouds is presented. The assessment utilizes a long-term, high temporal resolution data set from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program deployment at Pt. Reyes, California, United States, in 2005 to provide statistically robust measures of ACI and to characterize the variability of the measures based on variability in environmental conditions and observational approaches. The average ACI(N) (= dlnN(d)/dln alpha, the change in cloud drop number concentration with aerosol concentration) is 0.48, within a physically plausible range of 0-1.0. Values vary between 0.18 and 0.69 with dependence on (1) the assumption of constant cloud liquid water path (LWP), (2) the relative value of cloud LWP, (3) methods for retrieving N-d, (4) aerosol size distribution, (5) updraft velocity, and (6) the scale and resolution of observations. The sensitivity of the local, diurnally averaged radiative forcing to this variability in ACI(N) values, assuming an aerosol perturbation of 500 cm(-3) relative to a background concentration of 100 cm(-3), ranges between -4 and -9 W m(-2). Further characterization of ACI and its variability is required to reduce uncertainties in global radiative forcing estimates.

Satellite-Observed Location of Stratocumulus Cloud-Top Heights in the Presence of Strong Inversions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Infrared channels on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to infer cloud-top pressure (CTP), temperature, and effective cloud amount or emissivity. For low clouds, those with tops at pressures greater than 700 hPa, the infrared window 11-mu m channel brightness temperature is used to determine the CTP and the corresponding cloud-top temperature by comparison with the temperature profile obtained from the NCEP Global Data Assimilation System meteorological analysis. In the presence of strong inversions which are common for marine stratus and stratocumulus, this leads to the identification of an erroneously high cloud-top height (CTH), This discrepancy is illustrated by comparing MODIS CTHs with those inferred from the geometric method used by the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on the same satellite platform, and field observations. The error in CTH is typically about 2 km and depends on the shape of the actual temperature profile. It is shown that column water vapor above cloud retrieved from the MODIS solar infrared channels in the vicinity of the 0.94-mu m water vapor absorption band can be used to flag the error and that the location of the true CTH could possibly be obtained using lapse rate formulations for cloud-topped boundary layers.																	0196-2892					MAY	2009	47	5					1421	1428		10.1109/TGRS.2008.2005406								WOS:000265487100017

Towards a regional coastal ocean observing system: An initial design for the Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					Workshop on Coastal Observatories - Best Practice in the Synthesis of Long-Term Observations and Models	OCT 16-19, 2006	Liverpool Univ, Liverpool, ENGLAND		Liverpool Univ			A conceptual design for a southeast United States regional coastal ocean observing system (RCOOS) is built upon a partnership between institutions of the region and among elements of the academic, government and private sectors. This design envisions support of a broad range of applications (e.g., marine operations, natural hazards, and ecosystem-based management) through the routine operation of predictive models that utilize the system observations to ensure their validity. A distributed information management system enables information flow, and a centralized information hub serves to aggregate information regionally and distribute it as needed. A variety of observing assets are needed to satisfy model requirements. An initial distribution of assets is proposed that recognizes the physical structure and forcing in the southeast U.S. coastal ocean. In-situ data collection includes moorings, profilers and gliders to provide 3D, time-dependent sampling, HF radar and surface drifters for synoptic sampling of surface currents, and satellite remote sensing of surface ocean properties. Nested model systems are required to properly represent ocean conditions from the outer edge of the EEZ to the watersheds. An effective RCOOS will depend upon a vital "National Backbone" (federally supported) system of in situ and satellite observations, model products, and data management. This dependence highlights the needs for a clear definition of the National Backbone components and a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) that defines the roles, functions and interactions of regional and federal components of the integrated system. A preliminary CONOPS is offered for the Southeast (SE) RCOOS. Thorough system testing is advocated using a combination of application-specific and process-oriented experiments. Estimates of costs and personnel required as initial components of the SE RCOOS are included. Initial thoughts on the Research and Development program required to support the RCOOS are also outlined.

In this study, insights from petrographic data, granulometric measurements, bottom observations, and remote sensing and subbottom profiler data from the northwestern part of Caicos Platform make this one of the more intensely studied shallow-marine carbonate systems in the Caribbean. Collectively, analyses of the thicknesses and heterogeneity of shallow-water Holocene carbonates and the platform margin reveal details of the considerable geomorphic variability present on this part of the margin, on which the orientation changes markedly. In this area, the shelf margin arcs from northwest- to north- to northeast-facing, accompanied by changes in morphology as well as the distribution, thickness and type of sediments. The NW-facing margin has discontinuous reefs near the margin, flanked platformward by coarse sands in poorly developed aprons that transition to a deeper rocky bottom (interpreted as Pleistocene) with patches of sand to fine gravel sized sediment. Locally, lobate-to-arcuate shoals with medium sands (< 500 mu m mean size; peloids and skeletal grains) form discontinuous nearshore sediment wedges. Above the gently seaward-dipping surface of the interpreted top-Pleistocene surface on this part of the margin, the most pronounced bathymetric changes (greatest relief similar to 3 m) occur around reefs and tidal deltas. In contrast, the NE-facing margin includes a continuous aggraded reef with just two passages to the open ocean (Sellar's Cut and Wheeland Cut). Just behind the reef, landward-fining coarse skeletal-peloidal sands (> 500 mu m mean size) form a reef apron that is continuous along strike and over 1000 In wide. Because the interpreted top-Pleistocene surface is gently dipping seaward, Holocene sediment thicknesses vary with changes in bathymetry and generally thin away from the reefs. Sediments in most areas are between 1.5 and 3 m thick but can reach over 6 m locally. Although the interpretation of the base of the Holocene can be ambiguous under shelf-margin reefs, subbottom profiles illustrate that backreef shelf patch reefs do not necessarily nucleate on Pleistocene bedrock highs. Facies trends are interpreted to reflect a combination of physical oceanographic, sedimentologic, and biologic processes acting within the framework of Pleistocene bedrock configuration. The NE-facing margin, with the continuous reef and expansive sand apron, is interpreted to be more wave-dominated, influenced by swells from the open Atlantic, and by locally derived wind waves. Comparison with Bahamian platforms suggests that this trend is not unique; margins facing open Atlantic swells from the north-northeast have the best-developed reefs, not east-facing (windward) margins. In contrast, the beaches and tidal deltas on the NW-facing margin suggest tidal currents and longshore transport are more pronounced here, consistent with the nature of geomorphic changes through time. The enhanced tidal influence reflects the inlets open to the open bank interior, a factor which also may discourage growth of reefs on this part of the margin. Nonetheless, other Bahamian platforms with fewer tidal passes have comparable discontinuous reefs, suggesting that island continuity is not the most influential parameter on leeward reef development. Collectively, these results illustrate the nature, scale, and causes of along-strike heterogeneity and provide a conceptual model for ancient carbonate platform margins, some of which may be equally complex in their facies architecture.

J	Sun, DY; Li, YM; Wang, Q; Gao, J; Lv, H; Le, CF; Huang, CC				Sun, Deyong; Li, Yunmei; Wang, Qiao; Gao, Jay; Lv, Heng; Le, Chengfeng; Huang, Changchun			Light scattering properties and their relation to the biogeochemical composition of turbid productive waters: a case study of Lake Taihu	APPLIED OPTICS												Light scattering properties in such a highly turbid productive lake as Lake Taihu in China were examined through 118 samples collected during three cruises in November 2006, March 2007, and November 2007. The particulate scattering and backscattering coefficients were observed using WETLabs AC-S and ECO-BB9. A power model with a spectral exponent of -0.729 was used to simulate the particulate scattering coefficient (b(p)) spectra. It has a better performance than the linear model. Scattering parameters are more closely related to inorganic suspended matter (ISM) concentration than to other water components, such as total suspended matter (TSM), organic suspended matter (OSM), and chlorophyll a (Chla). This indicates that ISM dominates the scattering signal in the lake. Three discrepancies with oceanic/coastal waters are observed: (a) the backscattering ratio ((b) over bar (bp)) decreases with an increase in the ISM concentration because of a highly strong contribution by ISM to b(p); (b) the mass-specific scattering coefficient (b(p)(m)) exhibits a wider range of variability than that reported in previous studies, which can be attributed to considerable variation in the OSM and ISM distributions; (c) the particle size distribution slope (xi) is mostly larger than 4.0 in Lake Taihu, whereas it is usually within 3.5-4.0 for marine particles. In addition, the bulk refractive index ((n) over bar (p)) calculated according to the Twardowski et al. model [J. Geophys. Res. 106, 14129 (2001)] indicates that some stations ((n) over bar (p) < 1.07) can be regarded as organic-particle dominant. Other stations with high ISM concentrations have a very small (n) over bar (p) value mostly within 1.10-1.17. Overall, the knowledge on the scattering properties gained in this study broadens our understanding of water optics in highly turbid productive water columns.

Application of remote sensing to site characterisation and environmental change analysis of North African coastal lagoons	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This article describes the use of satellite imagery for identifying key environmental characteristics within three North African coastal lagoons (Merja Zerga, Morocco; Ghar El Melh, Tunisia and Lake Manzala, Egypt) and for detecting the major environmental changes within these environments. A combination of Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ and ASTER imagery was acquired for the three sites for a period covering the last three decades (1972-2004). Following geometric correction and enhancement, the interpretation of the most recent image acquired for each of the three lagoons provides important insights into their current conditions. For Merja Zerga, these include the distribution of the largest channels which drain extensive inter-tidal mudflats and the two major depositional features associated with sources of freshwater. The distribution of marginal aquatic vegetation is highlighted as is the intensive use of the surrounding landscape for agriculture. Intensive agriculture around Ghar El Melh is also indicated. The influence of the Mejerda River, which was diverted away from the lagoon over 100 years ago, is shown to persist as a residual area of deltaic deposits in shallow water that has been eroded over time. Coastal processes including the direction of the alongshore sediment transport and the influence of engineering work associated with port construction can also be recognised. Within Lake Manzala, vegetated islands divide the lake into a series of sub-basins which can be clearly distinguished. The large influence of human activities within this lake can be identified and include reclamation for agriculture and the conversion of parts of the lake bed for fish farms. The historical images available for the three lagoons provide important insights into decadal scale changes, which have been greatest at Lake Manzala. Since the early 1970s large parts of the lake, in particular in the southwest where the shoreline has migrated northwards, have been reclaimed. Major engineering works, such as the El Salam Canal and road embankments, are shown to have resulted in significant lake change. The distribution of emergent vegetation within the lake has also changed. Classification of images for this lake into open water, vegetation and land enables the quantification of these changes. Between 1973 and 2003, the lake declined in area by approximately 50%. Changes at Merja Zerga over the last three decades include reconfiguration of the marine outlet and the expansion of the internal delta at the end of the Nador Canal. The images of this site clearly demonstrate the intensification of agriculture around the lagoon. The most marked changes evident within the images of Ghar El Melh concern the sand bars that separate the lagoon from the sea. Geomorphological processes operating within the coastal zone have resulted in the straightening of the bars with central sections migrating out towards the sea. Remote sensing is established as a promising application for detecting the quantitative surface cover changes in coastal lagoons and their near landscapes.

Analysis of the empirically derived chl a increase within the gyre has been primarily attributed to initiation of a phytoplankton bloom promoted by nutrients upwelled by Katrina's winds. Detailed analysis of inherent optical properties derived from remotely sensed radiances, however, indicated the interaction of Katrina with shallow coastal and shelf waters likely entrained waters with higher concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) into the gyre circulation, augmenting the chl a signa. Storm-induced upwelling would also transport optically active CDOM to the surface. Increases in empirically derived chl a in the Florida coastal waters influenced by Katrina's winds were therefore partly due to increased absorption by CDOM. This analysis indicates that elevated empirically derived chl a in hurricane-influenced waters should not be unambiguously attributed to increased phytoplankton productivity, particularly in an optically complex coastal environment.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				APR	2009	6	2					209	213		10.1109/LGRS.2008.2007658								WOS:000265376000007						
J	Belkin, IM; Cornillon, PC; Sherman, K				Belkin, Igor M.; Cornillon, Peter C.; Sherman, Kenneth			Fronts in Large Marine Ecosystems	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY					ICES Annual Science Conference	2007	Helsinki, FINLAND	ICES				Oceanic fronts shape marine ecosystems; therefore front mapping and characterization are among the most important aspects of physical oceanography. Here we report on the first global remote sensing survey of fronts in the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME). This survey is based on a unique frontal data archive assembled at the University of Rhode Island. Thermal fronts were automatically derived with the edge detection algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992, 1995, 1996) from 12 years of twice-daily, global, 9-km resolution satellite sea surface temperature (SST) fields to produce synoptic (nearly instantaneous) frontal maps, and to compute the long-term mean frequency of occurrence of SST fronts and their gradients. These synoptic and long-term maps were used to identify major quasi-stationary fronts and to derive provisional frontal distribution maps for all LMEs. Since SST fronts are typically collocated with fronts in other water properties such as salinity, density and chlorophyll, digital frontal paths from SST frontal maps can be used in studies of physical-biological correlations at fronts. Frontal patterns in several exemplary LMEs are described and compared, including those for: the East and West Bering Sea LMEs, Sea of Okhotsk LME, East China Sea LME, Yellow Sea LME, North Sea LME, East and West Greenland Shelf LMEs, Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf LME, Northeast and Southeast US Continental Shelf LMEs, Gulf of Mexico LME, and Patagonian Shelf LME. Seasonal evolution of frontal patterns in major upwelling zones reveals an order-of-magnitude growth of frontal scales from summer to winter. A classification of LMEs with regard to the origin and physics of their respective dominant fronts is presented. The proposed classification lends itself to comparative studies of frontal ecosystems.

Influences of upwelling and downwelling winds on red tide bloom dynamics in Monterey Bay, California	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												It has recently been shown that inner shelf waters of NE Monterey Bay, California function as an "extreme bloom incubator", frequently developing dense "red tide" blooms that can rapidly spread. Located within the California Current upwelling system, this open bay is strongly influenced by oceanographic dynamics resulting from cycles of upwelling favorable winds and their relaxation and/or reversal. Different wind forcing causes influx of different water types that originate outside the bay: cold nutrient-rich waters during upwelling and warm nutrient-poor waters during relaxation. In this study, we examine how the bay's bloom incubation area can interact with highly variable circulation to cause red tide spreading, dispersal and retention. This examination of processes is supported by satellite, airborne and in situ observations of a major dinoflagellate bloom during August and September of 2004. Remote sensing of high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution shows that the bloom originated in the NE bay, where it was highly concentrated in a narrow band along a thermal front. Upwelling circulation rapidly spread part of the bloom, mixing cool waters of an upwelling filament with warm bloom source waters as they spread. Vertical migration of the dinoflagellate populations was mapped by autonomous underwater vehicle surveys through the spreading bloom. Following bloom expansion, a two-day wind reversal forced intrusion of warm offshore waters that dispersed much of the bloom. Upwelling winds then resumed, and the bloom was further dispersed by an influx of cold water. Throughout these oceanographic responses to changing winds, an intense bloom persisted in sheltered waters of the NE bay, where extreme blooms are most frequent and intense. Microscopic examination of surface phytoplankton samples from the central bay showed that spreading of the bloom from the NE bay and mixing with regional water masses resulted in significantly increased abundance of dinoflagellates and decreased abundance of diatoms. Similar dinoflagellate bloom incubation sites are indicated in other areas of the California Current system and other coastal upwelling systems. Through frequent bloom development and along-coast transports, relatively small incubation sites may significantly influence larger regions of the coastal marine ecosystems in which they reside.

Estimating a relationship between aerosol optical thickness and surface wind speed over the ocean	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Retrieved aerosol optical thickness (ACT) based on data obtained by the Sea-viewing Wide Field Sensor (SeaWiFS) is combined with surface wind speed, obtained at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), over the North Pacific for September 2001. In this study a cloud-screening approach is introduced in an attempt to exclude pixels partly or fully covered by clouds. The relatively broad swath width through which the nadir-viewing SeaWiFS scanned over the North Pacific means that the ACT can be estimated according to a relatively large range of wind speeds for each of the scenes analyzed. The sensitivity in AOT due to sea salt and hygroscopic growth of the marine aerosols was also investigated. The validation approach is based on previous parameterization in combination with the environmental quantities wind speed, RH and boundary layer height (BLH), estimated at the ECMWF. In this study a factor of 2 higher AOT is obtained between the highest wind speed (12 m s(-1)) and the lowest wind speed range (0-4 m s(-1)) for September 2001 over remote ocean areas. This is supported by the validation of the results. The enhancement in AOT is explained by a combination of hygroscopic growth of the marine aerosols (similar to 40%) and an increase in the sea salt particle mass concentrations (similar to 60%), caused by a wind-driven water vapor and sea salt flux respectively. Reasonable agreement (within 1 to 52%) occurs also between satellite-retrieved aerosol optical thickness and AOT observed at two AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) ground-based remote sensing stations. The overall variability is also observed by this comparison. Finally, possible reasons why relatively large standard deviations occur around the mean values of AOT, when all data is taken into consideration in the analyses for September 2001, are discussed.

THE FOG REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING FIELD PROJECT	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The main purpose of this work is to describe a major field project on fog and summarize the preliminary results. Three field phases of the Fog Remote Sensing and Modeling (FRAM) project were conducted over the following two regions of Canada: 1) the Center for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE), in Toronto, Ontario (FRAM-C), during the winter of 2005/06, and 2) Lunenburg, Nova Scotia (FRAM-L), during June 2006 and June 2007. Fog conditions observed during FRAM-C were continental in nature, while those conditions observed during FRAM-L were of marine origin. The main objectives of the project were to attain 1) a better description of fog environments, 2) the development of microphysical parameterizations for model applications, 3) the development of remote sensing methods for fog nowcasting/forecasting, 4) an understanding of issues related to instrument capabilities and improvement of the analysis, and 5) an integration of model data with observations to predict and detect fog areas and particle phase. During the project phases, various measurements at the surface, including droplet and aerosol spectra, ice crystal number concentration, visibility, 3D turbulent wind components, radiative fluxes, precipitation, liquid water content profiles, and cloud ceiling, were collected together with satellite measurements. These observations will be studied to better forecast/nowcast fog events in association with results obtained from numerical forecast models. It is suggested that improved scientific understanding of fog will lead to better forecasting/nowcasting skills, benefiting the aviation, land transportation, and shipping communities.

J	Hamylton, S				Hamylton, Sarah			Determination of the separability of coastal community assemblages of the Al Wajh Barrier Reef, Red Sea, from hyperspectral data	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Remote sensing provides a practical means by which coral reefs and their associated communities are commonly mapped. The availability of spectral information is a key determinant of the detail discernable in the mapping process and consequent detail presented in output maps. Testament to this is the increasing utility of hyperspectral sensors, which typically yield datasets of higher resolution, spectrally continuous wavebands. Image classification algorithms distinguish between the different and unique reflectance characteristics of target features. While the availability of more wavebands provides the opportunity to apply analysis techniques that treat the data as spectrally continuous, such a large number of data dimensions also present a considerable computing burden. Through multiple discriminant function analysis, this paper identifies an optimal subset of wavelengths for resolving the reflectance of key terrestrial and marine coverages at the Al Wajh Barrier reef system, Saudi Arabia, Red Sea. The goal of such analysis is to facilitate the processing of high resolution, spectrally continuous remote sensing data of coastal landscapes.

Morphology and modern sedimentary deposits of the macrotidal Marapanim Estuary (Amazon, Brazil)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The northern Brazilian coast, east of the Amazon River is characterized by several macrotidal estuarine systems that harbor large mangrove areas with approximately 7600 km(2). The Marapanim Estuary is influenced by macrotidal regime with moderate waves influence. Morphologic units were investigated by using remote sensing images (i.e., Landsat-7 ETM+, RADARSAT-1 Wide and SRTM) integrated with bathymetric data. The modern sedimentary deposits were analyzed from 67 cores collected by Vibracore and Rammkersonde systems. Analysis of morphology and surface sedimentary deposits of the Marapanim River reveal they are strongly influenced by the interaction of tidal, wave and fluvial currents. Based on these processes it was possible to recognize three distinct longitudinal facies zonation that revels the geological filling of a macrotidal estuary. The estuary mouth contain fine to medium marine sands strongly influenced by waves and tides, responsible for macrotidal sandy beaches and estuarine channel development, which are characterized by wave-ripple bedding and longitudinal cross-bedding sands. The estuary funnel is mainly influenced by tides that form wide tidal mudflats, colonized by mangroves, along the estuarine margin, with parallel laminations, lenticular bedding, root fragments and organic matter lenses. The upstream estuary contains coarse sand to gravel of fluvial origin. Massive mud with organic matter lenses, marks and roots fragments occur in the floodplain accumulates during seasonal flooding providing a slowly aggrading in the alluvial plain. This morphologic and depositional pattern show easily a tripartite zonation of a macrotidal estuary, that are in the final stage of filling. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, WQ; Peng, QC; Cai, JY				Wang, Wen-Qin; Peng, Qicong; Cai, Jingye			Waveform-Diversity-Based Millimeter-Wave UAV SAR Remote Sensing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												To integrate a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) into an operational unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV), it should be as small as possible to meet stringent limitations of size, weight, and power consumption. It appears that the novel combination of millimeter-wave frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) technology and SAR techniques can provide an optimal solution. However, some efficient techniques should be applied to resolve range/Doppler ambiguities in FMCW UAV SAR systems. As such, a technique of waveform-diversity-based millimeter-wave UAV SAR imaging is presented in this paper. Along with the described system concept and signal model, the performance of the diversified waveforms evaluated by their cross correlations is detailed. As the conventional stop-and-go approximation is not valid for FMCW SAR, a modified wavenumber-domain algorithm with a consideration of continuous antenna motion during transmission and reception is derived. This imaging algorithm is validated with computer simulations. Furthermore, one parallel direct-digital-synthesizer-driven phase-locked-loop synthesizer with adaptive nonlinearity compensation, which has been validated by the experimental results, is proposed to obtain a millimeter-wave FMCW signal with fine frequency linearity.																	0196-2892					MAR	2009	47	3					691	700		10.1109/TGRS.2008.2008720								WOS:000263928900002

Variability in upwelling intensity and nutrient regime in the coastal upwelling system offshore Namibia: results from sediment archives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The coastal upwelling system offshore Namibia is ideally suited to address a focal question of the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research Programme: what are the mechanisms that drive long-term changes in ecosystems? Considerable interannual variability in climatic forcing is indicated by long time series of meteorological and remote sensing observation; these accompany considerable interannual to interdecadal changes in the upwelling intensity over the last 100 years, as well as a centennial trend. On longer time scales, the only archives available are sediment records spanning the late Holocene. To decipher the sediment record, we mapped surface-sediment patterns of proxies for physical (sea surface temperature/SST from alkenone unsaturation indexes) and nutrient (delta N-15 on bulk sedimentary N) variables. Their present-day surface-sediment patterns outline the coastal upwelling cells and filaments and associated high productivity area. Analysed in an array of dated sediment cores, the spatial patterns of SST suggest long-term (>100 years) variability in the location and intensity of individual upwelling cells. The patterns of delta N-15 outline an area of intense denitrification near the coast, and advection of water with low-oxygen concentrations in the undercurrent from the North. delta N-15 exhibits considerable downcore variability, in particular over the last 50 years. The variability appears to be governed by differences in extent of denitrification and thus of the shelf oxygen balance, which appears to have deteriorated in the last 50 years. Together, the data suggest that SST and denitrification conditions have remained in the narrow bounds outlined by today's patterns in surface sediments, but that spatially small variability in upwelling intensity and make-up of upwelling feed waters induced considerable changes in the lower trophic levels of the coastal upwelling ecosystem over the last 6,000 years. Attempts to correlate proxy records from sediments with observational time series and regional climate reconstructions were not successful, possibly because annual to interannual environmental signals are erased in the process of sediment formation.

GIS applications for military operations in coastal zones	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												In order to successfully support current and future US military operations in coastal zones, geospatial information must be rapidly integrated and analyzed to meet ongoing force structure evolution and new mission directives. Coastal zones in a military-operational environment are complex regions that include sea, land and air features that demand high-volume databases of extreme detail within relatively narrow geographic corridors. Static products in the form of analog maps at varying scales traditionally have been used by military commanders and their operational planners. The rapidly changing battlefield of 21st Century warfare, however, demands dynamic mapping solutions. Commercial geographic information system (GIS) software for military-specific applications is now being developed and employed with digital databases to provide customized digital maps of variable scale, content and symbolization tailored to unique demands of military units. Research conducted by the Center for Remote Sensing and Mapping Science at the University of Georgia demonstrated the utility of GIS-based analysis and digital map creation when developing large-scale (1:10,000) products from littoral warfare databases. The methodology employed-selection of data sources (including high resolution commercial images and Lidar), establishment of analysis/modeling parameters, conduct of vehicle mobility analysis, development of models and generation of products (such as a continuous sea-land DEM and geo-visualization of changing shorelines with tidal levels)-is discussed. Based on observations and identified needs from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, formerly the National imagery and Mapping Agency, and the Department of Defense, prototype GIS models for military operations in sea, land and air environments were created from multiple data sets of a study area at US Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Results of these models, along with methodologies for developing large-scale littoral warfare databases, aid the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in meeting littoral warfare analysis, modeling and map generation requirements for US military organizations.

Seasonality of tropospheric ozone and water vapor over Delhi, India: a study based on MOZAIC measurement data	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY												Tropospheric distributions of ozone (O-3) and water vapor (H2O) have been presented based on the Measurements of OZone and water vapor by Airbus In-Service AirCraft (MOZAIC) data over the metro and capital city of Delhi, India during 1996-2001. The vertical mixing ratios of both O-3 and H2O show strong seasonal variations. The mixing ratios of O-3 were often below 40 ppbv near the surface and higher values were observed in the free troposphere during the seasons of winter and spring. In the free troposphere, the high mixing ratio of O-3 during the seasons of winter and spring are mainly due to the long-range transport of O-3 and its precursors associated with the westerly-northwesterly circulation. In the lower and middle troposphere, the low mixing ratios of similar to 20-30 ppbv observed during the months of July-September are mainly due to prevailing summer monsoon circulation over Indian subcontinent. The summer monsoon circulation, southwest (SW) wind flow, transports the O-3-poor marine air from the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. The monthly averages of rainfall and mixing ratio of H2O show opposite seasonal cycles to that of O-3 mixing ratio in the lower and middle troposphere. The change in the transport pattern also causes substantial seasonal variation in the mixing ratio of H2O of 3-27 g/kg in the lower troposphere over Delhi. Except for some small-scale anomalies, the similar annual patterns in the mixing ratios of O-3 and H2O are repeated during the different years of 1996-2001. The case studies based on the profiles of O-3, relative humidity (RH) and temperature show distinct features of vertical distribution over Delhi. The impacts of long range transport of air mass from Africa, the Middle East, Indian Ocean and intrusions of stratospheric O-3 have also been demonstrated using the back trajectory model and remote sensing data for biomass burning and forest fire activities.

In this paper, an algorithm is developed and tested for detecting Phaeocystis globosa blooms in the Southern North Sea. For this purpose, we first measured the light absorption properties of two phytoplankton groups, P. globosa and diatoms, in laboratory-controlled experiments. The main spectral difference between both groups was observed at 467 nm due to the absorption of the pigment chlorophyll c3 only present in P. globosa, suggesting that the absorption at 467 nm can be used to detect this alga in the field. A Phaeocystis-detection algorithm is proposed to retrieve chlorophyll c3 using either total absorption or water-leaving reflectance field data. Application of this algorithm to absorption and reflectance data from Phaeocystis-dominated natural communities shows positive results. Comparison with pigment concentrations and cell counts suggests that the algorithm can flag the presence of P. globosa and provide quantitative information above a chlorophyll c3 threshold of 0.3 mg m(-3) equivalent to a P. globosa cell density of 3 x 10(6) cells L(-1). Finally, the possibility of extrapolating this information to remote sensing reflectance data in these turbid waters is evaluated.																	0142-7873					MAR	2009	31	3					287	300		10.1093/plankt/fbn116								WOS:000263165800005

So, efficient radar signal processing techniques are needed to reduce it. In this way, nonlinear signal processing techniques based on neural networks (NNs) are used in the proposed clutter reduction system. The developed experiments show promising results characterized by different subjective (visual analysis of the processed radar images) and objective (clutter reduction, target enhancement and signal-to-clutter ratio improvement) criteria. Moreover, a deep study of the NN structure is done, where the low computational cost and the high processing speed of the proposed NN structure are emphasized.

Summary diagrams for coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem model skill assessment	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The increasing complexity of coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem models may require skill assessment methods that both quantify various aspects of model performance and visually summarize these aspects within compact diagrams. Hence summary diagrams, such as the Taylor diagram [Taylor, 2001, journal of Geophysical Research, 106, D7, 7183-7192], may meet this requirement by exploiting mathematical relationships between widely known statistical quantities in order to succinctly display a suite of model skill metrics in a single plot. In this paper, sensitivity results from a coupled model are compared with Sea-viewing Wide Field-orview Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color data in order to assess the utility of the Taylor diagram and to develop a set of alternatives. Summary diagrams are only effective as skill assessment tools insofar as the statistical quantities they communicate adequately capture differentiable aspects of model performance. Here we demonstrate how the linear correlation coefficients and variance comparisons (pattern statistics) that constitute a Taylor diagram may fail to identify other potentially important aspects of coupled model performance, even if these quantities appear close to their ideal values. An additional skill assessment tool, the target diagram is developed in order to provide summary information about how the pattern statistics and the bias (difference of mean values) each contribute to the magnitude of the total Root-Mean-Square Difference (RMSD). In addition, a potential inconsistency in the use of RMSD statistics as skill metrics for overall model and observation agreement is identified: underestimates of the observed field's variance are rewarded when the linear correlation scores are less than unity. An alternative skill score and skill score-based summary diagram is presented. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We illustrate the approach utilizing a multi-decade (1979-2004) hindcast experiment conducted with the Community Climate System Model (CCSM-3) ocean carbon model. The CCSM-3 ocean carbon model incorporates a multi-nutrient, multi-phytoplankton functional group ecosystem module coupled with a carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and iron biogeochemistry module embedded in a global, three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. The model is forced with physical climate forcing from atmospheric reanalysis and satellite data products and time-varying atmospheric dust deposition. Data-based skill metrics are used to evaluate the simulated time-mean spatial patterns, seasonal cycle amplitude and phase, and subannual to interannual variability. Evaluation data include: sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth; satellite-derived surface ocean chlorophyll, primary productivity, phytoplankton growth rate and carbon biomass; large-scale climatologies of surface nutrients, pCO(2), and air-sea CO2 and 02 flux; and time-series data from the joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). Where the data is sufficient, we construct quantitative skill metrics using: model-data residuals, timespace correlation, root mean square error, and Taylor diagrams. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Calibration and validation of these PP models are not straightforward, however, and comparative studies show large differences between model estimates. The goal of this paper is to compare PP estimates obtained from 30 different models (21 SatPPMs and 9 BOGCMs) to a tropical Pacific PP database consisting of similar to 1000 C-14 measurements spanning more than a decade (1983-1996). Primary findings include: skill varied significantly between models, but performance was not a function of model complexity or type (i.e. SatPPM vs. BOGCM); nearly all models underestimated the observed variance of PR specifically yielding too few low PP (< 0.2 g Cm-2 d(-1)) values; more than half of the total root-mean-squared model-data differences associated with the satellite-based PP models might be accounted for by uncertainties in the input variables and/or the PP data; and the tropical Pacific database captures a broad scale shift from low biomassnormalized productivity in the 1980s to higher biomass-normalized productivity in the 1990s, which was not successfully captured by any of the models. This latter result suggests that interdecadal and global changes will be a significant challenge for both SatPPMs and BOGCMs. Finally, average root-mean-squared differences between in situ PP data on the equator at 140 degrees W and PP estimates from the satellite-based productivity models were 58% lower than analogous values computed in a previous PP model comparison 6 years ago. The success of these types of comparison exercises is illustrated by the continual modification and improvement of the participating models and the resulting increase in model skill.

J	Chang, G; Whitmire, AL				Chang, Grace; Whitmire, Amanda L.			Effects of bulk particle characteristics on backscattering and optical closure	OPTICS EXPRESS												Optical closure is essential for the determination of biogeochemical properties from ocean color remote sensing information. Mie scattering theory, a radiative transfer model, and a semi-analytical inversion algorithm were used to investigate the influence of particles and their properties on optical closure. Closure results were generally poor. Absorption coefficient (a(t)) inversions were more accurate for moderate particle size distribution slopes (3.50 <= xi <= 3.75). The degree of success in the derivation of the backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) was highest at moderate indices of refraction (1.15 <= n(p) <= 1.20) and high values of xi (> 3.75). Marked improvements in the estimates of bbp were enabled by a priori knowledge of b(bp) at one wavelength. At moderate values of n(p), derivations of at and b(bp) were within 25% of Mie-modeled values when Gershun's relationship was used in combination with the semi-analytical algorithm.

The system can measure the distribution of irradiance and radiance over the sea surface, in the layer near sea surface and in the euphotic zone synchronously, during which some other parameters are also acquired such as spectral absorption and coefficients of the water column, the velocity and direction of the wind, and so on. The buoy was positioned by GPS. The low-power integrated PC104 computer was used as the control core to collect data automatically. The data and commands were real-timely transmitted by CDMA/GPRS wireless networks or by the maritime satellite. The coastal marine experimentation demonstrated that the buoy has small pitch and roll rates in high sea state conditions and thus can meet the needs of under-water radiometric measurements, the data collection and remote transmission are reliable, and the auto-operated anti-biofouling devices can ensure that the optical sensors work effectively for a period of several months.																	1000-0593					FEB	2009	29	2					565	569		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)02-0565-05								WOS:000263152300067
