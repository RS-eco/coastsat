J	Miossec, L; Le Guyader, F; Haugarreau, L; Pommepuy, M				Miossec, L; Le Guyader, F; Haugarreau, L; Pommepuy, M			Magnitude of rainfall on viral contamination of the marine environment during gastroenteritis epidemics in human coastal population	REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE					Meeting on Epidemiology, Environment and Health	OCT 25-27, 1999	ST MALO, FRANCE					Background: Sewage treatments are not efficient to eliminate enteric microorganisms. Viruses are able to persist and are discharged into the marine environment with treated effluents. Few data are now available on the magnitude and the contributive processes of marine viral contamination. This work evaluates the relationship between the magnitude of rainfall and the viral contamination of the marine environment during winter epidemics of gastroenteritis in human coastal populations. Methods: A RT-PCR method was used to detect enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, Norwalk-like virus, astrovirus and rotavirus in shellfish, harvested monthly between August 1995 and July 1998. The frequency of virus detection in shellfish was expressed as an Index of Viral Contamination. Acute gastroenteritis in the population was estimated using the French Sentinel System for Monitoring of Communicable Diseases. Rainfall effects on the efficiency of sewage treatment were assessed using an estimated staving time of sewage effluents in the plant. Results: The results indicate that the highest viral contamination occurs in winter. Maximal indexes of viral contamination were respectively 70% in January 1996, 100% in January 1997 but only 31% in January 1998. Viral contamination variations seemed to follow the pattern of the winter epidemic of acute gastroenteritis in the local population in 1996 and 1997 These observations should be linked to the winter rainfalls. Heavy mins on short periods of time could create fin hydraulic overload in the sewage treatment plant, reducing the staying time of the sewage effluents and thus the efficiency of the disinfection process. Conclusion: The magnitude of the viral contamination of shellfish seems to result from the simultaneity between the winter epidemics of acute gastroenteritis in the coastal population and heavy rainfall. To prevent public health hazards associated with shellfish consumption, the monitoring of microbiological quality in shellfish harvesting areas should include accompagning survey of viral epidemic in the coastal population, and of sewage outputs in the coastal environment.																	0398-7620					AUG	2000	48			2			62	71										WOS:000089257100007

In polar environments, characterization of antioxidant defences in key sentinel species may be of particular value as early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas. The complexities associated with predicting the consequences at the 'organism level' of variations of specific antioxidant defences have been recently overcome by the ability to quantify an index of specific biological resistance to various kinds of ROS. The total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay has been used in three species of scallops for quantifying their ability to neutralize peroxyl (ROO.) and hydroxyl ((OH)-O-.) radicals and peroxynitrite (HOONO). Adamussium colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for a comparison with a related temperate species. TOSC values for ROO. were significantly higher in A. colbecki indicating this species as the most efficient scavenger of ROO.. Mediterranean scallops had the lowest TOSC for ROO.. A. colbecki also exhibited the highest scavenging capacity for (OH)-O-. with values more than 2-fold greater than for C. islandicus and P. jacobaeus. TOSC for HOONO was lower for all scallops as compared to those for ROO. or (OH)-O-.. TOSC for microsomes was not significantly different among the species for any ROS studied, and the percentage contribution to the specific TOSC for the various oxidants of microsomes of all scallops accounted for 1-3% of the total TOSC of the post-mitochondrial fraction. The specific TOSC of scallop microsomes for (OH)-O-. was approximately ten times lower than that for ROO. or HOONO. The higher basal capability of the Antarctic scallop to neutralize different reactive oxygen species is discussed in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment and TOSC is validated as a quantifiable measure of susceptibility to oxidative stress in marine organisms.

Levels of metals were low in most of the sampling stations and similar to those found by other authors in uncontaminated zones. Certain locations, however, showed some degree of contamination (Cambrils, Almassora, Alacant, Mar Menor and El Portus). In Santa Pola we found high contents of metals in one sample of sediment due to the high proportion of the fine fraction (particules < 63 mu m) and organic matter, but not in the seagrass species. Mercury and zinc concentrations in the sediment are correlated to those in at least some anatomic fractions of Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa and Caulerpa prolifera, suggesting that these species reflect the levels of these metals in the environment. Lead contents in the alga Caulerpa prolifera are also correlated to those in the sediment, while no significant correlations were obtained for cadmium. Among the species studied, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa seem to be better biomonitors than Caulerpa prolifera.																	0173-9565					MAY	2000	21	1					1	16		10.1046/j.1439-0485.2000.00642.x								WOS:000087819400001

Enzyme activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of [H-3]arginine to [H-3]citrulline. Optimal NOS activity was found to require NADPH. Activity was inhibited by the competitive NOS inhibitor N-G-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMA), but not the arginase inhibitors L-valine and L-ornithine. NOS activity was predominantly cytosolic, and was characterised by a K-m for arginine of 19.05 mu M and a V-max of 2.96 pmol/min per mu g protein. Histochemical localisation of NOS activity using NADPH diaphorase staining showed the enzyme to be predominantly present in the epidermal cells and at the extremities of the mesoglea. These results provide a preliminary biochemical characterisation and histochemical localisation of NOS activity in A. pallida, an ecologically important sentinel species in tropical marine ecosystems.

The effects of clean and Zn-polluted environments and laboratory experiments where Zn-polluted mussels were exposed to sublethal concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cd were investigated. Zinc-polluted mussel shell weights increased significantly after a 51-day depuration period. Exposure of Zn-polluted mussels to Zn or Cd, however, caused a slightly reduced shell growth in comparison with depurating mussel Cu-exposures not causing any reduction in growth. Apart from metal concentrations, metal/shell weight indices have been used to assess metal bioavailability. Metal concentrations recorded in the soft tissues of depurating mussels increased without a source of 'extra' metals, while the Zn/shell-weight index was reduced, as expected from a depuration process, Cu and Cd/shell-weight indices remaining constant. Experimental exposure to Zn, Cu and Cd caused augmented values of Zn, Cu and Cd/shell-weight indices, respectively. These different findings were attributed to changes in flesh weight (related with gamete spawning) that would produce inconsistent estimates of whole metal concentration in soft tissues. Since changes in the tissue composition and in growth rates do not affect Zn/Cu ratios and metal/shell-weight indices, these parameters are proposed as reliable indices of metal bioavailability for 'Mussel-Watch' monitoring programmes. The most sensitive parameter is the metal/shell-weight index, which is, therefore, highly recommended to be used in 'Mussel-Watch' monitoring programmes in order to determine metal bioavailability in seawaters.

Among others, the following biomarkers received special attention: metallothionein induction, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, cytochrome P450 system induction, imposer, lysosomal enlargement and lysosomal membrane destabilisation, and peroxisome proliferation. These biomarkers can be used to evaluate exposure to and effect of different contaminants (metals, organic xenobiotics and organometallic compounds) and they can be measured using different methodological approaches (biochemistry, cytochemistry, immunochemical methods based on the use of biotechnology). Before the application of a set of biomarkers in pollution monitoring programmes, well-defined protocols of Quality Assurance have to be established to allow adequate comparison of results. It is also necessary to include analysis of standard reference materials and to obtain detailed knowledge of basal values and seasonal variations of the biomarkers in various species, as well as to integrate the information obtained with the different biomarkers, Marine bivalve molluscs such as mussels are appropriate sentinel species for most of the biomarkers proposed except for the induction of the cytochrome P450 system, which should be measured in fish, and the degree of imposer, which is a biomarker of exposure to TBT specifically measured in certain gastropod molluscs. As a result of the workshop, a battery of biomarkers of contaminant exposure and effects are proposed that could be incorporated into programmes monitoring the quality of the coastal environment in the Iberian Peninsula. These measures would be undertaken in conjunction with chemical measures of contaminant burdens in selected sentinel species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ross, PS				Ross, PS			Marine mammals as sentinels in ecological risk assessment	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												As high trophic level organisms in the marine environment, fish-eating seals, dolphins and whales are often exposed to very high levels of fat-soluble environmental contaminants. Assessing the sources, levels and patterns of contaminants found in the tissues of marine mammals, and the biological effects of these contaminants on individuals, is essential to determining any population- or species-level impacts. While the number of contaminants to which marine mammals are exposed is staggering, designing strategies to assess the effects of complex mixtures represent a challenging yet vital part of an understanding of the "real world". At present, an accumulated "weight of evidence" suggests that ambient levels of lipophilic contaminants have adversely affected aspects of reproduction, immune function and endocrine function in marine mammals inhabiting a number of industrial coastal regions. This body of evidence is drawn from a combination of (1) epidemiological or descriptive studies of effects observed in free-ranging populations of marine mammals inhabiting contaminated areas; (2) mechanistic, cause-and-effect, laboratory rodent studies, using single- or multiple- chemical exposures in acute or chronic designs; (3) semi-field or captive studies of marine mammals fed fish from contaminated areas; and (4) laboratory studies where rodent species are used as surrogates for marine mammals, and are exposed to extracts of complex contaminant mixtures found in fish. While these approaches have been used to delineate the effects of historically introduced environmental contaminants such as PCBs and DDT on wildlife, they may serve to identify the ecological risks presented by (1) the continued leaking of stored, discontinued, chemical supplies that have not yet been destroyed (e.g., PCBs); (2) new chemicals that may have lipophilic or persistent characteristics similar to those found currently in marine mammals; and (3) diet selection as a source of contaminants for humans, since certain human groups share the same food chain with marine mammals. Contaminant mixtures to which marine mammals are exposed differ greatly from the original industrial mixtures as a result of differing rates of accumulation and capacities to metabolize certain chemical types by the various trophic levels (e.g., invertebrates, fish, and marine mammals) of the food chain. Marine mammals ultimately provide information on the chemicals which present the greatest risk to consumers at the top of the food chain, something that cannot be adequately described or predicted in laboratory models.																	1080-7039	1549-7860				FEB	2000	6	1					29	46		10.1080/10807030091124437								WOS:000086143800003

Three established biomarkers, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, metallothionein concentration and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, were intercalibrated. The stability of lysosomal membranes in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.) was assessed with a cytochemical method. The four participating laboratories were able to discriminate between control animals (membrane labilization times ranging from 21 to 35 min) and Cu-exposed animals (40 mu g/l Cu for 3 days) (labilization times ranging from 4.5 to 7.4 min). The metallothionein concentration was evaluated in digestive gland homogenates of control mussels and of animals exposed to 200 mu g/l Cd for 7 days. The eight participating laboratories were able to discriminate between controls and treated samples using a spectrophotometric method. The EROD activity was evaluated by 11 laboratories. All laboratories were able to discriminate between liver microsomal preparations obtained from control and from benzo-a-pyrene exposed fisk(Dicentrarchus labrax), with values ranging from 0.5 to 15.88 pmol/min/mg protein in controls and from 5.41 to 165.13 pmol/min/mg protein in treated animals. Using S9 fractions, it was possible to correctly identify control and treated fish, with a variation similar to that found using microsomal fractions, albeit with an inevitable difference in specific activity. As a corollary, all laboratories involved produced comparable data and were able to identify pollutant-induced stress syndromes in sentinel organisms. Thus, intercalibration enables the use of biomarkers in large biomonitoring programs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mussels M. galloprovincialis were exposed for 21 d to different doses of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (50 and 100 mg B[a]P kg(-1) dry wt mussel d(-1)) via trophic intake. The kinetics of B[a]P concentration in whole mussel tissues was determined in both groups, and a dose-response study was conducted for both gill B[a]P-related DNA adducts and 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) formation in gill and digestive gland DNA. Exposure was followed by a 10 d depuration period to study mussel recovery. Although B[a]P was absorbed and bioaccumulated to very high concentrations (>300 mg B[a]P kg(-1) dry wt mussel), plateau values were not reached in either assay group. Regardless of the exposure dose of B[a]P, several bulky DNA adducts were induced in the typical PAH diagonal radioactive zone. For both doses, positive correlations were found between total DNA adduct level and both exposure time and B[a]P concentration in whole mussel tissues. DNA repair during depuration differed among the B[a]P-induced DNA adducts. B[a]P exposure had no effect on gill 8-oxodGuo levels, but led to a significant dose-dependent increase in the number of oxidative lesions in mussel digestive gland DNA. The decrease with depuration in digestive gland 8-oxodGuo levels to control values was indicative of the mussels' ability to recover from oxidative DNA damage.																	0171-8630						2000	205						195	206		10.3354/meps205195								WOS:000165292500015						
J	Couillard, CM; Nellis, P				Couillard, CM; Nellis, P			Organochlorine contaminants in mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) living downstream from a bleached-kraft pulp mill in the Miramichi Estuary, New Brunswick, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Mummichog, a small-sized sentinel fish species, has been proposed for use in environmental effects monitoring programs conducted by pulp mills that release their effluent in marine waters. In order to evaluate the suitability of mummichog as a sentinel species and to support the interpretation of biological effects data, tissue concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, (PCDD/Fs), chlorophenolic compounds (CPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pesticides were investigated in mummichog sampled in the Miramichi Estuary, which was receiving a bleached-kraft mill (BKM) effluent, and in a reference estuary, the Bouctouche Estuary. Higher concentrations PCDD/Fs (up to 50 times), CPs (up to 60 times), DDT, and PCBs (up to 10 times) were found in mummichog sampled at the upstream site of the Miramichi Estuary. At this site, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent concentrations were slightly above the threshold for ethoxy resorufin O-deethylase induction. Multivariate analyses on congener profiles revealed that the contamination by PCDD/Fs and CPs originated both from the BKM and from a former wood-preservation plant and that PCDD/Fs and CPs typical of the BKM were transported 40 km downstream from the mill. Patterns and levels of persistent contaminants differed between sites within the Estuary, indicating that the fish did not mix during their growing period. These findings support the use of mummichog in environmental effects monitoring programs, because this species bioaccumulates chlorinated compounds contained in BKM effluent and is sedentary. The cause-effect relationship between exposure to the BKM effluent and the observed biological responses will have to be demonstrated by laboratory studies because of the presence of multiple sources of contamination.																	0730-7268					NOV	1999	18	11					2545	2556		10.1897/1551-5028(1999)018<2545:OCIMFH>2.3.CO;2								WOS:000083271100023

Eelgrass was deployed unrooted in the water column in the vicinity of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, located on Seavey Island in Portsmouth Harbor of New Hampshire and Maine, offshore from seepage sites near the Jamaica Island landfill (JIL). Deployed eelgrass, water samples from seepage sites, and sediment from the deployment sites were analyzed for Pb concentration and stable Pb isotopic composition. Isotopic composition was used to distinguish recent anthropogenic Pb inputs from background Pb in the estuary. Isotope ratios indicated that two groundwater seeps were a source of recent anthropogenic Pb (i.e. industrial Pb from the landfill) to Jamaica Cove. The eelgrass that showed the strongest presence of industrial Pb (having the lowest Pb-206/Pb-207) was closest to a high volume seep that drained from the JIL and had a similar isotope signature as well as elevated Pb concentrations. These data confirm a source of water-borne industrial Pb in the estuary and show that eelgrass can function as a sentinel accumulator of Pb from anthropogenic sources. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Goley, PD				Goley, PD			Behavioral aspects of sleep in Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, Gill 1865)	MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE												Dolphin sleep is unlike typical mammalian sleep in that slow wave sleep occurs in one hemisphere at a time and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is apparently seduced or absent (Mukhametov 1987). Lilly (1964) observed that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sleep with one eye open and one eye closed and suggested that the open eye monitored the immediate area for predators. Mukhametov (1987) and Supin et al. (1978) found no physiological correlation between the active brain hemisphere and the open eye, and suggested that no sentinel function exists. I describe the behavioral and social aspects of sleep in a captive school of four Pacific white-sided dolphins (La genorhynchus obliquidens) at Long Marine Lab at the University of California at Santa Cruz for 32 nights. As the animals swam in formation, I recorded their positions and eye condition. Dolphins did not close their eyes or switch positions in the school randomly. While in formation, dolphins switched positions in bouts while concurrently changing eye condition. This resulted in a sleeping formation in which the dolphins likely had the eye open towards schoolmates, not toward the external environment. I suggest that this allows sleep to proceed while allowing dolphins to maintain visual contact with group members.																	0824-0469					OCT	1999	15	4					1054	1064		10.1111/j.1748-7692.1999.tb00877.x								WOS:000083402100020						
J	Coull, BC				Coull, BC			Role of meiofauna in estuarine soft-bottom habitats	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY					International Conference on the Ecology of Estuaries and Soft-Sediment Habitats	FEB, 1997	DEAKIN UNIV, GEELONG, AUSTRALIA	Deakin Univ, Alcoa Australia, Environm Protect Authority Victoria, Qantas, W Coast Railway, Ecol Soc Australia	DEAKIN UNIV			Meiofauna are ubiquitous in estuaries worldwide averaging 10(6) m(-2). Abundance and species composition are controlled primarily by three physical factors: sediment particle size, temperature and salinity. While meiofauna are integral parts of estuarine food webs, the evidence that they are biologically controlled is equivocal. Top down (predation) control clearly does not regulate meiofaunal assemblages. Meiofauna reproduce so rapidly and are so abundant that predators cannot significantly reduce population size. Food quantity (bottom up control) also does not appear to limit meiofaunal abundance; there is little data on the effect of food quality. In estuarine sediments meiofauna: (i) facilitate biomineralization of organic matter and enhance nutrient regeneration; (ii) serve as food for a variety of higher trophic levels; and (iii) exhibit high sensitivity to anthropogenic inputs, making them excellent sentinels of estuarine pollution. Generally mineralization of organic matter is enhanced and bacterial production stimulated in the presence of meiofauna. Tannins from mangrove detritus in northern Queensland appear to inhibit meiofaunal abundance and therefore the role of meiofauna in breakdown of the leaves. Meiofauna, particularly copepods, are known foods for a variety of predators especially juvenile fish and the meiofaunal copepods are high in the essential fatty acids required by fish. The copepod's fatty acid composition is like that of the microphytobenthos they eat; bacterial eaters (nematodes?) do not have the essential fatty acids necessary for fish. Most contaminants in estuaries reside in sediments, and meiofauna are intimately associated with sediments over their entire life-cycle, thus they are increasingly being used as pollution sentinels. Australian estuarine meiofauna research has been concentrated in Queensland, the Hunter River estuarine system in New South Wales, and Victoria's coastal lagoons. Studies in northern Queensland have primarily concentrated on the role of nematodes in mineralization of organic matter, whereas those from southern Queensland have concentrated on the role of meiofauna as food for fish and as bacterial grazers. The New South Wales studies have concentrated on the Hunter River estuary and on the structure and function of marine nematode communities. In Victoria, several fish have been shown to eat meiofauna. The Australian world of meiofaunal research has hardly been touched; there are innumerable opportunities for meiofaunal studies. In contaminated estuarine sediments reduced trophic coupling between meiofauna and juvenile fish is a basic ecological question of habitat suitability, but also a question with relevance to management of estuarine resources. Because meiofauna have short lifecycles, the effects of a contaminant on the entire life-history can be assessed within a relatively short time. The use of modern molecular biology techniques to assess genetic diversity of meiofauna in contaminated vs uncontaminated sediments is a promising avenue for future research. Much of the important meiofaunal functions take place in very muddy substrata; thus, it is imperative to retain mudflats in estuaries.																	0307-692X					AUG	1999	24	4					327	343		10.1046/j.1442-9993.1999.00979.x								WOS:000081839900005

This is reasonable because the ciliary strokes result in the intake of phytoplankton by raising the constant water current along the cilia from an inhalant siphon transported to the mouth. The ciliary strokes showed an evident diel fluctuation with the maximal activity during the night. The contribution of mucus excretion was evident for efficient filter-feeding. The ciliary stroke and the mucus excretion were activated almost simultaneously showing similar diel fluctuation while filter-feeding. The maximal ciliary stroke was observed at 20 degrees C in salt solution from 30 to 40 parts per thousand salinities. The stroke follows the Arrhenius equation in the temperature range from 5 to 30 degrees C with a break at around 20 degrees C when the experiment was performed with salt solution between 10 to 33 parts per thousand salinities.																	0049-6979					AUG	1999	114	1-2					53	66		10.1023/A:1005097922529								WOS:000081420000004

The polluted zone increased by a factor of 3 and the subnormal zone increased by a factor of 10 between 1970 and 1980. After construction of a primary treatment plant in 1987, the macrobenthos of the polluted zone decreased significantly in terms of number of individuals. This decrease was apparently caused by a reduction of organic matter discharged to the sea and was particularly notable near the discharge. However, composition of communities began to change in 1992 to 1993. Benthic samples taken at depths of 35, 39, and 51 m in July 1994 and January 1995 indicated a recovery of parts of a polluted zone to a community resembling the subnormal zone. Most notable is the disappearance of species indicative of the polluted zone at stations H3 and H4 and the decrease at station 17 (nearest the outfall). Also, sentinel species of the subnormal zone and species characteristic of the unpolluted zone increased in number. The study demonstrated a complete change of communities at stations 17 and H4 between 1990 and 1994. Communities at these two stations, both near the sewer outfall, are characteristic of the subnormal zone. The community at station H3 that belonged to the subnormal zone displayed a degree of structural stability. These changes in benthic populations indicated that construction of the primary treatment plant reduced contamination in the area and may lead to recovery of the benthos in this region.																	1061-4303					JUL-AUG	1999	71	4					483	493		10.2175/106143097X122167								WOS:000081452300013						
J	Curtis, LA; Tanner, NL				Curtis, LA; Tanner, NL			Trematode accumulation by the estuarine gastropod Ilyanassa obsoleta	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												The accumulation of larval trematodes by Ilyanassa obsoleta (Gastropoda) at 2 estuarine sites in Delaware was studied. Initial infection status of snails was assayed by looking for shed cercariae. Native snails (most already infected) were deployed at sites A and B, and sentinel snails (putatively uninfected) were deployed at site B. All were individually marked and, if found, reassessed for infection after being free 1-3 summers. Himasthla quissetensis, Lepocreadium setiferoides, Zoogonus rubellus, Austrobilharzia variglandis, and Gynaecotyla adunca infections were observed in recovered snails. At site A, in 1993, 62 natives were recovered. Among the 26 initially testing uninfected, 15 had infections at recovery. Of 36 that released cercariae, 26 had the infection initially indicated. Of sentinels released at site B in 1996, 3 of 16 had infections when recollected. One probably was infected before transplant; at least 2 were infected at site B during 1996-1997. Among site B natives, 26 were rater examined by dissection in 1996; 22 had the infection status initially revealed. Some site B natives (n = 35) escaped recapture in 1996 but were found in 1997, or 1998, or both, and were reexamined, most by cercarial release. The same cercariae were produced by 30. Among natives (both sites, n = 123), 27.6% exhibited some difference in infection status compared to the initial assay. This probably overestimates changes. Some differences were real but most can be discounted as cases where initial infection status was misrepresented.																	0022-3395					JUN	1999	85	3					419	425		10.2307/3285772								WOS:000081034300006	10386431

Biological responses that may contribute to the impairment of reproductive and developmental processes include responses that can be categorized as interfering with bioenergetic processes such as feeding and nutrient allocation; biosynthetic processes, such as the synthesis of energy stores; and morphogenic processes, such as those involved in structural development. Case studies within New Bedford and Boston Harbors (Massachusetts) are used to examine the relationship between contaminant uptake and effects on the reproductive cycle and bioenergetics of mussels and soft shell clams. The results observed illustrate that disruption in bioenergetics in bivalve molluscs exposed to chemical contaminants can result in loss of reproductive output and increased susceptibility to disease. Differences in the extent of reproductive impairment may be linked specifically to energetic strategies of individual species.																	0024-3590					MAY	1999	44	3	2				903	909		10.4319/lo.1999.44.3_part_2.0903								WOS:000080326600014						
J	Boening, DW				Boening, DW			An evaluation of bivalves as biomonitors of heavy metals pollution in marine waters	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Heavy metals (namely Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Hg, Pb, Ni, and Ag) that are present at concentrations common in ambient marine waters can cause adverse effects in shellfish. Such effects can significantly impact the trophic structure of a biological community. Heavy metals uptake is dependent on both geochemical and biological factors. In bivalves, the extent of accumulation is a function of several biotic and abiotic variables. Based on several criteria, (including: an ability to accumulate metals without suffering mortality, habitation within, and continuous exposure to, the contaminated matrix, hardiness, and ease of sampling) bivalve molluscs have proven to be useful biomonitors for a host of inorganic contaminants. it is essential that the biomonitoring plan is not only site specific, but that it considers the use of indigenous species whenever possible. This paper will provide a general review of studies that have employed bivalved shellfish as sentinel bioindicators in marine environments impacted by heavy metals, and give suggestions for conducting biomonitoring assays.																	0167-6369					APR	1999	55	3					459	470		10.1023/A:1005995217901								WOS:000080258800009

Genetic variability detected by electrophoresis of enzymes was low except for EST-3. Geographic distribution of rare alleles at four loci, discontinuity in allelic frequencies at the EST-3* locus and differences in the estimated number of migrants indicated that F. heteroclitus does not form a panmictic population in the study area. Temporal variability in allelic frequencies at the EST-3' locus was detected only at the site closest to the mill (M1). The proportion of fish with high pelvic fin ray counts was consistently higher at site M1 and was correlated at all sites to the proportion of fish with asymmetric fin ray counts. The possible impact of the observed genetic discontinuity on the response of this sentinel species to pollutants should be considered in further studies. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The range of metal concentrations is generally below acute thresholds in coastal areas, where recognition of chronic sublethal effects is more relevant. Evidence of long-term adverse effects, such as cancer, due to heavy metals in marine animals comes from a number of field and experimental studies. The mechanism of metal carcinogenicity remains largely unknown, although several lines of experimental evidence suggest that a genotoxic effect may be involved. The aim of our study was to evaluate the sensitivity of genotoxicity tests, alkaline elution and micronucleus test, as biomarkers for the detection of heavy metals in mussels as the sentinel species. Experimental studies were carried out on Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed in aquarium (5 days) to different concentrations of three selected metal salts, CuCl2 (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 mu g/l/a), CdCl2 (1.84, 18.4, 184 mu g/l/a), and HgCl2 (32 mu g/l/a), and to a mixture of equimolar doses of the three metals to study the results of their ioini action. Metallothionein quantitation was used as a marker of metal exposure. Lysosomal membrane stability was applied to evaluate the influence of physiological status on genotoxic damage. The ranking of genotoxic potential was in decreasing order: Hg > Cu > Cd. Cu and Hg caused an increase of DNA single-strand breaks and micronuclei frequency. Cd induced a statistical increase of DNA damage, but gave negative results with the micronucleus test. A relationship between genotoxic effects and metallothionein content was observed. Reduction in lysosomal membrane stability with the increasing concentration of heavy metals was also evident. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 33:287-292, 1999 (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

For this purpose fish erythrocytes (Gobidae) and two different tissue cell types from mussels (haemolymph cells and gill cells from Mytilus galloprovincialis) were used. The comet assay was carried out in two different versions: a) mild alkaline at pH=12.1, to detect DNA single strand breaks (ssb); and b) alkaline at pH>13, able also to evaluate alkali-labile sites. While fish erythrocytes showed a statistically higher amount of DNA damage when the assay was carried out at pH>13 compared to pH=12.1, no difference in DNA migration was found between slides obtained at pH=12.1 and at pH>13 in mussel haemocytes and gill cells. Two different voltage protocols (low voltage and longer times; high voltage and shorter times) were also looked at. The second one was chosen for biomonitoring Orbetello Lagoon. Spatial and temporal variability of DNR damage were investigated in 6 sampling sites characterised by different degrees of ecological disturbance.																	0028-2685						1999	46			S			6	7										WOS:000086580800003

The PAH concentrations determined in the organisms were significantly negatively correlated with logK(ow) values, but to different extents; according to the species. This was explained by the greater exposure of the organisms to the lower molecular weight compounds with differences resulting from different feeding habits, habitat, and biotransformation capacities of the organisms in relation to trophic levels. The influence of these observations on the use of different sentinel species in biomonitoring programmes is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This fish, common in the Mediterranean, was chosen since it is considered a good sentinel species. Moreover, biomarkers of exposure to organic contaminants (such as EROD) are often measured in this species and make it possible to evaluate the quality of waters. For cloning purposes, RNAs were extracted from the liver of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)-treated animals and used as template in degenerate RT-PCR. The cDNA product was cloned and used for the design of highly stringent primers that were utilized in Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) PCR. The cloned cDNA hybridizes with a 2.7 kb mRNA which is induced by treatment of the fish with BaP, a classical CYP1A inducer. The closest sequences found in data banks belong to fish CYP1A.

J	Kaiser, MJ; Laing, I; Utting, SD; Burnell, GM				Kaiser, MJ; Laing, I; Utting, SD; Burnell, GM			Environmental impacts of bivalve mariculture	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												There is a pressing need to protect the ecology of nearshore marine habitats that are used for an ever increasing range of activities. In particular, fisheries managers need to consider both environmental and socioeconomic issues in coastal areas owing to the environmental changes that can occur as a result of cultivation and harvesting processes associated with mariculture. Bivalve cultivation can be broadly split into three main processes: (1) seed collection, (2) seed nursery and on-growing, (3) harvesting. The environmental impacts of each cultivation stage will vary depending on the species in question and the techniques used. In many instances, commercial species are reared as seed in hatcheries prior to seeding, with few effects on the environment. However, while some species are collected from the wild using benign techniques such as spat collectors, others are extracted using intrusive devices such as dredges. A growing number of studies of the ecological effects of mechanical collecting devices have demonstrated direct mortality of non-target species and the destruction of suitable settlement substrata or habitats. In addition, other species, such as birds, crabs and starfish, may be deprived of valuable food resources and habitat as a result of the mechanical harvesting of bivalve seed. The nursery and ongrowing of bivalves involves either suspended culture subtidally, trestle culture intertidally or cultivation directly on/in the ground. Many of the environmental changes that occur result from their filter feeding activities that produce faeces and pseudofaeces. This can lead to depletion of phytoplankton in densely cultivated systems and accumulation of silt/pseudofaeces beneath suspended cultures that then often results in a locally anoxic environment and faunal impoverishment. In addition, the structures used during the cultivation process can cause environmental change. For example, the use of netting to protect clams from crab predators leads to siltation and accumulations of sediment. Parks of trestles can drastically alter the water flow regime leading to changes in sedimentation rate and oxygen exchange within the system. Extensive intertidal cultivation plots could deprive birds of feeding habitats, and the associated husbandry practices may disturb roosting birds. The final stage of cultivation involves harvesting. In many cases this involves little more than emptying the bivalves from poches or lifting ropes. However, in the case of species cultivated within sediment, or relayed on the seabed, the use of intrusive techniques is required. Both dredgers and suction devices cause disruption of the sediment and kill or directly remove non-target species. The time taken for communities affected by these processes to recover will vary depending on a number of factors, such as the cohesive qualities of the sediment and the aspect of the site and the longevity of the non-target fauna. As is the case with all anthropognic activities that impinge on the marine environment, the magnitude of the environmental changes that occur is linked to the scale of the cultivation processes. There are also positive aspects to coastal shellfish cultivation such as the provision of hard substrata and shelter in otherwise barren sites and the possibilities of using the cultured organisms as environmental sentinels. Here, we review the potential environmental effects that occur throughout the cultivation cycle, from collection of the seed to harvesting. We suggest that careful consideration of the techniques used can effectively minimise environmental changes that might occur, and possibly ameliorate subsequent restoration of cultivated sites.

Rates of nestling growth were measured and blood samples were collected for measurements of serum biomarkers. Haptoglobin, total protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and sodium in sera were measured as potential biomarkers of oil ingestion. Differences in mean levels of biomarkers were observed between years, and between nestlings and adults, as well as among locations within Kachemak Bay. During summer 1995, a controlled dose-response experiment was conducted with weathered Prudhoe Bay Crude Oil. Fifty-one nestlings were divided into three groups: controls, nestlings fed 0.05 ml of oil, and nestlings fed 0.20 ml of oil. Each experimental nestling was fed the dose of weathered oil twice: once at approximately day 20, and again 5 days later at approximately day 25 post-hatching. Blood samples were collected immediately before dosing on days 20, 25, and again on day 30 post-hatching. Site-specific differences in some blood variables were observed among treatments. These results suggest that the doses of weathered oil administered to guillemot nestlings were not sufficient to induce a persistent inflammatory response. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Littorina littorea	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Accumulation and tissue distribution of Cu and Zn in target organs of Littorina littorea have been investigated. Weight changes in particular organs were associated with either Cu or Zn exposures and therefore, metal/shell-weight indices were used instead of metal concentrations to investigate metal accumulation and mobilisation. A regulatory mechanism was observed on exposure to low levels of Cu, but regulation did not occur between 8 and 80 mu g Cu/l seawater. Conversely, Zn was well-regulated up to a concentration of 80 mu g Zn/l seawater. Zn/Cu index increased linearly at increasing Zn exposure levels and decreased linearly at increasing Cu exposure levels. The gills are not target tissues reflecting environmental levels of either Cu or Zn, however, copper levels were elevated in gills after exposure to 80 mu g Cu/l seawater for 29 and 41 days. On the other hand, the highest concentration of Cu in the kidney was found after exposure to 8 mu g Cu/l seawater for 41 days. Higher exposures resulted in lower Cu concentrations. According to metal/shell-weight indices, Cu and Zn were not significantly accumulated in the digestive gland/gonad complex (DGGC) until a certain threshold value was reached (exposure level >400 mu g . day/1). On the other hand, DGGC weight was significantly reduced and, concomitantly, Zn and Cu concentrations raised. However, the metal concentration values increased beyond those resulting simply from a weight reduction. In conclusion, dissimilar mechanisms performed by different cell types in the different organs, together with metal-induced weight changes, would account for the existence of different patterns of metal accumulation and tissue distribution. It is therefore suggested that the suitability of winkles as indicators of Cu and Zn pollution should be reconsidered on the basis of measurements of metal burdens at tissue and cell levels.

Mytilus galloprovincialis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The tissue distribution of Zn in mussels collected from a Zn-polluted site and the changes in the pattern of distribution for Zn and Cu in response to experimental exposures to Cu, Zn and Cd, as well as the tissue distribution of Cd have been studied. The organs of mussels were accurately separated avoiding mixtures except the kidney area that was included within the remainder tissues. Mussels exposed to intermediate dose (ID)-Cd showed the highest Cd burden first in gills and then more or less equally distributed between the various tissues examined with a dominance of the digestive gland. Mussels exposed to high dose (HD)-Cd, showed Cd equally distributed through all the organs at both exposure times. Below 0.8 mu g Cd/l seawater, the gills of Zn-polluted mussels were able to either protect against Cd entry or mobilise uptaken Cd towards other tissues. On the other hand, Zn- and Cu-burdens did not rise in gill tissue, although in depurating mussels Zn-levels were higher than in any other exposure group. Similar conclusions were obtained for the digestive gland. However, the accumulative capacity of the digestive gland tissue for Cd was not exhausted and Cu burdens were depressed on exposure to Cd. Interactions between metals in the various organs studied could be explained by redistribution of haemocytes or brown cells and by enhanced release of metal-bearing digestive lysosomes in response to metal exposure. It is suggested that (a) the pattern of metal accumulation and tissue distribution as well as a part of the interactions between Cu, Zn and Cd cannot be explained solely by the availability of metallothioneins in specific organs; and (b) the specific cell type in which these ligands occur as well as the relative abundance and distribution of these cells are relevant factors controlling metal burdens in organs of mussels. Therefore, in addition to the chemical and the biochemical approaches, investigations on tissue sections are required to better understand these phenomena. Meanwhile, the digestive gland of mussels could be used as the target organ to monitor metal pollution, including essential and non-essential metals, on the basis of metal/shell-weight indices.

Since oxidative stress is a common pathway of toxicity induced by xenobiotics, a preliminary biochemical characterization was carried out on the antioxidant system of this species and baseline data collected for future assessment of the anthropogenic impact in this remote area. The digestive gland and gills were investigated for levels of glutathione and the activity of several glutathione-dependent and antioxidant enzymes: gluthathione reductase, EC 1.6.4.2; glyoxalase I, EC 4.4.1.5; glyoxalase II, EC 3.1.2.6; gluthathione S-transferases, EC 2.5.1.18; Se-dependent, EC 1.11.1.9 and Se-independent, EC 2.5.1.18 glutathione peroxidases; catalase, EC 1.11.1.6; and superoxide dismutase, EC 1.15.1.1. The same enzymatic activities were measured for comparison in the Mediterranean molluscs Mytilus galloprovincialis and Pecten jacobaeus. Very high levels of glutathione S-transferases were found in the digestive gland of both species of scallop compared to mussels, suggesting the importance of different feeding behaviour among these molluscs. However, catalase activity, much higher in Adamussium colbecki than in the Mediterranean molluscs, may represent a biochemical adaptation to the Antarctic marine environment with high levels of dissolved oxygen. Enzymes from the Antarctic species appeared to be generally more active at low temperatures but, with a few exceptions, their activities increased at higher temperatures.

Marine molluscs (mussels, clams and snails) were sampled from three harbors with different characteristics (small vs. large boats). Two fish species were studied (a) the grey mullet Liza aurata sampled in Barcelona harbor and (b) the red mullet Mullus barbatus sampled along the coast; different tissues (muscle, liver, gills and digestive tube) were analysed separately. The composition of butyltin compounds was different according to the organism and sampling point, but in general elevated concentrations of TBT were noticed in molluscs. The highest organotin residue levels (5.4 mu g/g d.w. as Sn) were detected in mussels from Masnou, a recreational marina, followed by those collected in Barcelona harbor (1.2 mu g/g d.w. as Sn). In contrast, no organotin compounds were detected in fish muscle and very low levels in the other organs, being TPT the major organotin in red mullet liver.

J	Oubella, R				Oubella, R			Immunomodulation in populations of bivalve molluscs from the Bay of Brest	ANNALES DE L INSTITUT OCEANOGRAPHIQUE												The variations in hemolymph parameters in marine bivalves were monitored in both laboratory and field after exposure of animals to different metallic and organic pollutants. In the laboratory, experimental modification of cytometric parameters produced physiological changes in the hemolymph. Exposure of oysters to sub-lethal doses of metal ions, cadmium and copper resulted in an increase in total hemocyte counts (THC), a phenomenon often observed under pathological conditions, and in important shifts in differential hemocyte counts (DHC). Spontaneous hemocyte aggregation (SHA), which acts to maintain the integrity of the body, was altered in oysters and mussels following in vitro contact of the hemocytes with metal ions or with the biocide tributyltin (TBT). These effects on SHA were observed to be dependent on the applied concentration of the particular micropollutant. In the field, the measurement of THC, DHC and SHA in transplanted mussels revealed responses at the most exposed sites (mouth of the Elorn, Bay of Daoulas, harbour area). The serum of wild oysters and clams from exposed sites had increased levels of cellular peptidase reflecting sub-cellular modifications such as lysosome destabilisation. The modifications in hemolymphatic parameters, demonstrated in this study, are likely to have reduced immune system performance, and therefore are considered to indicate a state of immunomodulation. These changes in the immune system in bivalves in polluted areas, relative to those at control sites, indicate that measurement of hemolymphatic parameters in sentinel species should be strongly considered in monitoring of marine ecosystem under human impact.																	0078-9682						1997	73	1					77	87										WOS:000073942900009						
J	Florou, H; Chaloulou, C				Florou, H; Chaloulou, C			Fish as bioindicators of radiocaesium pollution in aquatic environment in Greece	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN					8th International Symposium on Environmental Pollution and its Impact on Life in the Mediterranean Region	OCT 08-12, 1995	RHODES, GREECE	Mediterranean Sci Assoc Environ Protect, Int Soc Ecotoxicol Environ Safety, GSF Res Ctr Environ Health, Inst Ecological Chem, Tech Univ Munich, Dept Ecolog Chem, Chem Tech Anal Food Technol, Univ Ioannina, Lab Analyt Chem, Univ Metz, Ctr Environ Sci				It is well known that selected organisms can offer an easy tool for radioactive pollution ''signal'', whereas the radiological impact of the pollution event can also be early approached by the appropriate selection of the organism-bioindicator. The nomination of an organism as bioindicator for a radionuclide is more complicated if compared with the stable isotopes even the biochemical behaviour is the same. The physical half-life of the radionuclides interferes to the ecological retention/elimination time and gives another parameter, the effective half-life, which defines the integrated activity concentration of radionuclide in the organism considered. Nevertheless, absolute activity concentration, concentration factor in relation to sea-water and the effective half-life of a radionuclide are the parameters, which can be used for the selection of organism-sentinels of radioactive pollution in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study the selection of some aquatic organisms as bioindicators for rdioacaesium (Cs-137 + Cs-134) pollution warning in marine and freshwater environment in Greece are evaluated, in relation to the ecological and the radiological impact assessment, as well, based on a bulk of activity concentration measurements on marine and freshwater biota, during the period 1984 - 1989. The Chernobyl influence to the Greek aquatic environment was also interpretated in consideration to the organisms' response to the pollution event. Furthermore, marine organisms and freswater fish are suggested as bioindicators for radiocaesium pollution according to the established criteria.																	1018-4619					JAN-FEB	1997	6	1-2					9	15										WOS:A1997XA85500003

The two species accumulated most of the elements efficiently. The only exceptions were Cs-134 in both P. oceanica and C. taxifolia and Cd in C. taxifolia (concentration factors less than or equal to 6.4). Steady state in uptake was reached in C. taxifolia for each element except Ag. In P. oceanica, steady state was noted for the uptake of Ag and Cs-134 whereas Zn, Cd, and Am-241 were linearly accumulated during the course of the experiment (15 d). With respect to relative metal bioavailability, the different compartments of P. oceanica shoots were generally ranked in the order: leaf epiphytes > adult leaves = intermediate leaves > leaf sheaths. The long-lived component of the loss kinetics for each element in P. oceanica was characterized by a relatively short biological half-life (T-b1/2 less than or equal to 28 d). However, observations for the individual compartments indicated that adult leaves had a high retention capacity for Ag and Cs-134, With virtually 100% retained after 21 d in uncontaminated sea water. In C. taxifolia, the long-lived component of the loss kinetics for each element was characterized by a T-b1/2 value that was not significantly different from infinity, an observation which suggests that a substantial fraction of the metal or radio-nuclide incorporated during a contamination event would be irreversibly bound by this algal species.

J	Depledge, MH				Depledge, MH			Genetic ecotoxicology: An overview	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The techniques currently available for detecting genotoxin exposure are briefly described and evaluated with regard to the goals of generic ecotoxicology. The occurrence and significance of genotoxin-induced neoplasia in marine organisms is described. Although there are numerous examples of hotspots where tumour incidences in fish and shellfish have been correlated with raised concentrations of anthropogenic chemicals, causal mechanisms are seldom established. Insufficient information is available to gauge the seriousness of genotoxicity for marine organisms on regional or global scales. The possibility of using marine organisms as sentinels to provide early warning of potential threats to Man is examined. Recognition of the genotoxic disease syndrome in lower animals highlights the need to explore the relationships between DNA damage (adduct formation, gene mutations, etc.) and its phenotypic consequences. Within a given population, not all individuals are equally susceptible to pollutant toxicity (including genotoxicity). The potential for using similarities in phenotypic traits to recognise subsets of individuals within populations possessing similar genotypes is discussed. Changes in heterozygosity and the evolution of genetically resistant populations following exposure to pollution are evaluated in the context of genetic ecotoxicology. Risk assessment procedures are required which enable genotoxin exposure to be related to specific consequences at the community and ecosystem levels. This necessitates both a sound scientific understanding of the mechanisms involved and the development of pragmatic ecotoxicological tools that can be employed by environmental managers.																	0022-0981					NOV 15	1996	200	1-2					57	66		10.1016/S0022-0981(96)02639-1								WOS:A1996VV02000004						
J	Curtis, LA				Curtis, LA			The probability of a marine gastropod being infected by a trematode	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Sentinel snails were employed to determine the likelihood of an estuarine snail becoming infected with a trematode under natural conditions. In summers of 1991 and 1993, Ilyanassa obsoleta (Mollusca: Gastropoda) (n = 1,400) were collected from a saltmarsh in Lewes, Delaware, where parasite prevalence was low, and screened for infections. Putatively uninfected snails were individually marked and released onto the nearby Cape Henlopen sandflat where prevalence of trematodes among native snails is very high (similar to 80%). Most sentinels were free in the field for 1-5 mo and 186 were ultimately recovered. The overall estimate of probability of infection is 1.6%. The snail lives for many years and this low probability of becoming infected indicates that high prevalence of trematodes in this host is brought about not by rapid colonization, but by stow accumulation over time.																	0022-3395					OCT	1996	82	5					830	833		10.2307/3283899								WOS:A1996VN95900025	8885896					
J	Bhattacharya, B; Sarkar, SK				Bhattacharya, B; Sarkar, SK			Total mercury content in marine organisms of the Hooghly estuary, west Bengal, India	CHEMOSPHERE												This paper reports concentrations of total Hg (both organic and inorganic) in different selected biota (seagrass, gastropods, bivalves and fishes) collected from the coastal regions of deltaic Sundarbans, West Bengal, India. Species-dependent variability is very much distinct where high level of Hg was found in carnivorous species. A high degree of organ specificity was pronounced in case of bivalves where gill and mantle exhibited higher Hg accumulation due to the ion exchange activity of the mucous in these organs. The available data demonstrates the potentiality of the shellfishes as sentinel accumulators of this element and they can be successfully used as sensitive index of pollution. The data also reveals that this coastal zone is getting polluted and necessary preventive measures must be adopted to make the best possible use of the available marine resources.

J	Castilla, JC				Castilla, JC			Copper mine tailing disposal in northern Chile rocky shores: Enteromorpha compressa (Chlorophyta) as a sentinel species	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The study assesses the ecological impact caused by the El Salvador untreated (1975-1990) and treated (1991-1994) copper mine tailings on rocky intertidal communities in and around the dumping site at Caleta Palito, northern Chile. Ecological changes are monitored for 16 years in polluted and unpolluted sites within a geographical area of 90 km. Copper concentration levels in water and the intertidal Chlorophyta E. compressa are presented. The results confirm a notorious reduction in the number of species and significant differences between polluted and unpolluted intertidal communities. At polluted sites, following the initiation of the disposal, all species of invertebrates and algae disappeared and primary space (rock) was partially or completely dominated by E. compressa along more than a decade. Its persistence in these sites supports the view that this taxon is a sentinel species resisting high levels of copper pollution. During the past four years, following the steps given to treat the tailings, at polluted sites there are preliminary indications showing increases in the number of species of algae and invertebrate. The need for future monitoring to elucidate ecosystem restoration processes is discussed.																	0167-6369					APR	1996	40	2					171	184		10.1007/BF00414390								WOS:A1996UA93600006	24198094

A reliable biomonitoring method to assess the degree of environmental TBT pollution has been described based on investigations of virilization phenomena in prosobranch snails (Mollusca: Gastropoda). Examples are the imposer phenomenon in marine and freshwater species, the intersex reaction in littorinids and the reduction of female sexual glands and offspring numbers in further species resulting mainly in a sterilization of females. The degree of imposer or intersex in populations is determined by different biomonitoring indices which allow to assess the TBT pollution of the environment at low costs with high precision. The effectiveness of TBT legislations is analysed by extensive surveys in France and Ireland indicating that there is still a continuing threat to sensitive marine organisms. TBT disturbs the biosynthesis of steroid hormones on the level of estrogen biosynthesis. The observed virilization phenomena seem due to an inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 dependent aromatase by this organotin compound.

The purpose of this research, therefore, has been to evaluate the uptake and depuration of selected PCBs and PAHs in transplanted American oysters, Crassostrea virginica, under field conditions in Galveston Bay, Texas. Transplanted oyster were found to bioaccumulate contaminants and reach concentrations nearly equal to those of indigenous oysters for PAHs and low molecular weight PCBs within 30-48 days. In contrast, high molecular weight PCBs did not reach equivalent concentrations. When returned to a clean environment, oysters significantly depurated PAHs and low molecular weight PCBs. There were, however, differences in depuration rates when newly contaminated oysters were compared to chronically contaminated oysters. Oysters are useful tools in biomonitoring studies but have their limitations. Transplant studies help to establish these limitations on the use of oysters as sentinel organisms to avoid misleading interpretation of the oyster contaminant concentrations.

J	DEZWART, D; KRAMER, KJM; JENNER, HA				DEZWART, D; KRAMER, KJM; JENNER, HA			PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES WITH THE BIOLOGICAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM MOSSELMONITOR	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND WATER QUALITY												Biological early warning systems (BEWS) for water pollution involve organisms as sentinels for the quality of the environment. The organisms are usually fast in their response (minutes) to a multitude of pollutants. BEWS devices are very useful for continuous monitoring of (industrial) effluents, water intake, and river or seawater quality control. The ''Mosselmonitor'' is a commercially available BEWS that uses the behavioral valve movement response of freshwater or marine mussels (e.g., Dreissena polymorpha or Mytilus edulis). As an indication of unfavorable conditions in the water, the closure of the shells, or a marked increase in the valve movement frequency, is automatically evaluated. During the last few years the authors have gained practical experience with the Mosselmonitor in a number of field experiments. Examples of monitoring practice will be presented that involve the following monitoring situations: intake of drinking water from a river system; continuous monitoring of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, partly in combination with other BEWS devices and physicochemical monitoring; monitoring of industrial effluents in a tidal estuary; and control of cooling water chlorination for antifouling purposes. In addition, the system has been used for toxicological laboratory studies on selected compounds.

Consequently, this event results in an unpredictable overestimation of metal bioavailability when the metal concentration in soft tissues is considered as an index of such metal bioavailability. The Abra estuary (Bizkaia, Bay of Biscay, Spain) was used as a natural experimental basin with well-known differences in the levels of metallic pollutants. The level of metal bioavailability was determined at various sites at different times of the year. For this purpose the conventional approach of recording metal concentrations in soft tissues and the approach based on the calculation of metal/shell-weight indices, first proposed by Fischer (1983), were applied. We concluded that seasonal changes in organism condition (Flesh Condition Index) cause unpredictable oscillations in the metal concentration in soft tissues. For this reason the direct use of metal concentration values is not recommended to assess metal bioavailability. The metal/shell-weight indices, however, were not affected by seasonal changes in the flesh weight of sentinel mussels and thus may provide a more realistic indication of metal bioavailability. In the present study, different metal bioavailabilities, assessed by metal/shell-weight indices, were found at different sampling sites, according to the influence of industrial activities. Seasonal trends in metal/shell-weight indices (attributed to different metal inputs at different times) were also recorded. In conclusion, metal/shell-weight indices, characterized by a high sensitivity and a low noise-to-signal ratio, are a simple and reliable tool for assessing metal bioavailability in 'Mussel Watch' monitoring programmes.

The channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, served as the benthic sentinel species for these studies. At least 15 aromatic hydrocarbons known to be associated with oil refining and/or other industrial activities were detected at impacted stations including known carcinogens and mutagens [e.g., anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene]. At an appropriate reference station, no anthropogenic contaminants were identified in the waters and only 2 were observed in the sediments. Catfish collected from the reference station were significantly heavier, longer, and had higher relative weights. Morphological deformities such as clubbed, split, and missing barbels were observed on 37.8% of the fish collected from the impacted stations, while none were observed on fish from the reference station. Livers of catfish collected from the impacted stations exhibited a variety of histological changes consistent with contaminant exposure including vacuolated hepatocytes, pigment deposits, and other hepatoxic changes. These sublethal changes appear to be associated with chemical contamination and represent compromised health of individual organisms and, potentially, populations.

Bioaccumulation depended on the routes of uptake and bioavailability determined by compound hydrophobicity. CHLPs were mainly present in the dissolved phase, showed a positive correlation between the bivalve-water BAFs and K-ow's and reached steady-state levels before 70 days in a caging experience. These facts reflect an efficient water-gill partitioning process. In contrast, PCBs were only detected in the SPM, showed essentially K-ow independent bivalve-sediment and bivalve-SPM BAFs with the lowest values for superhydrophobic heptachlorobiphenyls 174, 180, and 170, and did not reach steady-state levels during a 140-day exposure period. This suggests that the uptake was hindered by their stronger affinity for SPM and the interference of steric factors during intestine absorption. Corbicula fluminea are reliable sentinel organisms and showed clear geographical trends along 150 km of the Rio de La Plata coast: a progressive decrease of PCB levels and more degraded patterns dominated by recalcitrant congeners, i.e., 153, were observed with increasing distance from the major La Plata-Buenos Aires urban center. A size-related trend overlapped with this spatial gradient: older clams usually showed higher levels and a more degraded PCB signature. CHLPs showed less clear geographical trends due to the presence of multiple sources. CHLP patterns showed a strong dominance of chlordane-related compounds, particularly transchlordane which was 2-5 times more abundant than the cis isomer. On a temporal scale, from 1986 to 1993, Asiatic clams presented sustained PCB levels but showed a significant decrease of chlordane and DDT, which suggests reduced inputs in recent years.																	0013-936X					APR	1995	29	4					914	927		10.1021/es00004a011								WOS:A1995QP70900021	22176398

Pathological reactions of the lysosomal system in hepatopancreatic cells have proven to be sensitive bioindicators of pollutant effect. However, if such reactions are to be used as biomarkers, then they must be clearly distinguishable from any hormonally-induced changes linked to normal seasonal activity such as the reproductive cycle. The aim of the present study was to test the effects of several cell-to-cell signalling compounds on the lysosomes of the hepatopancreatic digestive cells. In vitro incubation of tissue slices showed that epinephrine, acetylcholine and prostaglandin F2-alpha reduced lysosomal membrane stability and latency of beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase and beta-glucuronidase. These results indicate the presence of cell surface receptors for all three hormones. The observed changes in lysosomal fragility were less pronounced than those induced by pollutants and when considered together with other published data, indicate that hormonal regulation of digestive cell lysosomes is unlikely to pose a problem for the use of lysosomal reactions as biomarkers for chemical insult.																	0018-2214					OCT	1991	23	10					495	500		10.1007/BF01041381								WOS:A1991GN19500011	1835969

The growing interest in molluscs as sentinels of environmental pollution has prompted studies on the responsiveness of lysosomal membranes from the common marine mussel, Mytilus edulis L. to oxidative stress by the oxyradical-generating hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction. We report that oxyradicals generated external to the lysosomal membrane cause a decrease in the stability of the lysosomal membrane, thereby resulting in leakage of enzymes from this organelle. This leakage can be prevented by catalase but not by hydroxyl radical scavenging agents. Superoxide dismutase appears to be a major enzyme exhibiting latent activity upon attack of lysosomes by oxyradicals but does not afford sufficient protection to prevent enzyme leakage under the conditions studied. Further, non-fluorescent dihydrorhodamine 123 is converted to highly fluorescent products after uptake into the lysosomal compartment of digestive gland cells suggesting that oxyradicals may be produced within the lysosomal compartment in association with the pinocytotic activity of the digestive cells. Thus, a consequence of xenobiotic-mediated proliferation of oxyradicals might be the release of potent hydrolytic enzymes into the cytosol with ensuing enzyme degradation and damage to other organelles.																	0090-4341					SEP	1991	21	3					401	408		10.1007/BF01060363                                                              								WOS:A1991GF25800011
