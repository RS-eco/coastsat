In particular, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability of turbidity and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Po River prodelta (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) during the period 2013-2016. To perform this analysis, a two-pronged processing methodology was implemented and the resulting outputs were analysed through a series of statistical tools. A pixel-based spatial correlation analysis was carried out by comparing temporal curves of turbidity and SST hypercubes with in situ time series of wind speed and water discharge, providing correlation coefficient maps. A geostatistical analysis was performed to determine the spatial dependency of the turbidity datasets per each satellite image, providing maps of correlation and variograms. The results show a linear correlation between water discharge and turbidity variations in the points more affected by the buoyant plumes and along the southern coast of Po River delta. Better inverse correlation was found between turbidity and SST during floods rather than other periods. The correlation maps of wind speed with turbidity show different spatial patterns depending on local or basin-scale wind effects. Variogram maps identify different spatial anisotropy structures of turbidity in response to ambient conditions (i.e. strong Bora or Scirocco winds, floods). Since the implemented processing methodology is based on open source software and free satellite data, it represents a promising tool for the monitoring of maritime ecosystems and to address water quality analyses and the investigations of sediment dynamics in estuarine and coastal waters.																	0303-2434					APR	2018	66						210	225		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.012								WOS:000423650500019

Moderate resolution spectro-radiometer on board the terra and aqua satellites can provide thermal infrared (TIR) imaging data for land and ocean. These TIR data have recorded short-lived thermal anomaly prior to major earthquakes. It is suggested by others that these electromagnetic (EM) phenomena relate to stress build up before earthquakes. The objective of this study is to find an association between spatial extent and temporal evolution of thermal anomalies and known major earthquakes near the boundary of Nazca plate and South American plate. Our approach is to map the TIR transient fields from polar orbiting satellites and analysing those data using time series temperature plots to detect the abnormal thermal trends before the earthquake. This study concentrated on marine earthquakes to detect the changes in both land and ocean before seismic activity.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2018	33	3					293	309		10.1080/10106049.2016.1250824								WOS:000419955200006

Raghavendra; Kang, Na; Yin, Yan			Classification of key aerosol types and their frequency distributions based on satellite remote sensing data at an industrially polluted city in the Yangtze River Delta, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												In the present study, characterization of columnar aerosol optical properties and classifying the major aerosol types was investigated at an urban-industrial city, Nanjing in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region over East China using simultaneous data sets retrieved from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensors during 2004-2015. A notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity was observed in the optical properties of aerosols on the seasonal scale over East China. Aerosol optical depth at 550nm (AOD(550)) exhibited pronounced seasonal variability over Nanjing in the YRD, with higher values during summer and spring seasons and lower in winter. angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE(470-660)) found higher in summer indicating the relative abundance of fine mode aerosols over the coarse mode. We also used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model for presenting cluster trajectory analysis which revealed that the airmasses from different source regions contributed greatly to aerosol loading during the study period. In addition, we followed two techniques for studying classification of major aerosol types based on the predefined thresholds. Using the AOD-AE method (here called as Technique-I), five major aerosol types were identified via, continental clean (CC), marine (MA), biomass burning/urban-industrial (BU), desert dust (DD), and mixed (MX). In all the seasons, MX is the dominant aerosol type followed by the BU and DD type aerosols during summer and spring seasons, respectively. Further, the sub-classification of aerosol types was carried out considering into account of the characteristics of absorbing aerosol index (AAI) (here called as Technique-II). The two clustering techniques showed reasonable consistency in the obtained results. The various aerosol types (absorbing and non-absorbing) and their change over a region are highly helpful in fine tuning the models to decrease the uncertainty in the radiative and climatic effects of aerosols.

J	Barnes, BB; Garcia, R; Hu, CM; Lee, Z				Barnes, Brian B.; Garcia, Rodrigo; Hu, Chuanmin; Lee, Zhongping			Multi-band spectral matching inversion algorithm to derive water column properties in optically shallow waters: An optimization of parameterization	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) and other water quality parameters from satellite remote sensing data covering optically shallow environments has historically been problematic due to difficulties in separating the benthic signal from that of the water column. While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2018	204						424	438		10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.013								WOS:000418464400031

Seasonal variation in remotely-sensed phytoplankton size structure around southern Africa	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010) computes fractional contributions of three phytoplankton size classes (micro- (> 20 mu m), nano- (2-20 mu m), picophytoplankton (< 2 mu m)) to the overall chlorophyll a concentration (Chla). Using in situ pigment data, model coefficients were adjusted for application to the southern African marine region. The refined model was applied to seasonal and monthly climatologies of MODIS Aqua Chla around Southern Africa. Chla > 1 mg m(-3) was limited to shelf regions along the coasts of Southern Africa and Madagascar, while values < 0.1 mg(-3) were found over most of the open ocean between the equator and 38 S during austral summer and autumn. In winter and spring, low values (< 0.1 mg m(-3)) were restricted to smaller regions within subtropical gyres, while values up to 0.7 mg m(-3) extended over a much greater area of the open ocean. Shelf regions in the northern (NB) and southern Benguela (SB), Agulhas Bank (AB), Agulhas region (AR), and Mozambique Channel (MC) all showed similar seasonal cycles of size structure. On average, microphytoplankton comprised > 50% of the total Chia in these regions with little change throughout the year. The AR shelf differed, with picophytoplankton dominating in summer, and micro- and nanophytoplankton the rest of the year. In the open ocean domains of the NB, SB, and AB regions, nanophytoplankton dominated for most of the year, with picophytoplankton being more prevalent during summer and autumn. In contrast, in the AR open ocean, nanophytoplankton were dominant only during winter and early spring, whereas picophytoplankton dominated throughout the year in the MC open ocean. The refined model characterised previously unknown spatial and temporal changes in size structure in various ecosystems around Southern Africa.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2018	204						617	631		10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.038								WOS:000418464400045

Marine mammals observations were obtained from two research platforms. CTD casts were deployed down to 100 m, water samples were taken monthly at six stations for determination of organic nutrients, and another 15 stations were sampled over a wider area only during the winter. Satellite images from MODIS-AQUA L2 were used to obtain sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) values, likewise altimetry data to identify mesoscale dynamic structures in the region. High salinity values (34.6), low concentrations of nitrates and nitrites ((similar to)3-4 mu M), silicates (5-7 mu M), Chl-alpha ((similar to)10 mg m(-3)), and low SST ((similar to)23.5 degrees C) were detected, as well as the presence of cyclonic gyres near the coast during the winter-spring period. This coincided with high marine mammal species richness in the area (from 5 to 9 species depending on spatial scale). The dominant species was Megaptera novaeangliae (0.092 sightings km(-1)), which was distributed close to the coast in shallow waters. Low salinity (32.8) and Chl-alpha values (0.1 mg m(-3)) were detected during the summer-fall period. High phosphate availability (2.5 mu M), presence of anticyclonic gyres, and high SST ((similar to)31 degrees C) were also found, coinciding with low species richness (3 species). The dominant species was Stenella attenuata (0.036 sightings km(-1)); those individuals were found distributed near the Jalisco-Colima coast (0-3 nm) in shallow waters with high inorganic nutrient availability. The principal components analysis showed that bathymetry (99.6%) was the main parameter explaining data variance; this parameter could therefore potentially modulate ecological aspects of marine mammals.																	0717-3326	0718-1957				DEC	2017	52	3					479	494										WOS:000423325000006

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.

Reflectances of SPOT multispectral images associated with the turbidity of the Upper Gulf of California	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												The use of satellite images for the observation and measurement of marine turbidity has been developed mainly with ocean colour sensors, such as MODIS. These images have a maximum spatial resolution of 250 m in their visible and infrared bands. In this research, images of the SPOT sensors were chosen as an alternative to overcome this limited spatial resolution. The objective was to prove the suitability of SPOT to measure turbidity in areas with great spatial variability. As a first step, all the images were standardized and the SPOT wavelength that had the largest association in the Principal Component Analysis was chosen (PCA). The results show that the bands of a SPOT multispectral image are highly redundant. The wavelength of the 610-680 nm (S2 (610-680)) obtained the best association in 89% of the 73 images analysed. The SPOT reflectance (R (rs)) (S2 (610-680)) was compared with MODIS 620-670 nm (M1 (620-670)), which has already been tested in other research and has proved to be adequate for measuring turbidity. Both sensors performance was similar for low and moderate reflectance but for high reflectance, SPOT (S2 (610-680)) had a better performance than MODIS (M1 (620-670)). Additionally, the SPOT R rs (S2 (610-680)) was associated with standardized Secchi disk depth data, which were measured in situ, to check SPOT suitability. SPOT R rs (S2 (610-680)) images were classified into: 1) cold or warm season, 2) spring tide or neap tide and 3) water flux or reflux. These constructed scenarios allowed to see the result of the Standardized Space Anomalies, which showed the continuous presence of low and medium values in the most oceanic region of the Upper Gulf of California (UGC) and very high values in all the scenarios in the intertidal zone. This research has shown that SPOT R rs (S2 (610-680)) is useful for observing, differentiating and measuring turbidity patterns in areas with very high spatial variability.																	1133-0953	1988-8740				DEC	2017		50					1	16		10.4995/raet.2017.7795								WOS:000418705700002

In the AbPM, a(ph) is used as the key predictor of phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency. Previous studies have shown that the size of phytoplankton could affect the photosynthetic efficiency. Thus, a size-fractionated AbPM was proposed by considering how phytoplankton size influenced the global quantum yield of phytoplankton photosynthesis. The sea surface temperature (SST) was also used to further improve AbPM performance in coldwaters (SST<10 degrees C). With the proposed new model, monthly averaged global ocean NPP data for the period 2003-2012 were derived, and the distributions of the global NPP differed in both space and time from previous AbPM-based estimates. The accuracy of the new estimated model was validated using in situ NPP data, which were collected from different marine monitoring sites. Compared with the original AbPM, the new model not only had an excellent performance at each marine monitoring site, but also had an improved accuracy over the Southern Ocean. Although additional studies need to be conducted for confirmation, this size-fractionated model could be a reasonable and accurate method for the estimation of global ocean NPP.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2017	10	12	2				5519	5528		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2747770								WOS:000418871200017

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

Identifying Meteorological Controls on Open and Closed Mesoscale Cellular Convection Associated with Marine Cold Air Outbreaks	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Mesoscale cellular convective (MCC) clouds occur in large-scale patterns over the ocean and have important radiative effects on the climate system. An examination of time-varying meteorological conditions associated with satellite-observed open and closed MCC clouds is conducted to illustrate the influence of large-scale meteorological conditions. Marine cold air outbreaks (MCAO) influence the development of open MCC clouds and the transition from closed to open MCC clouds. MCC neural network classifications on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2008 are collocated with Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data and ERA-Interim reanalysis to determine the radiative effects of MCC clouds and their thermodynamic environments. Closed MCC clouds are found to have much higher albedo on average than open MCC clouds for the same cloud fraction. Three meteorological control metrics are tested: sea-air temperature difference (T), estimated inversion strength (EIS), and a MCAO index (M). These predictive metrics illustrate the importance of atmospheric surface forcing and static stability for open and closed MCC cloud formation. Predictive sigmoidal relations are found between M and MCC cloud frequency globally and regionally: negative for closed MCC cloud and positive for open MCC cloud. The open MCC cloud seasonal cycle is well correlated with M, while the seasonality of closed MCC clouds is well correlated with M in the midlatitudes and EIS in the tropics and subtropics. M is found to best distinguish open and closed MCC clouds on average over shorter time scales. The possibility of a MCC cloud feedback is discussed.

Within the Aerosol_cci project the susceptibility of cloud properties to changes in aerosol properties is derived from the high-resolution AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) data set using the Cloud-Aerosol Pairing Algorithm (CAPA) (as described in our companion paper) and compared to susceptibilities from the global aerosol climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 and MODIS-CERES (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) data. For ECHAM6-HAM2 the dry aerosol is analysed to mimic the effect of CAPA. Furthermore the analysis is done for different environmental regimes. The aerosol-liquid water path relationship in ECHAM6-HAM2 is systematically stronger than in AATSR-CAPA data and cannot be explained by an overestimation of autoconversion when using diagnostic precipitation but rather by aerosol swelling in regions where humidity is high and clouds are present. When aerosol water is removed from the analysis in ECHAM6-HAM2 the strength of the susceptibilities of liquid water path, cloud droplet number concentration and cloud albedo as well as ERFaci agree much better with those of AATSR-CAPA or MODIS-CERES. When comparing satellite-derived to model-derived susceptibilities, this study finds it more appropriate to use dry aerosol in the computation of model susceptibilities. We further find that the statistical relationships inferred from different satellite sensors (AATSR-CAPA vs. MODIS-CERES) as well as from ECHAM6-HAM2 are not always of the same sign for the tested environmental conditions. In particular the susceptibility of the liquid water path is negative in non-raining scenes for MODIS-CERES but positive for AATSR-CAPA and ECHAM6-HAM2. Feedback processes like cloud-top entrainment that are missing or not well represented in the model are therefore not well constrained by satellite observations. In addition to aerosol swelling, wet scavenging and aerosol processing have an impact on liquid water path, cloud albedo and cloud droplet number susceptibilities. Aerosol processing leads to negative liquid water path susceptibilities to changes in aerosol index (AI) in ECHAM6-HAM2, likely due to aerosol-size changes by aerosol processing. Our results indicate that for statistical analysis of aerosolcloud interactions the unwanted effects of aerosol swelling, wet scavenging and aerosol processing need to be minimised when computing susceptibilities of cloud variables to changes in aerosol.

In this study, the relationship between the particle pollution over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and weather patterns is investigated. First, the pollution characteristics of particles in the YRD are studied using in situ monitoring data (PM2.5 and PM10) in 16 cities and Terra/MODIS AOD (aerosol optical depth) products collected from December 2013 to November 2014. The results show that the regional mean value of AOD is high in the YRD, with an annual mean value of 0.71 +/- 0.57. The annual mean particle concentrations in the cities of Jiangsu Province all exceed the national air quality standard. The pollution level is higher in inland areas, and the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 are 79 and 130 mu g m(-3), respectively, in Nanjing. The PM2.5 V PM10 ratios are typically high, thus indicating that PM2.5 is the overwhelmingly dominant particle pollutant in the YRD. The wintertime peak of particle concentrations is tightly linked to the increased emissions during the heating season as well as adverse meteorological conditions. Second, based on NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data, synoptic weather classification is conducted and five typical synoptic patterns are objectively identified. Finally, the synthetic analysis of meteorological fields and backward trajectories are applied to further clarify how these patterns impact particle concentrations. It is demonstrated that air pollution is more or less influenced by high-pressure systems. The relative position of the YRD to the anti-cyclonic circulation exerts significant effects on the air quality of the YRD. The YRD is largely influenced by polluted air masses from the northern and the southern inland areas when it is located at the rear of the East Asian major trough. The significant downward motion of air masses results in stable weather conditions, thereby hindering the diffusion of air pollutants. Thus, this pattern is quite favorable for the accumulation of pollutants in the YRD, resulting in higher regional mean PM10 (116.5 +/- 66.9 mu g m(-3)), PM2.5 (75.9 +/- 49.9 mu g m(-3)), and AOD (0.74) values. Moreover, this pattern is also responsible for the occurrence of most large-scale regional PM2.5 (70.4 %) and PM10 (78.3 %) pollution episodes. High wind speed and clean marine air masses may also play important roles in the mitigation of pollution in the YRD. Especially when the clean marine air masses account for a large proportion of all trajectories (i.e., when the YRD is affected by the cyclonic system or oceanic circulation), the air in the YRD has a lesser chance of being polluted. The observed correlation between weather patterns and particle pollution can provide valuable insight into making decisions about pollution control and mitigation strategies.																	1680-7316	1680-7324				NOV 1	2017	17	21					12871	12891		10.5194/acp-17-12871-2017								WOS:000414199400001

Simulation of Optical Properties and Direct and Indirect Radiative Effects of Smoke Aerosols Over Marine Stratocumulus Clouds During Summer 2008 in California With the Regional Climate Model RegCM	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The regional climate model RegCM has been modified to better account for the climatic effects of biomass-burning particles. Smoke aerosols are represented by new tracers with consistent radiative and hygroscopic properties to simulate the direct radiative forcing (DRF), and a new parameterization has been integrated for relating the droplet number concentration to the aerosol concentration for marine stratocumulus clouds (Sc). RegCM has been tested during the summer of 2008 over California, when extreme concentration of smoke, together with the presence of Sc, is observed. This work indicates that significant aerosol optical depth (AOD) (similar to 1-2 at 550nm) is related to the intense 2008 fires. Compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the regional pattern of RegCM AOD is well represented although the magnitude is lower than satellite observations. Comparisons with Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) above-clouds aerosol optical depth (ACAOD) show the ability of RegCM to simulate realistic ACAOD during the transport of smoke above the Pacific Ocean. The simulated single scattering albedo is similar to 0.90 (at 550nm) near biomass-burning sources, consistent with OMI and POLDER, and smoke leads to shortwave heating rates similar to 1.5-2 degrees Kd(-1). RegCM is not able to correctly resolve the daily patterns in cloud properties notably due to its coarse horizontal resolutions. However, the changes in the sign of the DRF at top of atmosphere (TOA) (negative to positive) from clear-sky to all-sky conditions is well simulated. Finally, the "aerosol-cloud" parameterization allows simulating an increase of the cloud optical depth for significant concentrations, leading to large perturbations of radiative fluxes at TOA.

S.; Anand, Vrinda; Axisa, Duncan			Microphysical characteristics of convective clouds over ocean and land from aircraft observations	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement EXperiment (CAIPEEX) is a field campaign conducted in India with an instrumented research aircraft. On 29 October 2010, a cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal persisted throughout the day. A special mission was conducted over the Bay of Bengal on this day with the objective of characterizing marine and continental clouds on the same day and finding contrasting/similar signatures of their microphysical properties. The research aircraft sampled growing convective clouds over the ocean and over land. High concentrations of aerosol and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were observed over land compared to ocean. Over ocean, higher liquid water content (LWC) and lower cloud droplet number concentrations (N-c) were observed, and droplets reached the threshold of precipitation initiation at lower cloud depths. Over land, clouds contained lower LWC and higher N-c, hence droplets did not reach the threshold of precipitation initiation at a warm temperature as in ocean clouds. Over the ocean larger droplets or drizzle were observed at lower cloud depth than over land. The maximum LWC was found to be very similar at higher altitudes. The convective clouds over land were modified by pollution aerosol with contrasting microphysical properties to those over the ocean.																	0169-8095	1873-2895				OCT 1	2017	195						62	71		10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.05.011								WOS:000405050500006

First assessment of MODIS satellite ocean color products (OC3 and nFLH) in the Inner Sea of Chiloe, northern Patagonia	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH					4th Congress of Physical, Meteorological and Clinical Oceanography	NOV 18-20, 2015	Valparaiso, CHILE					The use of remote sensing has allowed enormous progress in our understanding of biophysical processes worldwide. Despite their importance, the use of satellite bio-optical products is still limited due to optical complexity. In this study we assess the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer algorithm for chlorophyll-a (MODIS-OC3) and of normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH), in inner waters of northern Chilean Patagonia (41 degrees-45 degrees S). Satellite data were evaluated using a compilation of in situ chlorophyll-a data collected by the CIMAR-FIORDOS program during 2003-2012. During austral spring MODIS-OC3 showed a significant relationship with in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.2, P = 0.03, F = 5.33) in comparison with winter when the relationship was non-significant. In contrast, nFLH explained a significant fraction of observed variance of Chl-a during austral winter (R2 = 0.54, P = < 0.01, F = 10.68) and this relationship was not significant in spring. Our preliminary results offer an excellent chance to understand patterns of variability of the autotrophic biomass and physiological status in optically complex interior marine ecosystems.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				SEP	2017	45	4					822	827		10.3856/vol45-issue4-fulltext-18								WOS:000410546100018

The chemical compositions, optical properties, and sources of fine aerosol at a high-elevation mountain observatory (4730 m a.s.l.) in the central Tibetan Plateau were measured between 31 May and 1 July 2015. A low flow-rate sampler was used to collect 24-h average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) filter samples. Water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and light absorption by water-soluble BrC were determined for 26 filter samples. The mean (+/- 1 sigma) OC and WSOC concentrations were 0.76 +/- 0.43 and 0.39 +/- 0.15 mu gC/m(3), respectively, and the mean WSOC/OC mass ratio was 0.59 +/- 0.22. The OC and WSOC concentrations were relatively higher (0.59-1.80 and 0.33-0.83 mu gC/m(3), respectively) during the pre-monsoon period (2-13 June) and were relatively lower (0.27-0.77 and 0.12-0.50 mu gC/m(3), respectively) during the monsoon period (14 June to 1 July), probably because of wet scavenging of aerosols during long-range transport and the presence of cleaner marine air masses during the monsoon period. The absorption spectra of PM2.5 water extracts smoothly increase from visible range to ultraviolet range. The absorption ngstrom exponent, which describes the wavelength dependence of water-soluble BrC, was 2.74-10.61 (mean 6.19 +/- 1.70), and its value was similar in the pre-monsoon period (6.57 +/- 0.56) to that in the monsoon period (5.91 +/- 2.14). The water-soluble BrC mass absorption efficiency, 0.38 +/- 0.16 m(2)/(g C), was much lower than those observed in most urban areas but similar to those in other remote sites. Absorption coefficient at 365 nm, typically used as a proxy for water-soluble BrC, correlated well with the WSOC concentration (R-2 = 0.57), K+ concentration (R-2 = 0.75), and organic aerosol biomass burning markers characterized by an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (C2H4O2+ + C3H5O2 (+), R-2 = 0.60). It can be inferred that biomass burning was an important source of water-soluble BrC in the study area combined with air mass back trajectory analysis using the NOAA HYSPLIT as well as MODIS data of fire dots and aerosol optical depths. The water-soluble BrC to BC light absorption (at 365 nm) coefficient ratios were 9-27%.

In this study, our main objective was to determine the contribution of small phytoplankton to the total primary production, which is valuable information for detecting marine ecosystem changes in the Ulleung Basin. The small phytoplankton productivity contributions determined by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived monthly productivities using a phytoplankton community -based productivity algorithm was significantly consistent with the field-measured productivity contributions of small phytoplankton in this study. The daily primary productivity of small phytoplankton ranged from 42.7 to 418.7 mg Cm-2 d(-1) with an average of 172.9 mg Cm-2 d(-1) (S.D. = +/- 61.4 mg C m(-2) d(-1), n = 120), and the annual contribution of small phytoplankton ranged from 19.6% to 28.4% with an average of 23.6% (S.D. = +/- 8.1%) in the Ulleung Basin from 2003 to 2012. Overall, large phytoplankton were a major contributor to the total primary production in the Ulleung Basin (76.4 +/- 8.2%) from 2003 to 2012, which indicates that the Ulleung Basin is a highly productive region. A significantly negative relationship (p < 0.05) was found between the small phytoplankton primary productivity contribution and the annual primary production in this study. This finding revealed that the recent decreasing annual primary production in the Ulleung Basin could be a consequence of the increasing contribution of small phytoplankton. The response of phytoplankton to ongoing climate change depending on different-size phytoplankton compositions should be a subject for further investigation in the Ulleung Basin as a biologically highly productive region in the East Sea.																	0967-0645	1879-0100				SEP	2017	143				SI		54	61		10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.06.007								WOS:000408783900006

Since a high concentrated condition of prey to whales can be obtained by physical structures, the foraging whale distribution can be an indicator of biological hotspot. Our main objective is verifying the coastal upwelling-southwestern East Sea as a productive biological hotspot based on the geographical distribution of minke whales. Among the cetacean research surveys of the National Institute of Fisheries Science since 1999, 9 years data for the minke whales available in the East Sea were used for this study. The regional primary productivity derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used for a proxy of biological productivity. Minke whales observed during the sighting surveys were mostly concentrated in May and found mostly (approximately 70%) in the southwestern coastal areas (< 300 m) where high chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were generally detected. Based on MODIS-derived primary productivity algorithm, the annual primary production (320 g C m(-2) y(-1)) estimated in the southwestern coastal region of the East Sea belongs to the highly productive coastal upwelling regions in the world. A change in the main spatial distribution of minke whales was found in recent years, which indicate that the major habitats of mink whales have been shifted into the north of the common coastal upwelling regions. This is consistent with the recently reported unprecedented coastal upwelling in the mid-eastern coast of Korea. Based on high phytoplankton productivity and high distribution of minke whales, the southwestern coastal regions can be considered as one of biological hotspots in the East Sea. These regions are important for ecosystem dynamics and the population biology of top marine predators, especially migratory whales and needed to be carefully managed from a resource management perspective.																	0967-0645	1879-0100				SEP	2017	143				SI		91	99		10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.06.005								WOS:000408783900010

Cloud occurrences and cloud radiative effects (CREs) from CERES-CALIPSO-CloudSat-MODIS (CCCM) and CloudSat radar-lidar (RL) products	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Two kinds of cloud products obtained from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), CloudSat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are compared and analyzed in this study: Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)-CALIPSO-CloudSat-MODIS (CCCM) product and CloudSat radar-lidar products such as GEOPROF-LIDAR and FLXHR-LIDAR. Compared to GEOPROF-LIDAR, low-level (< 1 km) cloud occurrences in CCCM are larger over tropical oceans because the CCCM algorithm uses a more relaxed threshold of cloud-aerosol discrimination score for CALIPSO Vertical Feature Mask product. In contrast, midlevel (1-8 km) cloud occurrences in GEOPROF-LIDAR are larger than CCCM at high latitudes (>40 degrees). The difference occurs when hydrometeors are detected by CALIPSO lidar but are undetected by CloudSat radar. In the comparison of cloud radiative effects (CREs), global mean differences between CCCM and FLXHR-LIDAR are mostly smaller than 5 W m(-2), while noticeable regional differences are found. For example, CCCM shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) CREs are larger than FXLHR-LIDAR along the west coasts of Africa and America because the GEOPROF-LIDAR algorithm misses shallow marine boundary layer clouds. In addition, FLXHR-LIDAR SW CREs are larger than the CCCM counterpart over tropical oceans away from the west coasts of America. Over midlatitude storm-track regions, CCCM SW and LW CREs are larger than the FLXHR-LIDAR counterpart.

Correlations of oriented ice and precipitation in marine midlatitude low clouds using collocated CloudSat, CALIOP, and MODIS observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In April 2006, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) launched aboard the CALIPSO satellite and into the A-Train constellation of satellites with its transmitter pointed near nadir. This proved problematic due to specular reflection from horizontally oriented ice crystals occurring more frequently than expected. Because the specular backscatter from oriented ice crystals has large attenuated backscatter and almost no depolarization, the standard lidar inversions cannot be applied. To mitigate this issue, the CALIOP transmitter was moved to 3 degrees off nadir in November 2007. Though problematic for global CALIOP retrievals, the sensitivity to oriented ice during the first year of observations provides a unique data set to investigate scenes of this ice crystal signature. This study focuses on the CALIOP-oriented signature that occurs in midlatitude ocean regions whose cloud tops are relatively warm and low, existing below 6km. A significant seasonal dependence is found in the Northern Hemisphere with up to 19% of clouds below 6km yielding specular reflection by CALIOP during the colder months. In contrast, the Southern Hemisphere lacks such seasonal dependence and sees fewer oriented ice crystals. Using collocated CloudSat observations with both CALIOP and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we investigate the correlations of the oriented signature with MODIS cloud properties. Comparing with CloudSat precipitation retrievals, we find that the oriented signature is strongly correlated with surface precipitation with 64% of CALIOP-oriented ice crystal cases precipitating compared to 40% for nonoriented cases.

The OCO-2 oxygen A-band response to liquid marine cloud properties from CALIPSO and MODIS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Spectra of reflected sunlight in the oxygen A-band contain information about cloud properties such as cloud top pressure, optical depth, and pressure thickness. Here we show, for the first time, that high-spectral-resolution A-band Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) spectra respond largely as simulated to the optical properties of water clouds over ocean during November 2015 (N=184,318) using input cloud properties from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). In A-band continuum channels the standard deviation of simulated minus observed radiance is 37%. Selecting horizontally homogeneous clouds to mitigate three-dimensional cloud effects and collocation error with the other satellites, the standard deviation of the residuals is reduced to 18%. Using a look-up table developed from simulations, OCO-2's estimated cloud top pressure for low clouds (P-top>680hPa) has a standard deviation of 61hPa relative to CALIPSO retrievals, and bias is dependent on assumed cloud pressure thickness, with our smallest value being -5hPa. Versus MODIS optical depth, the standard deviation is 9.0 and the bias is -2.0, although these shrink for clouds of styled-content style-type=mathematics 30. These values include collocation error between the different satellites, meaning that they place an upper bound on the OCO-2 retrieval uncertainty. The theoretical precision limit from OCO-2's instrumental uncertainty is shown to be +/- 2.4hPa in above-cloud path and +/- 0.2% in optical depth for a two-channel retrieval. Options for retrieving cloud optical depth, cloud top pressure, and pressure thickness are discussed in the context of a formal OCO-2 cloud property retrieval.

We describe an approach that leverages coincident NASA A-train and the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data to quantify the relationships in the subtropical MBL derived at the native pixel and grid resolution. A new method for observing four subtropical oceanic regions that capture transitions from stratocumulus to trade cumulus is demonstrated, where stratocumulus and cumulus regimes are determined from infrared-based thermodynamic phase. Visible radiances are normally distributed within stratocumulus and are increasingly skewed away from the coast, where trade cumulus dominates. Increases in MBL depth, wind speed, and effective radius (r(e)), and reductions in 700-1000 hPa moist static energy differences and 700 and 850 hPa vertical velocity correspond with increases in visible radiance skewness. We posit that a more robust representation of the cloudy MBL is obtained using visible radiance rather than retrievals of optical thickness that are limited to a smaller subset of cumulus. The method using the combined A-train and MERRA data set has demonstrated that an increase in r(e) within shallow cumulus is strongly related to higher MBL wind speeds that further correspond to increased precipitation occurrence according to CloudSat, previously demonstrated with surface observations. Hence, the combined data sets have the potential of adding global context to process-level understanding of the MBL.

The tendency term dominates the magnitude and phase of the we diurnal cycle, with a secondary role of w, and a modest advective contribution. The peak and minimum in we occur between 20:00-22:00 LT and 9:00-11:00 LT, respectively, in close agreement with the diurnal cycle of turbulence driven by cloud top longwave cooling. Uncertainties in HT and ECMWF fields are assessed with in situ observations and three meteorological reanalysis data sets.

A realistic 3-D cirrus field is generated by the 3DCLOUD model (average optical thickness of 1.4, cloudtop and base altitudes at 10 and 12 km, respectively, consisting of aggregate column crystals of D-eff = 20 mu m), and 3-D thermal infrared radiative transfer (RT) is simulated with the 3DMCPOL code. According to previous studies, differences between 3-D BT computed from a heterogenous pixel and 1-D RT computed from a homogeneous pixel are considered dependent at nadir on two effects: (i) the optical thickness horizontal heterogeneity leading to the plane-parallel homogeneous bias (PPHB) and the (ii) horizontal radiative transport (HRT) leading to the independent pixel approximation error (IPAE). A single but realistic cirrus case is simulated and, as expected, the PPHB mainly impacts the low-spatial-resolution results (above similar to 250 m) with averaged values of up to 5-7 K, while the IPAE mainly impacts the high-spatial-resolution results (below similar to 250 m) with average values of up to 1-2 K. A sensitivity study has been performed in order to extend these results to various cirrus optical thicknesses and heterogeneities by sampling the cirrus in several ranges of parameters. For four optical thickness classes and four optical heterogeneity classes, we have found that, for nadir observations, the spatial resolution at which the combination of PPHB and HRT effects is the smallest, falls between 100 and 250 m. These spatial resolutions thus appear to be the best choice to retrieve cirrus optical properties with the smallest cloud heterogeneity-related total bias in the thermal infrared. For off-nadir observations, the average total effect is increased and the minimum is shifted to coarser spatial resolutions.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variability of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in the Bohai Sea were investigated using 13-year (2000-2012) satellite-derived products from MODIS and SeaWiFS observations. Based on linear regression analysis, the results showed that the entire Bohai Sea experienced an increase in Chl-a on a long-term scale, with the largest increase in the central Bohai Sea and the smallest increase in the Bohai strait. Distinct seasonal patterns of Chl-a existed in different sub-regions of the Bohai Sea. A long-lasting Chl-a peak was observed from May to September in coastal waters (Liaodong bay, Qinhuangdao coast, and Bohai bay) and the central Bohai Sea, whereas Laizhou bay had relatively low Chl-a in early summer. In the Bohai strait, two pronounced Chl-a peaks occurred in March and September, but the lowest Chl-a was in summer. This pattern was quite different from those in other regions of the Bohai Sea. The water column condition (stratified or mixed) was likely an important physical factor that affects the seasonal pattern of Chl-a in the Bohai Sea. Meanwhile, increased human activity (e.g., river discharge) played a significant role in changing the Chl-a distribution in both coastal waters and the central Bohai Sea, especially in summer. The increasing trend of Chl-a in the Bohai Sea might be attributed to the increase in nutrient contents from riverine inputs. The Chl-a dynamics documented in this study provide basic knowledge for the future exploration of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem evolution in the Bohai Sea.

J	Qi, L; Hu, C; Barnes, BB; Lee, Z				Qi, Lin; Hu, Chuanmin; Barnes, Brian B.; Lee, Zhongping			VIIRS captures phytoplankton vertical migration in the NE Gulf of Mexico	HARMFUL ALGAE												In summer 2014, a toxic Karenia brevis bloom (red tide) occurred in the NE Gulf of Mexico, during which vertical migration of K. brevis has been observed from glider measurements. The current study shows that satellite observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can capture changes in surface reflectance and chlorophyll concentration occurring within 2 h, which may be attributed this K. brevis vertical migration. The argument is supported by earlier glider measurements in the same bloom, by the dramatic changes in the VIIRS-derived surface chlorophyll, and by the consistency between the short-term reflectance changes and those reported earlier from field-measured K. brevis vertical migration. Estimates using the quasi-analytical algorithm also indicate significant increases in both total absorption coefficient and backscattering coefficient in two hours. The two observations in a day from a single polar-orbiting satellite sensor are thus shown to be able to infer phytoplankton vertical movement within a short timeframe, a phenomenon difficult to capture with other sensors as each sensor can provide at most one observation per day, and cross-sensor inconsistency may make interpretation of merged-sensor data difficult. These findings strongly support geostationary satellite missions to study short-term bloom dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A MODIS-Derived Value-Added Climatology of Maritime Cloud Liquid Water Path That Conserves Solar Reflectance	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												A dataset is generated from a method to retrieve distributions of cloud liquid water path over partially cloudy scenes. The method was introduced in a 2011 paper by Foster and coauthors that described the theory and provided test cases. Here it has been applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection-5 and collection-6 cloud products, resulting in a value-added dataset that contains adjusted distributions of cloud liquid water path for more than 10 years for marine liquid cloud for both Aqua and Terra. This method adjusts horizontal distributions of cloud optical properties to be more consistent with observed visible reflectance and is especially useful in areas where cloud optical retrievals fail or are considered to be of low quality. Potential uses of this dataset include validation of climate and radiative transfer models and facilitation of studies that intercompare satellite records. Results show that the fit method is able to reduce bias between observed visible reflectance and that derived from optical retrievals by up to an average improvement of 3%. The level of improvement is dependent on several factors, including seasonality, viewing geometry, cloud fraction, and cloud heterogeneity. Applications of this dataset are explored through a satellite intercomparison with PATMOS-x and Global Change Observation Mission-First Water (GCOM-W1; "SHIZUKU'') AMSR-2 and use of a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model. From the 3D Monte Carlo model simulations, albedo biases are found when the method is applied, with seasonal averages that range over 0.02-0.06.																	1558-8424	1558-8432				JUN	2017	56	6					1767	1781		10.1175/JAMC-D-16-0241.1								WOS:000403093300015

Evaluation of Hemispheric Asymmetries in Marine Cloud Radiative Properties	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The hemispheric symmetry of albedo and its contributing factors in satellite observations and global climate models is evaluated. The analysis is performed on the annual mean time scale, on which a bimodality in the joint distribution of albedo and cloud fraction is evident, resulting from tropical and subtropical clouds and midlatitude clouds, respectively. Hemispheric albedo symmetry is not found in individual ocean-only latitude bands; comparing the Northern and Southern Hemisphere (NH and SH), regional mean albedo is higher in the NH tropics and lower in the NH subtropics and midlatitudes than in the SH counterparts. This follows the hemispheric asymmetry of cloud fraction. In midlatitudes and tropics the hemispheric asymmetry in cloud albedo also contributes to the asymmetry in total albedo, whereas in the subtropics the cloud albedo is more hemispherically symmetric. According to the observations, cloud contributions to compensation for higher clear-sky albedo in the NH come primarily from cloud albedo in midlatitudes and cloud amount in the subtropics. Current-generation climate models diverge in their representation of these relationships, but common features of the model-data comparison include weaker-than-observed asymmetry in cloud fraction and cloud albedo in the tropics, weaker or reversed cloud fraction asymmetry in the subtropics, and agreement with observed cloud albedo asymmetry in the midlatitudes. Models on average reproduce the NH-SH asymmetry in total albedo over the 60 degrees S-60 degrees N ocean but show higher occurrence of brighter clouds in the SH compared to observations. The albedo bias in both hemispheres is reinforced by overestimated clear-sky albedo in the models.

J	Oreopoulos, L; Cho, N; Lee, D				Oreopoulos, Lazaros; Cho, Nayeong; Lee, Dongmin			Using MODIS cloud regimes to sort diagnostic signals of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Coincident multiyear measurements of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and radiation at near-global scales are analyzed to diagnose their apparent relationships as suggestive of interactions previously proposed based on theoretical, observational, and model constructs. Specifically, we examine whether differences in aerosol loading in separate observations go along with consistently different precipitation, cloud properties, and cloud radiative effects. Our analysis uses a cloud regime (CR) framework to dissect and sort the results. The CRs come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and are defined as distinct groups of cloud systems with similar covariations of cloud top pressure and cloud optical thickness. Aerosol optical depth used as proxy for aerosol loading comes from two sources, MODIS observations and the MERRA-2 reanalysis, and its variability is defined with respect to local seasonal climatologies. The choice of aerosol data set impacts our results substantially. We also find that the responses of the marine and continental component of a CR are frequently quite disparate. Overall, CRs dominated by warm clouds tend to exhibit less ambiguous signals but also have more uncertainty with regard to precipitation changes. Finally, we find weak, but occasionally systematic covariations of select meteorological indicators and aerosol, which serve as a sober reminder that ascribing changes in cloud and cloud-affected variables solely to aerosol variations is precarious. Plain Language Summary Aerosols are known to affect clouds and rainfall. This study examines whether satellite observations sampled and organized under a new framework can be used to detect the interactions and whether the results are consistent with expectations. The study is more extensive than previous similar efforts and highlights what is feasible and what is still challenging when attempting to find and evaluate signals of the interactions and providing interpretations of the underlying processes.

Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Southern California Bight (SCB), resulting from untreated runoff and pollutants from urban watersheds entering the coastal waters after rainstorms. We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery. A conceptual satellite stormwater runoff monitoring approach is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A comparison of Aqua MODIS ice and liquid water cloud physical and optical properties between collection 6 and collection 5.1: Pixel-to-pixel comparisons	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We compare differences in ice and liquid water cloud physical and optical properties between Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 (C6) and collection 5.1 (C51). The C6 cloud products changed significantly due to improved calibration, improvements based on comparisons with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization, treatment of subpixel liquid water clouds, introduction of a roughened ice habit for C6 rather than the use of smooth ice particles in C51, and more. The MODIS cloud products form a long-term data set for analysis, modeling, and various purposes. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of the changes. Two cases are considered for C6 to C51 comparisons. Case 1 considers pixels with valid cloud retrievals in both C6 and C51, while case 2 compares all valid cloud retrievals in each collection. One year (2012) of level-2 MODIS cloud products are examined, including cloud effective radius (CER), optical thickness (COT), water path, cloud top pressure (CTP), cloud top temperature, and cloud fraction. Large C6-C51 differences are found in the ice CER (regionally, as large as 15m) and COT (decrease in annual average by approximately 25%). Liquid water clouds have higher CTP in marine stratocumulus regions in C6 but lower CTP globally (-5hPa), and there are 66% more valid pixels in C6 (case 2) due to the treatment of pixels with subpixel clouds. Simulated total cloud radiative signatures from C51 and C6 are compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced And Filled (EBAF) product. The C6 CREs compare more closely with the EBAF than the C51 counterparts.

J	Wang, MQ; Hu, CM				Wang, Mengqiu; Hu, Chuanmin			Predicting Sargassum blooms in the Caribbean Sea from MODIS observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Recurrent and significant Sargassum beaching events in the Caribbean Sea (CS) have caused serious environmental and economic problems, calling for a long-term prediction capacity of Sargassum blooms. Here we present predictions based on a hindcast of 2000-2016 observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which showed Sargassum abundance in the CS and the Central West Atlantic (CWA), as well as connectivity between the two regions with time lags. This information was used to derive bloom and nonbloom probability matrices for each 1 degrees square in the CS for the months of May-August, predicted from bloom conditions in a hotspot region in the CWA in February. A suite of standard statistical measures were used to gauge the prediction accuracy, among which the user's accuracy and kappa statistics showed high fidelity of the probability maps in predicting both blooms and nonblooms in the eastern CS with several months of lead time, with overall accuracy often exceeding 80%. The bloom probability maps from this hindcast analysis will provide early warnings to better study Sargassum blooms and prepare for beaching events near the study region. This approach may also be extendable to many other regions around the world that face similar challenges and opportunities of macroalgal blooms and beaching events. Plain Language Summary Blooms of Sargassum seaweed appear to have increased in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean since 2011. These blooms provide important habitats for many marine animals (fish, turtles, shrimps, crabs, etc.) to maintain a healthy marine ecosystem, but large amounts of Sargassum deposition on the beaches have caused numerous problems to the local environment, tourism industry, and economy. There is currently little information on Sargassum distribution and bloom timing, not to mention a forecast system. In this work, based on satellite measurements and statistics, a forecast system has been developed for the Caribbean Sea. From this system, Sargassum blooms in May-August in the Caribbean can be predicted by the end of February, with overall accuracy often exceeding 80% in the eastern Caribbean. The system thus provides at least several months of lead time for the local residents and management agencies to better prepare for potential beaching events. The approach has significant implications for many other regions experiencing macroalgal blooms of either Sargassum or Ulva prolifera.

J	Zibordi, G; Melin, F				Zibordi, Giuseppe; Melin, Frederic			An evaluation of marine regions relevant for ocean color system vicarious calibration	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												System Vicarious Calibration (SVC) is the fundamental process commonly implemented to meet uncertainty requirements in satellite ocean color data. It is performed by applying gain factors, g-factors, to the pre-launch calibration coefficients of the space sensor already corrected for sensitivity decay with time. Mission specific g-factors are determined from top-of-the-atmosphere data computed by propagating highly accurate in situ values of the water-leaving radiance, L-W, to the satellite sensor. Values of L-W from marine regions characterized by oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters and maritime aerosols, high environmental stability and spatial homogeneity, low cloudiness and absence of any source of land contamination, are essential to determine g-factors applicable to the creation of Climate Data Records (CDRs) from multiple ocean color missions. Accounting for the location of existing and potential new SVC fixed sites, marine regions satisfying SVC requirements for the generation of CDRs have been identified through the analysis of satellite data from recent ocean color missions.

In this paper, we present an intercomparison of the MBL cloud properties, namely, cloud liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud-droplet effective radius (CER), among retrievals from the ARM mobile facility and two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products (Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)-MODIS and Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System-MODIS). A total of 63 daytime single-layer MBL cloud cases are selected for intercomparison. Comparison of collocated retrievals indicates that the two MODIS cloud products agree well on both COT and CER retrievals, with the correlation coefficient R>0.95, despite their significant difference in spatial sampling. In both MODIS products, the CER retrievals based on the 2.1 mu m band (CER2.1) are significantly larger than those based on the 3.7 mu m band (CER3.7). The GSFC-MODIS cloud product is collocated and compared with ground-based ARM observations at several temporal-spatial scales. In general, the correlation increases with more precise collocation. For the 63 selected MBL cloud cases, the GSFC-MODIS LWP and COT retrievals agree reasonably well with the ground-based observations with no apparent bias and correlation coefficient R around 0.85 and 0.70, respectively. However, GSFC-MODIS CER3.7 and CER2.1 retrievals have a lower correlation (R similar to 0.5) with the ground-based retrievals. For the 63 selected cases, they are on average larger than ground observations by about 1.5 mu m and 3.0 mu m, respectively. Taking into account that the MODIS CER retrievals are only sensitive to cloud top reduces the bias only by 0.5 mu m.

The global aerosol-cloud first indirect effect estimated using MODIS, MERRA, and AeroCom	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) represent a significant source of forcing uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs). Estimates of radiative forcing due to ACI in Fifth Assessment Report range from -0.5 to -2.5 W m(-2). A portion of this uncertainty is related to the first indirect, or Twomey, effect whereby aerosols act as nuclei for cloud droplets to condense upon. At constant liquid water content this increases the number of cloud droplets (Nd) and thus increases the cloud albedo. In this study we use remote-sensing estimates of Nd within stratocumulus regions in combination with state-of-the-art aerosol reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) to diagnose how aerosols affect Nd. As in previous studies, Nd is related to sulfate mass through a power law relationship. The slope of the log-log relationship between Nd and SO4 in maritime stratocumulus is found to be 0.31, which is similar to the range of 0.2-0.8 from previous in situ studies and remote-sensing studies in the pristine Southern Ocean. Using preindustrial emissions models, the change in Nd between preindustrial and present day is estimated. Nd is inferred to have more than tripled in some regions. Cloud properties from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate the radiative forcing due to this change in Nd. The Twomey effect operating in isolation is estimated to create a radiative forcing of -0.97 +/- 0.23 W m(-2) relative to the preindustrial era.

Satellite remote sensing can be a useful tool for the management of such types of marine hazards, namely oil spills, mainly owing to the synoptic view and the good trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, depending on the specific platform/sensor system used. In this paper, an innovative satellite-based technique for oil spill detection, based on the general robust satellite technique (RST) approach, is presented. It exploits the multi-temporal analysis of data acquired in the visible channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite in order to automatically and quickly detect the presence of oil spills on the sea surface, with an attempt to minimize "false detections" caused by spurious effects associated with, for instance, cloud edges, sun/satellite geometries, sea currents, etc. The oil spill event that occurred in June 2007 off the south coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea has been considered as a test case. The resulting data, the reliability of which has been evaluated by both carrying out a confutation analysis and comparing them with those provided by the application of another independent MODIS-based method, showcase the potential of RST in identifying the presence of oil with a high level of accuracy.

Low-CCN events are defined as 6 h periods with mean N-CCN < 20 cm(-3) (0.1% supersaturation). A total of 47 low-CCN events are identified. Surface, satellite, and reanalysis data are used to explore the meteorological and cloud context for low-CCN air masses. Low-CCN events occur in all seasons, but their frequency was 3 times higher in December-May than during June-November. Composites show that many of the low-CCN events had a common meteorological basis that involves southerly low-level flow and rather low wind speeds at Graciosa. Anomalously low pressure is situated to the west of Graciosa during these events, but back trajectories and lagged SLP composites indicate that low-CCN air masses often originate as cold air outbreaks to the north and west of Graciosa. Low-CCN events were associated with low cloud droplet concentrations (N-d) at Graciosa, but liquid water path (LWP) during low-CCN events was not systematically different from that at other times. Satellite N-d and LWP estimates from MODIS collocated with Lagrangian back trajectories show systematically lower N-d and higher LWP several days prior to arrival at Graciosa, consistent with the hypothesis that observed low-CCN air masses are often formed by coalescence scavenging in thick warm clouds, often in cold air outbreaks.

The South China Sea (SCS) is almost an enclosed marginal sea and is part of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Both of them are tropical marginal seas, and have similar hydrological properties, such as high surface temperature, stable thermocline, deep euphotic zone, etc. Moreover, they are all greatly affected by East Asian monsoon and typhoons. However, there are also several significant differences between them. The current circulation structures in the South China Sea are more complex with significant season variations. A large amount of fresh water through river inputs is one of the remarkable hydrological characteristics in the Bay of Bengal. In addition, the Bay of Bengal has a large volume of precipitation. Therefore, it is naturally interesting to investigate the different response of the marine ecological properties represented by chlorophyll concentration to climate change. The Sea -Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mission have provided a successive, long-term observations of global ocean colorfrom space. In this study, we investigate the Chl-a trends in the BOB and SCS during the SeaWiFS and MODIS observation periods (1998-2010 and 2003-2016), respectively. In 1998-2010, Chl-a increased in the western central basin of BOB, while it decreased in almost all other parts. During 2003-2016, Chl-a significantly increased in the western part of BOB, and reduced in the southern part. In the SCS, Chl-a in almost the whole region increased during the SeaWiFS observation period. In 2003-2016, the major rising trends appeared in China and Vietnam coast, the Beibu Gulf, and the Gulf of Thailand. The Chl-a of the Straits of Malacca and the Karimata Straits showed downward trends. The rise in temperature might be the main cause of the Chl-a decrease in the BOB. The deepened MLD and/or decreasing SST may contribute to the increasing Chl-a of the BOB and SCS. Remarkably, coastal Chl-a has continued to rise over the past 19 years. The freshwater input might have significant effect on it.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104221G	10.1117/12.2278330								WOS:000418795400034

Having a reliable retrieval model is essential to providing frequent and accurate sea surface salinity (SSS) data for marine research. Remote-sensing techniques provide alternatives for SSS data retrieval with its advantages of wide area surveys and real-time monitoring. In the present study, inverse relationship between SSS and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration in the Chinese Bohai Sea was verified. Thus, four simple band ratios of the original remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) used to retrieve the CDOM concentration were compared and tested during SSS retrieval. R-rs (531)/R-rs (551) performed best among the four given band ratios. The model employed here can be applied to derive SSS with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.26 practical salinity units (psu) (R-2 = 0.76). A calibration model was verified using a discrete dataset of the measured SSS and was tested further during mapping of SSS in the Chinese Bohai Sea during 2010-2014. The yielded spatial patterns of SSS were satisfactory and an inverse relationship between SSS and the Yellow River discharge was confirmed.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	23					7357	7373		10.1080/01431161.2017.1375570								WOS:000412545900045

Seabed samples were collected at >350 locations in Australia's western, northern and eastern continental margins during Federal Government surveys (2007-14). Parameters analysed included measures of organic matter (OM) source (delta C-13, delta N-15 and C : N ratios), concentration (percentage total organic carbon, %TOC, and surface area-normalised TOC, OC : SA) and bioavailability (chlorin indices, total reactive chlorins, total oxygen uptake, total sediment metabolism (TSM), sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and SOD and TSM normalised against TOC). The aim of the present study was to summarise these biogeochemical 'baseline' data and make contextualised inferences about processes that govern the observed concentrations. The OM was primarily from marine sources and the OC : SA broadly reflected water column productivity (based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer, MODIS). Approximately 40% of sediments were organic poor by global standards, reflecting seawater oligotrophy; similar to 12% were organic rich due to benthic production, high water column productivity and pockmark formation.

What if MODIS could measure the Q Stokes parameter?	RADIATION PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN	AIP Conference Proceedings				International Radiation Symposium (IRC/IAMAS) - Radiation Processes in the Atmosphere and Ocean	APR 16-22, 2016	Univ Auckland, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	Univ Auckland, Dept Phys, Kipp & Zonen, EKO Instruments Europe B V	Univ Auckland			Simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and surface properties by means of inverse techniques based on a coupled atmosphere-surface radiative transfer model and optimal estimation can yield a considerable improvement in retrieval accuracy based on radiances measured by MERIS, MODIS, and similar instruments compared with traditional methods. There are uniqueness problems associated with radiometric remote sensing measurements (like MERIS/MODIS) that ignore polarization effects, and rely on measuring only the radiance. Use of polarization measurements is particularly important for absorbing aerosols over coastal waters as well as over bright targets such as snow-covered and bare sea ice, where it has proved difficult to retrieve aerosol single-scattering albedo from radiance-only spectrometers such as MERIS and MODIS. We use a vector radiative transfer model for the coupled atmosphere-surface system (C-VRTM) in conjunction with an Optimal Estimation/Levenberg-Marquardt (OE/LM) method to quantify how polarization measurements can be used to overcome the uniqueness problems associated with radianceonly retrieval of aerosol parameters. However, this study also indicates that even for existing radiance-only instruments like MERIS and MODIS and future instrument like OLCI, use of a C-VRTM as a forward model in the inversion can lead to significant enhancement of retrieval capabilities, and facilitate simultaneous retrieval of absorbing aerosols and marine parameters in turbid coastal environments.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1478-5				2017	1810								UNSP 120008	10.1063/1.4975582								WOS:000405218500086

Development of an automated processing system for potential fishing zone forecast	3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON LAPAN-IPB SATELLITE FOR FOOD SECURITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING 2016	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				3rd International Symposium on LAPAN-IPB Satellite for Food Security and Environmental Monitoring (LISAT-FSEM)	OCT 25-26, 2016	Bogor, INDONESIA	Bogor Agr Univ, Ctr Environm Res Res & Community Serv Inst, Directorate Res & Innovat, Natl Inst Aeronaut & Space Indonesia				The Institute for Marine Research and Observation (IMRO) - Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries Republic of Indonesia (MMAF) has developed a potential fishing zone (PFZ) forecast using satellite data, called Peta Prakiraan Daerah Penangkapan Ikan (PPDPI). Since 2005, IMRO disseminates everyday PPDPI maps for fisheries marine ports and 3 days average for national areas. The accuracy in determining the PFZ and processing time of maps depend much on the experience of the operators creating them. This paper presents our research in developing an automated processing system for PPDPI in order to increase the accuracy and shorten processing time. PFZ are identified by combining MODIS sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (CHL) data in order to detect the presence of upwelling, thermal fronts and biological productivity enhancement, where the integration of these phenomena generally representing the PFZ. The whole process involves data download, map geo-process as well as layout that are carried out automatically by Python and ArcPy. The results showed that the automated processing system could be used to reduce the operator's dependence on determining PFZ and speed up processing time.

ZONE STATISTICS OF THE OCEANIC PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY FOR THE TRADITIONAL FISHING AREAS OF THE OPEN SOUTH CHINA SEA BASED ON MODIS PRODUCTS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The South China Sea is one of the most important fishing grounds in China and is also a traditional fishing ground. In order to determine the primary productivity products suitable for various traditional fishing areas, this paper is based on three models of VGPM, Eppley-VGPM and CbPM, we estimate the primary and the average monthly data of marine primary productivity in 8 days, a detailed analysis of the differences in 2006-2015 of these products which the traditional fishing areas in the South China Sea on the interannual and seasonal variation and spatial distribution. The results showed: 1) the years of large interannual variability which three models are estimated to obtain are between 2008 and 2012. At the same time, it has been found that these 5 years is also a frequent occurrence of ENSO events, but the specific regulatory mechanisms need to be further studied, 2) data products estimated by each model which reflected the seasonal pattern of each fishing area have inconsistency, 3) the three models can be used to estimate the characteristics which the coastal and estuarine areas are higher than the open sea area, and deep sea basin is the lowest in space, however the NPP values estimated by the three models are quite different, and the highest estimated value is by Eppley-VGPM model.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1013	1024		10.15666/aeer/1503_10131024								WOS:000403811200074

Scale of inference: on the sensitivity of habitat models for wide-ranging marine predators to the resolution of environmental data	ECOGRAPHY												Understanding and predicting the responses of wide-ranging marine predators such as cetaceans, seabirds, sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and large migratory fish to dynamic oceanographic conditions requires habitat-based models that can sufficiently capture their environmental preferences. Marine ecosystems are inherently dynamic, and animal-environment interactions are known to occur over multiple, nested spatial and temporal scales. The spatial resolution and temporal averaging of environmental data layers are therefore key considerations in modelling the environmental determinants of habitat selection. The utility of environmental data contemporaneous to animal presence or movement (e.g. daily, weekly), versus synoptic products (monthly, seasonal, climatological) is currently debated, as are the trade-offs between near real-time, high resolution and composite (i.e. synoptic, cloud-free) data fields. Using movement simulations with built-in environmental preferences in combination with both modelled and remotely-sensed (ROMS, MODIS-Aqua) sea surface temperature (SST) fields, we explore the effects of spatial and temporal resolution (3-111 km, daily-climatological) in predictive habitat models. Results indicate that models fitted using seasonal or climatological data fields can introduce bias in presence-availability designs based upon animal movement datasets, particularly in highly dynamic oceanographic domains. These effects were pronounced where models were constructed using seasonal or climatological fields of coarse (>0.25 degree) spatial resolution. However, cloud obstruction can lead to significant information loss in remotely-sensed data fields. We found that model accuracy decreased substantially above 70% data loss. In cloudy regions, weekly or monthly environmental data fields may therefore be preferable. These findings have important implications for marine resource management, particularly in identifying key habitats for populations of conservation concern, and in forecasting climate-mediated ecosystem changes.

Satellite-derived CO2 flux in the surface seawater of the Austral Ocean south of Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A step by step algorithm for air-sea CO2 flux (F(CO2)) calculation from satellite parameters is presented in this study. Parameters used for F(CO2) calculation are: (1) sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS Aqua), (2) sea surface salinity (SSS) estimated from MODIS Aqua SST using multiple linear regression, (3) seawater CO2 fugacity (f(CO2sw)) estimated by MODIS Aqua SST and chl-a using feedforward neural networks, (4) atmospheric CO2 fugacity (f(CO2atm)) from the Cape Grim station, and (5) wind speed from the Quick and Advanced Scatterometer (QSCAT and ASCAT). In situ data provided by (1) the Surveillance de l'Ocean Austral - Monitoring the Southern Ocean (SURVOSTRAL) project, (2) the Integrated Marine Observed System (IMOS) project, and (3) Mesures a l'INterface Eau-aiR de la Variabilite des echanges de CO2 (MINERVE) project collected on the research vessel L'Astrolabe, are used to establish and validate the models. These models are then tested using remote sensing data. This work focus on the southern ocean from the south of Australia to the Antarctica coasts (between 43.5 degrees S and 67 degrees S), on the period of spring and Austral summer (from October to March, between 2002/2003 and 2014/2015). In each step, the result's precision of experiments was determined by the root mean square error (RMSE). Results show (1) an improvement of satellite SSS estimation with a precision of +/- 0.16 using SST and latitude, (2) an estimation of f(CO2sw) by satellite data with a good accuracy of +/- 9.45 mu atm (0.96 Pa), and (3) a calculation of F(CO2) using satellite data with a global RMSE of about +/- 3 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1). The interpolated F(CO2) shows that, in the period of austral spring and summer, this region absorbs the atmospheric CO2, and becomes a stronger sink of CO2 throughout the years (from an overall average absorption of about 2 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2002/2003 to about 7 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2014/2015).																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	6					1600	1625		10.1080/01431161.2017.1286054								WOS:000394651500007

Conventional measurements of light attenuation in the PAR domain (K-d(PAR)) is representative for only small areas of water body. Remotely sensed optical imagery can be utilized to monitor K-d(PAR) in large areas of water bodies, based on the relationship between water leaving radiance and K-d(PAR). In this study, six field surveys were conducted over 20 lakes (or reservoirs) across Northeast China from April to September 2015. In order to derive the K-d(PAR) at regional scale, the Landsat/TM/ETM+/OLI and the MODIS daily surface reflectance data (MOD09GA similar to 500 m, Bands 17) were used to establish empirical inversion models. Through multiple stepwise regression analysis, the band difference (Red-Blue) and band ratio (NIR/Red) were used in Landsat imagery modeling, and the band difference (Red-Blue) and ratio (Red/Blue) were used in MODIS imagery modeling. The accuracy of the two models was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation in ten times. The results indicate that the models performed well for both Landsat (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.95, and MRE = 0.33), and MODIS (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.91, and MRE = 0.19) imagery. However, the K-d(PAR) derived by MODIS is slightly higher than that estimated by Landsat (slope = 1.203 and R-2 = 0.972). Consistency of model performance between the MODIS daily (MYDO9G A) and the 8-Day composite reflectance (MYDO9A1) data was verified by K-d(PAR) estimations and regression analysis (slope = 1.044 and R-2 = 0.966). Finally, the spatial and temporal distribution of K-d(PAR) in Northeast China indicated that specific geographical characteristics as well as meteorological alterations can influence K-d(PAR) calibrations. Specifically, we have revealed that the wind speed and algal bloom are the major determinants of K-d(PAR) in Lake Hulun (2050 km(2)) and Xingkai (4412 km(2)).

The intensity of the fire is characterized by the observed Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and this measurement is also used for the calculation of smoke emissions and initial plume rise. Geostationary (MSG-SEVIRI) and orbital instruments (MODIS, MISR) allow the early and accurate recognition of biomass burning episodes providing also information on the specific characteristics of the fire and smoke properties. Analysis of specific smoke dispersion episodes over Greece are performed with the FIREHUB platform incorporating both satellite and modeling techniques. FIREHUB has been developed at the National Observatory of Athens and combines satellite recognition of the initial hot-spots with high resolution Eulerian and Lagrangian atmospheric tools (FLEXPART-WRF) for the description of smoke dispersion. Comparison of smoke dispersion simulations with satellite data (MISR, MODIS) for the fire events of Peloponnese 2007, Evros 2011 and Agion Oros 2012 shows the ability of the system to reproduce complex dispersion patterns and indicates the increased possibility of long range transport of smoke due to the abrupt changes between marine and land PBL.																	2194-5217		978-3-319-35095-0; 978-3-319-35094-3				2017							809	815		10.1007/978-3-319-35095-0_116								WOS:000392385800116

This study evaluated the potential of an oyster Suitability Sites Occurrence Model (SSOM) to predict the status of littoral areas in the future due to sea warming. Data sources comprised Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 7 ETM+. The suitable sites were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 5 (most suitable). In the suitability model, score 5 had the highest proportion (35.8%) of oyster suitability which shrank to 16.2% with a 4 degrees C increase in sea temperature. Future increases in sea temperature are likely to cause shrinkage in the spatial extent of most suitable and suitable oyster sites. Thus changes in marine oyster suitability in littoral zones are predicted to worsen gradually as sea temperatures increase in the future. Differences in the recorded sea temperature of <= 6 degrees C within and between sites may influence spatial variations in oyster habitat due to future sea warming. Such concepts could form an alternative scientific basis for quantification of potential global climate change effects on biodiversity for marine systems policy adaptation analysis, aquaculture potential, and management.

It is based on the operational MODIS algorithm. This paper documents the technical details of this algorithm and evaluates the retrievals for selected marine boundary layer cloud scenes through comparisons with the operational MODIS Data Collection 6 (C6) cloud product. The newly developed, ASTER-specific cloud masking algorithm is evaluated through comparison with an independent algorithm reported in Zhao and Di Girolamo (2006). To validate and evaluate the cloud optical thickness (tau) and cloud effective radius (r(eff)) from ASTER, the high-spatial-resolution ASTER observations are first aggregated to the same 1000m resolution as MODIS. Subsequently, tau(aA) and r(eff, aA) retrieved from the aggregated ASTER radiances are compared with the collocated MODIS retrievals. For overcast pixels, the two data sets agree very well with Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients of R > 0.970. However, for partially cloudy pixels there are significant differences between r(eff, aA) and the MODIS results which can exceed 10 mu m. Moreover, it is shown that the numerous delicate cloud structures in the example marine boundary layer scenes, resolved by the high-resolution ASTER retrievals, are smoothed by the MODIS observations. The overall good agreement between the research-level ASTER results and the operational MODIS C6 products proves the feasibility of MODIS-like retrievals from ASTER reflectance measurements and provides the basis for future studies concerning the scale dependency of satellite observations and three-dimensional radiative effects.

For this objective, daily images of satellite chlorophyll were obtained from 2002 to 2013. Monthly means were calculated for each pixel and then the pixels were grouped by means of the statistical technique of non-hierarchical clustering analysis according to the features of their annual cycle. The outcome of the clustering analysis was validated by comparing the pixel grouping patterns with the spatial distribution of in situ chlorophyll a and nutrients as determined from the available data (about 2900 registers obtained in the 20 m upper seawater layer in 70 sampling stations). Six grouping areas were identified which reproduced the expected zonation according to the distribution of the main mesoscale hydrological structures that modulate the productivity in the study area (oligotrophic gyres and coastal upwelling). The grouping areas presented contrasting chlorophyll a concentrations as well as annual minimum and maximum occurring at different seasonal cycle timing. Seasonal means of in situ chlorophyll a and nitrate and phosphate concentrations calculated for the six grouping areas were significantly correlated, supporting that dissolved inorganic nutrients were the main factor controlling the productivity in the Alboran Sea. Consequently, the grouping of pixels based on satellite data reflected reasonably the underlying mechanisms that control the phytoplankton biomass in the study area. The utility of this technique to define spatial units for eutrophication management is discussed. These units can be used for spatial aggregation of eutrophication indicator data collected from in situ samplings as well as for calculating robust reference values and time trends. Furthermore, the pixel grouping is useful for optimizing the existing monitoring programs as it facilitates the selection and location of sampling stations in order to avoid collection of redundant and/or pointless information.

Microphysical and optical characteristics of these clouds were studied as well as the impact of aerosols on these properties. Microphysical and optical cloud properties were derived using the algorithm SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Clouds). Ground-based in situ measurements of aerosol concentrations and the transport path of air masses at cloud level were investigated as well. The cloud properties were studied in dependence of the prevailing air mass at cloud level and season. We found higher cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) and smaller effective radii (r(eff)) with greater pollution. Median CDNC ranged from 60 cm(-3) in marine air masses to 160 cm(-3) in continental air. Median reff ranged from 8 mu m in polluted conditions to 10 mu m in marine air. Effective droplet size distributions were broader in marine than in continental cases. Cloud optical thickness (COT) and albedo were lower in cleaner air masses and higher in more polluted conditions, with medians ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 and 0.22 to 0.39, respectively. However, calculation of COT and albedo was strongly affected by liquid water path (LWP) and departure from adiabatic conditions. A comparison of SYRSOC results with MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations showed large differences for LWP and COT but good agreement for reff with a linear fit with slope near 1 and offset of -1 mu m.

We aggregated data according to different granularities and estimated climatologies and anomalies. We also studied the phenology of phytoplankton blooms determining bloom starting date and date of maximum concentration. Finally, we estimated and described statistical indexes such as bloom occurrence frequency. The results obtained provide an overview of the evolution and the spatio-temporal variability of chl-a that, in general, and despite its limitations, was complementary and consistent with previous studies based on both satellite and in situ data. This study intended to set the baseline to study algal blooms and their variability in the Argentinian sea, which is valuable information to be included in predictive models related to the occurrence of harmful algal blooms, dynamics of marine system and the effects of global changes over climatic and biogeochemical cycles. In addition, this study also contributes with more up-to-date science data for the future Argentinian and Brazilian SABIA-Mar ocean color mission, which will provide high resolution data (200 m) over the Argentinian coastal zones and continental shelf. Besides the results per se, the relevance of this study is also related to the use of an novel free and open source tool.

Both the observations and simulations focus on the characteristics of the fog extent, boundary layer structure, and meteorological elements near the air-sea interface. Our main results are as follows: (1) The extent of mesoscale sea fog can be well simulated when the sea surface temperature has at least 0.5x0.5 horizontal resolution.

J	Lee, HS; Lee, KS				Lee, Hwa-Seon; Lee, Kyu-Sung			CAPABILITY OF GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE IMAGERY FOR SEA ICE MONITORING IN THE BOHAI AND YELLOW SEAS	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN					22nd International Symposium on Remote Sensing (ISRS)	APR 22-24, 2015	Tainan, TAIWAN	Korean Soc Remote Sensing, Remote Sensing Soc Japan, Chinese Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				On a regional scale, sea ice monitoring is important for marine transportation, fishery, harbor and offshore structures, and weather forecast. In this study, we attempt to analyze the potential of Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images for regional-scale sea ice monitoring. GOCI images obtained from December 2011 to March 2012 were analyzed to evaluate the frequency that sea ice can be observed in the Bohai Sea and the northern Yellow Sea. In this season, the sea ice distribution varies greatly both temporally and spatially. During the approximate 100-day ice period, GOCI provided relatively cloud-free daily images over sea ice 86% in Liaodong Bay and 81% in Seohan Bay. In addition, GOCI was able to provide all eight hourly images from morning to late afternoon with clear condition, which is important for tracking ice drift, for 40 days in Liaodong Bay and 31 days in Seohan Bay. The high temporal resolution of GOCI facilitates short-period monitoring and tracking of sea ice. We also proposed a simple method to detect and delineate the sea ice area (SIA) from the GOCI images. A simple standard deviation filtering enhanced the spatial variability between the sea ice and open water and was very effective in separating SIA from sea water.																	1023-2796					DEC	2016	24	6					1129	1135		10.6119/JMST-016-1026-1								WOS:000391418600010

Quantifying the human influence on fire ignition across the western USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Humans have a profound effect on fire regimes by increasing the frequency of ignitions. Although ignition is an integral component of understanding and predicting fire, to date fire models have not been able to isolate the ignition location, leading to inconsistent use of anthropogenic ignition proxies. Here, we identified fire ignitions from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area Product (2000-2012) to create the first remotely sensed, consistently derived, and regionally comprehensive fire ignition data set for the western United States. We quantified the spatial relationships between several anthropogenic land-use/disturbance features and ignition for ecoregions within the study area and used hierarchical partitioning to test how the anthropogenic predictors of fire ignition vary among ecoregions. The degree to which anthropogenic features predicted ignition varied considerably by ecoregion, with the strongest relationships found in the Marine West Coast Forest and North American Desert ecoregions. Similarly, the contribution of individual anthropogenic predictors varied greatly among ecoregions. Railroad corridors and agricultural presence tended to be the most important predictors of anthropogenic ignition, while population density and roads were generally poor predictors. Although human population has often been used as a proxy for ignitions at global scales, it is less important at regional scales when more specific land uses (e.g., agriculture) can be identified. The variability of ignition predictors among ecoregions suggests that human activities have heterogeneous impacts in altering fire regimes within different vegetation types and geographies.

Global observations of cloud-sensitive aerosol loadings in low-level marine clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol-cloud interaction is a key component of the Earth's radiative budget and hydrological cycle, but many facets of its mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, global satellite-derived aerosol and cloud products are used to identify at what aerosol loading cloud droplet size shows the greatest sensitivity to changes in aerosol loading (ACS(max)). While, on average, cloud droplet size is most sensitive at relatively low aerosol loadings, distinct spatial and temporal patterns exist. Possible determinants for these are identified with reanalysis data. The magnitude of ACS(max) is found to be constrained by the total columnar water vapor. Seasonal patterns of water vapor are reflected in the seasonal patterns of ACS(max). Also, situations with enhanced turbulent mixing are connected to higher ACS(max), possibly due to intensified aerosol activation. Of the analyzed aerosol species, dust seems to impact ACS(max) the most, as dust particles increase the retrieved aerosol loading without substantially increasing the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei.

For this purpose, a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees gridded MODIS dataset was compiled and validated against sun photometric observations from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). The high spatial resolution and long temporal coverage of the dataset allows for the determination of local hot spots like megacities, medium-sized cities, industrial zones and power plant complexes, seasonal variabilities and decadal averages. The average AOD at 550 nm (AOD(550)) for the entire region is similar to 0.22 +/- 0.19, with maximum values in summer and seasonal variabilities that can be attributed to precipitation, photochemical production of secondary organic aerosols, transport of pollution and smoke from biomass burning in central and eastern Europe and transport of dust from the Sahara and the Middle East. The MODIS data were analyzed together with data from other satellite sensors, reanalysis projects and a chemistry-aerosol-transport model using an optimized algorithm tailored for the region and capable of estimating the contribution of different aerosol types to the total AOD(550). The spatial and temporal variability of anthropogenic, dust and fine-mode natural aerosols over land and anthropogenic, dust and marine aerosols over the sea is examined. The relative contribution of the different aerosol types to the total AOD(550) exhibits a low/high seasonal variability over land/sea areas, respectively. Overall, anthropogenic aerosols, dust and fine-mode natural aerosols account for similar to 51, similar to 34 and similar to 15% of the total AOD(550) over land, while, anthropogenic aerosols, dust and marine aerosols account similar to 40, similar to 34 and similar to 26% of the total AOD(550) over the sea, based on MODIS Terra and Aqua observations.

This effort includes comparing quantities estimated from float and satellite data at nominal wavelengths of 412, 443, 488, and 555 nm, and examining sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in the float estimates. This study had 65 occurrences of coincident high-quality observations from floats and MODIS Aqua and 15 occurrences of coincident high-quality observations floats and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The float estimates of remote sensing reflectance are similar to the satellite estimates, with disagreement of a few percent in most wavelengths. The variability of the float-satellite comparisons is similar to the variability of in situ-satellite comparisons using a validation dataset from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY). This, combined with the agreement of float-based and satellite-based quantities, suggests that floats are likely a good platform for validation of satellite-based estimates of remote sensing reflectance.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.				van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013; Simon, Carine/L-1219-2014	van der Woerd, Hans/0000-0002-8901-7567; Simon, Carine/0000-0001-9951-5132; Bardaji, Raul/0000-0002-0803-3427; Piera, Jaume/0000-0001-5818-9836; Wernand, Marcel R./0000-0002-1331-9569												2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							879	10.3390/rs8110879								WOS:000388798400001

In this work, the Robust Satellite Techniques (RST) approach has been implemented and tested on historical series of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to monitor, for the first time, Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) anomalies associated to river plumes. To this aim, MODIS-Aqua Level 1A data were processed using an atmospheric correction adequate for coastal waters, and SPM daily maps were generated applying an algorithm adapted from literature. The RST approach was then applied to these maps to assess the anomalous presence of SPM. The study area involves the Basilicata region coastal waters (Ionian Sea, South of Italy). A long-time analysis (2003-2015) conducted for the month of December allows us to find that the maximum SPM concentration value was registered in December 2013, when an extreme hydrological event occurred. A short-time analysis was then carried out applying RST to monitor the dynamics of anomalous SPM concentrations. Finally, the most exposed areas, in terms of SPM concentration, were identified. The results obtained in this work showed the RST high potential when used in combination with standard SPM daily maps to better characterize and monitor coastal waters.

An oceanographic survey for oil spill monitoring and model forecasting validation using remote sensing and in situ data in the Mediterranean Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A research cruise was organized on board the Italian National Research Council (CNR) RN Urania to test the oil spill monitoring system developed during the PRogetto pilota Inquinamento Marino da Idrocarburi project (PRIMI, pilot project for marine oil pollution). For the first time, this system integrated in a modular way satellite oil spill detection (Observation Module) and oil spill displacement forecasting (Forecast Module) after detection. The Observation Module was based on both Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) and optical satellite detection, namely SAR and Optical Modules, while the Forecast Module on Lagrangian numerical circulation models. The cruise (Aug. 6-Sep. 7, 2009) took place in the Mediterranean Sea, around Sicily, an area affected by heavy oil tanker traffic with frequent occurrence of oil spills resulting from illegal tank washing. The cruise plan was organized in order to have the ship within the SAR image frames selected for the cruise, at acquisition time. In this way, the ship could rapidly reach oil slicks detected in the images by the SAR Module, and/or eventually by the Optical Module, in order to carry out visual and instrumental inspection of the slicks. During the cruise, several oil spills were detected by the two Observation Modules and verified in situ, with the essential aid of the Forecasting Module which provided the slick position by the time the ship reached the area after the alert given by the SAR and/or optical imagery. Results confirm the good capability of oil spill SAR detection and indicate that also optical sensors are able to detect oil spills, ranging from thin films to slicks containing heavily polluted water. Also, results confirm the useful potential of oil spill forecasting models, but, on the other hand, that further work combining satellite, model and in situ data is necessary to refine the PRIM! system.

J	Trepekli, A; Loupa, G; Rapsomanikis, S				Trepekli, Aikaterini; Loupa, Glykeria; Rapsomanikis, Spyridon			Seasonal evapotranspiration, energy fluxes and turbulence variance characteristics of a Mediterranean coastal grassland	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												A hydrological year of evapotranspiration (ET) and energy exchanges, for a coastal grassland in the Mediterranean-climate of Greece, are reported. Throughout the growing season, available energy (R-net-G) was transformed to latent heat flux by 67% while during the senescence period the turbulent exchange was dominated by sensible heat flux accounting for 80.42% of (R-net-G). Evapotranspiration reached maxima of 8.2 mm d(-1) in July while it was negligible during winter. The annual hydrological excess equalled 200 mm y(-1). Variation in water exchange depended primarily on (R-net-G) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). A significant positive linear correlation was found between values of ET and R-net-G on a monthly timescale. The monthly mean ET had also a positive correlation with the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Additionally, the bulk characteristics of the canopy, decoupling coefficient (Omega) and the daytime mean Priestley-Taylor (alpha) coefficient exhibited seasonal variations with higher values occurring in the rapid emergent period. Annual Omega was nearly 0.50, indicating that the surface was partially decoupled with the atmosphere. Given that this ecosystem is characterized by occasional flooding, the annual mean value of alpha was 0.52 implying seasonal growth limitation to transpiration. The impact of different wind origins on evapotranspiration was observed. ET was smaller than expected for winds of marine origin because of its response to small VPDs and the presence of sea salt aerosol. The results of the present study effected the explanation of the temporal patterns of ET in relation to the landscape of a Mediterranean coastal grassland and its meteorological and physiological characteristics.

Also, some coastal systems are characterized by the occurrence of large amounts of mucilaginous material of biologic origin (i.e. phytoplankton, bacteria), which aggregates and potentially traps other organisms and particles present in the water column. This study focuses on POM origin and spatio-temporal dynamics in the South-East coast of the Bay of Biscay, an area subject to mucilage occurrence. In order to investigate POM quantitative and qualitative (C and N elemental and isotopic ratios) characteristics, sampling was performed over an annual cycle at two sites experiencing different mucilage occurrence and river influence. Contribution of phytoplankton, terrestrial POM and anthropogenic POM to coastal-POM composition was calculated using a three-sources mixing model. Overall, phytoplankton dominated the coastal-POM composition at all seasons, sites and most of the depths (71.6 +/- 24.2%). Terrestrial-POM contribution was moderate (22.7 +/- 21.8%) and anthropogenic-POM contribution was usually negligible (5.7 +/- 7.4%). Both sites mainly exhibited similar vertical and temporal variations in terms of POM origin and dynamics: terrestrial-POM contribution increased with depth and was higher in winter at all depths and in autumn in bottom waters, compared to other seasons. The main differences between both sites were related to the vertical dynamics of the terrestrial contribution to the coastal POM. Horizontal, vertical and temporal variation of POM composition was linked to processes driving the sedimentary hydrodynamics: the river flow, the direction of the river plume and events of sediment resuspension/deposition. During the study period, the mucilage occurred only as flocs (small aggregates). The mucilage was of autochthonous origin and did not trap detectable amount of allochthonous material.

A massive Cochlodiniurn polykrikoids RT began in the eastern Persian Gulf (PG) in October 2008 and extended to the northern PG in December 2008. It killed large fish and hampered marine industries and water desalination appliances. Yet monthly averages of satellite-derived Chl-a (Chlorophyll-a), nFLH (normalized Fluorescence Line Height), and K-d(490) (diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm) have not been compared in the PG. MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor provides global coverage, with short revisit time, and accessible, well validated ocean color products. This study compares the behavior of MODIS Chl-a, nFLH, and K-d(490) in both normal and RT conditions. In doing so, their color maps are shown during normal and RT periods. Then, monthly variations of these products are shown as time series between 2002 and 2008. HOCI (Hybrid Ocean Color Index) is defined by integrating these products to detect RT affected areas. The results gained from 100 locations in the PG show that HOCI >0.18 mW cm(-2) sr(-1) sr(-1) mg m(-4) and nFLH >0.04 mW cm(-2) gm(-1) mu m(-1) sr(-1) discriminates non-bloom waters from algal blooms. R-rs(443)/R-rs(412) > 1 is a proper statement to separate Trichodesmium erythtraeum from Noctiluca millaris, Noctiluca scintillans, and diatoms. R-rs(667)/R-rs(443) > 1 can differentiate Cochlodinium polykrikoids from T. erythtraeum, N. millaris, N. scintillans, and diatoms as well. So, the combination of HOCI and R-rs(667)/R-rs(443) ratio is useful for detection and quantization of C. polykrikoids. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Geospatial approach towards enumerative analysis of suspended sediment concentration for Ganges-Brahmaputra Bay	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												This study presents an easy, modular, user-friendly, and flexible software package for processing of Landsat 7 ETM and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS data for estimating suspended particulate matter concentrations in the coastal waters. This package includes 1) algorithm developed using freely downloadable SCILAB package, 2) ERDAS Models for iterative processing of Landsat images and 3) ArcMAP tool for plotting and map making. Utilizing SCILAB package, a module is written for geometric corrections, radiometric corrections and obtaining normalized water-leaving reflectance by incorporating Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. Using ERDAS models, a sequence of modules are developed for iterative processing of Landsat images and estimating suspended particulate matter concentrations. Processed images are used for preparing suspended sediment concentration maps. The applicability of this software package is demonstrated by estimating and plotting seasonal suspended sediment concentration maps off the Bengal delta. The software is flexible enough to accommodate other remotely sensed data like Ocean Color monitor (OCM) data, Indian Remote Sensing data (IRS), MODIS data etc. by replacing a few parameters in the algorithm, for estimating suspended sediment concentration in coastal waters.

In this study, we explore the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data (MODIS, MODO9Q1 and MYDO9Q1 products, red (R) and near infrared (NIR) bands) to monitor turbidity and SSSC for the Bagre Reservoir in Burkina Faso. High values of these parameters associated with high spatial and temporal variability potentially challenge the methodologies developed so far for less turbid waters. Field measurements (turbidity, SSSC, radiometry) are used to evaluate different radiometric indices. The NIR/R ratio is found to be the most suited to retrieve SSSC and turbidity for both in-situ spectoradiometer measurements and satellite reflectance from MODIS. The spatio temporal variability of MODIS NIR/R together with rainfall estimated by the Tropical Rainforest Measuring Mission (TRMM) and altimetry data from Jason-2 is analyzed over the Bagre Reservoir for the 2000-2015 period. It is found that rain events of the early rainy season (February-March) through mid-rainy season (August) are decisive in triggering turbidity increase. Sediment transport is observed in the reservoir from upstream to downstream between June and September. Furthermore, a significant increase of 19% in turbidity values is observed between 2000 and 2015, mainly for the July to December period. It is especially well marked for August, with the central and downstream areas showing the largest increase. The most probable hypothesis to explain this evolution is a change in land use, and particularly an increase in the amount of bare soils, which enhances particle transport by runoff.

Arabian Red Sea coastal soils as potential mineral dust sources	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) satellite observations suggest that the narrow heterogeneous Red Sea coastal region is a frequent source of airborne dust that, because of its proximity, directly affects the Red Sea and coastal urban centers. The potential of soils to be suspended as airborne mineral dust depends largely on soil texture, moisture content and particle size distributions. Airborne dust inevitably carries the mineralogical and chemical signature of a parent soil. The existing soil databases are too coarse to resolve the small but important coastal region. The purpose of this study is to better characterize the mineralogical, chemical and physical properties of soils from the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain, which in turn will help to improve assessment of dust effects on the Red Sea, land environmental systems and urban centers. Thirteen surface soils from the hot-spot areas of windblown mineral dust along the Red Sea coastal plain were sampled for analysis. Analytical methods included optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), ion chromatography (IC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle size analysis (LPSA). We found that the Red Sea coastal soils contain major components of quartz and feldspar, as well as lesser but variable amounts of amphibole, pyroxene, carbonate, clays and micas, with traces of gypsum, halite, chlorite, epidote and oxides. The range of minerals in the soil samples was ascribed to the variety of igneous and metamorphic provenance rocks of the Arabian Shield forming the escarpment to the east of the Red Sea coastal plain. The analysis revealed that the samples contain compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus and iron that are essential nutrients to marine life. The analytical results from this study will provide a valuable input into dust emission models used in climate, marine ecology and air quality studies.

J	Wang, MH; Shi, W; Jiang, LD; Voss, K				Wang, Menghua; Shi, Wei; Jiang, Lide; Voss, Kenneth			NIR- and SWIR-based on-orbit vicarious calibrations for satellite ocean color sensors	OPTICS EXPRESS												The near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction algorithms are used in satellite ocean color data processing, with the SWIR-based algorithm particularly useful for turbid coastal and inland waters. In this study, we describe the NIR-and two SWIR-based on-orbit vicarious calibration approaches for satellite ocean color sensors, and compare results from these three on-orbit vicarious calibrations using satellite measurements from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP). Vicarious calibration gains for VIIRS spectral bands are derived using the in situ normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w)(lambda) spectra from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) in waters off Hawaii. The SWIR vicarious gains are determined using VIIRS measurements from the South Pacific Gyre region, where waters are the clearest and generally stable. Specifically, vicarious gain sets for VIIRS spectral bands of 410, 443, 486, 551, and 671 nm derived from the NIR method using the NIR 745 and 862 nm bands, the SWIR method using the SWIR 1238 and 1601 nm bands, and the SWIR method using the SWIR 1238 and 2257 nm bands are (0.979954, 0.974892, 0.974685, 0.965832, 0.979042), (0.980344, 0.975344, 0.975357, 0.965531, 0.979518), and (0.980820, 0.975609, 0.975761, 0.965888, 0.978576), respectively. Thus, the NIR-based vicarious calibration gains are consistent with those from the two SWIR-based approaches with discrepancies mostly within similar to 0.05% from three data processing methods. In addition, the NIR vicarious gains (745 and 862 nm) derived from the two SWIR methods are (0.982065, 1.00001) and (0.981811, 1.00000), respectively, with the difference similar to 0.03% at the NIR 745 nm band. This is the fundamental basis for the NIR-SWIR combined atmospheric correction algorithm, which has been used to derive improved satellite ocean color products over open oceans and turbid coastal/ inland waters. Therefore, a unified vicarious gain set for VIIRS bands M1-M8 and M10-M11 has been implemented in the VIIRS ocean color data processing. Using the unified vicarious gain set, VIIRS mission-long ocean color data have been successfully reprocessed using the NIR-, SWIR-, and NIR-SWIR-based atmospheric correction algorithms.

Here, using continuous 3-dimensional measurements by an ocean glider across a K. brevis bloom in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico between 1 and 8 August 2014, we show the vertical migration behavior of K brevis. Within the bloom where K. brevis concentration is between 100,000 and 1,000,000 cells L-1, the stratified water shows a two-layer system with the depth of pycnocline ranging between 14-20 m and salinity and temperature in the surface layer being <34.8 and >28 degrees C, respectively. The bottom layer shows the salinity of >36 and temperature of <26 degrees C. The low salinity is apparently due to coastal runoff, as the top layer also shows high amount of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Within the top layer, chlorophyll-a fluorescence shows clear diel changes in the vertical structure, an indication off( brevis vertical migration at a mean speed of 0.5-1 m h(-1). The upward migration appears to start at sunrise at a depth of 8-10 m, while the downward migration appears to start at sunset (or when surface light approaches 0) at a depth of 2 m. These vertical migrations are believed to be a result of the need of K. brevis cells for light and nutrients in a stable, stratified, and CDOM-rich environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a hybrid method, including analytical, semianalytical, and empirical steps, is developed to estimate PSD through the median diameter of suspended particles (D-v(50)). Four cruise surveys were conducted to measure optical scattering properties, particle concentrations, spectral reflectance, and particle-size distributions (obtained with a LISST instrument covering a size range of 2.5-500 mu m) in coastal waters of Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and Jiangsu coastal region. Based on the Mie scattering theory, D-v(50) is closely related to massspecific backscattering coefficient of suspended particles (b(bp)*), and their relationship is calibrated through a power model (R-2=0.796, n = 67, p< 0.001) for the D-v(50) range of 23.5-379.8 lm. The model is shown to perform better than the previously used inverse-proportion model. The retrieval of b(bp)* is through a bio-optical model that links remote sensing reflectance just beneath the surface to inherent optical properties, where a close empirical relationship is established between particulate backscattering and particle concentration. The hybrid method shows high degree of fitting (R-2 = 0.875, n = 46, p < 0.001) between the measured and estimated D-v(50) for the size range of 17.2-325.2 lm used in the model calibration, while validation using two independent data sets shows mean absolute percentage errors of 46.0% and 64.7%, respectively. Application of the hybrid method to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data results in spatial distributions of D-v(50) that are generally consistent with those from in situ observations, suggesting potential use of the method in studying particle dynamics through time series of remote sensing observations. However, its general applicability to other regions still requires further research.

J	Ohashi, Y; Iida, T; Sugiyama, S; Aoki, S				Ohashi, Yoshihiko; Iida, Takahiro; Sugiyama, Shin; Aoki, Shigeru			Spatial and temporal variations in high turbidity surface water off the Thule region, northwestern Greenland	POLAR SCIENCE					4th International Symposium for Arctic Science (ISAR) / 3rd International Conference for Arctic Research Planning (ICARP) held as the Science Symposium of the Arctic Science Summit Week	APR 27-30, 2015	Toyama, JAPAN					Glacial meltwater discharge from the Greenland ice sheet and ice caps forms high turbidity water in the proglacial ocean off the Greenland coast. Although the timing and magnitude of high turbidity water export affect the coastal marine environment, for example, through impacts on biological productivity, little is known about the characteristics of this high turbidity water. In this paper, we therefore report on the spatial and temporal variations in high turbidity water off the Thule region in northwestern Greenland, based on remote sensing, reflectance data at a wavelength of 555 nm (Rrs555). The high turbidity area, identified on the basis of high reflectivity (Rrs555 >= 0.0070 sr(-1)), was generally distributed near the coast, where many outlet glaciers terminate in the ocean and on land. The extent of the high turbidity area exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variability, and its annual maximum extent was significantly correlated with summer air temperature. Assuming a linear relationship between the high turbidity area and summer temperature, annual maximum extent increases under the influence of increasing glacial meltwater discharge, as can be inferred from present and predicted future warming trends.

J	Wang, MH; Son, S				Wang, Menghua; Son, SeungHyun			VIIRS-derived chlorophyll-a using the ocean color index method	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An implementation approach using the ocean color index (OCI)-based chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) algorithm for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) has been developed. The OCI Chl-a algorithm for satellite-derived Chl-a data was originally developed by Hu, Lee, and Franz (2012) (J. Geophys. Res., 117, C01011, doi: 01010.01029/02011JC007395) for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It uses two Chl-a algorithms, i.e., the color index (CO-based (reflectance difference-based) algorithm for oligotrophic waters and the usual ocean chlorophyll-type (OCx)-based (reflectance ratio-based) algorithm (e.g., OO3M for MODIS and OC3V for VIIRS), and merges the two algorithms for different Chl-a range applications (named OCI algorithm). In this study, we use the in situ Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) optics data to demonstrate conclusively that using the OCI-based Chl-a algorithm can significantly improve VIIRS Chl-a data over oligotrophic waters with much reduced data noise from instrument calibration and the imperfect atmospheric correction. Using the VIIRS-measured global Chl-a data derived from the Multi Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, we have developed the Cl-based algorithm specifically for VIIRS, and further improved the two Chl-a algorithms merging method using the blue-green reflectance ratio values. Extensive evaluation results show that the new OCI Chl-a algorithm for VIIRS can produce consistent Chl-a data compared with those from the OC3V algorithm. In particular, the data transition between the CI-based and OC3V-based Chl-a algorithm is quite smooth, and there are no obvious discontinuities in VIIRS-derived Chl-a data. The new OCI-based Chl-a algorithm has been implemented in MSL12 for routine production of VIIRS global Chl-a data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here we assess, from up-to-date and long-term observations, the SO2 emission of the Ambrym volcano, one of the dominant volcanoes in the MVA, and we investigate its role as sulfate precursor on the regional distribution of aerosols, using both satellite observations and model results at 1 x 1 spatial resolution from WRF-Chem/GOCART. Without considering aerosol forcing on clouds, our model parameterizations for convection, vertical mixing and cloud properties provide a reliable chemical weather representation, making possible a cross-examination of model solution and observations. This preliminary work enables the identification of biases and limitations affecting both the model (missing sources) and satellite sensors and algorithms (for aerosol detection and classification) and leads to the implementation of improved transport and aerosol processes in the modeling system. On the one hand, the model confirms a 50% underestimation of SO2 emissions due to satellite swath sampling of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), consistent with field studies. The OMI irregular sampling also produces a level of noise that impairs its monitoring capacity during short-term volcanic events. On the other hand, the model reveals a large sensitivity on aerosol composition and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) due to choices of both the source function in WRF-Chem and size parameters for sea-salt in FIexAOD, the post-processor used to compute offline the simulated AOD. We then proceed to diagnosing the role of SO2 volcanic emission in the regional aerosol composition. The model shows that both dynamics and cloud properties associated with the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) have a large influence on the oxidation of SO2 and on the transport pathways of volcanic species across the South Pacific atmosphere. For example, in the tropical cloudy air, the sulfate production in the aqueous phase is very efficient, resulting in the formation of a large cloud of highly scattering sulfate aerosols advected horizontally to Eastern Indonesia, in agreement with the AOD feature captured by MODIS/Aqua, but missed in CALIOP/CALIPSO (lidar) products. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that aerosol re-suspension due to evaporating droplets is a significant pathway for the supply of volcanic sulfur species in the remote marine boundary layer. By strongly modulating the irreversible loss due to wet scavenging, this aerosol process has a similar influence on the sulfur burden as natural emission from volcanoes or biogenic sources like dimethyl sulfate (DMS). The results emphasize the importance of MVA passive degassing and SPCZ dynamics on the aerosol background, and raise questions about potential impacts on the local climate and marine ecosystems.

Time Scales of Clouds and Cloud-Controlling Variables in Subtropical Stratocumulus from a Lagrangian Perspective	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The Lagrangian evolution of cloud cover and cloud-controlling variables is well approximated using red noise processes with different autocorrelation time scales for each variable. Trajectories within the subtropical marine boundary layer are generated using winds from ECMWF Re-Analysis data for low cloud decks in four eastern subtropical ocean basins. Cloud cover, liquid water path, and boundary layer depth are sampled at 12-h intervals using A-Train satellites, and droplet concentration is sampled every 24 h. Lower-tropospheric stability and vertical velocity are sampled concurrently using reanalysis data. Samples are converted to seasonal and diurnal anomalies. Data are spatially averaged over a range of length scales. The e-folding decay times tau for autocorrelation are calculated for each variable based on lag times of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Using lag 24 h and an averaging radius of 100 km, tau approximate to 15-17 h for liquid water path and vertical velocity, tau approximate to 19 h for cloud cover, tau approximate to 24-25 h for boundary layer depth and droplet concentration, and tau approximate to 53 h for lower-tropospheric stability. Time scales vary somewhat between regions and are shortest in the eastern Indian Ocean. Decay time t increases with averaging scale and the autocorrelation e-folding length of a variable at a fixed time. Diurnal analysis shows cloud cover anomalies have a stronger memory during morning breakup, while other variables show stronger memory as clouds reform in the evening. Lagrangian cloud anomalies are less persistent than anomalies at a fixed location. For the latter, estimated t values can vary significantly at different lag times, so a red noise assumption is inappropriate.

To detect and monitor sea fog, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data which is capable to provide spatial distribution of sea fog has been used. The previous automatic sea fog detection algorithms were focused on detecting sea fog using Terra/MODIS only. The improved algorithm is based on the sea fog detection algorithm by Wu and Li (2014) and it is applicable to both Terra and Aqua MODIS data. We have focused on detecting spring season sea fog events in the Yellow Sea. The algorithm includes application of cloud mask product, the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), the STandard Deviation test using infrared channel (STDIR) with various window size, Temperature Difference Index(TDI) in the algorithm (BTCT -SST) and Normalized Water Vapor Index (NWVI). Through the calculation of the Hanssen-Kuiper Skill Score (KSS) using sea fog manual detection result, we derived more suitable threshold for each index. The adjusted threshold is expected to bring higher accuracy of sea fog detection for spring season daytime sea fog detection using MODIS in the Yellow Sea.																	1225-6161	2287-9307				AUG	2016	32	4					339	351		10.7780/kjrs.2016.32.4.1								WOS:000408869900001

Subglacial hydrology at Rink Isbrae, West Greenland inferred from sediment plume appearance	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY					International Symposium on Hydrology of Glaciers and Ice Sheets	JUN, 2015	Hofn, ICELAND	Univ Iceland, Univ Iceland, Inst Earth Sci, Iceland Meteorol Off, Natl Power Co Iceland, Iceland Road & Coastal Adm, Iceland Glaciol Soc, Geoscience Soc Iceland				Marine-terminating outlet glaciers discharge most of the Greenland ice sheet's mass through frontal ablation and meltwater runoff. While calving can be estimated by in situ and remote sensing observations, submarine melting and subglacial meltwater transport are more challenging to quantify. Here we investigate the subglacial hydrology of Rink Isbrae, a fast-flowing West Greenland tidewater glacier, using time-lapse photography, modeled runoff estimates and daily satellite imagery from 2007 to 2011. We find that sediment plumes appear episodically at four distinct locations across the terminus, and last between 2 h and 17 d. This suggests short-term variability in discharge and the existence of persistent pathways. The seasonal onset of sediment plumes occurs before supraglacial lake drainages, shortly after the onset of runoff, and only after the wintertime ice melange has begun disintegrating. Plumes were also visible after the cessation of runoff (23 +/- 5 d), which is indicative of subglacial storage. The lack of either a seasonal velocity change or a correspondence between meltwater availability and plume occurrence suggests that the subglacial system persists in a state of inefficient drainage. Subglacial hydrology at tidewater glaciers is of critical importance in understanding dynamics at the ice front.

Monte Carlo Bayesian inference on a statistical model of sub-gridcolumn moisture variability using high-resolution cloud observations. Part 2: Sensitivity tests and results	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Part 1 of this series presented a Monte Carlo Bayesian method for constraining a complex statistical model of global circulation model (GCM) sub-gridcolumn moisture variability using high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud data, thereby permitting parameter estimation and cloud data assimilation for large-scale models. This article performs some basic testing of this new approach, verifying that it does indeed reduce mean and standard deviation biases significantly with respect to the assimilated MODIS cloud optical depth, brightness temperature and cloud-top pressure and that it also improves the simulated rotational-Raman scattering cloud optical centroid pressure (OCP) against independent (non-assimilated) retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Of particular interest, the Monte Carlo method does show skill in the especially difficult case where the background state is clear but cloudy observations exist. In traditional linearized data assimilation methods, a subsaturated background cannot produce clouds via any infinitesimal equilibrium perturbation, but the Monte Carlo approach allows non-gradient-based jumps into regions of non-zero cloud probability. In the example provided, the method is able to restore marine stratocumulus near the Californian coast, where the background state has a clear swath. This article also examines a number of algorithmic and physical sensitivities of the new method and provides guidance for its cost-effective implementation. One obvious difficulty for the method, and other cloud data assimilation methods as well, is the lack of information content in passive-radiometer-retrieved cloud observables on cloud vertical structure, beyond cloud-top pressure and optical thickness, thus necessitating strong dependence on the background vertical moisture structure. It is found that a simple flow-dependent correlation modification from Riishojgaard provides some help in this respect, by better honouring inversion structures in the background state.																	0035-9009	1477-870X				JUL	2016	142	699	B				2528	2540		10.1002/qj.2844								WOS:000385367000026

We found that NCP generally first peaks offshore and follows sea-ice retreat from offshore to inshore. Annually integrated NCP (ANCP) displays an onshore-to-offshore gradient, with coastal and shelf regions up to 8 times more productive than offshore regions. We examined potential drivers of interannual variability in the ANCP using an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The EOF's first mode explains approximate to 50% of the variance, with high interannual variability observed seaward of the shelf break. The first principal component is significantly correlated with the day of sea-ice retreat (R=-0.58, p<0.05), as well as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate indices in austral spring. Although the most obvious pathway by which the day of sea-ice retreat influences NCP is by controlling light availability early in the growing season, we found that the effect of day of sea-ice retreat on NCP persists throughout the growing season, suggesting that additional controls, such as iron availability, are preconditioned or correlated to the day of sea-ice retreat.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL	2016	121	7					4748	4762		10.1002/2015JC011378								WOS:000383468500019

TSS models applicable to data collected by satellite sensors can be used to determine TSS with reasonable accuracy and of adequate spatial and temporal resolution to be of use for coastal water quality monitoring. Thus, a study is presented here where we develop a semi-analytic sediment model (SASM) applicable to any sensor with red and near infrared (NIR) bands. The calibration and validation of the SASM using bootstrap and cross-validation methods showed that the SASM applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua band 1 data retrieved TSS with a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean averaged relative error (MARE) of 5.75 mg/L and 33.33% respectively. The application of the SASM over our study region using MODIS-Aqua band 1 data showed that the SASM can be used to monitor the on-going, post and pre-dredging activities and identify daily TSS anomalies that are caused by natural and anthropogenic processes in coastal waters of northern Western Australia.

This study assessed aquaculture suitability sites using dominant indicators of marine ecological dynamics on Japanese scallop culture in Funka and Mutsu Bays, Japan as comparative examples. Data sources comprised of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), four dimensional-variational (4D-VAR) data assimilation system, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), in situ and buoy measurements. The suitable sites were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 8 (most suitable). In the most suitable sites in aquaculture operational areas, Funka Bay had a high proportion (51.1%) than Mutsu Bay (13.7%) for the best performed model. Peaks of aquaculture suitability scores were attributed to potential effects of currents. Extreme sea temperatures (>24 degrees C) in summer 2010 were associated with low performance of the 2010 model in Mutsu Bay and mortality of scallops based on sea temperature-depth visualizations. Future global warming effects are likely to decrease the most suitable culture sites in Funka Bay and loss of similar areas in Mutsu Bay. Thus, change in marine environment influences scallop culture development. Such concepts could form scientific basis for aquaculture planning on designated system of larval distribution and stock management of cultured species to minimize mortality and economic losses.

Typhoons Nari and Wipha passed through the Yellow Sea on September 13, 2007 and the East China Sea (ECS) on September 16, 2007, respectively. The SST and Chl-a data were obtained from the Aqua/Terra MODIS and NOAA18, respectively, and the temperature and salinity in the southeast of the study area were observed in situ from Argo. The average SST within the study area dropped from 26.33 degrees C on September 10 to a minimum of 22.79 degrees C on September 16. Without the usual phenomenon of 'right bias', the most striking response of SST was in the middle of the typhoons' tracks, near to coastal waters. Strong cooling of the upper layers of the water column was probably due to increased vertical mixing, discharge from the Changjiang River estuary, and heavy rainfall. During the typhoons, average Chl-a increased by 11.54% within the study area and by 21.69% in the off shore area near to the southeast ECS. From September 1 to 13, average Chl-a was only 0.10 mg/m(3) in the off shore waters but it reached a peak of > 0.17 mg/m(3) on September 18. This large increase in Chl-a concentration in off shore waters might have been triggered by strong vertical mixing, upwelling induced by strong typhoons, and sedimentation and nutrient influx following heavy rainfall.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				JUL	2016	34	4					871	884		10.1007/s00343-016-5049-6								WOS:000377207800023

In addition, the fractional cloud cover obtained from the PCPRs applied to 1 km MODIS radiances was compared with that derived from the 250 m cloud mask (MOD35). The comparisons were made for pixels that were overcast and pixels that were only partially covered by clouds. Accounting for failed retrievals in both the MOD06 cloud properties and those obtained with the PCPRs leads to the suggestion that regional cloud cover be estimated in terms of lower and upper limits. The average could serve as the best estimate of the cloud cover, and the difference between the average and an extreme could serve as the uncertainty. The comparisons reveal that the overcast assumption used in the MODIS cloud property retrievals leads to cloud cover, droplet effective radii, and cloud top temperatures that are overestimated and, shortwave optical depths, liquid water paths that are underestimated. These biases persist when the properties are averaged to form spatial and temporal means. Owing to significant horizontal variations of cloud liquid water within the 1 km MODIS pixels, visible optical depths, droplet effective radii, and liquid water paths derived from the PCPRs show similar biases. The trends of the biases with pixel-scale and regional-scale cloud cover suggest that estimates of the aerosol indirect radiative forcing derived from satellites have been overestimated.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 16	2016	121	11					6404	6424		10.1002/2015JD024149								WOS:000381631700017						
J	Luccini, E; Rivas, M; Rojas, E				Luccini, Eduardo; Rivas, Miguel; Rojas, Elisa			Cloud optical depth from total and UV solar irradiance measurements at two sites of the Atacama Desert in Chile	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The visible cloud optical depth (COD) for overcast stratocumulus was estimated at Arica (18A7 degrees S, 7031 degrees W, 20 m above sea level (asl)) and Poconchile (18.45 degrees S, 70.07 degrees W, 560 m asl), northernmost Chilean sites distant about 30 km in the Atacama Desert, during morning hours for days in which cloudiness dissipates giving cloudless afternoons, from 10 min averaged measurements of total shortwave solar irradiance (ToSI) and ultraviolet solar irradiance (UVSI) during the period 2002-2005. One-dimensional radiative transfer model calculations were made to establish a theoretical relationship between the visible COD, the cloud effective transmittance in both ToSI (CETTO) and UVSI (CETUV), and the solar zenith angle (SZA). It is used to estimate COD from the previously measured CET by Luccini et al. (2011). Measurements in both ToSI and UVSI broadband ranges showed to be reliable to determine the visible COD within this frame. Overcast COD at the coastal site of Arica (typical COD similar to 15) is slightly larger than at the inland site of Poconchile (typical COD similar to 11). Maximum sensitivity of the retrieved CODs was found to variations in the cloud droplet effective radius, surface albedo and aerosol optical depth in both ranges, and in the total ozone column additionally in UVSI. The obtained CODs are linearly related but are higher compared with those from two other parametric methods using the same data. A simple rational expression of CET as a function of COD enables to estimate a mean (spectral and regional) surface albedo in each range that is in turn applicable to fit appropriately the ratio CETTo/CETUV. Instantaneous overpass MODIS-Terra satellite COD at 660 nm show a good agreement with simultaneous (within +/- 5 min) ground-derived COD at both sites.

The trend of rising sea surface temperature (SST) was the main factor maintaining phytoplankton positive net growth and resulted in a trend of increasing Chl at high latitudes in all seasons. At latitudes of 36-46A degrees N, east of 160A degrees E, the trend of rising SST was accompanied by a trend of declining Chl, markedly in spring and fall, which could be ascribed to strengthened stratification. The trends of environmental variables in the Oyashio area have modified conditions in a way detrimental to phytoplankton growth, the result being a trend of declining Chl from spring to fall. Chl south of roughly 36A degrees N exhibited different trends in different seasons because of the different trends of vertical stratification. Whereas the observed 16-year Chl trends were not primarily influenced by interannual climate variability, to some degree they were likely modified by decadal variability associated with a weakened Aleutian Low pressure. This work prompts further comprehensive studies to investigate the probable ecological consequences of the observed Chl trend for high-trophic-level marine organisms in the NWPO.

Coral reefs chronically exposed to river sediment plumes in the southwestern Caribbean: Rosario Islands, Colombia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Politicians do not acknowledge the devastating impacts river ne sediments can have on healthy coral reef ecosystems during environmental debates in Caribbean countries. Therefore, regional andlor local decision makers do not implement the necessary measures to reduce fluvial sediment fluxes on coral reefs.The Magdalena River, the main contributor of continental fluxes into the Caribbean Sea, delivers water and sediment fluxes into the Rosario Islands National Park, an important marine protected area in the southwestern Caribbean. Until now, there is no scientific consensus on the presence of sediment fluxes from the Magdalena River in the coral reefs of the Rosario Islands. Our hypothesis is that high sediment and freshwater inputs from the Magdalena have been present at higher acute levels during the last decade than previously thought, and that these runoff pulses are not flashy. We use in-situ calibrated MODIS satellite images to capture the spatiotemporal variability of the distribution of suspended sediment over the coral reefs. Furthermore, geochemical data are analyzed to detect associated sedimentation rates and pollutant dispersion into the coastal zone. Results confirm that turbidity levels have been much higher than previous values presented by national environmental authorities on coral reefs off Colombia over the last decade. During the 2003-2013 -period most of the Total Suspended Sediments (TSS) values witnessed in the sampled regions were above 10 mg/I, a threshold value of turbidity for healthy coral reef waters. TSS concentrations throughout the analyzed time were up to 623 mg,I. Plume pulses were more pronounced during wet seasons of La Nina events in 2002-2003, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010. Reconstructed time series of MODIS TSS indicates that coral reef waters were exposed to river plumes between 19.6 and 47.3% of the entire period of analysis (2000-2013), Further analyses of time series of water discharge and sediment load into the coastal zone during the last two decades show temporal increases in water discharge and sediment load of 2n and 48%, respectively. 21 Pb dating results from two cores indicate sedimentation rates of -0.75 cm/y of continentally exported clastic muddy sediments that are being deposited on the carbonatic shelf. The cores contain sediments with heavy metals and their concentrations are frequently above the ecologically accepted standards. Overall, the last decade has witnessed stronger magnitudes in fluvial fluxes to the coastal region, which probably coincide with associated declines in healthy coral cover and water quality. Our results emphasize the importance of local stressors, such as runoff and dispersion of turbid plumes, as opposed to ocean warming, disease and hurricanes, which have played a larger role on other coral reefs in the Caribbean. Coral reef management across the southwestern Caribbean, a coastal region influenced by continental fluxes of numerous rivers flowing from the Andes, may only be effective when land and marine -based stressors are simultaneously mitigated.

Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002-2013	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Water clarity is a key factor for the health of marine ecosystems. The Australian Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is located on a continental shelf, with >35 major seasonal rivers discharging into this 344,000 km(2) tropical to subtropical ecosystem. This work investigates how river discharges affect water clarity in different zones along and across the GBR. For each day over 11 years (2002-2013) we calculated 'photic depth' as a proxy measure of water clarity (calibrated to be equivalent to Secchi depth), for each 1 km2 pixel from MODIS-Aqua remote sensing data. Long-term and seasonal changes in photic depth were related to the daily discharge volumes of the nearest rivers, after statistically removing the effects of waves and tides on photic depth. The relationships between photic depths and rivers differed across and along the GBR. They typically declined from the coastal to offshore zones, and were strongest in proximity to rivers in agriculturally modified catchments. In most southern inner zones, photic depth declined consistently throughout the 11-year observation period; such long-term trend was not observed offshore nor in the northern regions. Averaged across the GBR, photic depths declined to 47% of local maximum values soon after the onset of river floods, and recovery to 95% of maximum values took on average 6 months (range: 150-260 days). The river effects were strongest at latitude 14.5 degrees-19.0 degrees S, where river loads are high and the continental shelf is narrow. Here, even offshore zones showed a >40% seasonal decline in photic depth, and 17-24% reductions in annual mean photic depth in years with large river nutrients and sediment loads. Our methodology is based on freely available data and tools and may be applied to other shelf systems, providing valuable insights in support of ecosystem management. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Cloud Cover and Fog Inundation in Coastal California: Ecological Implications	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in coastal California where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during otherwise warm and dry summer months. Summer fog and stratus can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets and often have different spatial and temporal patterns. Here, this study uses remote sensing datasets to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of cloud cover over California's northern Channel Islands. The authors found marine stratus to be persistent from May to September across the years 2001-12. Stratus clouds were both most frequent and had the greatest spatial extent in July. Clouds typically formed in the evening and dissipated by the following early afternoon. This study presents a novel method to downscale satellite imagery using atmospheric observations and discriminate patterns of fog from those of stratus and help explain patterns of fog deposition previously studied on the islands. The outcomes of this study contribute significantly to the ability to quantify the occurrence of coastal fog at biologically meaningful spatial and temporal scales that can improve the understanding of cloud-ecosystem interactions, species distributions, and coastal ecohydrology.

J	Bender, FAM; Engstrom, A; Karlsson, J				Bender, Frida A. -M.; Engstrom, Anders; Karlsson, Johannes			Factors Controlling Cloud Albedo in Marine Subtropical Stratocumulus Regions in Climate Models and Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study focuses on the radiative properties of five subtropical marine stratocumulus cloud regions, on monthly mean scale. Through examination of the relation between total albedo and cloud fraction, and its variability and relation to other parameters, some of the factors controlling the reflectivity, or albedo, of the clouds in these regions are investigated. It is found that the main part of the variability in albedo at a given cloud fraction can be related to temporal rather than spatial variability, indicating spatial homogeneity in cloud radiative properties in the studied regions. This is seen most clearly in satellite observations but also appears in an ensemble of climate models. Further comparison between satellite data and output from climate models shows that there is good agreement with respect to the role of liquid water path, the parameter that can be assumed to be the primary source of variability in cloud reflectivity for a given cloud fraction. On the other hand, the influence of aerosol loading on cloud albedo differs between models and observations. The cloud-albedo effect, or cloud brightening caused by aerosol through its coupling to cloud droplet number concentration and droplet size, is found not to dominate in the satellite observations on monthly mean scale, as it appears to do on this scale in the climate models. The disagreement between models and observations is particularly strong in regions with frequent occurrence of absorbing aerosols above clouds, where satellite data, in contrast to the climate models, indicate a scene darkening with increasing aerosol loading.																	0894-8755	1520-0442				MAY	2016	29	10					3559	3587		10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0095.1								WOS:000375950400005

The impact of cloud vertical profile on liquid water path retrieval based on the bispectral method: A theoretical study based on large-eddy simulations of shallow marine boundary layer clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Passive optical retrievals of cloud liquid water path (LWP), like those implemented for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), rely on cloud vertical profile assumptions to relate optical thickness (tau) and effective radius (r(e)) retrievals to LWP. These techniques typically assume that shallow clouds are vertically homogeneous; however, an adiabatic cloud model is plausibly more realistic for shallow marine boundary layer cloud regimes. In this study a satellite retrieval simulator is used to perform MODIS-like satellite retrievals, which in turn are compared directly to the large-eddy simulation (LES) output. This satellite simulator creates a framework for rigorous quantification of the impact that vertical profile features have on LWP retrievals, and it accomplishes this while also avoiding sources of bias present in previous observational studies. The cloud vertical profiles from the LES are often more complex than either of the two standard assumptions, and the favored assumption was found to be sensitive to cloud regime (cumuliform/stratiform). Confirming previous studies, drizzle and cloud top entrainment of dry air are identified as physical features that bias LWP retrievals away from adiabatic and toward homogeneous assumptions. The mean bias induced by drizzle-influenced profiles was shown to be on the order of 5-10 g/m(2). In contrast, the influence of cloud top entrainment was found to be smaller by about a factor of 2. A theoretical framework is developed to explain variability in LWP retrievals by introducingmodifications to the adiabatic re profile. In addition to analyzing bispectral retrievals, we also compare results with the vertical profile sensitivity of passive polarimetric retrieval techniques.

J	Dolinar, EK; Dong, XQ; Xi, BK				Dolinar, Erica K.; Dong, Xiquan; Xi, Baike			Evaluation and intercomparison of clouds, precipitation, and radiation budgets in recent reanalyses using satellite-surface observations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Atmospheric reanalysis datasets offer a resource for investigating climate processes and extreme events; however, their uncertainties must first be addressed. In this study, we evaluate the five reanalyzed (20CR, CFSR, Era-Interim, JRA-25, and MERRA) cloud fraction (CF), precipitation rates (PR), and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiation budgets using satellite observations during the period 03/2000-02/2012. Compared to the annual averaged CF of 56.7 % from CERES MODIS (CM) four of the five reanalyses underpredict CFs by 1.7-4.6 %, while 20CR overpredicts this result by 7.4 %. PR from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) is 3.0 mm/day and the reanalyzed PRs agree with TRMM within 0.1-0.6 mm/day. The shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) TOA cloud radiative effects (CREtoa) calculated by CERES EBAF (CE) are -48.1 and 27.3 W/m(2), respectively, indicating a net cooling effect of -20.8 W/m(2). Of the available reanalysis results, the CFSR and MERRA calculated net CREtoa values agree with CE within 1 W/m(2), while the JRA-25 result is similar to 10 W/m(2) more negative than the CE result, predominantly due to the underpredicted magnitude of the LW warming in the JRA-25 reanalysis. A regime metric is developed using the vertical motion field at 500 hPa over the oceans. Aptly named the "ascent" and "descent" regimes, these areas are distinguishable in their characteristic synoptic patterns and the predominant cloud-types; convective-type clouds and marine boundary layer (MBL) stratocumulus clouds. In general, clouds are overpredicted (underpredicted) in the ascent (descent) regime and the biases are often larger in the ascent regime than in the descent regime. PRs are overpredicted in both regimes; however the observed and reanalyzed PRs over the ascent regime are an order of magnitude larger than those over the descent regime, indicating different types of clouds exist in these two regimes. Based upon the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program ground-based and CM satellite observations, as well as reanalyzed results, the annual CFs are 15 % higher at the Azores site than at the Nauru site (70.2 vs. 55.2 %), less SW radiation (similar to 20 %) is transmitted the surface, and less LW radiation (similar to 60 W/m(2)) is emitted back to the surface. Also, the seasonal variations in both CF and surface radiation fluxes are much smaller at the Nauru site than at the Azores site. The dichotomy between the atmospheric ascent and descent regimes is a good measure for determining which parameterization scheme requires more improvement (convective vs. MBL clouds) in these five reanalyses.																	0930-7575	1432-0894				APR	2016	46	7-8					2123	2144		10.1007/s00382-015-2693-z								WOS:000373442900007

Observational evidence for aerosol invigoration in shallow cumulus downstream of Mount Kilauea	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Knowledge of how marine boundary layer (MBL) shallow cumulus clouds respond to changes in aerosol is central to understanding how MBL clouds modulate the climate system. Mount Kilauea on the island of Hawaii began erupting in 2008 injecting substantial SO2 into the marine boundary layer creating a unique natural laboratory. Examining data from approximately 600 passes of the A-Train downstream of Mount Kilauea over a 3year period and separating data into aerosol optical depth quartiles, we find an unambiguous increase in marine boundary cloud top height and an increase in surface wind speed as aerosol increases while the radar reflectivity does not change substantially. We conclude that increased aerosols may have caused invigoration of the MBL clouds. Additionally, we find that increases in sub 1km cloud fraction combined with increasing aerosol explain the increased visible reflectance suggesting that evidence for the so-called first aerosol indirect effect should be reexamined.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 28	2016	43	6					2981	2988		10.1002/2016GL067830								WOS:000374697200079

The associated algorithms were generally site specific or developed over a relatively narrow range of concentration, which make them inappropriate for global applications (or at least over broad SPM range). In the frame of the GlobCoast project, a large in situ data set of SPM and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), has been built gathering together measurements from various coastal areas around Europe, French Guiana, North Canada, Vietnam, and China. This data set covers various contrasting coastal environments diversely affected by different biogeochemical and physical processes such as sediment resuspension, phytoplankton bloom events, and rivers discharges (Amazon, Mekong, Yellow river, MacKenzie, etc.). The SPM concentration spans about four orders of magnitude, from 0.15 to 2626 g center dot m(-3). Different empirical and semi-analytical approaches developed to assess SPM from R-rs(lambda) were tested over this in situ data set. As none of them provides satisfactory results over the whole SPM range, a generic semi-analytical approach has been developed. This algorithm is based on two standard semi-analytical equations calibrated for low-to-medium and highly turbid waters, respectively. A mixing law has also been developed for intermediate environments. Sources of uncertainties in SPM retrieval such as the bio-optical variability, atmospheric correction errors, and spectral bandwidth have been evaluated. The coefficients involved in these different algorithms have been calculated for ocean color (SeaWiFS, MODIS-A/T, MERIS/OLCI, VIIRS) and high spatial resolution (LandSat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) sensors. The performance of the proposed algorithm varies only slightly from one sensor to another demonstrating the great potential applicability of the proposed approach over global and contrasting coastal waters.

Remote sensing monitoring products have been developed to map the spatial extent, composition and frequency of occurrence of river plumes in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. There is, however, a need to incorporate these monitoring products into Risk Assessment Frameworks as management decision tools. A simple Satellite Risk Framework has been recently proposed to generate maps of potential risk to seagrass and coral reef ecosystems in the GBR focusing on the Austral tropical wet season. This framework was based on a "magnitude x likelihood" risk management approach and GBR plume water types mapped from satellite imagery. The GBR plume water types (so called "Primary" for the inshore plume waters, "Secondary" for the midshelf-plume waters and "Tertiary" for the offshore plume waters) represent distinct concentrations and combinations of land-sourced and marine contaminants. The current study aimed to test and refine the methods of the Satellite Risk Framework. It compared predicted pollutant concentrations in plume water types (multi-annual average from 2005-2014) to published ecological thresholds, and combined this information with similarly long-term measures of seagrass and coral ecosystem health. The Satellite Risk Framework and newly-introduced multi-annual risk scores were successful in demonstrating where water conditions were, on average, correlated to adverse biological responses. Seagrass meadow abundance (multi-annual change in % cover) was negatively correlated to the multi-annual risk score at the site level (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.05). Relationships between multi-annual risk scores and multi-annual changes in proportional macroalgae cover (as an index for coral reef health) were more complex (R-2 = 0.04, p > 0.05), though reefs incurring higher risk scores showed relatively higher proportional macroalgae cover. Multi-annual risk score thresholds associated with loss of seagrass cover were defined, with lower risk scores (<= 0.2) associated with a gain or little loss in seagrass cover (gain/-12%), medium risk scores (0.2-0.4) associated with moderate loss (-12/-30%) and higher risk scores (>0.4) with the greatest loss in cover (>-30%). These thresholds were used to generate an intermediate river plume risk map specifically for seagrass meadows of the GBR. An intermediate river plume risk map for coral reefs was also developed by considering a multi-annual risk score threshold of 0.2-above which a higher proportion of macroalgae within the algal communities can be expected. These findings contribute to a long-term and adaptive approach to set relevant risk framework and thresholds for adverse biological responses in the GBR. The ecological thresholds and risk scores used in this study will be refined and validated through ongoing monitoring and assessment. As uncertainties are reduced, these risk metrics will provide important information for the development of strategies to manage water quality and ecosystem health.

Here, we use the latest earth observation data and soil visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy to estimate the factors of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and to model soil loss by water erosion in Australia. We estimate rainfall erosivity (R) using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM); slope length and steepness (L and S) using a 3-arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model; cover management (C) and control practice (P) using the national dynamic land cover dataset (DLCD) of Australia derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); and soil erodibility (K) using vis-NIR estimates of the contents of sand, silt, clay and organic carbon in Australian soil. We model K using a machine-learning algorithm with environmental predictors selected to best capture the factors that influence erodibility and produced a digital map of K. We use the derived RUSLE factors to estimate soil loss at 1-km resolution across the whole of Australia. We found that the potential gross average soil loss by water erosion in Australian is 1.86 t ha(-1) y(-1) (95% confidence intervals of 1.78 and 1.93 t ha(-1) y(-1)), equivalent to a total of 1242 x 10(6) tonnes of soil lost annually (95% confidence intervals of 1195 and 1293 t x 106 y(-1)). Our estimates of erosion are generally smaller than previous continental estimates using the RUSLE, but particularly in croplands, which might indicate that soil conservation practices effectively reduced erosion in Australia. However we also identify localized regions with large erosion in northern Australia and northeastern Queensland. Erosion in these areas carries sediments laden with nitrogen, phosphorus and pollutants from agricultural production into the sea, negatively affecting marine ecosystems. We used the best available data and our results provide better estimates compared to previous assessments. Our approach will be valuable for other large, sparsely sampled areas of the world where assessments of soil erosion are needed. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Comparing the spatio-temporal variability of remotely sensed oceanographic parameters between the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal throughout a decade	CURRENT SCIENCE												The spatio-temporal variability of sea-surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) was evaluated in the Arabian Sea (ABS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB), from July 2002 to November 2014 by means of remotely sensed monthly composite Aqua MODIS level-3 data having a spatial resolution of 4.63 km. Throughout the time period under consideration, the surface waters of ABS (27.76 +/- 1.12 degrees C) were slightly cooler than BoB (28.93 +/- 0.76 degrees C); this was observed during all the seasons. On the contrary, the availability of PAR was higher in ABS (45.76 +/- 3.41 mol m(-2) d(-1)) compared to BoB (41.75 +/- 3.75 mol m(-2) d(-1)), and its spatial dynamics in the two basins was mainly regulated by cloud cover and turbidity of the water column. The magnitude and variability of Chl-a concentration were substantially higher in ABS (0.487 +/- 0.984 mg m(-3)), compared to BoB (0.187 +/- 0.243 mg m(-3)), and spatially higher values were observed near the coastal waters. Both POC and PIC exhibited higher magnitudes in ABS compared to BoB; however, the difference was substantially high in case of POC. None of the parameters showed any significant temporal trend during the 12-year span, except PIC, which exhibited a significant decreasing trend in ABS.

This model is based on the consideration of AOT fields as realizations of a stochastic process that is the exponent of an underlying Gaussian process with a specific autocorrelation function. In this approach, AOT fields have lognormal PDFs and structure functions with the correct asymptotic behavior at large scales. The latter is an advantage compared with fractal (scale invariant) approaches. The simple analytical form of the structure function in the proposed model facilitates its use for the parameterization of AOT statistics derived from remote sensing data. The new approach is illustrated using a 1-yr-long global MODISAOT dataset (over ocean) with 10-km resolution. It was used to compute AOT statistics for sample cells forming a grid with 58 spacing. The observed shapes of the structure functions indicated that, in a large number of cases, the AOT variability is split into two regimes that exhibit different patterns of behavior: small-scale stationary processes and trends reflecting variations at larger scales. The small-scale patterns are suggested to be generated by local aerosols within the marine boundary layer, while the large-scale trends are indicative of elevated aerosols transported from remote continental sources. This assumption is evaluated by comparison of the geographical distributions of these patterns derived from MODIS data with those obtained from the GISS GCM. This study shows considerable potential to enhance comparisons between remote sensing datasets and climate models beyond regional mean AOTs.

Satellite assessment of sea spray aerosol productivity: Southern Ocean case study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Despite many years of observations by multiple sensors, there is still substantial ambiguity regarding aerosol optical depths (AOD) over remote oceans, in particular, over the pristine Southern Ocean. Passive satellite retrievals (e.g., Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and global aerosol transport models show a distinct AOD maximum around the 60 degrees S latitude band. Sun photometer measurements performed by the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN), on the other hand, indicate no increased AODs over the Southern Ocean. In this study elevated Southern Ocean AODs are examined from the modeling perspective. The primary aerosol component over the Southern Ocean is sea spray aerosol (SSA). Multiple simulations of SSA concentrations and optical depths are carried out using a single modeling framework, the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) model. Several SSA emission functions are examined, including recently proposed formulations with sea surface temperature corrections. The differences between NAAPS simulations are primarily due to different SSA emission formulations. The results are compared against satellite-derived AODs from the MISR and MODIS instruments. MISR and MODIS AOD retrievals are further filtered to eliminate retrievals potentially affected by cloud contamination and cloud adjacency effects. The results indicate a very large impact of SSA emission parameterization on the simulated AODs. For some scenarios, the Southern Ocean AOD maximum almost completely disappears. Further MISR and MODIS AOD quality screening substantially improves model/satellite agreement. Based on these comparisons, an optimal SSA emission function for global aerosol transport models is recommended.

Remote Sensing Observations of Ocean Surface Chlorophyll and Temperature with the Impact of Cyclones and Depressions over the Bay of Bengal Water	MARINE GEODESY												MODIS-Aqua derived eight-day composite chlorophyll concentration data analyzed to study the impact of cyclones and depressions on the Bay of Bengal productivity. A total of 15 cyclonic storms and depressions picked up from the India Meteorological Department datasets. MODIS-Aqua data analyzed during October 2002 to December 2009. There was observation of depressions (D), deep depressions (DD), cyclonic storms (CS), severe cyclonic storms (SCS), and very severe cyclonic storms (VSCS) with categories of intensities ("T" numbers 1.5-6) and wind speeds (25-108knots). The chlorophyll concentration observed to be high (1.0-5.0mg/m(3)) with the impact in the coastal and offshore waters. Quickscat scatterometer data showed high wind speed (about 10meters/second). Sea surface temperature (SST) observed to be decreased (roughly 2 degrees C) with effect of cyclones. The cyclone numbers, intensity, and chlorophyll concentration has been observed to be increasing from 2002 to 2009, with observation of VSCS "Sidr" during 2007. The study would be interesting to link carbon flux/sequestration, marine food chain, and harnessing fishery resources in a postcyclone period.																	0149-0419	1521-060X				JAN 2	2016	39	1					53	76		10.1080/01490419.2015.1121172								WOS:000372740600004

These six institutions constitute the MER Consortium created to develop these international postgraduate studies. The MER MSc programme has been recognised as a Erasmus Mundus Master Course 2012. During their learning path students spend periods at the different partner institutions. The University of the Basque Country is one of the four partners and classes are given at the research facilities located at the Plentzia Itsas Estazioa http://www. ehu. eus/PIE/overview/index. html, where, among others, students can select an optional subject called Satellite Oceanography and Meteorology with 4 ECTS. This subject is devoted to different aspects of the analysis of Satellite Data applied to oceanic studies. Apart from several introductory and theoretical aspects, hands-on computer exercises are included in the syllabus. This involves image and data retrieving, intensive programming using a high-level software and also the spatial representation of results. The target variables range from NASA's MODIS data http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/ such as for example, chlorophyll concentrations to significant wave height and period of ocean waves as measured by means of satellite altimetry in several satellite missions (TOPEX, JASON, ENVISAT). The objective is that students who in their future research activities are most likely to become final users of satellite data, can learn how to retrieve relevant scientific information from satellites. For this reason, either level 2 or level 3 images are used which typically, are in NetCDF3 or NetCDF4 format. Additionally, MODIS images can also be retrieved in GeoTIFF format. To that purpose, R (https://www.cran.r-project.org/) is a freely available software that provides an optimum answer to these combined needs and challenges due to its modular structure. R has a core module and nearly 8000 packages specifically developed for different purposes are also available. Packages like "RNetCDF" or "ncdf4" are used to read NetCDF archives, while, "rgdal", "maps", "maptools" and "mapdata" libraries can extract information from GeoTIFF images. Using them, raw data can be manipulated and relevant information can be extracted plotted onto a map. To that purpose R is the optimal tool due to its ability to combine all the specific aspects needed to deal with satellite imagery. Besides, R has the functionality of any fully scientific software while exhibiting the flexibility that Master studies require thus becoming a perfect tool for advanced training of students. R allows plotting the data but incorporates further advanced data processing abilities that make it more relevant for scientific use than other GIS programs that could also plot some of the satellite data. Incorporating R into the teaching activities of the optional subject Satellite Oceanography and Meteorology has represented an important step forward in the education of future oceanic scientists while providing them with access to state-of-art real-life tools that they will be able to apply during their future scientific career.

Firstly, a model for algal specific growth rate of Karenia mikimotoi based on the coupling effect of nutrient and temperature is established using laboratory algal culture data; secondly, the monthly hazard degree spatial distributions of K. mikimotoi red tide in Wenzhou coastal waters from January 2014 to December 2014 were obtained under the geographic information system (GIS) combining the MODIS satellite monthly average data with the assessment model. The results showed that (1) the algal specific growth rate relation model of K. mikimotoi was in accordance with Shelford's law of tolerance. (2) K. mikimotoi more likely caused red tide in Wenzhou coastal waters in May 2014 to July 2014, by contrast, it less likely induced red tide in other months of the same year. There are differences of the hazard degree of K. mikimotoi red tide disasters in the same months. These findings provide a technical basis to respond effectively to ecological disasters in Wenzhou coastal waters.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							4203	4206		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730095								WOS:000388114604053

The uncertainties associated with MODIS daily PAR need to be quantified in order to understand the uncertainties in the estimated PP. On the other hand, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (GOES) provides estimates of hourly solar radiation product (24 images per day) over North America, which can be integrated to produce daily PAR. In this study, both GOES iPAR and daily PAR are used to compare with the corresponding MODIS products to understand uncertainties in MODIS daily PAR products and to understand how multiple measurements per day can improve daily PAR estimates. While GOES iPAR and MODIS iPAR showed excellent consistency over cloud-free regions, their daily PAR products showed some degree of discrepancy due to variable cloud cover.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							5845	5847		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730527								WOS:000388114605200

Based on MODIS cloud fraction (CF) data during the 10 year study period, we found that these dust intrusions contribute to significant cloud cover along the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). Below the temperature inversion at the SAL's base, the presence of large amounts of settling dust particles, together with marine aerosols, produces meteorological conditions suitable for the formation of shallow stratocumulus clouds. The significant cloud fraction along the SAL together with clouds over the Atlantic Inter-tropical Convergence Zone contributes to the 20 % hemispheric CF asymmetry between the tropical North and South Atlantic. This leads to the imbalance in strong solar radiation, which reaches the sea surface between the tropical North and South Atlantic, and, consequently, affects climate formation in the tropical Atlantic. Therefore, despite the fact that, over the global ocean, there is no noticeable hemispheric asymmetry in cloud fraction, over the significant area such as the tropical Atlantic the hemispheric asymmetry in CF takes place. Saharan dust is also the major contributor to hemispheric aerosol asymmetry over the tropical Atlantic. The NASA GEOS-5 model with aerosol data assimilation was used to extend the MERRA reanalysis with five atmospheric aerosol species (desert dust, sulfates, organic carbon, black carbon, and sea-salt). The obtained 10 year (2002-2012) MERRA-driven aerosol reanalysis dataset (aka MERRAero) showed that, over the tropical Atlantic, dust and carbonaceous aerosols were distributed asymmetrically relative to the equator, while other aerosol species were distributed more symmetrically.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF LANDSAT-8 IMAGERY FOR RETRIEVING SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (CASE STUDY PERSIAN GULF)	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the critical parameters in marine meteorology and oceanography. The SST datasets are incorporated as conditions for ocean and atmosphere models. The SST needs to be investigated for various scientific phenomenon such as salinity, potential fishing zone, sea level rise, upwelling, eddies, cyclone predictions. On the other hands, high spatial resolution SST maps can illustrate eddies and sea surface currents. Also, near real time producing of SST map is suitable for weather forecasting and fishery applications. Therefore satellite remote sensing with wide coverage of data acquisition capability can use as real time tools for producing SST dataset. Satellite sensor such as AVHRR, MODIS and SeaWIFS are capable of extracting brightness values at different thermal spectral bands. These brightness temperatures are the sole input for the SST retrieval algorithms. Recently, Landsat8 successfully launched and accessible with two instruments on-board: (1) the Operational Land Imager (OLI) with nine spectral bands in the visual, near infrared, and the shortwave infrared spectral regions; and (2) the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) with two spectral bands in the long wavelength infrared. The two TIRS bands were selected to enable the atmospheric correction of the thermal data using a split window algorithm (SWA). The TIRS instrument is one of the major payloads aboard this satellite which can observe the sea surface by using the split-window thermal infrared channels (CH10: 10.6 mu m to 11.2 mu m; CH11: 11.5 mu m to 12.5 mu m) at a resolution of 30 m. The TIRS sensors have three main advantages comparing with other previous sensors. First, the TIRS has two thermal bands in the atmospheric window that provide a new SST retrieval opportunity using the widely used split-window (SW) algorithm rather than the single channel method. Second, the spectral filters of TIRS two bands present narrower bandwidth than that of the thermal band on board on previous Landsat sensors. Third, TIRS is one of the best space born and high spatial resolution with 30 m. in this regards, Landsat-8 can use the Split-Window (SW) algorithm for retrieving SST dataset. Although several SWs have been developed to use with other sensors, some adaptations are required in order to implement them for the TIRS spectral bands. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a SW, adapted for use with Landsat-8 TIRS data, along with its accuracy assessment. In this research, that has been done for modelling SST using thermal Landsat 8-imagery of the Persian Gulf. Therefore, by incorporating contemporary in situ data and SST map estimated from other sensors like MODIS, we examine our proposed method with coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) on check point to model SST retrieval for Landsat-8 imagery. Extracted results for implementing different SW's clearly shows superiority of utilized method by R-2=0.95 and RMSE=0.24.																	2194-9034						2016	41	B8					1107	1110		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B8-1107-2016								WOS:000393156000186

OCEAN COLOR RETRIEVAL USING LANDSAT-8 IMAGERY IN COASTAL CASE 2 WATERS (CASE STUDY PERSIAN AND OMAN GULF)	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Ocean color (OC) monitoring using satellite imageries provides an appropriate tool for a better understanding of marine processes and changes in the coastal environment. Radiance measurements in the range of visible light of the electromagnetic spectrum provides information of ocean color that is associated with the water constituents. This measurements are used to monitor the level of biological activity and the presence of particles in the water. Ocean features such as the concentration of chlorophyll, suspended sediment concentration and sea surface temperature have a significant impact on the dynamics of the ocean. The concentration of chlorophyll (chla), active pigments of phytoplankton photosynthesis, as a key indicator applied for assessment of water quality and biochemistry. Experimental algorithms chla related to internal communication various optical components in the water that may be change in space and time in the water with different optical characteristics. Therefore, the algorithms have been developed for one area may not work for other places and each region according to its specific characteristics needs that determined by an algorithm may be appropriate to local. We have tried treatment several algorithms for determination of chlorophyll, including experimental algorithms with a simple band ratio of blue-green band (i.e. OCx) and algorithms includes two bands ratio with variable R-rs(lambda(2))/R-rs(lambda(1)), the three bands ratio with variable [R-rs(lambda(1))(-1)-R-rs(lambda(2))(-1)] x R-rs(lambda(3)) and four bands ratio with variable [R-rs(lambda(1))(-1)-R-rs(lambda(2))(-1)]/[R-rs(lambda(4))(-1)-R-rs(lambda(3))(-1)] that desired wavelength (i.e. lambda(1),lambda(2),lambda(3) and lambda(4)) in the range of red and near-infrared wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum are in the region of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea look. Despite the high importance of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea which can have up basin countries, to now few studies have been done in this area. The focus of this article on the northern part of Oman Sea and Persian Gulf, the shores of neighboring Iran (case 2 water). In this paper, by using Landsat 8 satellite imageries, we have discussed chla concentrations and customizing different OC algorithms for this new dataset (Landsat-8 imagery). This satellite was launched in 2013 and its data using two sensors continuously are provided operating one sensor imager land (OLI: Operational Land Imager) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS: Thermal InfraRed Sensor) and are available. This sensors collect image data, respectively, for the nine-band short wavelength in the range of 433-2300 nm and dual-band long wavelength thermal. Seven band of the nine band picked up by the sensor information of OLI to deal with sensors TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) in previous satellite Landsat compatible and two other band, the band of coastal water (433 to 453 nm) and Cirrus band (1360 to 1390 nm), short wave infrared provides to measure water quality and high thin clouds. Since OLI sensor in Landsat satellite 8 compared with other sensors to study OC have been allocated a much better spatial resolution can be more accurate to determine changes in OC. To evaluate the results of the image sensor MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) at the same time satellite images Landsat 8 is used. The statistical parameters used in order to evaluate the performance of different algorithms, including root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2), and on the basis of these parameters we choose the most appropriate algorithm for the area. Extracted results for implementing different OC algorithms clearly shows superiority of utilized method by R-2=0.71 and RMSE=0.07.

SeaHawk: An advanced CubeSat mission for sustained ocean color monitoring	SENSORS, SYSTEMS, AND NEXT-GENERATION SATELLITES XX	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Sensors, Systems, and Next-Generation Satellites XX	SEP 26-28, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Sustained ocean color monitoring is vital to understanding the marine ecosystem. It has been identified as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and is a vital parameter in understanding long-term climate change. Furthermore, observations can be beneficial in observing oil spills, harmful algal blooms and the health of fisheries. Space-based remote sensing, through MERIS, SeaWiFS and MODIS instruments, have provided a means of observing the vast area covered by the ocean which would otherwise be impossible using ships alone. However, the large pixel size makes measurements of lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal zones difficult. Furthermore, retirement of a number of widely used and relied upon ocean observation instruments, particularly MERIS and SeaWiFS, leaves a significant gap in ocean color observation opportunities This paper presents an overview of the SeaHawk mission, a collaborative effort between Clyde Space Ltd., the University of North Carolina Wilmington, Cloudland Instruments, and Goddard Spaceflight Center, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The goal of the project is to enhance the ability to observe ocean color in high temporal and spatial resolution through use of a low-cost, next-generation ocean color sensor flown aboard a CubeSat. The final product will be 530 times smaller (0.0034 vs 1.81m(3)) and 115 time less massive (3.4 vs 390.0kg) but with a ground resolution 10 times better whilst maintaining a signal/noise ratio 50% that of SeaWiFs. This paper will describe the objectives of the mission, outline the payload specification and the spacecraft platform to support it.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0404-9; 978-1-5106-0405-6				2016	10000								UNSP 100001C	10.1117/12.2241058								WOS:000391489900030

Aerosol measurements and validation of satellite derived aerosol optical depth over the Kavaratti Cal-Val site	MULTISPECTRAL, HYPERSPECTRAL, AND ULTRASPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY, TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Remote Sensing Technology, Techniques and Applications VI	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			Aerosols are short-lived with a residual time of about a week in the lower atmosphere and are concentrated around the source of origin. Aerosols are produced by variety of natural processes as well as by anthropogenic activities; it gets distributed in the atmosphere through turbulent mixing as well as transported away from the source of origin and thus results in its large seasonal and spatial variability. In this study, the CIMEL sun-photometer measurements at Kavaratti calibration and validation site are used to characterize the aerosols' nature at the measurement site. Also, these in-situ measurements are used to validate the satellite sensor derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) parameter. The data analysis shows that the locally generated aerosols are mostly of marine aerosols and other natural aerosols are transported desert dust. The anthropogenic aerosols are transported from mainland and they are found during the pre-monsoon season. Also aerosol measurements for five years (2009 - 2015) are being planned for validating the satellite sensors derived AOD products namely: OceanSat2-OCM2, MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua.

Oceanographic observation factor such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) will improve knowledge of some oceanographic phenomena (e. g. thermal fronts) which is useful for fishing ground forecast. The aim of this study was to observe SST by using satellites image in West Banda Sea. There were the Aqua-MODIS datasets composite 8-day level 3, which provide a SST data in 4 km pixel size. Results showed that based on the observation of SST in 2013 that the highest temperature in west season and the lowest SST was founded in east season until east-west season. There are tend to occur upwelling in west of Banda Sea. Based on result of the research, it is necessary to do the next research for verifying and observing the upwelling phenomena in West Banda Sea.

MODIS-Aqua Data based Detection and Classification of Algal Blooms along the Coast of India using RLS Classifier	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS	Procedia Computer Science				6th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications (ICACC)	SEP 06-08, 2016	Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol, Kochi, INDIA		Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol			In the field of marine biology, researches reveal that there exists a constant increase in Algal bloom (AB) count, along the coast of India. This work aims at detecting and classifying six most frequently appearing algal blooms in this region (viz.: Trichodesmium erythraeum, Noctiluca scintillans/miliaris, Cocholodinium ploykrikoides, Chattonella marina and Karenia mikimotoi blooms). The uniqueness of ocean's optical properties such as remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)) during bloom period serve as the underlying features on whose grounds classification is performed. These parameters are acquired from Aqua/MODIS sensor measurements and Regularized least squares classifier is used in GURLS library for classification. An overall classification accuracy of 94.37% is obtained using both R-rs and nL(w) features, which is superior to the previously conducted studies for monitoring ABs using optical properties of water. Given a MODIS image, a map is developed wherein the pixels with ABs are highlighted and the causative species is recognized. A MODIS image is available every two days and hence frequent generation of AB moitoring maps is possible, which is of great significance in the fisheries industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Analysis of collocated AIRS and MODIS data: a global investigation of correlations between clouds and atmosphere in 2004-2012	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												We used collocated observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) to investigate correlations between cloud parameters and atmospheric stability. We focus on low clouds and specifically investigate the cloud parameters cloud cover and cloud optical thickness from MODIS. The selected atmospheric parameters from AIRS are maximum relative humidity (MRH), lower tropospheric stability (LTS), and water vapour gradient (QTS). The correlations were tested for temporal and regional variation on a global scale and over a time frame of 10 years. Cloud cover and MRH show weak correlations and strong variations on both the temporal and spatial scales. However, cloud cover and lower tropospheric stability show a high correlation in areas with low maritime clouds. The correlation is relatively stable, but slightly increased for the years 2009-2012. Correlations between cloud cover and QTS show a similar behaviour, but slightly stronger variations on the spatial and temporal scales, with better correlations in the East Pacific and from 2004 to 2012. The correlations with cloud optical thickness are weaker in all three cases. A more detailed analysis of the Southeast Pacific shows the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on most parameters, but a relatively stable behaviour for the connection of cloud fraction and LTS. Based on the analysis, we suggest that relative humidity is an insufficient approach to link atmospheric properties and low cloud cover. However, we find good correlations with respect to LTS and QTS. LTS in particular indicates low temporal fluctuations, even in the case of influence by ENSO.

J	Bikkina, S; Kawamura, K; Sarin, M				Bikkina, Srinivas; Kawamura, Kimitaka; Sarin, Manmohan			Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of fine mode aerosols (PM2.5) over the Bay of Bengal: impact of continental sources	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												This study reports on stable carbon (delta C-13(TC)) and nitrogen (delta N-15(TN)) isotopic composition of total carbon and nitrogen (TC and TN) in the fine mode aerosols (PM2.5; N = 31) collected over the Bay of Bengal (BoB). The samples represent two distinct wind regimes during the cruise (27 December 2008-28 January 2009); one from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (referred as IGP-outflow) and another from Southeast Asia (SEA-outflow). The PM2.5 samples from the IGP-outflow show higher delta C-13(TC) (-25.0 to -22.8 parts per thousand; -23.8 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand) than those from the SEA-outflow (-27.4 to -24.7 parts per thousand; -25.3 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand). Similarly, delta N-15(TN) varied from +11.8 to +30.6 parts per thousand (+20.4 +/- 5.4 parts per thousand) and +10.4 to +31.7 parts per thousand (+19.4 +/- 6.1 parts per thousand) for IGP-and SEA-outflows, respectively. Based on the literature data, MODIS-derived fire hotspots and back trajectories, we infer that higher delta C-13(TC) in the IGP-outflow is predominantly associated with fossil fuel and biofuel combustion. In contrast, contribution of primary organic aerosols from the combustion of C-3 plants or secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from biomass/biofuel-burning emissions (BBEs) can explain the lower delta C-13(TC) values in the SEA-outflow. This inference is based on the significant linear correlations among delta C-13(TC), water-soluble organic carbon and non-sea-salt potassium (nss-K+, a proxy for BBEs) in the SEA-outflow. A significant linear relationship of delta N-15 with NH4+and equivalent mass ratio of NH4+/SO42-is evident in both the continental outflows. Since NH4+abundance dominates the TN over the BoB (>90 %), atmospheric processes affecting its concentration in fine mode aerosols can explain the observed large variability of delta N-15(TN).

An 11-year global gridded aerosol optical thickness reanalysis (v1.0) for atmospheric and climate sciences	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												While stand alone satellite and model aerosol products see wide utilization, there is a significant need in numerous atmospheric and climate applications for a fused product on a regular grid. Aerosol data assimilation is an operational reality at numerous centers, and like meteorological reanalyses, aerosol reanalyses will see significant use in the near future. Here we present a standardized 2003-2013 global 1 x 1 degrees and 6-hourly modal aerosol optical thickness (AOT) reanalysis product. This data set can be applied to basic and applied Earth system science studies of significant aerosol events, aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction, and electro-optical propagation and sensor performance, among other uses. This paper describes the science of how to develop and score an aerosol reanalysis product. This reanalysis utilizes a modified Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) at its core and assimilates quality controlled retrievals of AOT from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) on Terra. The aerosol source functions, including dust and smoke, were regionally tuned to obtain the best match between the model fine-and coarse-mode AOTs and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOTs. Other model processes, including deposition, were tuned to minimize the AOT difference between the model and satellite AOT. Aerosol wet deposition in the tropics is driven with satellite-retrieved precipitation, rather than the model field. The final reanalyzed fine-and coarse-mode AOT at 550 nm is shown to have good agreement with AERONET observations, with global mean root mean square error around 0.1 for both fine-and coarse-mode AOTs. This paper includes a discussion of issues particular to aerosol reanalyses that make them distinct from standard meteorological reanalyses, considerations for extending such a reanalysis outside of the NASA A-Train era, and examples of how the aerosol reanalysis can be applied or fused with other model or remote sensing products. Finally, the reanalysis is evaluated in comparison with other available studies of aerosol trends, and the implications of this comparison are discussed.

Seasonal variations in aerosol optical thickness over eastern China determined from VIIRS data and ground measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Two-year records of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Intermediate Product (IP) data on aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550 nm were evaluated by comparing them to sun-sky radiometer measurements from the Chinese Sun Hazemeter Network (CSHNET) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The monthly and seasonal variations in the aerosol optical properties over eastern China were then investigated using collocated VIIRS IP data and CSHNET and AERONET measurements. Between 59.2 and 62.1% of the retrieved VIIR IP values fell within the range defined for MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and had similar values for the correlation coefficient (0.880-0.909). The performances of the current VIIRS IP AOT retrievals at the provisional stage were consistent with ground measurements. However, over urban areas, the VIIRS exhibits more scatter and therefore less precision than observed over marine and rural areas. Similar characteristics of seasonal and monthly variations were found among the measurements, though the observational methodologies were different, showing maxima in the summer and spring and minima in the winter and autumn. Although the intensities vary from season to season, the spatial AOT distribution patterns did not change. High-AOT centres were situated in the industrialized coastal regions of China and were related to the distribution of urban areas.

Here we employ a calibrated biogeochemical model to simulate change in sulfate aerosol emissions in the Barents Sea, and find strong increases occur by the late 21st century. If replicated across the Arctic Ocean, such increases in sulfate aerosol loading to the Arctic atmosphere may decrease the rate of warming at polar latitudes. Abstract Global warming of climate is connected to ecosystem change, especially in the polar oceans. Biogenic emissions of dimethylsulfide (DMS) are the main biogenic source of sulfate aerosols to the marine atmosphere and may change in the Arctic, where warming is currently very rapid. Here, we simulate DMS distribution and sea-to-air flux in the Barents Sea (30-40 degrees E and 70-80 degrees N) for the period 2003-05. A genetic algorithm is used to calibrate the key parameters in the DMS model. We use MODIS satellite chlorophyll-a data and regional DMS field data to calibrate the model. Owing to limited DMS observations in the Arctic Ocean, multiple data sources were used and compared. A back-propagation neural network is used for predicting regional DMS based on previous history time series. Parameter sensitivity analysis is done based on DMS flux output. Global climate model forcings for 1xCO(2) to 3xCO(2) conditions are used to force the biogeochemical model under future climate warming (c. 2080). The simulation results show that under tripled CO2, DMS flux would increase 168 to 279% from autumn through winter and would increase 112% during ice melting season. DMS flux would increase much more in ice-melt-affected water. The increased DMS flux under 3xCO(2) indicates that regional warming could slow owing to the emission of DMS in the Arctic, if the increase in emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is controlled.

Overview of the Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment/Aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing on the Mediterranean Climate (ChArMEx/ADRIMED) summer 2013 campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx; http://charmex.lsce.ipsl.fr) is a collaborative research program federating international activities to investigate Mediterranean regional chemistry-climate interactions. A special observing period (SOP-1a) including intensive airborne measurements was performed in the framework of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Impact on the regional climate in the MEDiterranean region (ADRIMED) project during the Mediterranean dry season over the western and central Mediterranean basins, with a focus on aerosol-radiation measurements and their modeling. The SOP-1a took place from 11 June to 5 July 2013. Airborne measurements were made by both the ATR-42 and F-20 French research aircraft operated from Sardinia (Italy) and instrumented for in situ and remote-sensing measurements, respectively, and by sounding and drifting balloons, launched in Minorca. The experimental setup also involved several ground-based measurement sites on islands including two ground-based reference stations in Corsica and Lampedusa and secondary monitoring sites in Minorca and Sicily. Additional measurements including lidar profiling were also performed on alert during aircraft operations at EARLINET/ACTRIS stations at Granada and Barcelona in Spain, and in southern Italy. Remote-sensing aerosol products from satellites (MSG/SEVIRI, MODIS) and from the AERONET/PHOTONS network were also used. Dedicated meso-scale and regional modeling experiments were performed in relation to this observational effort. We provide here an overview of the different surface and aircraft observations deployed during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED period and of associated modeling studies together with an analysis of the synoptic conditions that determined the aerosol emission and transport. Meteorological conditions observed during this campaign (moderate temperatures and southern flows) were not favorable to producing high levels of atmospheric pollutants or intense biomass burning events in the region. However, numerous mineral dust plumes were observed during the campaign, with the main sources located in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, leading to aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranging between 0.2 and 0.6 (at 440 nm) over the western and central Mediterranean basins. One important point of this experiment concerns the direct observations of aerosol extinction onboard the ATR-42, using the CAPS system, showing local maxima reaching up to 150Mm(-1) within the dust plume. Non-negligible aerosol extinction (about 50Mm(-1)) has also been observed within the marine boundary layer (MBL). By combining the ATR-42 extinction coefficient observations with absorption and scattering measurements, we performed a complete optical closure revealing excellent agreement with estimated optical properties. This additional information on extinction properties has allowed calculation of the dust single scattering albedo (SSA) with a high level of confidence over the western Mediterranean. Our results show a moderate variability from 0.90 to 1.00 (at 530 nm) for all flights studied compared to that reported in the literature on this optical parameter. Our results underline also a relatively low difference in SSA with values derived near dust sources. In parallel, active remote-sensing observations from the surface and onboard the F-20 aircraft suggest a complex vertical structure of particles and distinct aerosol layers with sea spray and pollution located within the MBL, and mineral dust and/or aged North American smoke particles located above (up to 6-7 km in altitude). Aircraft and balloon-borne observations allow one to investigate the vertical structure of the aerosol size distribution showing particles characterized by a large size (> 10 mu m in diameter) within dust plumes. In most of cases, a coarse mode characterized by an effective diameter ranging between 5 and 10 mu m, has been detected above the MBL. In terms of shortwave (SW) direct forcing, in situ surface and aircraft observations have been merged and used as inputs in 1-D radiative transfer codes for calculating the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF). Results show significant surface SW instantaneous forcing (up to -90Wm(-2) at noon). Aircraft observations provide also original estimates of the vertical structure of SW and LW radiative heating revealing significant instantaneous values of about 5 degrees K per day in the solar spectrum (for a solar angle of 30 degrees) within the dust layer. Associated 3-D modeling studies from regional climate (RCM) and chemistry transport (CTM) models indicate a relatively good agreement for simulated AOD compared with observations from the AERONET/PHOTONS network and satellite data, especially for long-range dust transport. Calculations of the 3-D SW (clear-sky) surface DRF indicate an average of about -10 to -20Wm(-2) (for the whole period) over the Mediterranean Sea together with maxima (-50Wm(-2)) over northern Africa. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) DRF is shown to be highly variable within the domain, due to moderate absorbing properties of dust and changes in the surface albedo. Indeed, 3-D simulations indicate negative forcing over the Mediterranean Sea and Europe and positive forcing over northern Africa. Finally, a multiyear simulation, performed for the 2003 to 2009 period and including an ocean-atmosphere (O-A) coupling, underlines the impact of the aerosol direct radiative forcing on the sea surface temperature, O-A fluxes and the hydrological cycle over the Mediterranean.

In this study, a recent decadal trend of primary productivity in the East Sea was analyzed based on Moderate- Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS)- derived monthly values to detect any long- term change. The daily primary productivities averaged using monthly values from 2003 to 2012 were 719.7 mg center dot C center dot m - 2 center dot d- 1 ( S. D +/- 197.5 mg center dot C center dot m-2 center dot d -1, n = 120) and 632.3 mg center dot C - m center dot 2 center dot d- 1 (S. D +/- 235.1 mg C m-2 d-1, n = 120) for the southern and northern regions of the East Sea, respectively. Based on the daily productivities, the average annual primary production in the East Sea was 246.mg C m-2 d(-1), which was substantially higher than that previously reported in deep oceans. However, a decreasing trend ( 13% per 10 years) in the annual primary production was observed in the East Sea within the study period from 2003 to 2012. The shallower mixed layers caused by increased temperature could be a potential cause for the decline in annual production. However, this decline could also be part of an oscillation pattern that is strongly governed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ( PDO). A better understanding of primary productivity patterns and their subsequent effects on the marine ecosystem is required for further interdisciplinary studies in the East Sea.																	2072-4292					JAN	2016	8	1							25	10.3390/rs8010025								WOS:000369495800022

Quantifying Marine Boundary Layer Water Vapor beneath Low Clouds with Near-Infrared and Microwave Imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study investigates the synergy of collocated microwave radiometry and near-infrared imagery to estimate the marine boundary layer water vapor beneath uniform cloud fields. Microwave radiometry provides the total column water vapor, while the near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor. In combining the two datasets, we apply several flags as well as proximity tests to remove pixels with high clouds and/or intrapixel heterogeneity. Comparisons against radiosonde and ECMWF reanalysis data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. Last, it is shown that the measured AMSR-MODIS boundary layer water vapor can be analyzed using sea surface temperature and cloud-top pressure information by employing simple equations based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.

The models were based on cell density (N) dependent parameterizations of the spectral backscattering coefficients, b(b) (lambda), obtained from in situ measurements. There was a strong relationship between b(b) (lambda) and N, with a minimum regression coefficient of 0.97 at 488 nm and a maximum value of 0.98 at other bands. The cell density calculated by the multiband inversion model was similar to the field measurements of the coastal waters (the average relative error was only 8.9%), but it could not accurately discern the red tide from mixed pixels, and this led to overestimation of the area affected by the red tide. While the single-band inversion model is less precise than the former model in the high chlorophyll water, it could eliminate the impact of the suspended sediments and make more accurate estimates of the red tide area. We concluded that the two models both have advantages and disadvantages; these methods lay the foundation for developing a remote sensing forecasting system for red tides.																	1687-9309	1687-9317					2016									1780986	10.1155/2016/1780986								WOS:000367969700001						
J	Eastman, R; Wood, R				Eastman, Ryan; Wood, Robert			Factors Controlling Low-Cloud Evolution over the Eastern Subtropical Oceans: A Lagrangian Perspective Using the A-Train Satellites	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A Lagrangian technique is developed to sample satellite data to quantify and understand factors controlling temporal changes in low-cloud properties (cloud cover, areal-mean liquid water path, and droplet concentration). Over 62 000 low-cloud scenes over the eastern subtropical/tropical oceans are sampled using the A-Train satellites. Horizontal wind fields at 925 hPa from the ERA-Interim are used to compute 24-h, two-dimensional, forward, boundary layer trajectories with trajectory locations starting on the CloudSat/CALIPSO track. Cloud properties from MODIS and AMSR-E are sampled at the trajectory start and end points, allowing for direct measurement of the temporal cloud evolution. The importance of various controls (here, boundary layer depth, lower-tropospheric stability, and precipitation) on cloud evolution is evaluated by comparing cloud evolution for different initial values of these controls. Viewing angle biases are removed and cloud anomalies (diurnal and seasonal cycles removed) are used throughout to quantify cloud evolution relative to the climatological-mean evolution. Cloud property anomalies show temporal changes similar to those expected for a stochastic red noise process, with linear relationships between initial anomalies and their mean 24-h changes. This creates a potential bias when comparing the evolutions of sets of trajectories with different initial anomalies; three methods are introduced and evaluated to account for this. Results provide statistically robust observational support for theoretical/modeling studies by showing that low clouds in deep boundary layers and under weak inversions are prone to break up. Precipitation shows a more complex and less statistically significant relationship with cloud breakup. Cloud cover in shallow precipitating boundary layers is more persistent than in deep precipitating boundary layers. Liquid water path and cloud droplet concentration decrease more rapidly for precipitating clouds and in deep boundary layers.

The tropical Atlantic surface wind divergence belt and its effect on clouds	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												A well-defined surface wind divergence (SWD) belt with distinct cloud properties forms over the equatorial Atlantic during the boreal summer months. This belt separates the deep convective clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) from the shallow marine stratocumulus cloud decks forming over the cold-water subtropical region of the southern branch of the Hadley cell in the Atlantic. Using the QuikSCAT-SeaWinds and Aqua-MODIS instruments, we examined the large-scale spatiotemporal variability in the SWD belt during a 6-year period (2003-2008) and the related links to cloud properties over the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic SWD belt was found to be most pronounced from May to August, between the Equator and 2 degrees N latitude. A positive correlation and a strong link were observed between formation of the SWD belt and a sharp sea-surface temperature gradient on the northern border of the cold tongue, supporting Wallace's vertical-mixing mechanism. The dominant cloud type over this region was shallow cumulus. Cloud properties were shown to be strongly linked to the formation and strength of the SWD zone. The findings will help to understand the link between ocean-atmosphere dynamics and cloud properties over this region, and suggest that the SWD zone be considered a unique cloud belt of the southern branch of the Atlantic Hadley cell.

Sediment plumes induced by the Port of Miami dredging: Analysis and interpretation using Landsat and MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Beginning in November 2013, large turbidity plumes were observed offshore the Port of Miami (Florida, USA), likely associated with a project to deepen and widen the Miami Harbor channels. Local coral colonies, including those considered threatened by the US Endangered Species Act, exacerbate the need for thorough assessment of these plumes. Without ruling out other causal factors such as wind storms and tidal currents, it is difficult to conclude whether the plumes were caused by the dredging. From current in situ monitoring programs, it is also difficult to estimate the size, duration, extent and historical context of these plumes. Satellite observing systems, in contrast, offer a means by which these plumes can be monitored and compared to previous events. As such, turbidity plumes visible in Landsat 8 and MODE Aqua imagery were first manually outlined, and then refined (for MODIS only) using anomaly and normalized anomaly thresholds determined from pre-dredging data. Local environmental conditions were also considered and used to determine dates for which elevated reflectance data might be expected in the absence of dredging. In total, the spatial extent of all turbidity plumes observed from November 2013 to April 2015 was between 127 and 228 km(2), at least 5 times that for January October 2013. Furthermore, the frequency of observed plumes in images increased from 23% to 84% after dredging began. Coral areas were particularly affected after dredging began, with over 11 km(2) of coral area being within plumes on an average of 16% of images (maximum 39%). Temporal differences in location, severity, and size were also observed. Together, these results highlight widespread turbidity plumes associated with the Port of Miami dredging activities, which may cause large adverse effects on local coral communities. The approaches developed in this work, in particular the focus on historical norms after considering all perturbation factors, may be included in monitoring and assessment of this and future dredging activities, especially where fragile marine ecosystems may be impacted.

J	Das, SK; Chatterjee, A; Ghosh, SK; Raha, S				Das, Sanat Kumar; Chatterjee, Abhijit; Ghosh, Sanjay K.; Raha, Sibaji			An integrated campaign for investigation of winter-time continental haze over Indo-Gangetic Basin and its radiative effects	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												An outflow of continental haze occurs from Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) in the North to Bay of Bengal (BoB) in the South. An integrated campaign was organized to investigate this continental haze during December 2013-February 2014 at source and remote regions within IGB to quantify its radiative effects. Measurements were carried out at three locations in eastern India; 1) Kalas Island, Sundarban (21.68 degrees N, 88.57 degrees E) - an isolated island along the north-east coast of BoB, 2) Kolkata (22.57 degrees N, 88.42 degrees E) - an urban metropolis and 3) Siliguri (26.70 degrees N, 88.35 degrees E) - an urban region at the foothills of eastern Himalayas. Ground-based AOD (at 0.5 mu m) is observed to be maximum (1.25 +/- 0.18) over Kolkata followed by Siliguri (0.60 +/- 0.17) and minimum over Sundarban (0.53 +/- 0.18). Black carbon concentration is found to be maximum at Kolkata (21.6 +/- 6.6 mu g . m(-3)) with almost equal concentrations at Siliguri (12.6 +/- 5.2 mu g . m(-3)) and Sundarban (12.3 +/- 3.0 mu g . m(-3)). Combination of MODIS-AOD and back-trajectories analysis shows an outflow of winter-time continental haze originating from central IGB and venting out through Sundarban towards BoB. This continental haze with high extinction coefficient is identified up to central BoB using CALIPSO observations and is found to contribute similar to 75% to marine AOD over central BoB. This haze produces significantly high aerosol radiative forcing within the atmosphere over Kolkata (75.4 Wm(-2)) as well as over Siliguri and Sundarban (40 Wm(-2)) indicating large forcing over entire IGB, from foothills of the Himalayas to coastal region. This winter-time continental haze also causes about similar radiative heating (1.5 K . day(-1)) from Siliguri to Sundarban which is enhanced over Kolkata (3 K . day(-1)) due to large emission of local urban aerosols. This high aerosol heating over entire IGB and coastal region of BoB can have considerable impact on the monsoonal circulation and more importantly, such haze transported over to BoB can significantly affect the marine hydrological cycle.

J	Nasiha, HJ; Shanmugam, P				Nasiha, Hussain J.; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Estimating the Bulk Refractive Index and Related Particulate Properties of Natural Waters From Remote-Sensing Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												A proof-of-concept method is developed to estimate bulk refractive index (eta(bp)) of particles for deriving information on their composition and optical properties of natural waters using satellite ocean color data. It estimates eta(bp) as a function of the backscattering ratio (B-p), hyperbolic slope of the particle size distribution (xi derived from the beam attenuation slope beta), and apparent density of particles (rho(a)) as described in our previous inversion model. For deriving these parameters from remote-sensing data, large in situ measurement data of the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), particulate scattering (b(p)), backscattering (b(bp)) beam attenuation (c(p)), and seawater constituents' concentrations are used to establish the required relationships and derive the model parameters (i.e., eta(bp) <- B-p, xi, rho(a); Bp <- R-rs; xi <-beta <- c(p) <- Turbidity; Turbidity <- R-rs; and rho(a) <- c(p)). When validated with those derived from in situ data spanning the large dynamic range in water optical properties and relevant water constituents impacting the remote-sensing signal, the derived model parameters and bulk refractive index had errors of a few percent which falls well within the benchmark for a validated uncertainty of +/- 35% endorsed for the remote-sensing retrieval of chlorophyll-a in oceanic waters. The model was applied to regional and global images of satellite ocean color observations provided by the MODIS-Aqua sensor. Global images of seasonal climatology over a decade of MODIS-Aqua ocean color observations provided interesting insights into the seasonal variability of eta(bp) in coastal and open ocean waters. To further investigate the bulk particulate assemblages in some regional waters, several MODIS-Aqua imageries from different regional waters dominated by sediment-laden river plumes and phytoplankton blooms were analyzed. Satellite retrievals of the eta(bp) varied from 1.035 to 1.05 for clear oceanic waters, 1.045-1.07 for phytoplankton-dominated waters (higher water content), 1.05-1.15 for floating algal blooms and Cocolithophore blooms, 1.07-1.10 for coastal waters dominated by detrital particles, and 1.10-1.28 for river plume and sediment-laden coastal waters (lower water content). These results were consistent with those expected for the waters examined, being in excellent agreement with the previous reports and estimates based on the laboratory/in situ measurements and modeling studies. Given the fact that there is currently no satellite-based method to differentiate between bulk particulate compositions, the new method provides a valuable tool for estimating eta(bp) values as a proxy for the apparent density and composition of particles and such information when derived from satellite ocean color data provides new tools for improving our current understanding of particle dynamics of pelagic ecosystems, advancing biogeochemical modeling, assessing the global ocean ecosystem, and elucidating the coastal processes.

While the relevance of each system has been observed across different wind erosion events in central Australia, the entrainment of dust by all three winds during the passage of an individual front has not been demonstrated until now. Synoptic information, satellite aerosol and imagery, meteorological and dust concentration data are presented for a single case study erosion event in the lower Lake Eyre Basin. This event demonstrates variable dust transport in three different directions from one of the southern Hemisphere's most significant source regions, and the changing nature of the active dust pathways during the passage of a frontal system. While only a single dust event is considered, the findings show the complexity of mineral aerosol emission and transport patterns even within an individual dust outbreak. For the lower Lake Eyre Basin, this appreciation of pathway behaviour is significant for better understanding the role of aeolian inputs from the dominant Australian source to surrounding marine systems. In a wider context, the findings exhibit the detailed insights into major dust source dynamics that can be obtained from high resolution spatial and particularly temporal data, as used in combination. This work highlights the importance of adequately resolved data for the accurate determination of dust entrainment and transport patterns of major dust sources.

These spatiotemporal properties of in situ measured near-surface aerosols were compared with the columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent, effective radius, mass concentration, fine-mode AOD, and large-mode AOD retrieved by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The spatial heterogeneity in the chemical nature of aerosols for the three contrasting seasons has been addressed. In all the seasons, BoB is found to be polluted by anthropogenic aerosols as revealed by their chemical composition. North BoB exhibits highest near-surface aerosol loading, columnar AOD, and aerosol mass concentration irrespective of the season. While the high AOD in winter is due to fine-mode anthropogenic aerosols, that in monsoon is due to large-sized sea-salt aerosols. The fine-mode AOD over BoB contributes 45% in monsoon, 69% in premonsoon, and 73% in winter. The column AOD in winter and premonsoon is similar to 50% of its monsoonal value. The e-fold scale distances of total aerosol mass loading and those of various chemical species over BoB are also investigated. The column mass concentration has been estimated from the in situ measured near-surface aerosol mass loading and compared with that retrieved from MODIS. Regions where low near-surface aerosol mass loading was observed; the satellite-retrieved columnar loading was found to be overestimated suggesting seasonal and regional differences in scale height.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 16	2015	120	19					10548	10568		10.1002/2015JD023418								WOS:000209847200041

Cumulative pressures from extreme weather with a high frequency of large scale flooding in recent years has been linked to the large scale reported decline in the health of inshore seagrass systems and coral reefs in the central areas of the GBR, with concerns for the recovery potential of these impacted ecosystems. Management authorities currently rely on remotely-sensed (RS) and in situ data for water quality monitoring to guide their assessment of water quality conditions in the GBR. The use of remotely-sensed satellite products provides a quantitative and accessible tool for scientists and managers. These products, coupled with in situ data, and more recently modelled data, are valuable for quantifying the influence of river plumes on seagrass and coral reef habitat in the GBR. This article reviews recent remote sensing techniques developed to monitor river plumes and water quality in the GBR. We also discuss emerging research that integrates hydrodynamic models with remote sensing and in situ data, enabling us to explore impacts of different catchment management strategies on GBR water quality.

WRF multi-physics simulation of clouds in the African region	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been used to simulate clouds, and their effects on precipitation and radiation, in Africa. The results have been compared with observational databases, mainly based on satellite measurements. The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been used to consistently compare simulated clouds with satellite data, allowing us to evaluate not only the total cloud cover but also the cloud amount of different cloud types, classified according to their optical thickness and cloud-top pressure. Nine WRF simulations, for the 2002-2006 period, were carried out to evaluate the influence on cloud cover of different physical parametrizations and model configurations. In general, model simulations show similar results, underestimating total cloud cover in most of the studied region. In the tropical convective area, high clouds are underestimated, but the net effect on the radiation is partially compensated by the overestimation of cloud optical depth. Major differences appear over subtropical areas dominated by marine boundary-layer clouds, mainly off the coast of Namibia. In this area, simulations show too many thick clouds and too few clouds with lower optical thickness. The net result is an underestimation of low cloud cover. Also, the transition from stratocumulus to shallow cumulus away from the coast is not realistically modelled.

Smoke dispersion modeling over complex terrain using high resolution meteorological data and satellite observations - The Fire Hub platform	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A total number of 20,212 fire hot spots were recorded by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument over Greece during the period 2002-2013. The Fire Radiative Power (FRP) of these events ranged from 10 up to 6000 MW at 1 km resolution, and many of these fire episodes resulted in long-range transport of smoke over distances up to several hundred kilometers. Three different smoke episodes over Greece are analyzed here using real time hot-spot observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) satellite instrument as well as from MODIS hot-spots. Simulations of smoke dispersion are performed with the FLEXPART-WRF model and particulate matter emissions are calculated directly from the observed FRP. The modeled smoke plumes are compared with smoke stereo-heights from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument and the sensitivities to atmospheric and modeling parameters are examined. Driving the simulations with high resolution meteorology (4 x 4 km) and using geostationary satellite data to identify the hot spots allows the description of local scale features that govern smoke dispersion.

J	Tripathy, M; Raman, M; Chauhan, P				Tripathy, Madhumita; Raman, Mini; Chauhan, Prakash			Estimation of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) from OCEANSAT-I OCM using a simple atmospheric radiative transfer model	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) is an important variable for radiation budget, marine and terrestrial ecosystem models. OCEANSAT-1 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) PAR was estimated using two different methods under both clear and cloudy sky conditions. In the first approach, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD) were estimated from OCEANSAT-1 OCM TOA (top-of-atmosphere) radiance data on a pixel by pixel basis and PAR was estimated from extraterrestrial solar flux for fifteen spectral bands using a radiative transfer model. The second approach used TOA radiances measured by OCM in the PAR spectral range to compute PAR. This approach also included surface albedo and cloud albedo as inputs. Comparison between OCEANSAT-1 OCM PAR at noon with in situ measured PAR shows that root mean square difference was 5.82% for the method I and 7.24% for the method II in daily time scales. Results indicate that methodology adopted to estimate PAR from OCEANSAT-1 OCM can produce reasonably accurate PAR estimates over the tropical Indian Ocean region. This approach can be extended to OCEANSAT-2 OCM and future OCEANSAT-3 OCM data for operational estimation of PAR for regional marine ecosystem applications. (C) 2015 COSPAR.

Validation of standard and alternative satellite ocean-color chlorophyll products off Western Iberia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) product validation off the Western Iberian coast is here undertaken by directly comparing remote sensing data with in situ surface reference values. Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities. Results also demonstrate the relevance of oceanographic regions such as the Nazare area to evaluate how complex hydrodynamic conditions can influence the quality of Chl products.

J	Amin, R; Penta, B; deRada, S				Amin, Ruhul; Penta, Bradley; deRada, Sergio			Occurrence and Spatial Extent of HABs on the West Florida Shelf 2002-Present	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can lead to severe economic and ecological impacts in coastal areas and can threaten marine life and human health. About three quarters of these toxic blooms are caused by dinoflagellate species. One dinoflagellate species, i.e., Karenia brevis, blooms nearly every year in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly on the West Florida Shelf (WFS), where these blooms cause millions of dollars in socioeconomic damage. In this letter, we use the red band difference (RBD) bloom detection technique for detection of low backscattering phytoplankton blooms, such as K. brevis, and conduct time-series analyses of the spatial extent of these blooms using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly mean data spanning July 2002 (sensor inception) to September 2014. The time-series results show that the RBD successfully detects the documented HABs in the region, illustrating the seasonal and interannual variability, including the extensive blooms of 2005 and 2014.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				OCT	2015	12	10					2080	2084		10.1109/LGRS.2015.2448453								WOS:000359576400015						
J	Olsen, PM; Kolden, CA; Gadamus, L				Olsen, Patrick M.; Kolden, Crystal A.; Gadamus, Lily			Developing Theoretical Marine Habitat Suitability Models from Remotely-Sensed Data and Traditional Ecological Knowledge	REMOTE SENSING												There is a lack of information regarding critical habitats for many marine species, including the bearded seal, an important subsistence species for the indigenous residents of Arctic regions. A systematic approach to modeling marine mammal habitat in arctic regions using the lifetime and multi-generational Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of Alaska Native hunters is developed to address this gap. The approach uses lifetime and cross-generational knowledge of subsistence hunters and their harvest data in the place of observational knowledge gained from Western scientific field surveys of marine mammal sightings. TEK information for mid-June to October was transformed to seal presence/pseudo-absence and used to train Classification Tree Analyses of environmental predictor variables to predict suitable habitat for bearded seals in the Bering Strait region. Predictor variables were derived from a suite of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric remote sensing products, transformed using trend analysis techniques, and aggregated. A Kappa of 0.883 was achieved for habitat classifications. The TEK information used is spatially restricted, but provides a viable, replicable data source that can replace or complement Western scientific observational data.																	2072-4292					SEP	2015	7	9					11863	11886		10.3390/rs70911863								WOS:000362511400042						
J	Gehlot, S; Minnett, PJ; Stammer, D				Gehlot, Swati; Minnett, Peter J.; Stammer, Detlef			Impact of Sahara dust on solar radiation at Cape Verde Islands derived from MODIS and surface measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Based on radiometer measurements of solar irradiance (direct and diffuse light) and Aeronet-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained at the Cape Verde atmospheric observatory during a major cloud-free dust outbreak event on February 7, 2012, the relationship between Saharan mineral dust outbreaks and a reduction of solar irradiance is quantified. The investigation is representative of the eastern subtropical North Atlantic region where the wind mobilization of mineral desert dust from the Sahara results in aerosol signals that are large enough to outweigh those from other aerosol types such as anthropogenic and marine aerosols. Ground-based estimates of AOD show frequency dependence as is expected from Mie theory. Our AOD signals agree well with satellite-based MODIS products and reveal AOD values exceeding 2.5 during the investigated dust storm event. We also demonstrate the use of satellite imagery with an atmospheric trajectory model to simulate time series of measurements at a given location. Using this approach, variations in AOD observed during February 7, 2012 can be rationalized as spatial inhomogeneities in the atmospheric dust load being advected laterally over the observing site. Our measurements suggest a dust forcing efficiency of around 90 W/m(2)/AOD at a wavelength of 380 nm, which is about 10-15% greater than reported in the literature indicative of a possible non-linear behavior at high AODs.

J	Huang, Z; Feng, M				Huang, Zhi; Feng, Ming			Remotely sensed spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Leeuwin Current is an anomalous poleward-flowing eastern boundary current that transports warm tropical waters southward and imposes significant ecological influences on the coastal marine ecosystems off Western Australia. In this study, we attempt to map the spatial structure of the sea surface temperature (SST) signature of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS satellite data, which is used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current for the period July 2002 to December 2012. A topographic Position Index (TPI) method is used to map the Leeuwin Current's SST signature from the MODIS SST images. The semi-automatic classification process involves automatically identifying areas occupied by warm SST waters of the Leeuwin Current and manually discarding detached Leeuwin Current features. The TPI mapping results enabled us to quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST signature, including its spatial structure, extent, and cross-shelf migration, as well as its associated surface chlorophyll a characteristics. This study showed that the TPI mapping is able to capture the complex spatial structures of the Leeuwin Current, including its meanders, offshoots and eddies along its path, as reflected in the SST data. Using an eddy-resolving, data-assimilating numerical ocean model, we were able to relate the Leeuwin Current's SST signature with its surface current speed signature, though generally the speed signature is on the offshore side of the SST signature by about 25 to 30 km. Temporal wavelet analyses indicated that the variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST structure is dominated by seasonal cycle. During austral winter, the warm SST signature of the current is close to the shelf break, having greater spatial extent and higher chlorophyll a concentrations. In contrast, during austral summer, the SST signature of the current moves offshore, with reduced spatial extent and chlorophyll a concentrations. The Leeuwin Current also has notable inter-annual variation, to a large extent in response to ENSO variability in the Pacific. In El Nino years the current's SST signature tends to have reduced spatial extent, move further inshore, and increase its chlorophyll a concentrations. The opposite occurs during the La Nina years, especially after the unprecedented 2010-11 La Nina/Ningaloo Nino event when there was a significant reduction of the surface chlorophyll a concentration within the Leeuwin Current's SST signature. The mapping method developed in this study will be also useful in detecting climate driven variability of other ocean boundary current systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Global retrieval of marine and terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence at its red peak using hyperspectral top of atmosphere radiance measurements: Feasibility study and first results	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll fluorescence is directly linked to the physiology of phytoplankton or plants. Here, we present a new satellite remote sensing approach to retrieve chlorophyll fluorescence at its red peak (similar to 685 nm) by using measurements from the hyperspectral instruments SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). This method, which is based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique, was used to exploit narrow spectral structures resulting from the filling-in of the Fraunhofer Fe I line, which originates from fluorescence. The reference spectra for chlorophyll fluorescence were calculated by the coupled ocean atmosphere radiative transfer model SCIATRAN. We compared our results on marine chlorophyll fluorescence observations with the MODIS Terra normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH) product for the average of years 2003-2011 and year 2009. Our method also enables the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence above land vegetation scenes. The results for the fluorescence observed above terrestrial vegetation for July and December 2009 were compared to MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The comparisons show good spatial agreement between different retrievals providing evidence for the good performance of our algorithm. The method presented is generic and can be applied to other hyperspectral instruments in the future. Having established the retrieval technique, extensive studies of chlorophyll fluorescence will improve global knowledge on physiology and photosynthetic efficiency, in both the marine and terrestrial realms, and its dependence on environmental factors.

Global aerosol mixtures and their multiyear and seasonal characteristics	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The optical and microphysical characteristics of distinct aerosol types in the atmosphere are not yet specified at the level of detail required for climate forcing studies. What is even less well known are the characteristics of mixtures of aerosol and, in particular, their precise global spatial distribution. Here, cluster analysis is applied to seven years of 3-hourly, gridded 2.5 degrees x 2 degrees aerosol optical depth data from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model, one of the most-studied global simulations of aerosol type currently available, to construct a spatial partition of the globe into a finite number of aerosol mixtures. The optimal number of aerosol mixtures is obtained with a k-means algorithm with smart seeding in conjunction with a stopping condition based on applying the law of diminishing returns' to the norm of the Euclidean distance to provide upper and lower bounds on the number of clusters. Each cluster has a distinct composition in terms of the proportion of biomass burning, sulfate, dust and marine (sea salt) aerosol and this leads rather naturally to a taxonomy for labeling aerosol mixtures. In addition, the assignment of primary colors to constituent aerosol types enables true color-mixing and the production of easy-to-interpret maps of their distribution. The mean multiyear global partition as well as partitions deduced on the seasonal timescale are used to extract aerosol robotic network (AERONET) Level 2.0 Version 2 inversion products in each cluster for estimating the values of key optical and microphysical parameters to help characterize aerosol mixtures. On the multiyear timescale, the globe can be spatially partitioned into 10 distinct aerosol mixtures, with only marginally more variability on the seasonal timescale. In the context of the observational constraints and uncertainties associated with AERONET retrievals, bivariate analysis suggests that mixtures dominated by dust and marine aerosol can be detected with reference to their single scattering albedo and Angstrom exponent at visible wavelengths in conjunction with their fine mode fraction and sphericity. Existing multivariate approaches at classification appear to be more ambiguous. The approach presented here provides gridded (1 degrees x 1 degrees) mean compositions of aeorosol mixtures as well as tentative estimates of mean aerosol optical and microphysical parameters in planetary regions where AERONET sites do not yet exist. Spreadsheets of gridded cluster indices for multiyear and seasonal partitions are provided to facilitate further study of the global distribution of aerosol mixtures and possibly for the selection of new AERONET site locations.

MODIS comparisons with northeastern Pacific in situ stratocumulus microphysics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Vertical sounding measurements within stratocumuli during two aircraft field campaigns, Marine Stratus/stratocumulus Experiment (MASE) and Physics of Stratocumulus Top (POST), are used to validate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud liquid water path (LWP), and cloud effective radius (r(e)). In situ COT, LWP, and r(e) were calculated using 5 m vertically averaged droplet probe measurements of complete vertical cloud penetrations. MODIS COT, LWP, and r(e) 1 km pixels were averaged along these penetrations. COT comparisons in POST showed strong correlations and a near 1:1 relationship. In MASE, comparisons showed strong correlations; however, MODIS COT exceeded in situ COT, likely due to larger temporal differences between MODIS and in situ measurements. LWP comparisons between two cloud probes show good agreement for POST but not MASE, giving confidence to POST data. Both projects provided strong LWP correlations but MODIS exceeded in situ by 14-36%. MODIS in situ r(e) correlations were strong, but MODIS 2.1 mu m r(e) exceeded in situ r(e), which contributed to LWP bias; in POST, MODIS r(e) was 20-30% greater than in situ r(e). Maximum in situ r(e) near cloud top showed comparisons nearer 1:1. Other MODIS r(e) bands (3.7 mu m and 1.6 mu m) showed similar comparisons. Temporal differences between MODIS and in situ measurements, airplane speed differences, and cloud probe artifacts were likely causes of weaker MASE correlations. POST COT comparison was best for temporal differences under 20 min. POST data validate MODIS COT but it also implies a positive MODIS r(e) bias that propagates to LWP while still capturing variability.

Assessment of ocean color data records from MODIS-Aqua in the western Arctic Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A broad suite of bio-optical and biogeochemical observations collected during the NASA-funded ICESCAPE expeditions to the western Arctic Ocean in 2010 and 2011 was used to validate ocean color satellite data products in this region, which is undergoing fast ecological changes in the context of a changing climate. Satellite-to-in situ match-ups for the MODIS instrument on board Aqua (MODISA) were evaluated using standard NASA empirical and semi-analytical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll-a (C-a), spectral marine inherent optical properties, and particulate organic carbon (POC). Results for the empirical algorithms were compared with those from the semi-analytical Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP) algorithm. The findings presented here showed that MODISA Ca estimates were positively biased relative to in situ measurements, in agreement with previous studies that have evaluated ocean color retrievals in the Arctic Ocean. These biases were reproduced using both satellite and in situ measured remote sensing reflectances, R-rs(lambda), indicating that estimation errors are derived from the application of the empirical algorithm and not by the observed radiometry. This disparity appears to be caused by contributions of high spectral absorption from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which is a well-documented feature of Arctic Ocean waters. The current MODISA empirical algorithm (OC3M) appears to attribute CDOM absorption in the blue region of the spectrum to phytoplankton absorption. In contrast, GIOP showed significant improvement over OC3M C-a estimates by effectively discriminating between phytoplankton and CDOM absorption. Additionally, executing GIOP with an expanded set of spectral bands derived from in situ radiometry, instead of just six MODISA bands, further improved the performance of absorption estimates. These findings reinforce previous suggestions that semi-analytical approaches will provide more reliable data records for Arctic studies than existing empirical methods. POC estimates showed no clear bias relative to in situ measurements, suggesting that the empirical algorithm better represents high latitude oceans with regards to the bio-optical signature of suspended particulate stocks.

Krishna; Babu, Suresh			Spatial heterogeneity in spectral variability of aerosol optical depth and its implications to aerosol radiative forcing in the Tropical Indian Ocean and in the Indian Ocean Sector of Southern Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The aerosol optical depths (AODs) in the wavelength range 380-875 nm and black carbon (BC) mass concentrations were estimated over the tropical Indian Ocean and in the Indian Ocean sector of Southern Ocean, between 14 degrees N and 53 degrees S, during December 2011-February 2012, onboard the Ocean Research Vessel (ORV) Sagar Nidhi. The data were analysed to understand the spectral variability, micro-physical characteristics of aerosols and the associated radiative forcing. Concurrent MODIS-derived chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and sea-surface temperature (SST) provided ancillary data used to understand the variability of biomass in association with fronts and the possible role of phytoplankton as a source of aerosols. AODs and their spectral dependencies were distinctly different north and south of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). North of 11 degrees S (the northern limit of ITCZ), the spectral distribution of AOD followed Angstrom turbidity formule (Junge power law function), while it deviated from such a distribution south of 16 degrees S (southern boundary of ITCZ). At the southern limit of the ITCZ and beyond, the spectral variation of AOD showed a peak around 440 nm, the amplitude of which was highest at similar to 43 degrees S, the axis of the subtropical front (STF) with the highest Chl-a concentration (0.35 mu g l(-1)) in the region. To understand the role of Chl-a in increasing AOD at 440 nm, AOD at this wavelength was estimated using Optical properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) model. The anomalies between the measured and model-estimated (difference between the measured and estimated AOD values at 440 nm) AOD(440) were correlated with Chl-a concentrations. A very high and significant association with coefficient of determination (R-2=0.80) indicates the contribution of Chl-a as a source of aerosols in this part of the ocean. On the basis of the measured aerosol properties, the study area was divided into three zones; Zone 1 comprising of the area between 10 degrees N and 11 degrees S; Zone 2 from 16 degrees S to 53 degrees S; and Zone 3 from 52 degrees S to 24 degrees S during the return leg. BC mass concentration was in the range 520 ng m(-3) to 2535 ng m(-3) in Zone 1, while it was extremely low in the other zones (ranging from 49.3 to 264.4 ng m(-3) in Zone 2 and from 61.6 ng m(-3) to 303.3 ng m(-3) in Zone 3). The atmospheric direct-short wave radiative forcing (DRSF), estimated using a radiative transfer model (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer - SBDART), was in the range 4.72-27.62 wm(-2) north of 16 degrees S, and 4.80-6.25 wm(-2) south of 16 degrees S.

The Strait of Bonifacio is a particularly sensitive marine area in which specific conservation measures have been taken to preserve the natural environment and wild species. Good knowledge of the hydrodynamics in this area is essential to optimize the Marine Protected Area's management rules. Therefore, we used a high-resolution model (400 m) based on the MARS3D code to investigate the main flux exchanges and to formulate certain hypotheses about the formation of possible eddy structures. The aim of the present paper is first to synthetize the results obtained by combining Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data, hydrological parameters, Lagrangian drifter data, and satellite observations such as MODIS OC5 chlorophyll a data or Metop-A AVHRR Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. These elements are then used to validate the presence of the mesoscale eddies simulated by the model and their recurrence outside the cruise period. To complete the analysis, the response of the 3D hydrodynamical model was evaluated under two opposing wind systems and certain biases were detected. Strong velocities up to 1 m s(-1) were recorded in the east part due to the Venturi effect; a complementary system of vortices governed by Coriolis effect and west wind was observed in the west part, and horizontal stratification in the central part has been identified under typical wind condition.					galgani, francois/0000-0001-8770-6054; Bisgambiglia, Paul-Antoine/0000-0003-3026-2258												1616-7341	1616-7228				AUG	2015	65	8					1165	1182		10.1007/s10236-015-0863-5								WOS:000358604600008

Assessing the evolution of historic eutrophication status is of importance for exploring the reasons for the blooms. In this study, we used an area-weighted nutrient pollution index (AWCPI-NP) and ocean color data to assess temporal changes in eutrophication status in the Yellow Sea basin. Results show that significant shifts occurred from the pre-MAB phase (2001-2006) to MAB phase (2007-2012): the average AWCPI-NP was higher than that in the pre-MAB phase (2001-2006) by about 45 %; chlorophyll a concentration, an indicator of eutrophication, increased by about 15 % in the region of MAB. Meanwhile, in the Jiangsu Shoal, the origin place of the floating macroalgae, the annual in situ nutrient concentrations increased rapidly from 2000 to 2011. The result obtained through our approach highlights that the MAB in the Yellow Sea might be primarily linked to the progressive eutrophication. In order to reduce this hazard, policy makers should include this new knowledge for an effective countermeasure planning.

Although they only account for 5% of the global land surface, over 550 million people live in deltas. These preferred livelihood locations, which feature flat terrain, fertile alluvial soils, access to fluvial and marine resources, a rich wetland biodiversity and other advantages are, however, threatened by numerous internal and external processes. Socio-economic development, urbanization, climate change induced sea level rise, as well as flood pulse changes due to upstream water diversion all lead to changes in these highly dynamic systems. A thorough understanding of a river delta's general setting and intra-annual as well as long-term dynamic is therefore crucial for an informed management of natural resources. Here, remote sensing can play a key role in analyzing and monitoring these vast areas at a global scale. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential of intra-annual time series analyses at dense temporal, but coarse spatial resolution for inundation characterization in five river deltas located in four different countries. Based on 250 m MODIS reflectance data we analyze inundation dynamics in four densely populated Asian river deltas-namely the Yellow River Delta (China), the Mekong Delta (Vietnam), the Irrawaddy Delta (Myanmar), and the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh, India)-as well as one very contrasting delta: the nearly uninhabited polar Mackenzie Delta Region in northwestern Canada for the complete time span of one year (2013). A complex processing chain of water surface derivation on a daily basis allows the generation of intra-annual time series, which indicate inundation duration in each of the deltas. Our analyses depict distinct inundation patterns within each of the deltas, which can be attributed to processes such as overland flooding, irrigation agriculture, aquaculture, or snowmelt and thermokarst processes. Clear differences between mid-latitude, subtropical, and polar deltas are illustrated, and the advantages and limitations of the approach for inundation derivation are discussed.

Riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) is discharged into oceans after a series of biogeochemical reactions in estuaries. Satellite monitoring of POC will improve our understanding of the carbon dynamics of these water bodies. Based on in situ data from four seasonal survey cruises, we developed an algorithm for estimating POC concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Reflectance ratios, Rrs(678)/Rrs(488) and Rrs(748)/Rrs(412), were set as inputs to calculate POC concentration in the PRE. The algorithm was then applied to MODIS/AQUA data to inverse POC concentrations in the PRE from 2002 to 2014. Additionally, sources, impact factors, and seasonal distributions of POC were also investigated. Phytoplankton contributed more to POC in off-shore waters than that in in-shore waters in autumn and spring, but showed the opposite pattern in winter. Under the influence of freshwater from the Pearl River, underwater topography, tides, winds, etc., the seasonal POC concentrations along a specific section, vertical to water depth gradient, decreased in different seasons. These decreases could be described by exponential functions (y = ae(bx), b < 0). The distribution of POC concentrations in the PRE resulted from complex physical and biogeochemical processes, which can change spatially and seasonally.																	2072-4292					JUL	2015	7	7					8683	8704		10.3390/rs70708683								WOS:000360919900020

An improved algorithm for remotely sensing marine dissolved organic carbon: Climatology in the northern South China Sea shelf-sea and adjacent waters	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												By using field in situ observations, data from the NOMAD database, and remotely sensed data from MODIS-Aqua, an improved algorithm has been developed for estimating the surface concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Northern South China Sea Shelf-sea (NoSoCS) and adjacent waters through a combination of the remotely sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Unlike previously reported algorithms, which were based on only one of these two parameters, this algorithm does not require seasonal tuning and is applicable to both coastal and pelagic waters. The uncertainty in the remotely sensed concentrations of DOC is about +/- 4-10 mu M. The climatological distributions of the satellite-derived surface DOC in the NoSoCS and adjacent waters between 2002 and 2012 followed a general trend of increasing concentrations landward, from about 58 and 73 mu M in the open South China Sea (SCS) in January and July, respectively, to > 100 mu M at the mouth of the Pearl River. The intra-annual changes in the monthly average concentration of DOC in the NoSoCS follow a distinct seasonal cycle, with the lowest and highest concentrations, 56 mu M and 75 mu M, in February and July, respectively. The seasonal cycle of DOC was in phase with that of SST but out of phase with that of primary production, suggesting that biological activity was not likely its primary control. Instead, it was consistent with the entrainment of the cold and less DOC-rich sub-surface water in the surface water by enhanced vertical mixing during winter, and the high inflow of organic-rich river water to the NoSoCS in summer. Sub-regionally, lower concentrations of DOC were found in the known upwelling zones in the NoSoCS, where vertical mixing was enhanced. In the inner shelf, the effect of riverine input was indicated by higher concentrations of DOC in the plume of water at the mouth of the Pearl River. This work represents the first attempt to characterize the regional distribution of surface concentration of DOC in the NoSoCS and adjacent waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here an algorithm is introduced to simultaneously retrieve above-cloud aerosol optical thickness (AOT), the cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective particle radius (CER) of the underlying MBL clouds while also providing pixel-level estimates of retrieval uncertainty. This approach utilizes reflectance measurements at six Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels from the visible to the shortwave infrared. Retrievals are run under two aerosol model assumptions on 8years (2006-2013) of June-October Aqua MODIS data over the SE Atlantic, from which a regional cloud and above-cloud aerosol climatology is produced. The cloud retrieval methodology is shown to yield COT and CER consistent with those from the MODIS operational cloud product (MOD06) when forcing AOT to zero, while the full COT-CER-AOT retrievals that account for the above-cloud aerosol attenuation increase regional monthly mean COT and CER by up to 9% and 2%, respectively. Retrieved AOT is roughly 3 to 5 times larger than the collocated 532nm Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) retrievals, though closer agreement is observed with the CALIOP 1064nm retrievals, a result consistent with previous case study analyses. Regional cloudy-sky above-cloud aerosol DRE calculations are also performed that illustrate the importance of the aerosol model assumption and underlying cloud retrievals.

In the upper Chesapeake Bay, river-induced sediment plumes are generally known as either a monotonic spatial shape or a turbidity maximum. Little is known about plume evolution in response to variation in streamflow and extreme discharge of sediment. Here we propose a typology of sediment plumes in the upper Chesapeake Bay using a 17 year time series of satellite-derived suspended sediment concentration. On the basis of estimated fluvial and wind contributions, we define an intermittent/wind-dominated type and a continuous type, the latter of which is further divided into four subtypes based on spatial features of plumes, which we refer to as Injection, Transport, Temporary Turbidity-Maximum, and Persistent Turbidity-Maximum. The four continuous types exhibit a consistent sequence of evolution within 1 week to 1 month following flood events. We also identify a shift in typology with increased frequency of Turbidity-Maximum types before and after Hurricane Ivan (2004), which implies that extreme events have longer-lasting effects upon estuarine suspended sediment than previously considered. These results can serve as a diagnostic tool to better predict distribution and impacts of estuarine suspended sediment in response to changes in climate and land use.

The GAW-PFR aerosol optical depth network: The 2008-2013 time series at Cape Point Station, South Africa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A ground-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) climatology is presented for Cape Point (CPT) station, South Africa, for the 2008-2013 period. CPT is part of the Global Atmosphere Watch-Precision Filter Radiometer network which conducts long-term AOD measurements at remote background sites. AOD (=500nm) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (368 to 862nm; (368-862)) averages for the entire period were 0.059 and 0.68, displaying only a weak seasonality. Based on an established method for air mass classification using the in situ wind direction and Rn-222 concentration, the following four air mass types were used to further investigate AOD: background marine, marine, mixed, and continental. AOD was similar for all types, but (368-862) was distinctly lower (0.43) for background marine and higher (1.07) for continental air masses, illustrating the presence of coarse mode and anthropogenic aerosols, respectively. Trajectory cluster analysis of 5day back trajectories confirmed/augmented this classification. AOD for background marine and marine air mass types were consistent with ship-based (Maritime Aerosol Network) and island (AErosol RObotic NETwork) measurements, suggesting that CPT is a suitable site to monitor pristine conditions in the South Atlantic and Southern Oceans when Rn-222 concentrations are <100mBqm(-3).

Frequency and causes of failed MODIS cloud property retrievals for liquid phase clouds over global oceans	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieves cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) and optical thickness () by projecting observed cloud reflectances onto a precomputed look-up table (LUT). When observations fall outside of the LUT, the retrieval is considered failed because no combination of and r(e) within the LUT can explain the observed cloud reflectances. In this study, the frequency and potential causes of failed MODIS retrievals for marine liquid phase (MLP) clouds are analyzed based on 1year of Aqua MODIS Collection 6 products and collocated CALIOP and CloudSat observations. The retrieval based on the 0.86 mu m and 2.1 mu m MODIS channel combination has an overall failure rate of about 16% (10% for the 0.86 mu m and 3.7 mu m combination). The failure rates are lower over stratocumulus regimes and higher over the broken trade wind cumulus regimes. The leading type of failure is the r(e) too large failure accounting for 60%-85% of all failed retrievals. The rest is mostly due to the r(e) too small or retrieval failures. Enhanced retrieval failure rates are found when MLP cloud pixels are partially cloudy or have high subpixel inhomogeneity, are located at special Sun-satellite viewing geometries such as sunglint, large viewing or solar zenith angles, or cloudbow and glory angles, or are subject to cloud masking, cloud overlapping, and/or cloud phase retrieval issues. The majority (more than 84%) of failed retrievals along the CALIPSO track can be attributed to at least one or more of these potential reasons. The collocated CloudSat radar reflectivity observations reveal that the remaining failed retrievals are often precipitating. It remains an open question whether the extremely large r(e) values observed in these clouds are the consequence of true cloud microphysics or still due to artifacts not included in this study.

The present study analyzed the spatial-temporal variations of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration under the influence of discharge from the Yangtze River, based on remotely sensed Chl-a concentrations. The study area was initially zoned to quantitatively investigate the spatial variation patterns of Chl-a. Then, the temporal variation of Chl-a in each zone was simulated by a sinusoidal curve model. The results showed that in the inshore waters, the terrigenous discharge was the predominant driving force determining the pattern of Chl-a, which brings the risk of red tide disasters; while in the open sea areas, Chl-a was mainly affected by meteorological factors. Furthermore, a diversity of spatial and temporal variations of Chl-a existed based on the degree of influences from discharge. The diluted water extended from inshore to the east of Jeju Island. This process affected the Chl-a concentration flowing through the area, and had a potential impact on the marine environment. The Chl-a from September to November showed an obvious response to the discharge from July to September with a lag of 1 to 2 months.																	1660-4601					MAY	2015	12	5					5420	5438		10.3390/ijerph120505420								WOS:000359190300057	26006121					
J	Vanhellemont, Q; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Ruddick, Kevin			Advantages of high quality SWIR bands for ocean colour processing: Examples from Landsat-8	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring of water quality by satellite ocean colour data requires high quality atmospheric correction and especially the accurate quantification of the aerosol contribution to the top of atmosphere radiance. Several methods have been proposed for atmospheric correction over turbid waters, including modelling the marine contributions to the NIR signal or switching to longer short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths where the signal even in turbid waters can be assumed zero. Here we present the use of the high quality SWIR bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8, launched in 2013, to extend our existing turbid water atmospheric correction to extremely turbid waters. The atmospheric correction is image based, and no external measurements are required. The aerosol type is estimated using NIR and SWIR bands in clear water pixels, or in all water pixels using the two SWIR bands. The aerosol type is assumed to be constant over a single Landsat-8 tile (170 by 185 km), or allowed to vary spatially when using both SWIR bands. Realistic spatial patterns of marine reflectances are retrieved, uncorrelated with the estimated aerosol reflectance. Taking spatial and temporal variability into account, products from Landsat-8 compare well with those of MODIS Aqua and Terra also using the SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. The limitations of our previously published method (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2014a) are illustrated at higher turbidities, and removed by using the new method. The uncertainty caused by using a single aerosol type per scene is assessed. The advantages of the high spatial resolution L8/OLI data are clear for applications in coastal and estuarine waters. As an example of the advantage of high quality SWIR bands, and a SWIR-based atmospheric correction, an algorithm for detecting black suspended sediments from dredging and dumping operations is demonstrated here. In conclusion, L8/OLI is a powerful new tool for remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, and can be used as a precursor for future ocean colour missions with SWIR bands. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Aerosol-cloud interactions in ship tracks using Terra MODIS/MISR	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Simultaneous ship track observations from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) have been compiled to investigate how ship-injected aerosols affect marine warm boundary layer clouds for different cloud types and environmental conditions. By taking advantage of the high spatial resolution multiangle observations available from MISR, we utilized the retrieved cloud albedo, cloud top height, and cloud motion vectors to examine cloud property responses in ship-polluted and nearby unpolluted clouds. The strength of the cloud albedo response to increased aerosol level is primarily dependent on cloud cell structure, dryness of the free troposphere, and boundary layer depth, corroborating a previous study by Chen et al. (2012) where A-Train satellite data were utilized. Under open cell cloud structure the cloud properties are more susceptible to aerosol perturbations as compared to closed cells. Aerosol plumes caused an increase in liquid water amount (+38%), cloud top height (+13%), and cloud albedo (+49%) for open cell clouds, whereas for closed cell clouds, little change in cloud properties was observed. Further capitalizing on MISR's unique capabilities, the MISR cross-track cloud speed was used to derive cloud top divergence. Statistically averaging the results from the identified plume segments to reduce random noise, we found evidence of cloud top divergence in the ship-polluted clouds, whereas the nearby unpolluted clouds showed cloud top convergence, providing observational evidence of a change in local mesoscale circulation associated with enhanced aerosols. Furthermore, open cell polluted clouds revealed stronger cloud top divergence as compared to closed cell clouds, consistent with different dynamical mechanisms driving their responses. These results suggest that detailed cloud responses, classified by cloud type and environmental conditions, must be accounted for in global climate modeling studies to reduce uncertainties in calculations of aerosol indirect forcing.

Discrimination of Aerosol Types and Validation of MODIS Aerosol and Water Vapour Products Using a Sun Photometer over Central India	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												Aerosol optical properties were studied using handheld Microtops II sun photometer over Nagpur (79.028 degrees E, 21.125 degrees N) located in central India, suggests highest Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (0.64 +/- 0.08) during Pre-Monsoon Season (PMS) and lowest AOD (0.38 +/- 0.06) during Summer Monsoon Season (SMS). Using the scatter plot of AOD(500) versus Angstrom exponent (a), dominating type of aerosol, during the most of the seasons is found to be urban/industrial and biomass burning (UB). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire data suggests a large amount of biomass burning in different parts of India during PMS compared to other seasons. Aerosol transport analysis suggests during PMS, the air masses were originated from the biomass burning regions, desert regions and also from marine regions. Seasonal variation of AOD(550) over India using MODIS data indicates significant AOD (> 0.7) over northwest during SMS, Indo - Gangetic region during Post Monsoon Season (PoMS) and north east region during winter. Southern part of India shows relatively less AOD (< 0.45) compared to north India during all the seasons. MODIS derived AOD and water vapor (NIR), compared against the ground-based observations from sun photometer, indicates an underestimation of 35% lower AOD compared to sun photometer and overestimation of 20% higher water vapor with correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.89 respectively. In view of the sizeable contribution of biomass burning aerosols, we suggest the use of a more absorbing type of aerosol model for central India, for an accurate retrieval of AOD from MODIS.

Patterns of Diurnal Marine Stratocumulus Cloud Fraction Variability	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The spatial patterns of subtropical marine stratocumulus cloud fraction variability on diurnal time scales are examined using high-temporal-resolution cloud masks that are based on 30-min, 4 km 3 4 km geosynchronous infrared data for 2003-10. This dataset permits comparison of the characteristics of variability in low cloud fraction among the three subtropical marine stratocumulus regions in the northeastern (NE) Pacific, southeastern (SE) Pacific, and SE Atlantic Oceans. In all three regions, the largest diurnal cycles and earliest time of cloud breakup occur on the edges of the cloud field where cloud fractions are generally lower. The rate at which the cloud breaks up during the day is tied to the starting cloud fraction at dawn, which determines the amount of longwave cooling that is initially available to offset shortwave radiative fluxes during the day. The maximum rate of cloud breakup occurs near 1200 LT. Cloud fraction begins to increase by 1600 LT (before the sun sets) and reaches its maximum value just before dawn. The diurnal-cycle characteristics of the SE Pacific and SE Atlantic marine stratocumulus cloud decks are more similar to each other than to those in the NE Pacific. The NE Pacific cloud deck has a smaller-amplitude diurnal cycle, slower rates of cloud breakup during the day for a given cloud fraction at dawn, and a higher probability of cloud breakup overnight.

Improving upon previous techniques, the approach leverages the capability of CloudSat and CALIPSO to retrieve vertically resolved estimates of cloud and aerosol properties required for complete and accurate assessment of aerosol direct effects under all conditions. The global annually averaged aerosol direct radiative effect is estimated to be -1.9 W m(-2) with an uncertainty range of (+)0.6 W m(-2), which is in better agreement with previously published estimates from global models than previous satellite-based estimates. Detailed comparisons against a fully coupled simulation of the Community Earth System Model, however, reveal that this agreement on the global annual mean masks large regional discrepancies between modeled and observed estimates of aerosol direct effects. A series of regional analyses demonstrate that, in addition to previously documented biases in simulated aerosol distributions, the magnitude and sign of these discrepancies are often related to model biases in the geographic and seasonal distribution of clouds. A low bias in stratocumulus cloud cover over the southeastern Pacific, for example, leads to an overestimate of the radiative effects of marine aerosols in the region. Likewise, errors in the seasonal cycle of low clouds in the southeastern Atlantic distort the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols from southern Africa. These findings indicate that accurate assessment of aerosol direct effects requires models to correctly represent not only the source, strength, and optical properties of aerosols, but their relative proximity to clouds as well.

W.; Platt, Trevor; Sathyendranath, Shubha; Hoteit, Ibrahim			Phytoplankton phenology indices in coral reef ecosystems: Application to ocean-color observations in the Red Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Phytoplankton, at the base of the marine food web, represent a fundamental food source in coral reef ecosystems. The timing (phenology) and magnitude of the phytoplankton biomass are major determinants of trophic interactions. The Red Sea is one of the warmest and most saline basins in the world, characterized by an arid tropical climate regulated by the monsoon. These extreme conditions are particularly challenging for marine life. Phytoplankton phenological indices provide objective and quantitative metrics to characterize phytoplankton seasonality. The indices i.e. timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration are estimated here using 15 years (1997-2012) of remote sensing ocean-color data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative project (OC-CCI) in the entire Red Sea basin. The OC-CCI product, comprising merged and bias-corrected observations from three independent ocean-color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS), and processed using the POLYMER algorithm (MERIS period), shows a significant increase in chlorophyll data coverage, especially in the southern Red Sea during the months of summer NW monsoon. In open and reef-bound coastal waters, the performance of OC-CCI chlorophyll data is shown to be comparable with the performance of other standard chlorophyll products for the global oceans. These features have permitted us to investigate phytoplankton phenology in the entire Red Sea basin, and during both winter SE monsoon and summer NW monsoon periods. The phenological indices are estimated in the four open water provinces of the basin, and further examined at six coral reef complexes of particular socio-economic importance in the Red Sea, including Siyal Islands, Shams El Sheikh, Al Wajh bank, Thuwal reefs, Al Lith reefs and Farasan Islands. Most of the open and deeper waters of the basin show an apparent higher chlorophyll concentration and longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the winter period (relative to the summer phytoplankton growth period). In contrast, most of the reef-bound coastal waters display equal or higher peak chlorophyll concentrations and equal or longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the summer period (relative to the winter phytoplankton growth period). The ecological and biological significance of the phytoplankton seasonal characteristics are discussed in context of ecosystem state assessment, and particularly to support further understanding of the structure and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in the Red Sea.

Monitoring and trend mapping of sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS data: a case study of Mumbai coast	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in monitoring ecosystem health in the marine and coastal environment. Coastal ecosystem is largely dependent on ambient temperature and temperature fronts for marine/coastal habitat and its sustainability. Hence, thermal pollution is seen as a severe threat for ecological health of coastal waters across the world. Mumbai is one of the largest metropolises of the world and faces severe domestic and industrial effluent disposal problem, of which thermal pollution is a major issue with policy-makers and environmental stakeholders. This study attempts to understand the long-term SST variation in the coastal waters off Mumbai, on the western coast of India, and to identify thermal pollution zones. Analysis of SST trends in the near-coastal waters for the pre-and postmonsoon seasons from the year 2004 to the year 2010 has been carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Thermal Infra-red (TIR) bands. SST is calculated with the help of bands 31 and 32 using split window method. Several statistical operations were then applied to find the seasonal averages in SST and the standard deviation of SST in the study area. Maximumvariation in SSTwas found within a perpendicular distance of 5 km from the shoreline during the study period. Also, a warm water mass was found to form consistently off coast during the winter months. Several anthropogenic sources of thermal pollution could be identified which were found to impact various locations along the coast.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2015	187	4								10.1007/s10661-015-4386-9								WOS:000350685000012	25743152

Based on the comparison of TSM predicted by these models with in situ measurements taken in the BYES, it was found that the MBPNN model produces a superior performance to the three existing models selected. Near-infrared band-based and shortwave infrared band-based combined model was used to remove the atmospheric effects from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and the TSM concentration was quantified from the MODIS data after atmospheric correction using the MBPNN model. It was found that the MBPNN model produces 41.4% uncertainty in deriving TSM concentration from the MODIS data. The MBPNN model-based climatological seasonal mean TSM concentration indicated that the highest TSM concentrations were found around the river estuaries, while the lowest values were found in the far offshore regions of the BYES. The MBPNN model-based monthly mean TSM concentration revealed that the highest TSM concentrations occurred in February, and the lowest in July. The diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 am (K-d(490)) depended heavily on TSM concentration in the BYES. The significant relationship (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.05) between K-d(490) and TSM concentration indicated that the BYES waters are TSM dominated types. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chang, CH				Chang, Chih-Hua			Development of ocean color algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations and inherent optical properties using gene expression programming (GEP)	OPTICS EXPRESS												This paper proposes new inversion algorithms for the estimation of Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) and the ocean's inherent optical properties (IOPs) from the measurement of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). With in situ data from the NASA bio-optical marine algorithm data set (NOMAD), inversion algorithms were developed by the novel gene expression programming (GEP) approach, which creates, manipulates and selects the most appropriate tree-structured functions based on evolutionary computing. The limitations and validity of the proposed algorithms are evaluated by simulated R-rs spectra with respect to NOMAD, and a closure test for IOPs obtained at a single reference wavelength. The application of GEP-derived algorithms is validated against in situ, synthetic and satellite match-up data sets compiled by NASA and the International Ocean Color Coordinate Group (IOCCG). The new algorithms are able to provide Chla and IOPs retrievals to those derived by other state-of-the-art regression approaches and obtained with the semi-and quasi-analytical algorithms, respectively. In practice, there are no significant differences between GEP, support vector regression, and multilayer perceptron model in terms of the overall performance. The GEP-derived algorithms are successfully applied in processing the images taken by the Sea Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), generate Chla and IOPs maps which show better details of developing algal blooms, and give more information on the distribution of water constituents between different water bodies.

Unique Sequence of Events Triggers Manta Ray Feeding Frenzy in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	REMOTE SENSING												Manta rays are classified as Vulnerable to Extinction on the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species. In Australia, a key aggregation site for reef manta rays is Lady Elliot Island (LEI) on the Great Barrier Reef, similar to 7 km from the shelf edge. Here, we investigate the environmental processes that triggered the largest manta ray feeding aggregation yet observed in Australia, in early 2013. We use MODIS sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration and photic depth data, together with in situ data, to show that anomalous river discharges led to high chlorophyll (anomalies: 10-15 mg center dot m(-3)) and turbid (photic depth anomalies: -15 m) river plumes extending out to LEI, and that these became entrained offshore around the periphery of an active cyclonic eddy. Eddy dynamics led to cold bottom intrusions along the shelf edge (6 degrees C temperature decrease), and at LEI (5 degrees C temperature decrease). Strongest SST gradients (>1 degrees C center dot km(-1)) were at the convergent frontal zone between the shelf and eddy-influenced waters, directly overlying LEI. Here, the front intensified on the spring ebb tide to attract and shape the aggregation pattern of foraging manta rays. Future research could focus on mapping the probability and persistence of these ecologically significant frontal zones via remote sensing to aid the management and conservation of marine species.

A switching algorithm was developed for the atmospheric correction. The evaluation shows that MODIS measured R-rs at visible bands compare reasonably well with in situ R-rs, with the mean ratios ranging from 0.955 to 1.374. The spatiotemporal variation of R-rs in Bohai sea is characterized using MODIS data from July 2002 to June 2014. It is noted from the time series of monthly mean R-rs and wind speed a time lag for the response of R-rs to wind. Significant linear relationship is found between the monthly mean R-rs and wind speed, with the correlation coefficients much higher than those between the annual mean R-rs and total river discharge, indicating that wind plays a more important role than river discharge in determining the variation of R-rs in Bohai sea. Strong seasonal variation is observed in the monthly mean R-rs, which is the lowest during July and August and increases to the maximum in January-February and then decreases. Using the entire archive of MODIS/Aqua data over Bohai sea, this study documents the apparent optical properties which serve as an indicator of sediment transport, providing a low-cost and efficient way for monitoring the marine environmental change and for demonstrating the effect from sediment transport on coastal morphology and ecosystem.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAR	2015	8	3					1176	1184		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2380785								WOS:000352279200021

Most ocean circulation is mesoscale (scales of 50-500 km and 10-100 days), and the energy in mesoscale circulation is at least one order of magnitude greater than general circulation; therefore, the study of mesoscale oceanic structures (MOS) is crucial to ocean dynamics, making it especially useful for analyzing global changes. The detection of MOS, such as upwellings or eddies, from satellites images is significant for marine environmental studies and coastal resource management. In this paper, we present an object-based image analysis (OBIA) system which segments and classifies regions contained in sea-viewing field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS)Aqua sensor satellite images into MOS. After color clustering and hierarchical data format (HDF) file processing, the OBIA system segments images and extracts image descriptors, producing primary regions. Then, it merges regions, recalculating image descriptors for MOS identification and definition. First, regions are labeled by a human-expert, who identifies MOS: upwellings, eddies, cool, and warm eddies. Labeled regions are then classified by learning algorithms (i.e., decision tree, Bayesian network, artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, and near neighbor algorithm) from selected features. Finally, the OBIA system enables images to be queried from the user interface and retrieved by means of fuzzy descriptors and oceanic structures. We tested our system with images from the Canary Islands and the North West African coast.

An empirical equation to estimate mineral dust concentrations from visibility observations in Northern Africa	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												This paper presents a new empirical equation relating horizontal visibility and PM10 dust concentrations. The new empirical equation (IZO-Eq) is derived from observations performed at the Izana Atmospheric Observatory (IZO, 28.30 degrees N, 16.49 degrees W, 2367 m a.s.l., Tenerife, Spain), recorded during Saharan dust outbreaks from 2003 to 2010. A filter based on relative humidity, present-weather and aerosol optical properties is applied to identify dust events. IZO-Eq is validated in the Sahel region during the dry and wet seasons (2006-2008) using data from two PM10 monitoring stations from the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) International Project, and data from the nearest meteorological synoptic stations. The estimated PM10, derived from IZO-Eq is compared against that those obtained by other empirical equations and dust surface concentrations from NMMB/BSC-Dust model. IZO-Eq presents better performance than the other equations in both dry and wet seasons when compared with observed PM10 at two Sahelian sites. IZO-Eq is also able to reproduce the surface concentration variability simulated by NMMB/BSC-Dust. Above 10 km of horizontal visibility, empirical equations cannot be used to estimate PM10, since above this threshold equations estimate a nearly constant PM10 value, regardless of the visibility range. A comparison between the PM10 spatial distributions derived from visibility SYNOP observations through IZO-Eq, the modelled values from the NMMB/BSC-Dust model and aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from MODIS is performed for the 2006-2008 period. The different spatial distributions present a rather good agreement among them as well as to reproduce the characteristic seasonal dust features over North Africa. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The Convolution of Dynamics and Moisture with the Presence of Shortwave Absorbing Aerosols over the Southeast Atlantic	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Biomass burning aerosols seasonally overlie the subtropical southeast Atlantic stratocumulus deck. Previous modeling and observational studies have postulated a semidirect effect whereby shortwave absorption by the aerosol warms and stabilizes the lower troposphere, thickening the low-level clouds. The focus herein is on the dynamical and moisture effects that may be convoluted with the semidirect effect. Almost-daily radiosonde data from remote St. Helena Island (15.9 degrees S, 5.6 degrees W), covering September-October 2000-11, are combined with daily spatial averages (encompassing the island) of the MODIS clear-sky fine-mode aerosol optical depth (Tat). Increases in tau(af) are associated with increases in 750-500-hPa moisture content. The net maximum longwave cooling by moisture of almost 0.45 K day(-1) reduces the aerosol layer warming from shortwave absorption. ERA-Interim spatial composites show that polluted conditions are associated with a strengthening of a deep land-based anticyclone over southern Africa, facilitating the westward offshore transport of both smoke and moisture at 600 hPa. The shallower surface-based South Atlantic anticyclone exhibits a less pronounced shift to the northeast, strengthening the low-level coastal jet exiting into the stratocumulus deck and cooling 1000-hPa potential temperatures. Warm continental outflow further increases the 800-hPa potential temperatures (theta(800)), reinforcing the lower tropospheric stability (theta(800) - theta(1000)) over the stratocumulus deck. Enhanced southerly dry air advection also strengthens the cloud-top humidity inversion. The increased stability helps explain an observed decrease in cloud-top heights despite an anomalous reduction in subsidence. The changes to the horizontal dynamics enhance low-level cloudiness. These are separate but not necessarily distinct from an aerosol semidirect effect, encouraging care in attribution studies.

J	Wang, DC				Wang, Dacheng			Remote Sensing-Based Study on the Temporal Variations in Chlorophyll-a Concentration After Confo Oil Spill in Bohai Sea	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration was used to measure the impact of oil contamination on marine environment after the oil spill on June 4, 2011 in the Bohai Sea. The chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature was derived from MODIS images with 38.47 % and 7.63 % uncertainty, respectively. The impacts of oil spill on aquatic environments can be divided into three stages: (1) the beginning stage (0-7 weeks), during which the toxicity of other pollutants besides the oil exceeds the tolerance of most algae in the Bohai Sea; (2) the self-repairing stage (7-51 weeks), during which the petroleum hydrocarbon concentration is diluted by the physical and chemical degradation process of aquatic ecology and petroleum hydrocarbon becomes one an important carbon source for algal growth; and (3) long-term toxic affecting stage (> 1 year). However, there is currently little knowledge about the long-term toxic effect of oil spill on the natural assemblages of marine phytoplankton. In this study, we determined that the process for delivering nutrients required for algal growth from seabed to water column is slowed by the 'oil-packaged' suspended particles above the seabed. These results may be helpful for oil spill response, ecological remediation, and environment monitoring.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2015	43	1					133	142		10.1007/s12524-014-0381-9								WOS:000350890300014						
J	Varunan, T; Shanmugam, P				Varunan, Theenathayalan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			A model for estimating size-fractioned phytoplankton absorption coefficients in coastal and oceanic waters from satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												One of the central goals of using satellite ocean color remote sensing is to detect and identify different phytoplankton groups (size classes) and describe their variability continuously and synoptically for various applications including marine ecosystem dynamics, carbon and biogeochemical cycles, and related fields in oceanography. Taking the advantage of phytoplankton communities having distinct optical properties, this study presents a new model to explicitly detect and differentiate between three phytoplankton size-classes namely, picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and microphytoplankton, based on distinct differences in the optical signatures of these phytoplankton groups in a wide variety of coastal and oceanic waters. The model is based on the assumption that there is a significant relationship between chlorophyll-a concentration, and total as well as the size-fractioned absorption coefficients of phytoplankton. The new model is validated using three different in-situ datasets collected from a wide variety of locations in the global and regional oceans (including turbid coastal and eutrophic waters) and its results are further compared with those of the existing two- and three-component models. The new model performs better than other models in terms of yielding more accurate estimates of the total and size-dependent phytoplankton absorption coefficients across the entire visible wavelengths. Since satellite observation of 'ocean color' as detected by a remote sensor provides an estimate of the chlorophyll-a concentration, commonly used as an index of phytoplankton biomass, the new model is also applied to regional and global images of seasonal climatology over a decade of satellite ocean color observations provided by the MODIS-Aqua sensor. When applied to the MODIS-Aqua images of the Arabian Sea dominated by spatially intense algal blooms, the present model is generally excellent at predicting and describing the spatial distribution of these phytoplankton groups within cyclonic eddies and adjacent regions in the Arabian Sea. Conversely, size-fractioned phytoplankton absorption coefficients derived from global images of seasonal climatology are found to vary depending on the season and ocean basin. These global images imply that when phytoplankton abundance increases, larger size-classes are added incrementally to a background of smaller cells. Further examination of these data showed that picophytoplankton population is generally low, although dominating a major part of the surface ocean during summer and winter. Nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton populations are high in surface waters of the North and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific Oceans, Arabian Sea, and equatorial region, showing an increasing trend in summer and a decreasing trend in winter in each hemisphere. These results suggest that the new model is an important tool which will inspire further research to investigate different phytoplankton size classes and their variability on regional and global scales.

While there are no optical properties that allow direct estimation of inorganic nitrogen, its correlation with other biogeochemical variables may permit its inference from satellite data. Here we report a new method for estimating monthly mean surface nitrate concentrations employing local multiple linear regressions on a global 1 degrees by 1 degrees resolution grid, using satellite-derived sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and modeled mixed layer depth. Our method is able to reproduce the interannual variability of independent in situ nitrate observations at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series, the Hawaii Ocean Time series, the California coast, and the southern New Zealand region. Our new method is shown to be more accurate than previous algorithms and thus can provide improved information on temporal and spatial nutrient variations beyond the climatological mean at regional and global scales.

J	Patel, P; Shukla, AK				Patel, Piyush; Shukla, A. K.			Aerosol optical properties over marine and continental sites of India during pre-monsoon season	CURRENT SCIENCE												Ground and satellite based measurements of spectral optical properties of aerosols have been carried out at Dehradun (DDN) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Kavaratti (KVT) at Lakshadweep in southern Arabian Sea during pre-monsoon season (March-May) 2012. The measurements illustrate distinct seasonal impact on aerosol properties with maximum dust loading during May in conjunction with anthropogenic aerosols over DDN and marine aerosols over KVT. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) values have been observed maximum in May (0.72 +/- 0.03) over DDN and in April (0.77 +/- 0.05) over KVT. The high AOD at DDN during May is associated with low alpha and high beta, means higher loading in May is associated with coarse mode aerosols, may be dust loading as evident from SSA and volume size distribution. Similarly, high AOD at KVT during March and April are associated with high alpha and low beta, may be due to anthropogenic influence as evident from BT analysis as well as SSA and volume size distribution. However, influence of marine aerosols is also noticeable over KVT during May as indicated by the lower values of alpha with high turbidity coefficient beta. Comparison between sunphotometer and MODIS AOD observations indicates good statistical agreement with the minimal error.

Monthly level 3 and daily level 1 images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Satellite (MODIS) derived SST and chl-a from July 2002 to June 2011 around the archipelagic waters of Spermonde Indonesia were used to investigate the relationship between SST and chl-a and to forecast the potential fishing ground of Rastrelliger kanagurta. The results indicated that there was positive correlation between SST and chl-a (R=0.3, p<0.05). Positive correlation was also found between SST and chl-a with the catch of R. kanagurta (R=0.7, p<0.05). The potential fishing grounds of R. kanagurta were found located along the coast (at accuracy of 76.9%). This study indicated that, with the integration of remote sensing technology, statistical modeling and geographic information systems (GIS) technique were able to determine the relationship between SST and chl-a and also able to forecast aggregation of R. kanagurta. This may contribute in decision making and reducing search hunting time and cost in fishing activities.																	0126-6039					FEB	2015	44	2					225	232		10.17576/jsm-2015-4402-09								WOS:000352086200009

One of the most important water quality parameters that can be assessed in coastal waters and river estuaries using remote sensing techniques is suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It regulates primary production and has substantial influence on the migration of pollutants, temperature, and marine life. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) images were used to retrieve the SSC along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. MODIS of 250 m resolution data were utilized because they have the highest spatial resolution of all the MODIS bands. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns with fast motor boats, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. The goal of this article is to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) to retrieve SSC from satellite remote sensing imagery. ANN function as an intelligent structure to model a variety of nonlinear relationships because iteration-based inversion methods need long computation times for common usage. Using a validation data set and a testing data set, the network could be validated. The learning process was more efficient which resulted in a shorter learning time. The validation data set played a vital role as a stopping criterion during the training procedure to overcome the overtraining problem. A robust relationship between MODIS bands 1 and 2 and in situ data was established based on a three-layer ANN with six neurons in the hidden layer. Root mean squared error and R-2 values for this model were 0.853 and 0.969 mg/L, respectively, for all data. Results of this study reveal that the SSC in the Caspian Sea gradually decreases from west to east.

J	McKinna, LIW				McKinna, Lachlan I. W.			Three decades of ocean-color remote-sensing Trichodesmium spp. in the World's oceans: A review	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Ocean-color sensors have provided the necessary platform for synoptic-scale detection and monitoring of the nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. Such information is invaluable to global biogeochemical studies which require accurate estimates of atmospherically-fixed nitrogen. This article reviews literature from the past three decades and discusses the development of Trichodesmium-specific remote-sensing methods and how these have been revised with improved knowledge of bio-optical properties and remote-sensing technologies. Overall, the majority of Trichodesmium-specific detection methods have been non-quantitative and developed primarily for mapping the occurrence of dense surface aggregations of the cyanobacteria. The ability to positively discriminate and quantify low background concentrations of Trichodesmium (e.g. <3200 trichomes L-1) dispersed within the water column still remains an intractable problem. Furthermore, the spectral and spatial resolutions of existing ocean-color sensors are presently a limiting factor for quantitative Trichodesmium remote sensing. It is noted that planned next-generation sensors with higher spectral resolutions, in both low earth and geostationary orbits, are likely to enhance efforts to remotely-sense global Trichodesmium abundance.

GLOBIL: WWF'S GLOBAL OBSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION PORTAL	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Despite ever increasing availability of satellite imagery and spatial data, conservation managers, decision makers and planners are often unable to analyze data without special knowledge or software. WWF is bridging this gap by putting extensive spatial data into an easy to use online mapping environment, to allow visualization, manipulation and analysis of large data sets by any user. Consistent, reliable and repeatable ecosystem monitoring information for priority eco-regions is needed to increase transparency in WWF's global conservation work, to measure conservation impact, and to provide communications with the general public and organization members. Currently, much of this monitoring and evaluation data is isolated, incompatible, or inaccessible and not readily usable or available for those without specialized software or knowledge. Launched in 2013 by WWF Netherlands and WWF Germany, the Global Observation and Biodiversity Information Portal (GLOBIL) is WWF's new platform to unite, centralize, standardize and visualize geo-spatial data and information from more than 150 active GIS users worldwide via cloud-based ArcGIS Online. GLOBIL is increasing transparency, providing baseline data for monitoring and evaluation while communicating impacts and conservation successes to the public. GLOBIL is currently being used in the worldwide marine campaign as an advocacy tool for establishing more marine protected areas, and a monitoring interface to track the progress towards ocean protection goals. In the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation area, local partners are using the platform to monitor land cover changes, barriers to species migrations, potential human-wildlife conflict and local conservation impacts in vast wildlife corridor. In East Africa, an early warning system is providing conservation practitioners with real-time alerts of threats particularly to protected areas and World Heritage Sites by industrial extractive activities. And for globally consistent baseline ecosystem monitoring, MODIS-derived data are being combined with local information to provide visible advocacy for conservation. As GLOBIL is built up through the WWF network, the worldwide organization is able to provide open access to its data on biodiversity and remote sensing, spatial analysis and projects to support goal setting, monitoring and evaluation, and fundraising activities.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					511	514		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-511-2015								WOS:000380531900074

GENERATING A LONG-TERM SERIES OF SST AND CHLOROPHYLL-A FOR THE COAST OF IRELAND	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The use of remote sensing has increased greatly in recent years due to technological advances and its advantages in comparison with traditional methods. In the case of Ireland however the use of these techniques is not well established and only 17% of remote sensing studies are related to marine and coastal environments. As a first step, and taking into account that fisheries and aquaculture plays an important economic and social role in Ireland, a database of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) relating to the ICES fisheries management areas is being generated. Up to now three different products have been produced. These products correspond to the annual SST Climatology and annual SST Anomalies from 1982 to 2014, as well as the annual Chl-a Climatology taking into account the different life span of CZCS (1982-1986), SeaWIFS (1997-2010), MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS-Aqua (2002-2014). Initially, the Chl-a Climatology was produced for each sensor individually while the creation of a continuous Chl-a series will be investigated in the future. Analysing the SST trends highlighted an increasing trend in SST values in Irish waters, a trend which was more pronounced in the northern areas (+0.54 degrees C in the last 10 years). Although there are differences between sensors, Chl-a concentration seems to present higher values in the Celtic Sea since 2009. Analysing the ICES Divisions individually highlighted that coastal areas presented the highest Chl-a concentrations, involving a clear differentiation in the optical properties of coastal and oceanic waters.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					933	940		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-933-2015								WOS:000380531900139

Investigation the Behavior of MODIS Ocean Color Products under the 2008 Red Tide in the Eastern Persian Gulf	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SENSORS & MODELS IN REMOTE SENSING & PHOTOGRAMMETRY	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				International Conference on Sensors and Models in Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry	NOV 23-25, 2015	Kish Island, IRAN					Biophysical properties of water undergo serious variations under red tide (RT) outbreak. During RT conditions, algal blooms spread out in the estuarine, marine and fresh waters due to different triggering factors such as nutrient loading, marine currents, and monsoonal winds. The Persian Gulf (PG) was a talent region subjected to different RTs in recent decade. A massive RT started from the Strait of Hormuz in October 2008 and extended towards the northern parts of the PG covering more than 1200 km of coastlines. The bloom of microorganism C. Polykrikoides was the main specie that generated large fish mortalities, and hampered marine industries, and water desalination appliances. Ocean color satellite data have many advantages to monitor and alarm RT occurrences, such as wide and continuous extent, short time of imagery, high accessibility, and appropriate estimation of ocean color parameters. Since 1999, MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor has estimated satellite derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH), and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490nm (kd490). It provides a capability to study the behavior of these parameters during RT and normal conditions. This study monitors variations in satellite derived Chl-a, nFLH, and kd490 under both RT and normal conditions of the PG between 2002 and 2008. Up to now, daily and monthly variations in these products were no synchronously investigated under RT conditions in the PG. In doing so, the MODIS L1B products were provided from NASA data archive. They were corrected for Rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption, and atmospheric interference in turbid coastal waters, and then converted to level 2 data. In addition, Enhanced Red Green Blue (ERGB) image was used to illustrate better water variations. ERGB image was built with three normalized leaving water radiance between 443 to 560nm. All the above data processes were applied by SeaDAS 7 software package. The Strait of Hormuz was selected as the study area in the eastern part of the PG. Images including high cloud coverage (>50%) over the study area were filtered out. The classification maps of the above products were shown during RT and normal periods. Monthly variations of mentioned products were calculated for the dates before, during, and after RT appearance. The results were demonstrated as time-series diagrams. All the above calculations and presentations were performed in Matlab 7 software package. The results show that MODIS Chl-a, nFLH, and kd490 increased during the 2008 RT. Based on the feedback of these parameters under RT conditions, hybrid ocean color index (HOCI) is defined. HOCI is able to display better water variations during RT outbreak. High values of HOCI show RT affected areas.

FISHING FORECASTING SYSTEM IN ADRIATIC SEA - A MODEL APPROACH BASED ON A NORMALIZED SCALAR PRODUCT OF THE SST GRADIENT AND CHL GRADIENT VECTORS	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				By mapping the concentration of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and the temperature of the sea surface (SST), satellite images reveal the complex dynamics of marine waters and prove to be a very powerful tool when used to detect potential fishing areas, significantly reducing the time of the search, the fuel consumption and the human effort, and simultaneously increasing the CPUE (catch per unit effort). In the present work, various techniques of multi-sensor, multi-resolution and multi-temporal data fusion are applied to multi-spectral satellite image data of MODIS-AQUA, MODIS-TERRA and VIIRS sensors, in order to detect "fronts" of chlorophyll concentration and temperature on the sea surface. According to the physical model of the phenomena, these fronts are generated by the upwelling of cold waters rich of nutrients (phytoplankton) which correspond to areas with a high concentration of pelagic fish and are characterized by high values of local gradients of SST and CHL with anti-parallel orientation. An automatic procedure has been developed to calibrate and validate the production in near-real time of daily maps of expected good fishing grounds to be provided to the FEDERPESCA fleet. The same procedure could be optimized also for other seas.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2257	2260										WOS:000371696702089

Specifically, VIIRS ocean color products derived from the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system are evaluated and compared with in situ data from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In general, VIIRS ocean color products are matched well with MOBY in situ measurements, and are also consistent with those from MODIS-Aqua. Ocean color products were found to be highly sensitive to some operational sensor calibration issues. We have improved sensor calibration by combining the lunar calibration into the current calibration method. Here, the ocean color products based on the new sensor calibration are evaluated. Our results show that VIIRS is capable of providing high-quality global ocean color products in support of the scientific research and operational applications.

The coastal water-leaving refectance of HICO was simulate from in situ hyperspectral remote sensing spectrum with 0.19 nm spectral resolution. According to the spectral simulation, characteristics bands of HICO were identified for water clarity estimation model. On the basis of correlation analysis between water transparency and simulation spectra, a single band model for estimating Secchi depth was established. Moreover, the relationship between Secchi depth band ratios of HICO were analyzed, and then a linear regression model of water clarity using simulated HICO was developed, with a mean relative error of 5.6% and relative mean square error of 0.29 m. The result indicates that the band ratio model of Rrs(507.18)/Rrs(518.64) of HICO could be used to retrieve Secchi depth in coastal waters.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0049-2				2015	9808								980817	10.1117/12.2207858								WOS:000369013400042

Satellite based remote sensing systems could be implemented for a surveillance and monitoring network. At present, the SAR system is the most widely used sensor for this purpose as it offers day and night high resolution images and it is not influenced by the presence of cloud cover, dust or smoke over the scene. The operational capabilities of these kinds of sensors are limited by factors such as the low revisiting frequency over the scene, the data's high cost, and finally the inability to make a certain assessment of the nature of the detected event without collecting data from complementary instruments. SAR sensor limitations could be complemented by optical sensor capabilities. In particular, multispectral sensors like MODIS offer a high number of spectral bands to detect, identify, classify and describe an oil spill event, and guarantee daily image frequency. However, optical sensors are highly dependent on meteorological conditions over the study area, they offer only low and medium resolution images and, finally, dedicated algorithms for image processing do not exist at present. For these reasons, the optical sensors play only a subordinate role with reference to SAR sensors. This work shows the results achievable through the development of dedicated algorithms for automatic image processing from MODIS data, and a method to classify and describe oil spill events.																			978-1-4799-7992-9				2015							1653	1658										WOS:000366654400280

A.			A new chemistry option in WRF-Chem v. 3.4 for the simulation of direct and indirect aerosol effects using VBS: evaluation against IMPACT-EUCAARI data	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												A parameterization for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production based on the volatility basis set (VBS) approach has been coupled with microphysics and radiative schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. The new chemistry option called "RACM-MADE-VBS-AQCHEM" was evaluated on a cloud resolving scale against ground-based and aircraft measurements collected during the IMPACT-EUCAARI (Intensive Cloud Aerosol Measurement Campaign - European Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air quality interaction) campaign, and complemented with satellite data from MODIS. The day-to-day variability and the diurnal cycle of ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the surface are captured by the model. Surface aerosol mass concentrations of sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), and organic matter (OM) are simulated with correlations larger than 0.55. WRF-Chem captures the vertical profile of the aerosol mass concentration in both the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) as a function of the synoptic condition, but the model does not capture the full range of the measured concentrations. Predicted OM concentration is at the lower end of the observed mass concentrations. The bias may be attributable to the missing aqueous chemistry processes of organic compounds and to uncertainties in meteorological fields. A key role could be played by assumptions on the VBS approach such as the SOA formation pathways, oxidation rate, and dry deposition velocity of organic condensable vapours. Another source of error in simulating SOA is the uncertainties in the anthropogenic emissions of primary organic carbon. Aerosol particle number concentration (condensation nuclei, CN) is overestimated by a factor of 1.4 and 1.7 within the PBL and FT, respectively. Model bias is most likely attributable to the uncertainties of primary particle emissions (mostly in the PBL) and to the nucleation rate. Simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are also overestimated, but the bias is more contained with respect to that of CN. The CCN efficiency, which is a characterization of the ability of aerosol particles to nucleate cloud droplets, is underestimated by a factor of 1.5 and 3.8 in the PBL and FT, respectively. The comparison with MODIS data shows that the model overestimates the aerosol optical thickness (AOT). The domain averages (for 1 day) are 0.38 +/- 0.12 and 0.42 +/- 0.10 for MODIS and WRF-Chem data, respectively. The droplet effective radius (Re) in liquid-phase clouds is underestimated by a factor of 1.5; the cloud liquid water path (LWP) is overestimated by a factor of 1.1-1.6. The consequence is the overestimation of average liquid cloud optical thickness (COT) from a few percent up to 42 %. The predicted cloud water path (CWP) in all phases displays a bias in the range +41-80 %, whereas the bias of COT is about 15 %. In sensitivity tests where we excluded SOA, the skills of the model in reproducing the observed patterns and average values of the microphysical and optical properties of liquid and all phase clouds decreases. Moreover, the run without SOA (NOSOA) shows convective clouds with an enhanced content of liquid and frozen hydrometers, and stronger updrafts and downdrafts. Considering that the previous version of WRF-Chem coupled with a modal aerosol module predicted very low SOA content (secondary organic aerosol model (SORGAM) mechanism) the new proposed option may lead to a better characterization of aerosol-cloud feedbacks.

Use of the CALIOP vertical feature mask for evaluating global aerosol models	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												We use observations from the space-based Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to evaluate global aerosol distributions simulated in the NASA Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications aerosol reanalysis (MERRAero). We focus particularly on an evaluation of aerosol types, using the CALIOP vertical feature mask (VFM) algorithm, and look especially at Saharan dust distributions during July 2009. MERRAero consists of an aerosol simulation produced in the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) Earth system model and incorporates assimilation of MODIS-derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) to constrain column aerosol loadings. For comparison to the CALIOP VFM we construct two synthetic VFMs using the MERRAero aerosol distributions: a CALIOP-like VFM in which we simulate the total attenuated backscatter and particle depolarization ratio from the MERRAero output and pass those into the CALIOP VFM typing algorithm (MERRAero-CALIOP), and an extinction-based VFM in which we use the MERRAero-simulated species-resolved extinction to map the MERRAero species to the CALIOP VFM types (MERRAero-Extinction). By comparing the MERRAero-CALIOP VFM to CALIOP VFM, we can diagnose the aerosol transport and speciation in MERRAero. By comparing the MERRAero-CALIOP and MERRAero-Extinction-simulated VFM, we perform a simple observing system experiment (OSE), which is useful for identifying limitations of the CALIOP VFM algorithm itself. We find that, despite having our column AOT constrained by MODIS, comparison to the CALIOP VFM reveals a greater occurrence of dusty aerosol layers in our MERRAero-CALIOP VFM due to errors in MERRAero aerosol speciation. Additionally, we find that the CALIOP VFM algorithm is challenged when classifying aerosol features when multiple aerosol types are present, as our application of the CALIOP VFM algorithm to MERRAero aerosol distributions classified marine-dominated aerosol layers with low aerosol loadings as polluted dust when the contribution of dust to the total extinction was low.

We found that sea-salts (Na+ and Cl-) are the major mass fraction (65%) of the total water-soluble matter followed by SO42- (20%) and WSOM (6%). The seasonal variation of g(90%)(ZSR) was high in summer to autumn and low in winter to spring months, probably due to the influence of the long-range transport of anthropogenic SO42-, dust, and organics from East Asia and their interaction with sea-salts through heterogeneous reactions. On the other hand, annual variations of g(90%)(ZSR) showed a decrease from 2001 to 2006 and then an increase from 2007 to 2012. Interestingly, the annual variations in SO42- mass fractions showed an increase from 2001 to 2006 and then a decrease from 2007 to 2012, demonstrating that SO42- seriously suppresses the hygroscopic growth of sea-salt particles over the western North Pacific. This is further supported by the strong negative correlation between SO42- and g(90%)(ZSR). Based on the MODIS satellite data, the present study demonstrates that long-range transported anthropogenic pollutants from East Asia to the North Pacific can act as efficient cloud condensation nuclei but significantly suppress the precipitation by reducing the size of cloud droplets over the western North Pacific.

MISR empirical stray light corrections in high-contrast scenes	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												We diagnose the potential causes for the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer's (MISR) persistent high aerosol optical depth (AOD) bias at low AOD with the aid of coincident MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery from NASA's Terra satellite. Stray light in the MISR instrument is responsible for a large portion of the high AOD bias in high-contrast scenes, such as broken-cloud scenes that are quite common over ocean. Discrepancies among MODIS and MISR nadir-viewing blue, green, red, and near-infrared images are used to optimize seven parameters individually for each wavelength, along with a background reflectance modulation term that is modeled separately, to represent the observed features. Independent surface-based AOD measurements from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and the Marine Aerosol Network (MAN) are compared with MISR research aerosol retrieval algorithm (RA) AOD retrievals for 1118 coincidences to validate the corrections when applied to the nadir and off-nadir cameras. With these corrections, plus the baseline RA corrections and enhanced cloud screening applied, the median AOD bias for all data in the mid-visible (green, 558 nm) band decreases from 0.006 (0.020 for the MISR standard algorithm (SA)) to 0.000, and the RMSE decreases by 5% (27% compared to the SA). For AOD(558 nm) < 0.10, which includes about half the validation data, 68th percentile absolute AOD(558 nm) errors for the RA have dropped from 0.022 (0.034 for the SA) to < 0.02 (similar to 0.018).																	1867-1381	1867-8548					2015	8	7					2927	2943		10.5194/amt-8-2927-2015								WOS:000358799900020

Integration of prognostic aerosol-cloud interactions in a chemistry transport model coupled offline to a regional climate model	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												To reduce uncertainties and hence to obtain a better estimate of aerosol (direct and indirect) radiative forcing, next generation climate models aim for a tighter coupling between chemistry transport models and regional climate models and a better representation of aerosol-cloud interactions. In this study, this coupling is done by first forcing the Rossby Center regional climate model (RCA4) with ERA-Interim lateral boundaries and sea surface temperature (SST) using the standard cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) formulation (hereafter, referred to as the 'stand-alone RCA4 version' or 'CTRL' simulation). In the stand-alone RCA4 version, CDNCs are constants distinguishing only between land and ocean surface. The meteorology from this simulation is then used to drive the chemistry transport model, Multiple-scale Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH), which is coupled online with the aerosol dynamics model, Sectional Aerosol module for Large Scale Applications (SALSA). CDNC fields obtained from MATCH-SALSA are then fed back into a new RCA4 simulation. In this new simulation (referred to as 'MOD' simulation), all parameters remain the same as in the first run except for the CDNCs provided by MATCH-SALSA. Simulations are carried out with this model setup for the period 2005-2012 over Europe, and the differences in cloud microphysical properties and radiative fluxes as a result of local CDNC changes and possible model responses are analysed. Our study shows substantial improvements in cloud microphysical properties with the input of the MATCH-SALSA derived 3-D CDNCs compared to the stand-alone RCA4 version. This model setup improves the spatial, seasonal and vertical distribution of CDNCs with a higher concentration observed over central Europe during boreal summer (JJA) and over eastern Europe and Russia during winter (DJF). Realistic cloud droplet radii (CD radii) values have been simulated with the maxima reaching 13 mu m, whereas in the stand-alone version the values reached only 5 mu m. A substantial improvement in the distribution of the cloud liquid-water paths (CLWP) was observed when compared to the satellite retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the boreal summer months. The median and standard deviation values from the 'MOD' simulation are closer to observations than those obtained using the stand-alone RCA4 version. These changes resulted in a significant decrease in the total annual mean net fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by -5 W m(-2) over the domain selected in the study. The TOA net fluxes from the 'MOD' simulation show a better agreement with the retrievals from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument. The aerosol indirect effects are estimated in the 'MOD' simulation in comparison to the pre-industrial aerosol emissions (1900). Our simulations estimated the domain averaged annual mean total radiative forcing of -0.64 W m(-2) with a larger contribution from the first indirect aerosol effect (-0.57 W m(-2)) than from the second indirect aerosol effect (-0.14 W m(-2)).

Molecular characterization of free tropospheric aerosol collected at the Pico Mountain Observatory: a case study with a long-range transported biomass burning plume	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Free tropospheric aerosol was sampled at the Pico Mountain Observatory located at 2225 m above mean sea level on Pico Island of the Azores archipelago in the North Atlantic. The observatory is located similar to 3900 km east and downwind of North America, which enables studies of free tropospheric air transported over long distances. Aerosol samples collected on filters from June to October 2012 were analyzed to characterize organic carbon, elemental carbon, and inorganic ions. The average ambient concentration of aerosol was 0.9 +/- 0.7 mu gm(-3). On average, organic aerosol components represent the largest mass fraction of the total measured aerosol (60 +/- 51 %), followed by sulfate (23 +/- 28 %), nitrate (13 +/- 10 %), chloride (2 +/- 3 %), and elemental carbon (2 +/- 2 %). Water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) extracted from two aerosol samples (9/24 and 9/25) collected consecutively during a pollution event were analyzed using ultrahigh-resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Approximately 4000 molecular formulas were assigned to each of the mass spectra in the range of m/z 100-1000. The majority of the assigned molecular formulas had unsaturated structures with CHO and CHNO elemental compositions. FLEXPART retroplume analyses showed the sampled air masses were very aged (average plume age > 12 days). These aged aerosol WSOM compounds had an average O/C ratio of similar to 0.45, which is relatively low compared to O/C ratios of other aged aerosol. The increase in aerosol loading during the measurement period of 9/24 was linked to biomass burning emissions from North America by FLEXPART retroplume analysis and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire counts. This was confirmed with biomass burning markers detected in the WSOM and with the morphology and mixing state of particles as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of markers characteristic of aqueous-phase reactions of phenolic species suggests that the aerosol collected at the Pico Mountain Observatory had undergone cloud processing before reaching the site. Finally, the air masses of 9/25 were more aged and influenced by marine emissions, as indicated by the presence of organosulfates and other species characteristic of marine aerosol. The change in the air masses for the two samples was corroborated by the changes in ethane, propane, and ozone, morphology of particles, as well as by the FLEXPART retroplume simulations. This paper presents the first detailed molecular characterization of free tropospheric aged aerosol intercepted at a lower free troposphere remote location and provides evidence of low oxygenation after long-range transport. We hypothesize this is a result of the selective removal of highly aged and polar species during long-range transport, because the aerosol underwent a combination of atmospheric processes during transport facilitating aqueous-phase removal (e.g., clouds processing) and fragmentation (e.g., photolysis) of components.

A theoretical study of the effect of subsurface oceanic bubbles on the enhanced aerosol optical depth band over the southern oceans as detected from MODIS and MISR	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Submerged oceanic bubbles, which have a much longer life span than whitecaps or bubble rafts, have been hypothesized to increase the water-leaving radiance and thus affect satellite-based estimates of water-leaving radiance to non-trivial levels. This study explores this effect further to determine whether such bubbles are of sufficient magnitude to impact satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals through perturbation of the lower boundary conditions. There has been significant discussion in the community regarding the high positive biases in retrieved AODs in many remote ocean regions. In this study, for the first time, the effects of oceanic bubbles on satellite retrievals of AOD are studied by using a linked Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) atmospheric and HydroLight oceanic radiative transfer models. The results suggest an insignificant impact on AOD retrievals in regions with near-surface wind speeds of less than 12ms(-1). However, the impact of bubbles on aerosol retrievals could be on the order of 0.02-0.04 for higher wind conditions within the scope of our simulations (e. g., winds < 20m s(-1). This bias is propagated to global scales using 1 year of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer EOS (AMSR-E) data to investigate the possible impacts of oceanic bubbles on an enhanced AOD belt observed over the high-latitude southern oceans (also called the enhanced southern oceans anomaly, or ESOA) by some passive satellite sensors. Ultimately, this study is supportive of the null hypothesis: submerged bubbles are not the major contributor to the ESOA feature. This said, as retrievals progress to higher and higher resolutions, such as from airborne platforms, the uniform bubble correction in clean marine conditions should probably be separately accounted for against individual bright whitecaps and bubble rafts.

The MACC-II 2007-2008 reanalysis: atmospheric dust evaluation and characterization over northern Africa and the Middle East	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												In the present work, atmospheric mineral dust from a MACC-II short reanalysis run for 2 years (2007-2008) has been evaluated over northern Africa and the Middle East using satellite aerosol products (from MISR, MODIS and OMI satellite sensors), ground-based AERONET data, in situ PM10 concentrations from AMMA, and extinction vertical profiles from two ground-based lidars and CALIOP satellite-based lidar. The MACC-II aerosol optical depth (AOD) spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) variability shows good agreement with those provided by satellite sensors. The capability of the model to reproduce the AOD, Angstrom exponent (AE) and dust optical depth (DOD) from daily to seasonal time-scale is quantified over 26 AERONET stations located in eight geographically distinct regions by using statistical parameters. Overall DOD seasonal variation is fairly well simulated by MACC-II in all regions, although the correlation is significantly higher in dust transport regions than in dust source regions. The ability of MACC-II in reproducing dust vertical profiles has been assessed by comparing seasonal averaged extinction vertical profiles simulated by MACC-II under dust conditions with corresponding extinction profiles obtained with lidar instruments at M'Bour and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and with CALIOP. We find a good agreement in dust layers structures and averaged extinction vertical profiles between MACC-II, the lidars and CALIOP above the marine boundary layer from 1 to 6 km. Surface dust daily mean concentrations from MACC-II reanalysis has been evaluated with daily averaged PM10 at three monitoring stations of the Sahelian Dust Transect. MACC-II correctly reproduces daily to interannual surface dust concentration variability, although it underestimates daily and monthly means all year long, especially in winter and early spring (dry season). MACC-II reproduces well the dust variability recorded along the station transect which reflects the variability in dust emission by different Saharan sources, but fails in reproducing the sporadic and very strong dust events associated to mesoscale convective systems during the wet season.

In operational mode it computes 48-h forecasts of the hydrodynamic and biochemical parameters describing the Baltic Sea state. The Cressman assimilation scheme was implemented as part of the system in order to improve overall model accuracy. The system uses satellite-measured sea surface temperature from the MODIS Aqua spectroradiometer for the assimilation process. The satellite measured SST is obtained from a predefined server, which is part of the Satellite Monitoring of the Baltic Sea Environment project (SatBattyk). To validate the model results and the impact of assimilation on the model's accuracy, two separate test runs were performed using historical data covering the years 2011 and 2012. Independent computations were performed for the model with and without satellite SST assimilation, respectively referred to in this paper as 3D CEMBS_A and 3D CEMBS. The results of the computations were then compared with satellite and in situ measured data to validate the model and the assimilation scheme's implementation. The objective of this paper is to describe the implementation of the satellite SST data assimilation algorithm and to present the results of the preliminary validation of the models with observations.

J	Kampf, J				Kaempf, J.			Phytoplankton blooms on the western shelf of Tasmania: evidence of a highly productive ecosystem	OCEAN SCIENCE												Satellite-derived chlorophyll a data using the standard NASA-OC3 ( ocean colour) algorithm are strongly biased by coloured dissolved organic matter and suspended sediment of river discharges, which is a particular problem for the western Tasmanian shelf. This work reconstructs phytoplankton blooms in the study region using a quadratic regression between OC3 data and chlorophyll fluorescence based on the fluorescence line height (FLH) data. This regression is derived from satellite data of the nearby Bonney upwelling region, which is devoid of river influences. To this end, analyses of 10 years of MODIS-aqua satellite data reveal the existence of a highly productive ecosystem on the western Tasmanian shelf. The region normally experiences two phytoplankton blooms per annum. The first bloom occurs during late austral summer months as a consequence of upwelling-favourable coastal winds. Hence, the western Tasmanian shelf forms a previously unknown upwelling centre of the regional upwelling system, known as Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System. The second phytoplankton bloom is a classical spring bloom also developing in the adjacent Tasman Sea. The author postulates that this region forms another important biological hot spot for the regional marine ecosystem.

Hourly resolution cloud fraction (CF) and cloud-top height (H-T) are retrieved from Meteosat-9 radiances using modified Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithms, whereas liquid water path (LWP) is from the University of Wisconsin microwave satellite climatology. The MMF simulations use a 2D cloud-resolving model (CRM) that contains an advanced third-order turbulence closure to explicitly simulate cloud physical processes in every grid column of a general circulation model. The model accurately reproduces the marine stratocumulus spatial extent and cloud cover. The mean cloud cover spatial variability in the model is primarily explained by the boundary layer decoupling strength, whereas a boundary layer shoaling accounts for a coastal decrease in CF. Moreover, the core of the stratocumulus cloud deck is concomitant with the location of the strongest temperature inversion. Although the model reproduces the observed westward boundary layer deepening and the spatial variability of LWP, it overestimates LWP by 50%. Diurnal cycles of H-T, CF, and LWP from satellites and the model have the same phase, with maxima during the early morning and minima near 1500 local solar time, which suggests that the diurnal cycle is driven primarily by solar heating. Comparisons with the SE Pacific cloud deck indicate that the observed amplitude of the diurnal cycle is modest over the SE Atlantic, with a shallower boundary layer as well. The model qualitatively reproduces these interregime differences.

The results for a large region around the Azores show that (1) far-from-cloud aerosol statistics are dominated by samples from scenes with lower cloud fractions, while near-cloud aerosol statistics are dominated by samples from scenes with higher cloud fractions; (2) near-cloud enhancements of attenuated backscatter occur for any cloud fraction but are most pronounced for higher cloud fractions; (3) the difference in the enhancements for different cloud fractions is most significant within 5km from clouds; (4) near-cloud enhancements can be well approximated by logarithmic functions of cloud fraction and distance to clouds. These findings demonstrate that if variability in cloud fraction across the scenes used for composite aerosol statistics is not considered, a sampling artifact will affect these statistics calculated as a function of distance to clouds. For the Azores region data set examined here, this artifact occurs mostly within 5km from clouds and exaggerates the near-cloud enhancements of lidar backscatter and color ratio by about 30%. This shows that for accurate characterization of the changes in aerosol properties with distance to clouds, it is important to account for the impact of changes in cloud fraction.

Why do satellite imageries show exceptionally high chlorophyll in the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Bay during the Norteast Monsoon?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and the Palk Bay (PB) are two least studied marine environments located between India and Sri Lanka. Exceptionally high chlorophyll a concentration in the GoM and the PB during the Northeast Monsoon (November-February) is a consistent feature in satellite imageries, which has been attributed to the intrusion of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) waters. The analyses of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and field chlorophyll data collected from 30 locations in the Indian sector of the GoM and the PB in January 2011 showed significant overestimations in the satellite data. This error was much higher in the PB (60-80 %) as compared to the GoM (18-28 %). The multivariate analyses evidenced that the exceptionally high satellite chlorophyll in the PB is contributed largely by turbidity, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and bottom reflectance. The paper cautions that though MODIS is superior in estimating chlorophyll a in optically complex waters, there are still chances of overestimations in regions like the PB.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2014	186	11					7781	7792		10.1007/s10661-014-3966-4								WOS:000343051400061	25142503					
J	Painemal, D; Kato, S; Minnis, P				Painemal, David; Kato, Seiji; Minnis, Patrick			Boundary layer regulation in the southeast Atlantic cloud microphysics during the biomass burning season as seen by the A-train satellite constellation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Solar radiation absorption by biomass burning aerosols has a strong warming effect over the southeast Atlantic. Interactions between the overlying smoke aerosols and low-level cloud microphysics and the subsequent albedo perturbation are, however, generally ignored in biomass burning radiative assessments. In this study, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) are combined with Aqua satellite observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) to assess the effect of variations in the boundary layer height and the separation distance between the cloud and aerosol layers on the cloud microphysics. The merged data analyzed at a daily temporal resolution suggest that overlying smoke aerosols modify cloud properties by decreasing cloud droplet size despite an increase in the cloud liquid water as boundary layer deepens, north of 5 degrees S. These changes are controlled by the proximity of the aerosol layer to the cloud top rather than increases in the column aerosol load. The correlations are unlikely driven by meteorological factors, as three predictors of cloud variability, lower tropospheric stability, surface winds, and mixing ratio suggest that cloud effective radius, cloud top height, and liquid water path should correlate positively. Because cloud effective radius anticorrelates with cloud liquid water over the region with large microphysical changes-north of 5 degrees S-the overall radiative consequence at the top of the atmosphere is a strong albedo susceptibility, equivalent to a 3% albedo increase due to a 10% decrease in cloud effective radius. This albedo enhancement partially offsets the aerosol solar absorption. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of accounting for the indirect effect of smoke aerosols in the cloud microphysics when estimating the radiative impact of the biomass burning at the top of the atmosphere.

Evaluating clouds, aerosols, and their interactions in three global climate models using satellite simulators and observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Accurately representing aerosol-cloud interactions in global climate models is challenging. As parameterizations evolve, it is important to evaluate their performance with appropriate use of observations. In this investigation we compare aerosols, clouds, and their interactions in three global climate models (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory-Atmosphere Model 3 (AM3), National Center for Atmospheric Research-Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5), and Goddard Institute for Space Studies-ModelE2) to Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. Modeled cloud properties are diagnosed using a MODIS simulator. Cloud droplet number concentrations (N) are computed identically from satellite-simulated and MODIS-observed values of liquid cloud optical depth and droplet effective radius. We find that aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) simulated by models is similar to observations in many regions around the globe. For N, AM3 and CAM5 capture the observed spatial pattern of higher values in coastal marine stratocumulus versus remote ocean regions, though modeled values, in general, are higher than observed. Aerosol-cloud interactions were computed as the sensitivity of ln(N) to ln(tau(a)) for coastal marine liquid clouds near South Africa (SAF) and Southeast Asia where tau(a) varies in time. AM3 and CAM5 are more sensitive than observations, while the sensitivity for ModelE2 is statistically insignificant. This widely used sensitivity could be subject to misinterpretation due to the confounding influence of meteorology on both aerosols and clouds. A simple framework for assessing the sensitivity of ln(N) to ln(tau(a)) at constant meteorology illustrates that observed sensitivity can change from positive to statistically insignificant when including the confounding influence of relative humidity. Satellite-simulated versus standard model values of N are compared; for CAM5 in SAF, standard model values are significantly lower than satellite-simulated values with a bias of 83 cm(-3).

Estuaries located in the northeastern part of the Texas coast receive more rainfall than estuaries in the southwestern part, and consequently greater runoff and concomitant freshwater inflow. Extreme inter-annual variability of precipitation caused by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events is another characteristic of the Texas coast. During El Nino periods, salinities in Texas estuaries decrease because of increased precipitation and increased freshwater inflow to the coast. During La Nina periods, salinities increase due to drier climatic conditions and reduced freshwater inflow. The combination of the climatic gradient and temporal variability of freshwater inflow drive changes in the frequency, timing, duration, and magnitude of river flows to coastal waters, which in turn control the salinity, nutrients, organic matter, and sediments in Texas estuaries. Chlorophyll biomass, as an indicator of primary production, was estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from July 2002 to December 2011 for all Texas estuaries. The climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean delivers a cascading signal via freshwater inflow changes to estuaries that effects primary production subsequently. The maximum correlation was found at the 5th lag (month) with correlation coefficient (rho) being 0.45 (NINO3.4 is fixed as a reference). The combination of the local climatic gradient and quasi-periodic natural variability in ENSO has been influencing estuarine ecosystem dynamics over decadal scales in this region. The present study demonstrates that freshwater inflow is an important driver in maintaining primary productivity of Texas estuaries, which is required to maintain estuarine health and sustainability.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2014					68		65	73		10.2112/SI68-009.1								WOS:000347145600010

These fronts generally attract fish and may therefore be targeted by marine top-predators. In the southern Benguela upwelling system, such fronts might be used as environmental cues by foraging seabirds. In this study we analyzed high-frequency foraging tracks (GPS, 1 s sampling) of Cape gannets Morus capensis from two colonies located on the west and east coast of South Africa in relation to mesoscale fronts detected on daily high-resolution chlorophyll-a maps (MODIS, 1 km). We tested the association of (i) searching behavior and (ii) diving activity of foraging birds with mesoscale fronts. We found that Cape gannets shift from transiting to area-restricted search mode (ARS) at a distance from fronts ranging between 2 and 11 km (median is 6.7 km). This suggests that Cape gannets may be able to sense fronts (smell or vision) or other predators, and that such detection triggers an intensified investigation of their surroundings (i.e. ARS). Also we found that diving probability increases near fronts in 11 out of 20 tracks investigated (55%), suggesting that Cape gannets substantially use fronts for feeding; in the remaining cases (45%), birds may have used other cues for feeding including fishing vessels, particularly for gannets breeding on the west coast. We demonstrated in this study that oceanographic structures such as mesoscale fronts are important environmental cues used by a foraging seabird within the rich waters of an upwelling system. There is now need for further investigations on how Cape gannets actually detect these fronts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mitchell, C; Cunningham, A; Mckee, D				Mitchell, Catherine; Cunningham, Alex; Mckee, David			Remote sensing of particulate absorption coefficients and their biogeochemical interpretation: A case study in the Irish Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We propose a method for (i) obtaining particulate absorption coefficients from optical remote sensing reflectance signals and (ii) partitioning these coefficients into separate components for phytoplankton cells and mineral particles. This method makes the initial assumption that absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the region of interest is either constant, or so low that its variability can be neglected. It uses a slightly modified version of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (Lee et al., 2009) to recover the non-water absorption (a) and particulate backscattering (bbp) coefficients, and then obtains an estimate of absorption by CDOM, and the bacicscattering to absorption ratios for minerals and phytoplankton, by fitting upper and lower boundaries to the resulting data cluster. These ratios are employed in linear un-mixing equations to resolve the contributions of phytoplanlcton and minerals to the particulate absorption coefficient. The performance of the method was evaluated using reflectance spectra generated by an optical model of the Irish Sea which incorporated realistic specific inherent optical properties and distributions of constituent concentrations. It was then used to recover absorption coefficients for phytoplankton and suspended minerals in the 488 nm waveband from MODIS remote sensing data for the central Irish Sea for the period May 2005-November 2012. The partitioned coefficients showed strong seasonality, with suspended mineral absorption peaking in winter and phytoplanlcton absorption becoming dominant in spring and summer. By employing locally determined specific inherent optical properties, it was possible to estimate the average annual cycles in the concentrations of the two constituents. These cycles proved to be consistent with previously published models of particle dynamics in the region in which mineral concentrations are elevated by winter mixing and increasing water column stability in spring is followed by a period of phytoplankton growth. We conclude that it is possible to resolve the separate contributions of phytoplankton and minerals to particulate absorption in waters where these constituents are the dominant determinants of optical variability, and that the partitioned absorption coefficients can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of biogenic and minerogenic particles in shelf sea ecosystems. 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				SEP	2014	152						74	82		10.1016/j.rse.2014.06.003								WOS:000343392200007

A number of monitoring systems are used for tracking the spills and their effects on the marine environment, as well as for collecting data for feeding models. Among them, Earth observation technologies play a crucial role and moderate spatial resolution satellite systems are able to collect images with a very short revisit time or even daily. This paper describes the use of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data for monitoring large oil slicks with the fluorescence/emissivity index and object-based image analysis. Two case studies are presented: the Deepwater Horizon (2010) and the Campos Basin (2011) oil spill accidents. Results show that it is possible to track the dynamics of the slick both for massive and long-lasting accidents and for smaller and very quick accidents. The main advantages of the method proposed are a straightforward implementation, a fast and semi-automated data processing and the capability of integration of daytime and nighttime acquisitions, as well as its adaptability to different sensors.

Cloud properties derived from ARM ground-based observations were averaged over a 1 h interval centered at the satellite overpass time, while the CERES-MODIS (CM) results were averaged within a 30 km x 30 km grid box centered over the Azores site. A total of 63 daytime and 92 nighttime single-layered overcast MBL cloud cases were selected from 19 months of ARM radar-lidar and satellite observations. The CM cloud top/base heights (H-top/H-base) were determined from cloud top/base temperatures (T-top/T-base) using a regional boundary layer lapse rate method. For daytime comparisons, the CM-derived H-top (H-base), on average, is 0.063 km (0.068 km) higher (lower) than its ARM radar-lidar-observed counterpart, and the CM-derived T-top and T-base are 0.9 K less and 2.5 K greater than the surface values with high correlations (R-2 = 0.82 and 0.84, respectively). In general, the cloud top comparisons agree better than the cloud base comparisons, because the CM cloud base temperatures and heights are secondary products determined from cloud top temperatures and heights. No significant day-night difference was found in the analyses. The comparisons of MBL cloud microphysical properties reveal that when averaged over a 30 km x 30 km area, the CM-retrieved cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) at 3.7 mu m is 1.3 mu m larger than that from the ARM retrievals (12.8 mu m), while the CM-retrieved cloud liquid water path (LWP) is 13.5 gm(-2) less than its ARM counterpart (114.2 gm(-2)) due to its small optical depth (9.6 versus 13.7). The differences are reduced by 50% when the CM averages are computed only using the MODIS pixel nearest the AMF site. Using the effective radius retrieved using 2.1 mu m channel to calculate LWP can reduce the difference between the CM and ARM microwave radiometer retrievals from -13.7 to 2.1 gm(-2). The 10% differences between the ARM and CERES-MODIS LWP and r(e) retrievals are within the uncertainties of the ARM LWP (similar to 20 gm(-2)) and r(e) (similar to 10%) retrievals; however, the 30% difference in optical depth is significant. Possible reasons contributing to this discrepancy are increased sensitivities in optical depth from both surface retrievals when tau similar to 10 and topography. The tau differences vary with wind direction and are consistent with the island orography. Much better agreement in tau is obtained when using only those data taken when the wind is from the northeast, where topographical effects on the sampled clouds are minimal.

The sketch of the MOFL system equipped with a compact multi-channel photomultiplier tube (MPMT) is introduced in the paper. The methods of differentiating the oil fluorescence from the background water fluorescence and evaluating the Chl-a concentration are described. Two field experiments were carried out to investigate the field performance of the system, i.e., an experiment in coastal areas for oil pollution detection and an experiment over the Yellow Sea for Chl-a monitoring. In the coastal experiment, several oil samples and other fluorescence substances were used to analyze the fluorescence spectral characteristics for oil identification, and to estimate the thickness of oil films at the water surface. The experiment shows that both the spectral shape of fluorescence induced from surface water and the intensity ratio of two channels (I-495/I-405) are essential to determine oil-spill occurrence. In the airborne experiment, MOFL was applied to measure relative Chl-a concentrations in the upper layer of the ocean. A comparison of relative Chl-a concentration measurements by MOFL and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) indicates that the two datasets are in good agreement. The results show that the MOFL system is capable of monitoring oil spills and Chl-a in the upper layer of ocean water.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				AUG	2014	13	4					597	603		10.1007/s11802-014-2098-3								WOS:000339093900008

For the 642 daily coincident measurements that were obtained, MODIS AOT generally varies within the predicted uncertainty of the retrieval over ocean (Delta AOT = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 . AOT). The results from the remote sensing have been used to examine the accuracy in estimates of aerosol optical properties in the Arctic, generated by global climate models and from in situ measurements at the Zeppelin station, Svalbard. AOT simulated with the Norwegian Earth System Model/Community Atmosphere Model version 4 Oslo global climate model does not reproduce the observed seasonal variability of the Arctic aerosol. The model overestimates clear-sky AOT by nearly a factor of 2 for the background summer season, while tending to underestimate the values in the spring season. Furthermore, large differences in all-sky AOT of up to 1 order of magnitude are found for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 model ensemble for the spring and summer seasons. Large differences between satellite/ground-based remote sensing of AOT and AOT estimated from dry and humidified scattering coefficients are found for the subarctic marine boundary layer in summer.

The covered area is about 1,200 km(2) and the impacted area reached 40,000 km(2) on 31 May. This also occurred in the following two years, 2009 and 2010. We analyzed the satellite data from MODIS and the results showed that sea surface temperature increased 1-3 degrees C in U. prolifera bloom locations. The macroalgae in the water may have been the cause of the increase of sea surface temperatures. Rapid increases of U. prolifera biomass during the blooms may have increased radiation absorption of the water, and thus enhanced the rate of heating at the sea surface. The present study represents a preliminary observation, which is an important step for understanding influences of macroalgae on ocean surface conditions.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JUL-SEP	2014	17	3			SI		299	304		10.1080/14634988.2014.944471								WOS:000342280800012

We emphasize the following three aspects: (1) The retrieval algorithms developed for land and marine aerosol by using POLDER/PARASOL; The validation and application of POLDER/PARASOL AOD, and cross-comparison with AOD of other satellites, such as MODIS AOD. (2) The retrieval algorithms developed for land and marine aerosolby using MICROPOL and RSP/APS. We also introduce the new progress in aerosol research based on The Directional Polarimetric Camera(DPC), which was produced by Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). (3) The aerosol retrieval algorithms by using measurements from ground-based instruments, such as CE318-2 and CE318-DP. The retrieval results from spaceborne sensors, airborne camera and ground-based measurements include total AOD, fine-mode AOD, coarse-mode AOD, size distribution, particle shape, complex refractive indices, single scattering albedo, scattering phase function, polarization phase function and AOD above cloud. Finally, based on the research, the authors present the problems and prospects of atmospheric aerosol research by using polarization remote sensing, and provide a valuable reference for the future studies of atmospheric aerosol.																	1000-0593					JUL	2014	34	7					1873	1880		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)07-1873-08								WOS:000338826600030						
J	Petus, C; Collier, C; Devlin, M; Rasheed, M; McKenna, S				Petus, Caroline; Collier, Catherine; Devlin, Michelle; Rasheed, Michael; McKenna, Skye			Using MODIS data for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health: A case study in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Stretching more than 2000 km along the Queensland coast, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBR) shelters over 43,000 square km of seagrass meadows. Despite the status of marine protected area and World Heritage listing of the GBR, local seagrass meadows are under stress from reduced water quality levels; with reduction in the amount of light available for seagrass photosynthesis defined as the primary cause of seagrass loss throughout the GBR. Methods have been developed to map GBR plume water types by using MODE quasi-true colour (hereafter true colour) images reclassified in function of their dominant colour. These data can be used as an interpretative tool for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health (as defined in this study by the seagrass area and abundance) at different spatial and temporal scales. We tested this method in Cleveland Bay, in the northern GBR, where substantial loss in seagrass area and biomass was detected by annual monitoring from 2007 to 2011. A strong correlation was found between bay-wide seagrass meadow area and biomass and exposure to turbid Primary (sediment-dominated) water type. There was also a strong correlation between the changes of biomass and area of individual meadows and exposure of seagrass ecosystems to Primary water type over the 5-year period. Seagrass meadows were also grouped according to the dominant species within each meadow, irrespective of location within Cleveland Bay. These consolidated community types did not correlate well with the exposure to Primary water type, and this is likely to be due to local environmental conditions with the individual meadows that comprise these groupings. This study proved that remote sensing data provide the synoptic window and repetitivity required to investigate changes in water quality conditions over time. Remote sensing data provide an opportunity to investigate the risk of marine-coastal ecosystems to light limitation due to increased water turbidity when in situ water quality data is not available or is insufficient.

J	Chen, J; Quan, WT; Cui, TW; Song, QJ; Lin, CS				Chen, Jun; Quan, Wenting; Cui, Tingwei; Song, Qingjun; Lin, Changsong			Remote sensing of absorption and scattering coefficient using neural network model: Development, validation, and application	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The total absorption (a(lambda)) and backscattering (b(b)(lambda)) coefficients of natural waters are the most significant factors affecting light propagation within water columns, and thus play indispensable roles in the estimation of aquatic biomass, primary production, and carbon pools. Despite its importance, no accurate retrieval model has been specifically developed for both oceanic and coastal waters, but significant efforts have been made in regard to oceanic inversion models. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the applicability of the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) in deriving a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) from oceanic and coastal waters, and to improve it using a neural network-based semi-analytical algorithm (NNSAA). Based on a comparison of the a(X) and bb(X) predicted by these models with field measurements taken from the national aeronautics and space administration bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD), the Yellow Sea and China East Sea, it is shown that the NNSAA model (R-2 > 0.82 and mean relative error, MRE = 20.6-35.5%) provides a stronger performance than the QAA model (R-2 < 0.73 and MRE = 32.2-69.6%). The model was also applied to MODIS data after atmospheric correction using a near-infrared-based and shortwave infrared-based combined model. Through validation by field measurements, it was shown that the NNSAA model can predict a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) with high accuracy (R-2 >0.77 and MRE < 39.9%). Finally, the NNSAA model was used to map the global climatological seasonal mean a(443) and b(b)(555) for the time range of July 2002 to September 2013. Except the coastal zones, it was shown that the a(443) and b(b)(532) in some high-latitude areas are much higher than in the mid- and low-latitude regions, due to the effects of spurious signals from neighboring sea-ice. In the equatorial oceans, the a(443) value in the surface water is considerably higher in the equatorial Pacific than in the equatorial Atlantic in the upwelling region, while the integrate a(443) is much higher in the Atlantic than in the throughout the entire tropical gyre areas. The difference between a(443) and b(b)(532) in the subsurface water is due to a pronounced deep biomass maximum existing in the equatorial Atlantic, which is associated with the higher nitrate in the lower euphotic zone.

Assessment of NASA GISS CMIP5 and Post-CMIP5 Simulated Clouds and TOA Radiation Budgets Using Satellite Observations. Part I: Cloud Fraction and Properties	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Although many improvements have been made in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), clouds remain a significant source of uncertainty in general circulation models (GCMs) because their structural and optical properties are strongly dependent upon interactions between aerosol/cloud microphysics and dynamics that are unresolved in such models. Recent changes to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) turbulence and moist convection parameterizations in the NASA GISS Model E2 atmospheric GCM (post-CMIP5, hereafter P5) have improved cloud simulations significantly compared to its CMIP5 (hereafter C5) predecessor. A study has been performed to evaluate these changes between the P5 and C5 versions of the GCM, both of which used prescribed sea surface temperatures. P5 and C5 simulated cloud fraction (CF), liquid water path (LWP), ice water path (IWP), cloud water path (CWP), precipitable water vapor (PWV), and relative humidity (RH) have been compared to multiple satellite observations including the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (CERES-MODIS, hereafter CM), CloudSat-Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO; hereafter CC), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Although some improvements are observed in the P5 simulation on a global scale, large improvements have been found over the southern midlatitudes (SMLs), where correlations increased and both bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) significantly decreased, in relation to the previous C5 simulation, when compared to observations. Changes to the PBL scheme have resulted in improved total column CFs, particularly over the SMLs where marine boundary layer (MBL) CFs have increased by nearly 20% relative to the previous C5 simulation. Globally, the P5 simulated CWPs are 25 gm(-2) lower than the previous C5 results. The P5 version of the GCM simulates PWV and RH higher than its C5 counterpart and agrees well with the AMSR-E and AIRS observations. The moister atmospheric conditions simulated by P5 are consistent with the CF comparison and provide a strong support for the increase in MBL clouds over the SMLs. Over the tropics, the P5 version of the GCM simulated total column CFs and CWPs are slightly lower than the previous C5 results, primarily as a result of the shallower tropical boundary layer in P5 relative to C5 in regions outside the marine stratocumulus decks.

Environmental monitoring of El Hierro Island submarine volcano, by combining low and high resolution satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												El Hierro Island, located at the Canary Islands Archipelago in the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been rocked by thousands of tremors and earthquakes since July 2011. Finally, an underwater volcanic eruption started 300 m below sea level on October 10, 2011. Since then, regular multidisciplinary monitoring has been carried out in order to quantify the environmental impacts caused by the submarine eruption. Thanks to this natural tracer release, multisensorial satellite imagery obtained from MODIS and MERIS sensors have been processed to monitor the volcano activity and to provide information on the concentration of biological, chemical and physical marine parameters. Specifically, low resolution satellite estimations of optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration under these abnormal conditions have been assessed. These remote sensing data have played a fundamental role during field campaigns guiding the oceanographic vessel to the appropriate sampling areas. In addition, to analyze El Hierro submarine volcano area, WorldView-2 high resolution satellite spectral bands were atmospherically and deglinted processed prior to obtain a high-resolution optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient model. This novel algorithm was developed using a matchup data set with MERIS and MODIS data, in situ transmittances measurements and a seawater radiative transfer model. Multisensor and multitemporal imagery processed from satellite remote sensing sensors have demonstrated to be a powerful tool for monitoring the submarine volcanic activities, such as discolored seawater, floating material and volcanic plume, having shown the capabilities to improve the understanding of submarine volcanic processes.

The applicability of Lee's quasi-analytical algorithm-based semi-analytical model, Wang's switching model, Chen's semi-analytical model, jamet's neural network model, and the MBPNN model is evaluated using the NASA bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD) and the Eastern China Seas dataset. Based on the comparison of Kd(490) predicted by these five models, with field measurements taken in global oceanic and coastal waters, it is found that the MBPNN model provides a stronger performance than the Lee, Wang, Chen, and Jamet's models. The atmospheric effects on the MODIS data are eliminated using near-infrared band-based and shortwave infrared band-based combined models, and the K-d(490) is quantified from the MODIS data after atmospheric correction using the MBPNN model. The study results indicate that the MBPNN model produces similar to 28% uncertainty in estimating K-d(490) from the MODIS data. Finally, an exemplification of the applicability of the model to the coastal regions in the Eastern China Seas is carried out. Our results suggest that the K-d(490) shows a large variation in the Eastern China Seas, ranging from 0.02 to 4.0 m(-1), with an average value of -0.17 m(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluating the impact of aerosol particles above cloud on cloud optical depth retrievals from MODIS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Using two different operational Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud optical depth (COD) retrievals (0.86 versus 1.6 mu m), we evaluate the impact of above-cloud smoke aerosol particles on near-IR (0.86 mu m) COD retrievals. Aerosol Index (AI) from the collocated Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) are used to identify above-cloud aerosol particle loading over the southern Atlantic Ocean, including both smoke and dust from the African subcontinent. Collocated Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation data constrain cloud phase and provide contextual above-cloud aerosol optical depth. The frequency of occurrence of above-cloud aerosol events is depicted on a global scale for the spring and summer seasons from OMI and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization. Seasonal frequencies for smoke-over-cloud off the southwestern Africa coastline reach 20-50% in boreal summer. We find a corresponding low COD bias of 10-20% for standard MODIS COD retrievals when averaged OMI AI are larger than 1. No such bias is found over the Saharan dust outflow region off northern Africa, since both MODIS 0.86 and 1.6 mu m channels are vulnerable to radiance attenuation due to dust particles. A similar result is found for a smaller domain, in the Gulf of Tonkin region, from smoke advection over marine stratocumulus clouds and outflow into the northern South China Sea in spring. This study shows the necessity of accounting for the above-cloud aerosol events for future studies using standard MODIS cloud products in biomass burning outflow regions, through the use of collocated OMI AI and supplementary MODIS 1.6 mu m COD products.

In this study, a recent decadal trend of primary production in the Ulleung Basin was analyzed based on MODIS-derived monthly primary production for a better annual production budget. Based on the MODIS-derived primary production, the mean daily primary productivity was 766.8 mg C m-2 d-1 (SD=+/- 196.7 mg C m-2 d-1) and the annual primary productivity was 280.2 g C m-2 yr-1 (SD=+/- 14.9 g C m-2 yr-1) in the Ulleung Basin during the study period. The monthly contributions of primary production were not largely variable among different months, and a relatively small interannual production variability was also observed in the Ulleung Basin, which indicates that the Ulleung Basin is a sustaining biologically productive region called as hot spot in the East Sea. However, a significant recent decline in the annual primary production was observed in the Ulleung Basin after 2006. Although no strong possibilities were found in this study, the current warming sea surface temperature and a negative phase PDO index were suggested for the recent declining primary production. For a better understanding of subsequent effects on marine ecosystems, more intensive interdisciplinary field studies will be required in the Ulleung Basin.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY	2014	119	5					3002	3011		10.1002/2014JC009862								WOS:000337632500017

Using MODIS data for mapping of water types within river plumes in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia: Towards the production of river plume risk maps for reef and seagrass ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												River plumes are the major transport mechanism for nutrients, sediments and other land-based pollutants into the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) and are a major threat to coastal and marine ecosystems such as coral reefs and seagrass beds. Understanding the spatial extent, frequency of occurrence, loads and ecological impacts of land-based pollutants discharged through river plumes is essential to drive catchment management actions. In this study, a framework to produce river plume risk maps for seagrass and coral ecosystems, using supervised classification of MODIS Level 2 (L2) satellite products, is presented. Based on relevant 12 thresholds, river plumes are classified into Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary water types, which represent distinct water quality (WQ) parameters concentrations and combinations. Annual water type maps are produced over three wet seasons (2010-2013) as a case of study. These maps provide a synoptic basis to assess the likelihood and magnitude of the risk of reduced coastal WQ associated with the river discharge (river plume risk) and in combination with sound knowledge of the regional ecosystems can serve as the basis to assess potential ecological impacts for coastal and marine GBR ecosystems. The methods described herein provide relevant and easily reproducible large-scale information for river plume risk assessment and management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MODIS, MERIS and GOCI seawater reflectance products at green, red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are generated using atmospheric correction algorithms designed for turbid coastal waters then compared. Good agreement is obtained in the green and red while significant differences are observed in the NIR. The standard GOCI algorithm and a new one based on a regional empirical relationship established using MODIS satellite data are both proved to perform well over the whole range of water turbidity. Finally the dynamics of SPM is reconstituted along a three-month period to highlight a steady-state and stratified situation before the overpass of a large typhoon which mixed the water column, destroyed the deep-chlorophyll maximum and enhanced resuspension of bottom sediments varying according to tidal cycles.

J	Vanhellemont, Q; Neukermans, G; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Neukermans, Griet; Ruddick, Kevin			Synergy between polar-orbiting and geostationary sensors: Remote sensing of the ocean at high spatial and high temporal resolution	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Ocean colour sensors have been capturing the state of the world's oceans for over a decade. They are typically installed on polar-orbiting satellites and cover the entire earth every 1 to 2 days. This temporal resolution is insufficient to observe oceanic processes occurring at a higher frequency, especially when taking cloud cover into account. Data from geostationary platforms can be obtained with a much better temporal resolution (images every 15 or 60 min), and thus are useful to study those processes. We show that by synergistically combining marine reflectance data from SEVIRI, a geostationary sensor, and MODIS Aqua, a polar orbiter, the resulting product is an improvement over both data sources. The synergy approach takes the reflectance from MODIS, with high quality and high spatial resolution, and modulates this over the day by the temporal variability of the SEVIRI reflectance, normalized to the SEVIRI reflectance at the time of MODIS overpass. The temporal frequency of the synergy product is much better than that of MODIS, and by using the latter's high quality data, the limited spatial and radiometric resolution of SEVIRI is enhanced. As the SEVIRI data is limited to a single broad red band (560-710 nm), the applications of the synergy product are limited to parameters that can be derived from this band, such as suspended particulate matter (SPM), turbidity (T) and the diffuse attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (Kpar) in turbid waters. A geostationary ocean colour sensor over Europe will provide invaluable data concerning our marine environment. The cost of increasing the spatial resolution of a geostationary sensor is very high, and this study illustrates that a lower resolution geostationary ocean colour sensor combined with a high resolution polar orbiting sensor, can provide a high frequency synergetic product with high spatial resolution.

J	Vanhellemont, Q; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Ruddick, Kevin			Turbid wakes associated with offshore wind turbines observed with Landsat 8	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In the last decade, the number of offshore wind farms has increased rapidly. Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150 m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions.

A review of ocean color remote sensing methods and statistical techniques for the detection, mapping and analysis of phytoplankton blooms in coastal and open oceans	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The need for more effective environmental monitoring of the open and coastal ocean has recently led to notable advances in satellite ocean color technology and algorithm research. Satellite ocean color sensors' data are widely used for the detection, mapping and monitoring of phytoplankton blooms because earth observation provides a synoptic view of the ocean, both spatially and temporally. Algal blooms are indicators of marine ecosystem health; thus, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. Since the late 1970s, a wide variety of operational ocean color satellite sensors and algorithms have been developed. The comprehensive review presented in this article captures the details of the progress and discusses the advantages and limitations of the algorithms used with the multi-spectral ocean color sensors CZCS, SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS. Present challenges include overcoming the severe limitation of these algorithms in coastal waters and refining detection limits in various oceanic and coastal environments. To understand the spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms and their triggering factors, it is essential to consider the possible effects of environmental parameters, such as water temperature, turbidity, solar radiation and bathymetry. Hence, this review will also discuss the use of statistical techniques and additional datasets derived from ecosystem models or other satellite sensors to characterize further the factors triggering or limiting the development of algal blooms in coastal and open ocean waters.

J	Moore, TS; Dowell, MD; Bradt, S; Verdu, AR				Moore, Timothy S.; Dowell, Mark D.; Bradt, Shane; Ruiz Verdu, Antonio			An optical water type framework for selecting and blending retrievals from bio-optical algorithms in lakes and coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Bio-optical models are based on relationships between the spectral remote sensing reflectance and optical properties of in-water constituents. The wavelength range where this information can be exploited changes depending on the water characteristics. In low chlorophyll-a waters, the blue/green region of the spectrum is more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll-a concentration, whereas the red/NIR region becomes more important in turbid and/or eutrophic waters. In this work we present an approach to manage the shift from blue/green ratios to red/NIR-based chlorophyll-a algorithms for optically complex waters. Based on a combined in situ data set of coastal and inland waters, measures of overall algorithm uncertainty were roughly equal for two chlorophyll-a algorithms the standard NASA OC4 algorithm based on blue/green bands and a MERIS 3-band algorithm based on red/NIR bands-with RMS error of 0.416 and 0.437 for each in log chlorophyll-a units, respectively. However, it is clear that each algorithm performs better at different chlorophyll-a ranges. When a blending approach is used based on an optical water type classification, the overall RMS error was reduced to 0.320. Bias and relative error were also reduced when evaluating the blended chlorophyll-a product compared to either of the single algorithm products. As a demonstration for ocean color applications, the algorithm blending approach was applied to MERIS imagery over Lake Erie. We also examined the use of this approach in several coastal marine environments, and examined the long-term frequency of the OWTs to MODIS-Aqua imagery over Lake Erie. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Mitchell, C; Cunningham, A; McKee, D				Mitchell, Catherine; Cunningham, Alex; McKee, David			Remote sensing of shelf sea optical properties: Evaluation of a quasi-analytical approach for the Irish Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A quasi-analytical approach to deriving the coefficients of absorption, a(lambda), backscattering, b(b)(lambda), and the attenuation of planar irradiance, K-d(lambda), from sub-surface remote sensing reflectance, r(rs) (lambda), was investigated for the optically complex (Case 2) waters of the Irish Sea. The algorithms of Lee et al. (2005b, Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans, 110, C02017) were tuned for this region using radiative transfer calculations which incorporated locally determined specific inherent optical properties and constituent concentrations. The optimised algorithms were then applied to r(rs) spectra derived from profiling radiometry for 145 stations in the Irish Sea and adjacent waters, and their outputs compared with inherent optical property measurements for these stations. For the modelled data, recoveries of, a(lambda), b(b)(lambda) and K-d(lambda) in six wavebands between 412 nm and 667 nm had mean percentage errors below 3% and standard deviations of around 6%. For in situ data, the algorithms tended to over-estimate a(lambda) and under estimate b(b)(lambda) relative to measured values, but a contributing factor could be the difficulty of measuring optical properties accurately in turbid waters. Retrieved values of K-d(lambda) were highly correlated with those measured in situ, with regression slopes in the best-performing bands of 1.05 at 442 nm (r(2) = 0.91) and 0.92 at 488 nm (r(2) = 0.96). Three previously published relationships between satellite-derived optical properties at 490 nm and euphotic depth, z(1%PAR), produced roughly equivalent results with root mean square percentage errors, relative to in situ measurements, of around 20%. On the logarithmic scales usually employed in remote sensing, values of a(488), b(b)(488),K-d(488) and z(1%PAR) recovered using the optimised algorithms bore strong linear relationships to in situ measurements, with least square regression slopes in the range 0.89 to 1.03 and r(2) values from 0.87 to 0.94. Application of these algorithms to a MODIS image of the Irish Sea in early summer (25th May 2013) revealed marked spatial variations in optical properties which were well correlated with known patterns of tidal stirring in the region.

J	Kim, YH; Im, J; Ha, HK; Choi, JK; Ha, S				Kim, Yong Hoon; Im, Jungho; Ha, Ho Kyung; Choi, Jong-Kuk; Ha, Sunghyun			Machine learning approaches to coastal water quality monitoring using GOCI satellite data	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Since coastal waters are one of the most vulnerable marine systems to environmental pollution, it is very important to operationally monitor coastal water quality. This study attempts to estimate two major water quality indicators, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, in coastal environments on the west coast of South Korea using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data. Three machine learning approaches including random forest, Cubist, and support vector regression (SVR) were evaluated for coastal water quality estimation. In situ measurements (63 samples) collected during four days in 2011 and 2012 were used as reference data. Due to the limited number of samples, leave-one-out cross validation (CV) was used to assess the performance of the water quality estimation models. Results show that SVR outperformed the other two machine learning approaches, yielding calibration R-2 of 0.91 and CV root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 1.74 mg/m(3) (40.7%) for chl-a, and calibration R-2 of 0.98 and CV RMSE of 11.42 g/m(3) (63.1%) for SPM when using GOCI-derived radiance data. Relative importance of the predictor variables was examined. When GOCI-derived radiance data were used, the ratio of band 2 to band 4 and bands 6 and 5 were the most influential input variables in predicting chl-a and SPM concentrations, respectively. Hourly available GOCI images were useful to discuss spatiotemporal distributions of the water quality parameters with tidal phases in the west coast of Korea.

Application of the coastal and marine ecological classification standard using satellite-derived and modeled data products for pelagic habitats in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The expansive and dynamic nature of the ocean's water column may limit the feasibility of the frequent in situ sampling that would be necessary to monitor these habitats and produce region-wide map products with any regularity. Alternatives to in situ sampling such as remote sensing and classification offer a means of routinely characterizing the environmental forcing functions that shape and determine habitat suitability and distribution. Four products derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-aqua satellite (chlorophyll concentration, salinity, sea-surface temperature, and euphotic depth) and a hydrodynamic modeled product for bottom to surface temperature differences (At) were evaluated to assess the utility of these products as proxies for in situ measurements. MODIS images covering the northern Gulf of Mexico were obtained for a 5-year time period Uanuary 2005 - December 2009; 300 total images) and processed through Automated Processing System. The products were used to classify surface waters in three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico using subcomponents and modifiers from the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) Water Column Component (WC) to determine if CMECS categories could be affectively used to categorize the products into meaningful management units. Products were assessed for each month over the five year period. Sea-surface temperature and salinity were classified into CMECS WC temperature and salinity subcomponent categories, respectively. Three modifiers from the WC were also used for the pelagic classification: water column stability, productivity, and turbidity. At was used to assign classification for water column stability; surface chlorophyll was used to determine phytoplankton productivity; and euphotic depth was used to indicate the level of turbidity. Statistical analyses of the products compared to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program in situ data indicated that the MODIS and hydrodynamic modeling products were consistently different from the in situ data; however, we believe the potential is strong for use of these standard products to enhance water column information. Use of the CMECS WC with appropriate modifiers captures all the significant pelagic environmental parameters which influence habitat and species distributions. Of the parameters evaluated, the sea-surface salinity and temperature, as expected, were most useful for making comparisons. Further research incorporating different types of data is necessary to explore the full potential of this approach. Specifically, resource managers would like to see the incorporation of sediment and bathymetry data. We believe addition of these data layers would result in more robust habitat maps and provide an innovative tool for resource managers.

A case study- based assessment	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We intercompare the above-cloud aerosol optical depth (ACAOD) of biomass burning plumes retrieved from A-train sensors, i.e., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). These sensors have shown independent capabilities to retrieve aerosol loading above marine boundary layer cloudsa kind of situation often found over the southeast Atlantic Ocean during dry burning season. A systematic comparison reveals that all passive sensors and CALIOP-based research methods derive comparable ACAOD with differences mostly within 0.2 over homogeneous cloud fields. The 532nm ACAOD retrieved by CALIOP operational algorithm is underestimated. The retrieved 1064nm AOD however shows closer agreement with passive sensors. Given the different types of measurements processed with different algorithms, the reported close agreement between them is encouraging. Due to unavailability of direct measurements above cloud, the validation of satellite-based ACAOD remains an open challenge. The intersatellite comparison however can be useful for the relative evaluation and consistency check.

J	Sreekanth, V				Sreekanth, V.			On the classification and sub-classification of aerosol key types over south central peninsular India: MODIS-OMI algorithm	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Long-term (8 years), simultaneous data on aerosol optical properties from MODIS and OMI satellite sensors are analyzed to study their temporal characteristics and to infer on the major aerosol types present over the study location, Bangalore situated in south central peninsular India. Investigations are carried out on Aerosol Optical Depths (AODs), Angstrom exponent (alpha) and Aerosol Index (AI) for the purpose. Aerosol parameters exhibited significant seasonal variations: AODs peaking during monsoon, alpha during post-monsoon and AI during summer. Seasonal air mass back trajectories are computed to infer on the transport component over the study region. By assigning proper thresholds (depending on the nature of the location and transport pathways) on ADD and alpha values, aerosols are discriminated into their major types viz., marine influenced, desert dust, urban/industrialized and mixed types. Further sub-categorization of the aerosols has been done on an annual scale taking into account of their absorptance information in terms of the OMI-AI values. Mixed type aerosols contributed the most during all the seasons. Next to mixed type aerosols, marine influenced aerosols dominated during winter, desert dust during monsoon and summer, urban/industrialized aerosols during post-monsoon. Considering the urban nature of the study location, urban/industrialized/carbonaceous type aerosols have been significantly underestimated in these methodologies. Finally, discussion has been made on the consistency of the results obtained from the methodologies (i) based on AODs and alpha; (ii) based on AODs, alpha and AI. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Since the 1960s, remote sensing has played an important role in characterizing the marine environment, with particular emphasis on sea surface features, temperature, and salinity; mapping of shorelines, wetlands, and coral reefs; local fisheries and species movements; tracking hurricanes, earthquakes, and coastal flooding; and changes in coastal upwelling and marine productivity. This chapter reviews marine applications of remote sensing worldwide, exploring contemporary satellite systems, research themes, and analytical methods. In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, marine remote sensing has been limited to the use of large-scale daily image-gathering systems, such as CZCS, MODIS, SeaWiFS, and AVHRR, due to persistent cloud cover and constrained research budgets. Recent advances in satellite technology and availability, however, offer new opportunities for remote sensing in the Galapagos archipelago and beyond. Moderate-resolution sensors like SPOT and Landsat continue to be relevant for regional-scale evaluations of marine and coastal environments, identifying hotspots or focal areas for the use of more fine-grained imagery like QuickBird, WorldView-2, and aerial photographs. Radar systems like Aquarius and SAR show promise in new lines of oceanographic research, including sea surface salinity and the differentiation of mangrove subspecies. The use of ancillary or in situ data for calibration and validation of remotely-sensed image analysis can overcome the limitations of sensors used in bathymetric applications, while advances in cellular and GPS technology facilitate real-time reporting from citizen scientists for integrated monitoring of environmental and social change.																	2195-1055		978-3-319-02769-2; 978-3-319-02768-5				2014							109	136		10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2_6	10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2							WOS:000364124700008

We extract information of Spatial and Temporal Distributions of internal waves using MODIS remote sensing data of South China Sea in 2012, the characteristics of Spatial and Temporaldistribution of internal waves are analyzed. The results show that most of internal waves in the South China Sea are concentrate in continental shelf area, much internal waves in deep sea between Dongsha Islands to the west Luzon Strait. A gradual increase in the number of occurrences of internal waves appear at the beginning of April, May-August to achieve strong period, occurrences within the wave was gradually decreasing trend from September.

Looking through the haze: evaluating the CALIPSO level 2 aerosol optical depth using airborne high spectral resolution lidar data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) spacecraft has provided over 8 yr of nearly continuous vertical profiling of Earth's atmosphere. In this paper we investigate the V3.01 and V3.02 CALIOP 532 nm aerosol layer optical depth (AOD) product (i. e the AOD of individual layers) and the column AOD product (i. e., the sum AOD of the complete column) using an extensive database of coincident measurements. The CALIOP AOD measurements and AOD uncertainty estimates are compared with collocated AOD measurements collected with the NASA High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) in the North American and Caribbean regions. In addition, the CALIOP aerosol lidar ratios are investigated using the HSRL measurements. In general, compared with the HSRL values, the CALIOP layer AOD are biased high by less than 50% for AOD < 0.3 with higher errors for higher AOD. Less than 60% of the HSRL AOD measurements are encompassed within the CALIOP layer 1 SD uncertainty range (around the CALIOP layer AOD), so an error estimate is created to encompass 68% of the HSRL data. Using this new metric, the CALIOP layer AOD error is estimated using the HSRL layer AOD as +/- 0.035 +/- 0.05 +/- (HSRL layer AOD) at night and +/- 0.05 +/- 0.05 +/- (HSRL layer AOD) during the daytime. Furthermore, the CALIOP layer AOD error is found to correlate with aerosol loading as well as aerosol subtype, with the AODs in marine and dust layers agreeing most closely with the HSRL values. The lidar ratios used by CALIOP for polluted dust, polluted continental, and biomass burning layers are larger than the values measured by the HSRL in the CALIOP layers, and therefore the AODs for these types retrieved by CALIOP were generally too large. We estimated the CALIOP column AOD error can be expressed as +/- 0.05 +/- 0.07 +/- (HSRL column AOD) at night and +/- 0.08 +/- 0.1 +/- (HSRL column AOD) during the daytime. Multiple sources of error contribute to both positive and negative errors in the CALIOP column AOD, including multiple layers in the column of different aerosol types, lidar ratio errors, cloud misclassification, and undetected aerosol layers. The undetected layers were further investigated and we found that the layer detection algorithm works well at night, although undetected aerosols in the free troposphere introduce a mean underestimate of 0.02 in the column AOD in the data set examined. The decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during the daytime led to poorer performance of the layer detection. This caused the daytime CALIOP column AOD to be less accurate than during the nighttime, because CALIOP frequently does not detect optically thin aerosol layers with AOD < 0.1. Given that the median vertical extent of aerosol detected within any column was 1.6 km during the nighttime and 1.5 km during the daytime, we can estimate the minimum extinction detection threshold to be 0.012 km(-1) at night and 0.067 km(-1) during the daytime in a layer median sense. This extensive validation of level 2 CALIOP AOD products extends previous validation studies to nighttime lighting conditions and provides independent measurements of the lidar ratio; thus, allowing the assessment of the effect on the CALIOP AOD of using inappropriate lidar ratio values in the extinction retrieval.																	1867-1381	1867-8548					2014	7	12					4317	4340		10.5194/amt-7-4317-2014								WOS:000352290900006

In this paper, the information of the two major oil spill accidents, which occurred near Wusong and Jiuduansha of Shanghai waters in 2012, were analyzed by using the HJ-1 domestic environment satellite, at the same time, validated by the multi-satellite data, such as medium resolution MODIS of ESA and Landsat-5 date, as well as the investigation of our project group at the scene of accident. At first, by applying ratio operation between oil-water sensitive channel bands, the difference between film and background water's spectral reflectance was emphasized. After that, threshold determination method based on image segmentation was used, combined with the spectrum characteristic of heavy diesel oil, the oil spills information was effectively extracted from the suspected oil films area. Putting together, the oil spills location, area and quantity were diagnosed to provide the fundamental analysis data for emergency response work.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014										10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6947109								WOS:000349688104073

In addition, from the marine environment elements of sea surface temperature(SST) and sea surface wind field, the growth and drift characteristic of U. Prolifera were studied based on MODIS thermal infrared channel SST data and Windsat wind field data. In May 2014, U. Prolifera accumulation areas were first found in central YS north of Subei Bank. With summer arrival, seawater temperature of ocean surface gradually increased in YS, It provided a more suitable environment for the growth of U. Prolifera. Due to the prevailing northerly winds in central and western YS, U. Prolifera advected to the coastal waters of Shandong Peninsula, and spread to the northeastward. In late June, it had a massive bloom and reached the maximum coverage in the northern YS. The U. Prolifera drift characteristic was confirmed by the analysis on SST and sea surface wind field, and the result shows that under the environment of suitable sea surface temperature, the driving force of the prevailing sea surface wind field might be the main reason of YS U.

REMOTELY SENSED TIME SERIES OF CHLOROPHYLL-alpha, TOTAL SUSPENDED MATTER AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE FOR MONITORING WATER QUALITY OF THERMAIKOS GULF (GREECE)	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												During the last decades, remote sensing has been accepted as a useful tool for monitoring marine and coastal environments. The most notable advantages of using satellite imagery are the detailed coverage of large areas at low cost, the ability to collect data repeatedly and nonintrusively, and the multispectral nature of the observations. The aim of this work was to assess the use of satellite images for creating a time series of water quality parameters in Thermaikos Gulf (Greece), a dynamic aquatic ecosystem. The specific objectives included the evaluation of the spatial and temporal distributions of the produced maps, and the evaluation of the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Using ENVISAT MERIS and Aqua MODIS satellite images, a time series of two hydrological years was put together for chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha), total suspended matter (TSM) and sea surface temperature (SST). The results show that the satellite images covered the study Site with some data gaps due to cloud coverage and orbit shift of the ENVISAT satellite. Comparisons show a very good correlation with measurements of samples taken in the field. The produced maps illustrate the spatial distribution of Chl-alpha and TSM, specifically, the maxima were observed on the plumes of the three major rivers and the minima in the open sea. The time series produced by the temporal interpolation may be adequate for monitoring the water quality parameters of the area on an operational basis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	10A					2636	2644										WOS:000349805300015

The marine reflectance is then retrieved by subtraction. Variants and improvements have been made over the years to deal with non-null reflectance in the red and near infrared, a general situation in estuaries and the coastal zone, but the solutions proposed so far still suffer some limitations, due to uncertainties in marine reflectance modeling in the near infrared or difficulty to extrapolate the aerosol signal to the blue when using observations in the shortwave infrared (SWIR), a spectral range far from the ocean-color wavelengths. To estimate the marine signal (i. e., the product of marine reflectance and atmospheric transmittance) in the near infrared, the proposed approach is to decompose the aerosol reflectance in the near infrared to shortwave infrared into principal components. Since aerosol scattering is smooth spectrally, a few components are generally sufficient to represent the perturbing signal, i.e., the aerosol reflectance in the near infrared can be determined from measurements in the shortwave infrared where the ocean is black. This gives access to the marine signal in the near infrared, which can then be used in the classic atmospheric correction algorithm. The methodology is evaluated theoretically from simulations of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance for a wide range of geophysical conditions and angular geometries and applied to actual MODIS imagery acquired over the Gulf of Mexico. The number of discarded pixels is reduced by over 80% using the PC modeling to determine the marine signal in the near infrared prior to applying the classic atmospheric correction algorithm.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								926117	10.1117/12.2074009								WOS:000348837900027

The atmospheric "path" reflectance, due to scattering by molecules, aerosols, and droplets, absorption by aerosols, and reflection by the surface, including coupling terms, is modeled by a polynomial with three terms, i.e., three unknown coefficients. The marine reflectance is modeled as a function of chlorophyll concentration and a backscattering coefficient that accounts for scattering by non-algal particles (or deviation from the backscattering coefficient specified for typical phytoplankton), i.e., two additional unknown variables. The cloud transmittance, assumed constant spectrally, is estimated separately from top-of-atmosphere reflectance in the near infrared. The five unknowns are retrieved by an iterative, spectral matching scheme. The methodology, including the decomposition of the top-of-atmosphere signal and the modeling of the path reflectance, is evaluated theoretically and applied to actual MODIS imagery acquired over relatively thin clouds. Chlorophyll concentration is retrieved adequately under the clouds, and continuity is good between the cloudy and adjacent clear regions. Values are similar to those obtained with the SeaDAS algorithm in clear sky conditions, but cloud coverage is increased considerably. The algorithm is applicable operationally, but needs to be further evaluated in varied cloudy situations.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 926108	10.1117/12.2074008								WOS:000348837900007

Computing APAR requires knowledge of the absorption coefficient of live phytoplankton and the total absorption coefficient, quantities that are difficult to retrieve accurately from satellite ocean-color data. In the proposed approach, APAR is estimated directly from a linear combination of marine reflectance in the PAR spectral range. Feasibility is demonstrated theoretically from simulations using a marine reflectance model, and experimentally using data collected at 19 bio-optical stations during the February-March 2011 R/V Melville oceanographic cruise in the Southern Atlantic and Southeastern Pacific. Improvements in APAR accuracy are quantified in comparisons with estimates obtained from absorption coefficients or chlorophyll concentration determined from marine reflectance via standard satellite algorithms. The linear combination of marine reflectance is fairly robust to atmospheric correction errors. Due to the linear nature of the algorithm, their impact may be further reduced when using space- or time-averaged reflectance. The methodology is applied to actual MODIS imagery over the Southern Atlantic, and variability in the resulting APAR field is analyzed. The study suggests that determining APAR directly from marine reflectance has the potential to improve PP estimates from space.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 926106	10.1117/12.2074004								WOS:000348837900005

Automatic Detection of Marine Surfactants by MODIS Sunglint Imagery: A Study Case of Biogenic Films off the Southeastern Coast of Brazil	OCEAN REMOTE SENSING AND MONITORING FROM SPACE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Ocean Remote Sensing and Monitoring from Space	OCT 15-16, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	SPIE, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm, Minist Earth Sci				Global monitoring of marine surfactants is important for understanding the heat, particle, momentum, and gas exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. Observing the sunglint, i.e., the specular reflection between Sun, sea surface, and sensor, which intensity depends on the geometry of acquisition, has the potential to improve surfactants detection. The basis of the approach is that surfactants modify surface roughness, therefore the probability distribution of observing reflection by wave facets in the sensor field-of-view. An automatic method to detect surfactants from optical imagery under Sun glint conditions is presented. The method consists in comparing modeled normalized radiance (for clean water and surfactant contaminated water) with observed values. Application to MODIS imagery acquired off the Southwest Coast of Brazil in January 2003 demonstrates the method's feasibility, revealing the presence of biogenic films formed by Trichodesmium colonies. The presence of the N-2 fixing cyanobacteria was verified independently from in-situ measurements and ocean color remote sensing. An advantage of the glint-based method over detection methods using SAR imagery is the good spatial resolution (250 m) and the capability to detect surfactants at low wind speeds (< 2 m/s), impractical to SAR sensors due to the absence of Bragg scattering. Discriminating the type of surfactant, i.e., biogenic versus mineral, requires additional information, such as spectral marine reflectance.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi NPP, which has 22 spectral bands (from visible to infrared) similar to the NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), is a multi-disciplinary sensor providing observations for the Earth's atmosphere, land, and ocean properties. In this paper, we provide some evaluations and assessments of VIIRS ocean color data products, or ocean color Environmental Data Records (EDR), including normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) at VIIRS five spectral bands, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm K-d(490). Specifically, VIIRS ocean color products derived from the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (NOAA-MSL12) ocean color data processing system are evaluated and compared with MODIS ocean color products and in situ measurements. MSL12 is now NOAA's official ocean color data processing system for VIIRS. In addition, VIIRS Sensor Data Records (SDR or Level-1B data) have been evaluated. In particular, VIIRS SDR and ocean color EDR have been compared with a series of in situ data from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) in the waters off Hawaii. A notable discrepancy of global deep water Chl-a derived from MODIS and VIIRS between 2012 and 2013 is observed. This discrepancy is attributed to the SDR (or Level-1B data) calibration issue and particularly related to VIIRS green band at 551 nm. To resolve this calibration issue, we have worked on our own sensor calibration by combining the lunar calibration effect into the current calibration method. The ocean color products derived from our new calibrated SDR in the South Pacific Gyre show that the Chl-a differences between 2012 and 2013 are significantly reduced. Although there are still some issues, our results show that VIIRS is capable of providing high-quality global ocean color products in support of science research and operational applications.

NOAA-SeaDAS inherited all the original functionalities of SeaDAS 6.4 and was upgraded with many new functions and new sensor supports, particularly the support of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP). The main goal of the NOAA-SeaDAS development is primarily in support of NOAA ocean color team's calibration and validation activities. The current version of NOAA-SeaDAS can visualize, analyze, and process VIIRS Sensor Data Records (SDR or Level-1B data) produced by the NOAA Interface Data Processing System (IDPS), ocean color Environmental Data Records (EDR or Level-2 data) produced by the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, and Level-3 data binned or mapped from Level-2 data produced by NOAA-MSL12. NOAA-SeaDAS is currently serving an active IDL user group at NOAA and will serve other institutions and universities in the future. The goal is to allow various scientific users to visualize, analyze, and process VIIRS data from Level-1B through Level-2 and Level-3. In addition, NOAA-SeaDAS can also visualize satellite images from the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), as well as many other satellite ocean color sensors, e. g., SeaWiFS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), etc. NOAA-SeaDAS is under constant development to create new system functionalities and enhance user experience.

In recent years, along with the changing of global climate, the sea ice situation becomes too critical. The monitoring of sea ice is playing a very important role in keeping human life and properties in safety, and undertaking of marine scientific research. The methods to monitor sea ice mainly include: first, shore observation; second, icebreaker monitoring; third, satellite remote sensing; and then aerial remote sensing monitoring. The marine station staffs use relevant equipments to monitor the sea ice in the shore observation. The icebreaker monitoring means: the workers complete the test of the properties of sea ice, such as density, salinity and mechanical properties. MODIS data and NOAA data are processed to get sea ice charts in the satellite remote sensing means. Besides, artificial visual monitoring method and some airborne remote sensors are adopted in the aerial remote sensing to monitor sea ice. Aerial remote sensing is an important means in sea ice monitoring because of its strong maneuverability, wide watching scale, and high resolution. In this paper, several methods in the sea ice monitoring using aerial remote sensing technology are discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-385-4				2014	9299								UNSP 929903	10.1117/12.2066434								WOS:000349376400003

Remote sensing and GIS for the modeling of persistent organic pollutant in the marine environment	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				The characterization of the marine environment plays an important role in the understanding of the dynamics affecting the transport, fate and persistence (TFP) of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). This work is part of a project funded by the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca. The aim of the project is the assessment of the TFP of POPs in the Mediterranean sea. The analysis will be carried out at regional-mesoscale (central Mediterranean), and at local spatial scale considering different Italian test sites (the Delta of the Po River, the Venice Lagoon and the estuary of the Rio Nocella). The first step of this work involves the implementation of GIS geodatabases for the definition of the input dataset. The geodatabases were populated with MERIS and MODIS level 2 and level 3 products of Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient (DAC), Particulate Inorganic Carbon (PIC), Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The spatial scale (central Mediterranean sea) and the reference system (Plate Carree projection) have been imposed as a constraint for the geodatabases. Four geodatabases have been implemented, two for MODIS and two for MERIS products with a monthly, seasonal and climatological temporal scale (2002 -2013). Here, we present a first application of a methodology aimed to identify vulnerable areas to POPs accumulation and persistence. The methodology allowed to assess the spatial distribution of the CHL-a in the central Mediterranean sea. The chlorophyll concentration is related to the amount of nutrients in the water and therefore provides an indicator of the potential presence of POPs. A pilot area of 300 x 200 km located in the North Adriatic sea has been initially considered. The seasonal and climatological MODIS and MERIS CHL-a variability were retrieved and compared with in-situ forcing parameters, i.e. Po River discharge rates and wind data. Study outlooks include a better accuracy of the distribution of the vulnerable areas achieved through the use of additional parameters (CDOM, SST, POC), and an assessment of the contribution of the contaminants by atmospheric dry deposition to the marine environment.

This work focuses on development of a multiband inversion algorithm that combines remote sensing reflectance measurements at several wavelengths in the blue, green and red for retrievals of the absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, color dissolved organic matter and non-algal particulates at 443nm as well as the particulate backscatter coefficient at 443nm. The algorithm was developed, using neural networks (NN), and was designed to use as input measurements on ocean color bands matching those of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The NN is trained on a simulated data set generated through a bio-optical model for a broad range of typical coastal water parameters. The NN was evaluated using several statistical indicators, initially on the simulated data-set, as well as on field data from the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set, NOMAD, and data from our own field campaigns in the Chesapeake Bay which represent well the range of water optical properties as well as chlorophyll concentrations in coastal regions. The algorithm was also finally applied on a satellite - in situ databases that were assembled for the Chesapeake Bay region using MODIS and VIIRS satellite data. These databases were created using in-situ chlorophyll concentrations routinely measured in different locations throughout Chesapeake Bay and satellite reflectance overpass data that coexist in time with these in-situ measurements. NN application on this data-sets suggests that the blue (412 and 443nm) satellite bands are erroneous. The NN which was assessed for retrievals from VIIRS using only the 486, 551 and 671 bands showed that retrievals that omitted the 671 nm band was the most effective, possibly indicating an inaccuracy in the VIIRS 671 band that needs to be further investigated.

Many instruments are used for the measuring the SST. The SST delivered from satellite have the advantages that are a broad scope and consistent detection. But SST products show the different value because of different of retrieval algorithm and sensor. To reduce the uncertain, SST data ensemble is carried out using the Bayesian model averaging(BMA). BMA is method of the weighted average using the posterior probability distribution. And the means and variances of the posterior probabilities are estimated using Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm. The estimated mean of the posterior probability is used as the weight for the weighted average. SST data of Aqua/MODIS, Terra/MODIS and NOAA/AVHRR was used as ensemble member. SST data Envisat/AATSR was used as reference data for calculating the posterior probability and validation data. To make the monthly ensemble SST, their provided monthly SST data was used. one-leave-out-cross validation that is one of the statistical validation method is used for validating the ensemble SST. The 12 cases, except for the data of one month per the case, was made and excepted month was used validation period. And we compared with the ensemble mean and median. As the result, ensemble BMA showed the lowest RMSE.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								924011	10.1117/12.2067324								WOS:000348196100025

This system is designed for investigating various processes and phenomena in the ocean and marine atmosphere using different types of satellite remotely sensed data. The STS system provides researchers with the possibilities to deal with the satellite remote sensing data as well as with the result of its analysis. The key feature of STS is the ability to work simultaneously with satellite information of different types. STS provides tools for joint analysis of different types of satellite data, as well as data of ground meteorological stations, cartographic data etc. This paper gives an overview of the system and data processing use cases. Some example cases are described including processing and joint analysis of various satellite data. The data from different sensors (obtained by Envisat ASAR, Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-5 TM, Terra/Aqua MODIS as well as Hyperion and HICO hyperspectral data) was analyzed jointly for differentiation between different types of coastal waters, and for reconstruction of suspended matter distribution in the test areas of the Azov and Black Seas.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								92401C	10.1117/12.2067300								WOS:000348196100033

The influence of the Guadalquivir River on the spatio-temporal variability of suspended solids and chlorophyll in the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												This study examines the spatio-temporal variability of the turbidity plume and phytoplankton biomass (in terms of chlorophyll) in the marine region influenced by the Guadalquivir estuary using ocean colour images over a period of 11 years (20032013). The area of the turbidity plume was calculated using water-leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw555). Climatologic and monthly averages showed recurrent high nLw555 levels in winter and high chlorophyll in spring. Similar variability was confirmed by Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of 8-day composite images, illustrating the existence of different regions with similar behaviour. The first EOF mode explained 60.7% and 31% of the variability in nLw555 and chlorophyll, respectively, and was associated with enhanced Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in autumn-winter and phytoplankton blooms in winter-spring periods. The results confirmed that the development of the turbidity plume and subsequent phytoplankton blooms were strongly regulated by river discharges and precipitation. Indeed, inter-annual variation in nLw555 was consistent with changes in the large-scale climate index, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a proxy for regional rainfall patterns. In the case of phytoplankton biomass, the second EOF mode revealed differentiation between offshore and near shore areas, the latter characterized by delayed development of phytoplankton blooms due to light limitation by high TSS. This suggests that the stability of the water column, via its influence on phytoplankton light-limitation, also influenced the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton bloom events. The dynamics of the Guadalquivir estuary turbidity plume is a crucial factor for the pelagic ecosystem of the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz, governing phytoplankton productivity.

B	Banks, AC; Melin, F			IEEE	Banks, Andrew Clive; Melin, Frederic			Cloud Masking Schemes for Satellite Ocean Colour Data in the Baltic Sea and Applications to Cyanobacteria Bloom Analysis	2014 IEEE/OES BALTIC INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM (BALTIC)					6th IEEE/OES Baltic International Symposium (BALTIC) - Measuring and Modeling of Multi-Scale Interactions in the Marine Environment	MAY 26-29, 2014	Tallinn, ESTONIA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Ocean Engn Soc, Tallinn Univ Technol, Marine Syst Inst, Tallinn Univ Technol				One of the most important steps in utilizing ocean colour remote sensing data is subtracting the contribution of the atmosphere from the signal at the satellite to obtain marine water leaving radiance. To be done accurately this requires clear sky conditions, i.e. all clouds need to be excluded or masked from the data prior to atmospheric correction. The standard cloud mask used routinely in the processing of NASA's global ocean colour data is based on a simple threshold applied to the Rayleigh-corrected top-of-atmosphere radiance. The threshold is kept purposefully low to ensure high quality processing at a global scale. As a consequence, the standard scheme can sometimes inadvertently mask extreme optical events such as intense blue-green algal (cyanobacteria) blooms in the Baltic Sea. These blooms have important ecological and environmental impacts on the basin and require appropriate monitoring. Therefore, an assessment of 5 existing cloud masking schemes that could provide valuable alternatives for the Baltic Sea was carried out by systematically testing their application to time series of SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS data. By applying them to a number of years of satellite data, temporal and spatial implications were analyzed and a new hybrid cloud mask was developed and similarly tested. The results indicate that, by replacing the standard cloud mask, an increase of an average of 22% in ocean coverage over the course of a seasonal cycle in the Baltic Sea may be possible. Major occurrences of intense blooms can be recovered whilst at the same time not introducing any significant extra cloud into the processing. The full inclusion of the cyanobacteria blooms, even their most intense manifestations, into Baltic data series allows a more comprehensive analysis of their spectral characteristics with powerful implications for their detection, monitoring, and interannual evolution.																			978-1-4799-5707-1				2014																		WOS:000346649800007

Atmospheric black carbon and warming effects influenced by the source and absorption enhancement in central Europe	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Particles containing black carbon (BC), a strong absorbing substance, exert a rather uncertain direct and indirect radiative forcing in the atmosphere. To investigate the mass concentration and absorption properties of BC particles over central Europe, the model WRF-Chem was used at a resolution of 12 km in conjunction with a high-resolution BC emission inventory (EUCAARI 42-Pan-European Carbonaceous Aerosol Inventory; 1/8 degrees x 1/16 degrees). The model simulation was evaluated using measurements of equivalent soot carbon, absorption coefficients and particle number concentrations at seven sites within the German Ultrafine Aerosol Network, PM10 mass concentrations from the dense measurement network of the German Federal Environmental Agency at 392 monitoring stations, and aerosol optical depth from MODIS and AERONET. A distinct time period (25 March to 10 April 2009) was chosen, during which the clean marine air mass prevailed in the first week and afterwards the polluted continental air mass mainly from the southeast dominated with elevated daily average BC concentration of up to 4 mu g m(-3). The simulated PM10 mass concentration, aerosol number concentration and optical depth were in good agreement with the observations, while the modelled BC mass concentrations were found to be a factor of 2 lower than the observations. Together with back trajectories, detailed model bias analyses suggested that the current BC emission in countries to the east and south of Germany might be underestimated by a factor of 5, at least for the simulation period. Running the model with upscaled BC emissions in these regions led to a smaller model bias and a better correlation between model and measurement. In contrast, the particle absorption coefficient was positively biased by about 20% even when the BC mass concentration was underestimated by around 50 %. This indicates that the internal mixture treatment of BC in the WRF-Chem optical calculation is unrealistic in our case, which overamplifies the light absorption by BC-containing particles. By adjusting the modelled mass absorption cross-section towards the measured values, the simulation of particle light absorption of BC was improved as well Finally, the positive direct radiative forcing of BC particles at the top of the atmosphere was estimated to be in the range of 0 to +4 W m(-2) over Germany for the model mn with improved BC mass concentration and adjusted BC light absorption cross-section. This adjustment lowered the positive forcing of BC by up to 70 %, compared with the internal mixing treatment of BC in the model simulation.

J	Wu, X; Li, S				Wu, Xiaojing; Li, Sanmei			Automatic sea fog detection over Chinese adjacent oceans using Terra/MODIS data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Sea fog is a problematic weather phenomenon for marine transportation and navigation. Lacking ground observations, sea fog monitoring mainly depends on meteorological and environmental satellites because they provide large swaths of data with good spatial and temporal resolution. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites provides several new features for sea fog detection because of the more available channels. In addition to the traditional variable-dual channel difference (DCDIR), which is widely used to detect sea fog and stratus clouds at night, this study uses and analyses several other variables including NDSI (normalized difference snow index), BTDback (brightness temperature difference in the thermal infrared channel between a sea fog/stratus cloud pixel and nearby clear-sky ocean surface), NWVI (normalized difference near-infrared water vapour index) and D_NWVI (NWVI difference between a possible sea fog/stratus cloud pixel and nearby clear-sky ocean surface), for all seasons. BTDback, NWVI, and D_NWVI show outstanding ability to discriminate between sea fog and stratus clouds. Automatic sea fog detection algorithms are developed using these variables for both daytime and night time with Terra/MODIS data based on a threshold scheme. During development of the algorithms, a series of data processes are also considered to maintain stable performance of the algorithms over wide areas and in all seasons. The algorithms are applied to Terra/MODIS data at a semi-operational mode from 2007 to 2013 and show promising results. Validation with data from field campaigns, one buoy station with good maintenance, 18 weather stations, and CALIOP (Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization)/CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) demonstrates the accuracy of the algorithms. The sea fog detection results are highly consistent with fog observations from the field campaign data. The validation with the buoy station data shows an overall accuracy of 90% under all weather conditions, an accuracy of 86% during foggy weather condition, and a KSS (Hanssen-Kuiper Skill Score) of 0.81. The validation with two-year data from 18 weather stations and CALIOP/CALIPSO over the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea shows accuracy of 76.3% and 77.9%, respectively. The promising results indicate high probability of applying the algorithms in operational systems over the oceans adjacent to China or even wider oceans using Terra/MODIS data.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	21					7430	7457		10.1080/01431161.2014.968685								WOS:000346052200005

FAME-C: cloud property retrieval using synergistic AATSR and MERIS observations	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												A newly developed daytime cloud property retrieval algorithm, FAME-C (Freie Universitat Berlin AATSR MERIS Cloud), is presented. Synergistic observations from the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), both mounted on the polar-orbiting Environmental Satellite (Envisat), are used for cloud screening. For cloudy pixels two main steps are carried out in a sequential form. First, a cloud optical and microphysical property retrieval is performed using an AATSR near-infrared and visible channel. Cloud phase, cloud optical thickness, and effective radius are retrieved, and subsequently cloud water path is computed. Second, two cloud top height products are retrieved based on independent techniques. For cloud top temperature, measurements in the AATSR infrared channels are used, while for cloud top pressure, measurements in the MERIS oxygen-A absorption channel are used. Results from the cloud optical and microphysical property retrieval serve as input for the two cloud top height retrievals. Introduced here are the AATSR and MERIS forward models and auxiliary data needed in FAME-C. Also, the optimal estimation method, which provides uncertainty estimates of the retrieved property on a pixel basis, is presented. Within the frame of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, the first global cloud property retrievals have been conducted for the years 2007-2009. For this time period, verification efforts are presented, comparing, for four selected regions around the globe, FAME-C cloud optical and microphysical properties to cloud optical and microphysical properties derived from measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra satellite. The results show a reasonable agreement between the cloud optical and microphysical property retrievals. Biases are generally smallest for marine stratocumulus clouds: -0.28, 0.41 mu m and 0.18 gm(-2) for cloud optical thickness, effective radius and cloud water path, respectively. This is also true for the root-mean-square deviation. Furthermore, both cloud top height products are compared to cloud top heights derived from ground-based cloud radars located at several Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites. FAME-C mostly shows an underestimation of cloud top heights when compared to radar observations. The lowest bias of -0.3 km is found for AATSR cloud top heights for single-layer clouds, while the highest bias of -3.0 km is found for AATSR cloud top heights for multilayer clouds. Variability is low for MERIS cloud top heights for low-level clouds, and high for MERIS cloud top heights for mid-level and high-level single-layer clouds, as well as for both AATSR and MERIS cloud top heights for multilayer clouds.

Systematic satellite observations of the impact of aerosols from passive volcanic degassing on local cloud properties	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The impact of volcanic emissions, especially from passive degassing and minor explosions, is a source of uncertainty in estimations of aerosol indirect effects. Observations of the impact of volcanic aerosol on clouds contribute to our understanding of both present-day atmospheric properties and of the pre-industrial baseline necessary to assess aerosol radiative forcing. We present systematic measurements over several years at multiple active and inactive volcanic islands in regions of low present-day aerosol burden. The time-averaged indirect aerosol effects within 200 km downwind of island volcanoes are observed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 2002-2013) and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR, 2002-2008) data. Retrievals of aerosol and cloud properties at Kilauea (Hawai'i), Yasur (Vanuatu) and Piton de la Four-naise (la Reunion) are rotated about the volcanic vent to be parallel to wind direction, so that upwind and downwind retrievals can be compared. The emissions from all three volcanoes -including those from passive degassing, Strombolian activity and minor explosions - lead to measurably increased aerosol optical depth downwind of the active vent. Average cloud droplet effective radius is lower downwind of the volcano in all cases, with the peak difference ranging from 2-8 mu m at the different volcanoes in different seasons. Estimations of the difference in Top of Atmosphere upward Short Wave flux upwind and downwind of the active volcanoes from NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) suggest a downwind elevation of between 10 and 45 Wm(-2) at distances of 150-400 km from the volcano, with much greater local (< 80 km) effects. Comparison of these observations with cloud properties at isolated islands without degassing or erupting volcanoes suggests that these patterns are not purely orographic in origin. Our observations of unpolluted, isolated marine settings may capture processes similar to those in the pre-industrial marine atmosphere.

Especially, calibration and validation of ocean color satellite data relies on high quality in situ data. In addition, objective evaluation of satellite ocean color products need well quality controlled in situ data from various bio-optical environments covering diverse aquatic waters. The goal of ocean color satellite sensors is to remotely derive accurate normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nL(w)(lambda)), therefore other water biological and biogeochemical property data can be obtained using satellite-measured nL(w)(lambda) spectra. In this paper, we show results from analyzing in situ data processing procedure from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and NASA SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) used for satellite ocean color calibration and validation purposes. Various issues in determining final product of in situ radiometric data processing such as convolving nL(w)(lambda) with respect to satellite sensor spectral response functions, sensor effective band center wavelengths, and effects of Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are analyzed and discussed. Performance of satellite-derived nL(w)(lambda) taking into consideration of various issues in the in situ data processing is also assessed.

Remote sensing of cloud top pressure/height from SEVIRI: analysis of ten current retrieval algorithms	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The role of clouds remains the largest uncertainty in climate projections. They influence solar and thermal radiative transfer and the earth's water cycle. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate cloud observations to validate climate models and to monitor climate change. Passive satellite imagers measuring radiation at visible to thermal infrared (IR) wavelengths provide a wealth of information on cloud properties. Among others, the cloud top height (CTH) - a crucial parameter to estimate the thermal cloud radiative forcing - can be retrieved. In this paper we investigate the skill of ten current retrieval algorithms to estimate the CTH using observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). In the first part we compare ten SEVIRI cloud top pressure (CTP) data sets with each other. The SEVIRI algorithms catch the latitudinal variation of the CTP in a similar way. The agreement is better in the extratropics than in the tropics. In the tropics multi-layer clouds and thin cirrus layers complicate the CTP retrieval, whereas a good agreement among the algorithms is found for trade wind cumulus, marine stratocumulus and the optically thick cores of the deep convective system. In the second part of the paper the SEVIRI retrievals are compared to CTH observations from the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) instruments. It is important to note that the different measurement techniques cause differences in the retrieved CTH data. SEVIRI measures a radiatively effective CTH, while the CTH of the active instruments is derived from the return time of the emitted radar or lidar signal. Therefore, some systematic differences are expected. On average the CTHs detected by the SEVIRI algorithms are 1.0 to 2.5 km lower than CALIOP observations, and the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the CALIOP data sets range between 0.77 and 0.90. The average CTHs derived by the SEVIRI algorithms are closer to the CPR measurements than to CALIOP measurements. The biases between SEVIRI and CPR retrievals range from -0.8 km to 0.6 km. The correlation coefficients of CPR and SEVIRI observations vary between 0.82 and 0.89. To discuss the origin of the CTH deviation, we investigate three cloud categories: optically thin and thick single layer as well as multi-layer clouds. For optically thick clouds the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the reference data sets are usually above 0.95. For optically thin single layer clouds the correlation coefficients are still above 0.92. For this cloud category the SEVIRI algorithms yield CTHs that are lower than CALIOP and similar to CPR observations. Most challenging are the multi-layer clouds, where the correlation coefficients are for most algorithms between 0.6 and 0.8. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the SEVIRI retrievals for boundary layer clouds. While the CTH retrieval for this cloud type is relatively accurate, there are still considerable differences between the algorithms. These are related to the uncertainties and limited vertical resolution of the assumed temperature profiles in combination with the presence of temperature inversions, which lead to ambiguities in the CTH retrieval. Alternative approaches for the CTH retrieval of low clouds are discussed.

Cloud properties were drawn from data acquired both from in situ measurements with state of the art airborne instrumentation and from satellite products of the MODIS06 System. The used aircraft was ATMOSLAB - Airborne Laboratory for Environmental Atmospheric Research, property of the National Institute for Aerospace Research "Elie Carafoli" (INCAS), Bucharest, Romania, which is specially equipped for this kind of research. The main tool of the airborne laboratory is a Cloud, Aerosol and Precipitation Spectrometer-CAPS (30 bins, 0.51-50 mu m). The data was recorded during two flights during the winter 2013-2014, over a flat region in the south-eastern part of Romania (between Bucharest and Constanta). The analysis of cloud particle size variations and cloud liquid water content provided by CAPS can explain cloud processes, and can also indicate the extent of aerosols effects on clouds. The results, such as cloud coverage and/or cloud types, microphysical parameters of aerosols on the one side and the cloud microphysics parameters obtained from aircraft flights on the other side, was used to illustrate the importance of microphysics cloud properties for including the radiative effects of clouds in the regional climate models.

Bromocarbons in the tropical coastal and open ocean atmosphere during the 2009 Prime Expedition Scientific Cruise (PESC-09)	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Atmospheric concentrations of very short-lived species (VSLS) bromocarbons, including CHBr3, CH2Br2, CHCl2Br, CHClBr2, and CH2BrCl, were measured in the Strait of Malacca and the South China and Sulu-Sulawesi seas during a two-month research cruise in June-July 2009. The highest bromocarbon concentrations were found in the Strait of Malacca, with smaller enhancements in coastal regions of northern Borneo. CHBr3 was the most abundant bromocarbon, ranging from 5.2 pmol mol(-1) in the Strait of Malacca to 0.94 pmol mol(-1) over the open ocean. Other bromocarbons showed lower concentrations, in the range of 0.8-1.3 pmol mol(-1) for CH2Br2, 0.1-0.5 pmol mol(-1) for CHCl2Br, and 0.1-0.4 pmol mol(-1) for CHClBr2. There was no significant correlation between bromocarbons and in situ chlorophyll a, but positive correlations with both MODIS and SeaWiFS satellite chlorophyll a. Together, the short-lived bromocarbons contribute an average of 8.9 pmol mol(-1) (range 5.2-21.4 pmol mol(-1)) to tropospheric bromine loading, which is similar to that found in previous studies from global sampling networks (Montzka et al., 2011). Statistical tests showed strong Spearman correlations between brominated compounds, suggesting a common source. Log-log plots of CHBr3/CH2Br2 versus CHBr2Cl/CH2Br2 show that both chemical reactions and dilution into the background atmosphere contribute to the composition of these halocarbons at each sampling point. We have used the correlation to make a crude estimate of the regional emissions of CHBr3 and to derive a value of 32 Gg yr(-1) for the Southeast (SE) Asian region (10 degrees N-20 degrees S, 90-150 degrees E). Finally, we note that satellite-derived chlorophyll a (chl a) products do not always agree well with in situ measurements, particularly in coastal regions of high turbidity, meaning that satellite chl a may not always be a good proxy for marine productivity.

Radiative signature of absorbing aerosol over the eastern Mediterranean basin	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The effects of absorbing aerosols on the atmospheric radiation budget and dynamics over the eastern Mediterranean region are studied using satellites and ground-based observations, and radiative transfer model calculations, under summer conditions. Climatology of aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA) and size parameters were analyzed using multiyear (1999-2012) observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and AErosol RObotic NET-work (AERONET). Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)-derived aerosol vertical distributions and their classifications are used to calculate the AOD of four dominant aerosol types: dust, polluted dust, polluted continental, and marine aerosol over the region. The seasonal mean (June-August 2010) AODs are 0.22 +/- 0.02, 0.11 +/- 0.04, 0.10 +/- 0.04 and 0.06 +/- 0.01 for polluted dust, polluted continental, dust and marine aerosol, respectively. Changes in the atmospheric temperature profile as a function of absorbing aerosol loading were derived for the same period using observations from the AIRS satellite. We inferred heating rates in the aerosol layer of similar to 1.7 +/- 0.8 K day(-1) between 925 and 850 hPa, which is attributed to aerosol absorption of incoming solar radiation. Radiative transfer model (RTM) calculations show significant atmospheric warming for dominant absorbing aerosol over the region. A maximum atmospheric forcing of +16.7 +/- 7.9 W m(-2) is calculated in the case of polluted dust, followed by dust (+9.4 +/- 4.9 W m(-2)) and polluted continental (+6.4 +/- 4.5 W m(-2)). RTM-derived heating rate profiles for dominant absorbing aerosol show warming of 0.1-0.9 K day(-1) in the aerosol layer (<3.0 km altitudes), which primarily depend on AODs of the different aerosol types. Diabatic heating due to absorbing aerosol stabilizes the lower atmosphere, which could significantly reduce the atmospheric ventilation. These conditions can enhance the "pollution pool" over the eastern Mediterranean.

J	Grosvenor, DP; Wood, R				Grosvenor, D. P.; Wood, R.			The effect of solar zenith angle on MODIS cloud optical and microphysical retrievals within marine liquid water clouds	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												In this paper we use a novel observational approach to investigate MODIS satellite retrieval biases of tau and r(e) (using three different MODIS bands: 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m, denoted as r(e1.6), r(e2.1) and r(e3.7), respectively) that occur at high solar zenith angles (theta(0)) and how they affect retrievals of cloud droplet concentration (N-d). Utilizing the large number of overpasses for polar regions and the diurnal variation of theta(0) we estimate biases in the above quantities for an open ocean region that is dominated by low level strati-form clouds. We find that the mean tau is fairly constant between theta(0) = 50 degrees and similar to 65-70 degrees, but then increases rapidly with an increase of over 70% between the lowest and highest theta(0). The r(e2.1) and r(e3.7) decrease with theta(0), with effects also starting at around theta(0) = 65-70 degrees. At low theta(0), the re values from the three different MODIS bands agree to within around 0.2 m, whereas at high theta(0) the spread is closer to 1 mu m. The percentage changes of r(e) with theta(0) are considerably lower than those for tau, being around 5% and 7% for r(e2.1) and r(e3.7). For r(e1.6) there was very little change with theta(0). Evidence is provided that these changes are unlikely to be due to any physical diurnal cycle. The increase in tau and decrease in r(e) both contribute to an overall increase in N-d of 40- 70% between low and high theta(0). Whilst the overall r(e) changes are quite small, they are not insignificant for the calculation of N-d; we find that the contributions to N-d biases from the tau and r(e) biases were roughly comparable for r(e3.7), although for the other r(e) bands the tau changes were considerably more important. Also, when considering only the clouds with the more heterogeneous tops, the importance of the r(e) biases was considerably enhanced for both r(e2.1) and r(e3.7). When using the variability of 1 km resolution tau data (gamma(tau)) as a heterogeneity parameter we obtained the expected result of increasing differences in tau between high and low theta(0) as heterogeneity increased, which was not the case when using the variability of 5 km resolution cloud top temperature (sigma(CTT)), suggesting that gamma(tau) is a better predictor of tau biases at high theta(0) than sigma(CTT). For a given theta(0), large decreases in r(e) were observed as the cloud top heterogeneity changed from low to high values, although it is possible that physical changes to the clouds associated with cloud heterogeneity variation may account for some of this. However, for a given cloud top heterogeneity we find that the value of theta(0) affects the sign and magnitude of the relative differences between r(e1.6,) r(e2.1) and r(e3.7), which has implications for attempts to retrieve vertical cloud information using the different MODIS bands. The relatively larger decrease in r(e3.7) and the lack of change of r(e1.6) with both theta(0) and cloud top heterogeneity suggest that r(e3.7) is more prone to retrieval biases due to high theta(0) than the other bands. We discuss some possible reasons for this. Our results have important implications for individual MODIS swaths at high theta(0), which may be used for case studies for example. theta(0) values > 65 degrees can occur at latitudes as low as 28 degrees in mid-winter and for higher latitudes the problem will be more acute. Also, Level-3 daily averaged MODIS cloud property data consist of the averages of several overpasses for the high latitudes, which will occur at a range of theta(0) values. Thus, some biased data are likely to be included. It is also likely that some of the theta(0) effects described here would apply to tau and r(e) retrievals from satellite instruments that use visible light at similar wavelengths along with forward retrieval models that assume plane parallel clouds, such as the GOES imagers, SEVIRI, etc.				Wood, Robert/A-2989-2008	Wood, Robert/0000-0002-1401-3828												1680-7316	1680-7324					2014	14	14					7291	7321		10.5194/acp-14-7291-2014								WOS:000339934900011

Climatology of stratocumulus cloud morphologies: microphysical properties and radiative effects	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												An artificial neural network cloud classification scheme is combined with A-train observations to characterize the physical properties and radiative effects of marine low clouds based on their morphology and type of mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) on a global scale. The cloud morphological categories are (i) organized closed MCC, (ii) organized open MCC and (iii) cellular but disorganized MCC. Global distributions of the frequency of occurrence of MCC types show clear regional signatures. Organized closed and open MCCs are most frequently found in subtropical regions and in midlatitude storm tracks of both hemispheres. Cellular but disorganized MCC are the predominant type of marine low clouds in regions with warmer sea surface temperature such as in the tropics and trade wind zones. All MCC types exhibit a pronounced seasonal cycle. The physical properties of MCCs such as cloud fraction, radar reflectivity, drizzle rates and cloud top heights as well as the radiative effects of MCCs are found highly variable and a function of the type of MCC. On a global scale, the cloud fraction is largest for closed MCC with mean cloud fractions of about 90 %, whereas cloud fractions of open and cellular but disorganized MCC are only about 51% and 40 %, respectively. Probability density functions (PDFs) of cloud fractions are heavily skewed and exhibit modest regional variability. PDFs of column maximum radar reflectivities and inferred cloud base drizzle rates indicate fundamental differences in the cloud and precipitation characteristics of different MCC types. Similarly, the radiative effects of MCCs differ substantially from each other in terms of shortwave reflectance and transmissivity. These differences highlight the importance of low-cloud morphologies and their associated cloudiness on the shortwave cloud forcing.

Assessment of SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MERIS ocean colour products in the South China Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) remote-sensing radiometric and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration products for the South China Sea (SCS) from October 2003 to May 2010 were assessed using in situ data. A strict spatiotemporal match-up method was used to minimize the temporal variability effects of atmosphere and seawater around the measurement site. A comparison of the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) of the three sensors with in situ values from the open waters of the SCS showed that the mean absolute percentage difference varied from 13% to 55% in the 412-560 nm spectral range. Generally, the MERIS radiometric products exhibited higher typical uncertainties and bias than the SeaWiFS and MODIS products. The R-rs(443) to R-rs(555/551/560) band ratios of the satellite data were in good agreement with in situ observations for these sensors. The SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MERIS chl-a products overestimated in situ values by 74%, 42%, and 120%, respectively. MODIS retrieval accuracy was better than those of the other sensors, with MERIS performing the worst. When the match-up criteria were relaxed, the assessment results degraded systematically. Therefore, strict spatiotemporal match-up is recommended to minimize the possible influences of small-scale variation in geophysical properties around the measurement site. Coastal and open-sea areas in the SCS should be assessed separately because their biooptical properties are different and the results suggest different atmospheric correction problems.

J	He, MX; Hu, LB; Hu, CM				He, Ming-Xia; Hu, Lianbo; Hu, Chuanmin			Harbour dredging and fish mortality in an aquaculture zone: assessment of changes in suspended particulate matter using multi-sensor remote-sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The semi-closed Rushan Bay is one of the largest aquaculture bases in North China, with its only navigation channel connecting the Rushan harbour and the Yellow Sea. Recent economic growth with increased import and export demands have stimulated a dredging operation, starting on 26 March 2010, which was paused on 17 June 2010 after numerous reports of mortality of cultured shellfish, such as clam (Ruditapes philippinarum), among other precious marine animals. A lawsuit was filed to settle the dispute between the dredging company and an aquaculture company, yet there was endless debate on whether the mortality was caused by the dredging operations. Here, using multi-sensor remote-sensing data collected by Landsat/ETM+, HJ-1A&1 B/CCD, and Aqua & Terra/MODIS, we addressed the two critical questions of (1) whether there was a significant increase in the suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the aquaculture area during and after the dredging operations; and (2) if the answer is yes, whether such an increase was a direct result of the dredging. After careful selection of the satellite data and algorithms, the results from all three sensors suggested positive answers to both questions. In the 2 km(2) aquaculture zone where significant mortality of cultured clam was reported, SPM derived from all three sensors during the dredging period was found to be at least 20 mg l (1) higher than that during the same period in previous years, far exceeding the 10 mg l (1) threshold value that has been used to gauge water quality degradation.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4383	4398		10.1080/01431161.2014.916446								WOS:000337623200028

The Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands: Inception and retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Antarctic subglacial highlands are where the Antarctic ice sheets first developed and the "pinning points" where retreat phases of the marine-based sectors of the ice sheet are impeded. Due to low ice velocities and limited present-day change in the ice-sheet interior, West Antarctic subglacial highlands have been overlooked for detailed study. These regions have considerable potential, however, for establishing the locations from which the West Antarctic Ice Sheet originated and grew, and its likely response to warming climates. Here, we characterize the subglacial morphology of the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands, West Antarctica, from ground-based and aerogeophysical radio-echo sounding (RES) surveys and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Mosaic of Antarctica. We document well-preserved classic landforms associated with restricted, dynamic, marine-proximal alpine glaciation, with hanging tributary valleys feeding a significant overdeepened trough (the Ellsworth Trough) cut by valley (tidewater) glaciers. Fjord-mouth threshold bars down-ice of two overdeepenings define both the northwest and southeast termini of paleo-outlet glaciers, which cut and occupied the Ellsworth Trough. Satellite imagery reveals numerous other glaciated valleys, terminating at the edge of deep former marine basins (e. g., Bentley Subglacial Trench), throughout the Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands. These geomorphic data can be used to reconstruct the glaciology of the ice masses that formed the proto-West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The landscape predates the present ice sheet and was formed by a small dynamic ice field(s), similar to those of the present-day Antarctic Peninsula, at times when the marine sections of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were absent. The Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands represent a major seeding center of the paleo-West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and its margins represent the pinning point at which future retreat of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet would be arrested.

Interannual Variation in Phytoplankton Primary Production at A Global Scale	REMOTE SENSING												We used the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM) combined with remote sensing data via assimilation to evaluate the contribution of four phytoplankton groups to the total primary production. First, we assessed the contribution of each phytoplankton groups to the total primary production at a global scale for the period 1998-2011. Globally, diatoms contributed the most to the total phytoplankton production (approximate to 50%, the equivalent of approximate to 20 PgCy(-1)). Coccolithophores and chlorophytes each contributed approximate to 20% (approximate to 7 PgCy(-1)) of the total primary production and cyanobacteria represented about 10% (approximate to 4 PgCy(-1)) of the total primary production. Primary production by diatoms was highest in the high latitudes (>40 degrees) and in major upwelling systems (Equatorial Pacific and Benguela system). We then assessed interannual variability of this group-specific primary production over the period 1998-2011. Globally the annual relative contribution of each phytoplankton groups to the total primary production varied by maximum 4% (1-2 PgCy(-1)). We assessed the effects of climate variability on group-specific primary production using global (i.e., Multivariate El Nino Index, MEI) and regional climate indices (e.g., Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)). Most interannual variability occurred in the Equatorial Pacific and was associated with climate variability as indicated by significant correlation (p < 0.05) between the MEI and the group-specific primary production from all groups except coccolithophores. In the Atlantic, climate variability as indicated by NAO was significantly correlated to the primary production of 2 out of the 4 groups in the North Central Atlantic (diatoms/cyanobacteria) and in the North Atlantic (chlorophytes and coccolithophores). We found that climate variability as indicated by SAM had only a limited effect on group-specific primary production in the Southern Ocean. These results provide a modeling and data assimilation perspective to phytoplankton partitioning of primary production and contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of the carbon cycle in the oceans at a global scale.

Injection heights of springtime biomass-burning plumes over peninsular Southeast Asia and their impacts on long-range pollutant transport	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We analyzed observations from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) to determine the injection heights of biomass-burning smoke plumes over peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA, here defined as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar) in the spring, with the goal of evaluating the impacts on long-range pollutant transport. We retrieved the heights of 22 000 MISR smoke pixels from 607 smoke plumes over PSEA during February to April of the years 2001-2010. Forty-five percent of the analyzed smoke pixels were above the local mean boundary layer (1 km) at MISR overpass time (10:30 a.m. local time). We used the GEOS-Chem model to simulate the transport of PSEA biomass-burning pollutants in March 2001. On a monthly mean basis, we found that the direct injection of 40% of the PSEA biomass-burning emissions had little impact on the long-range transport of CO to downwind regions, compared to a control simulation where all biomass-burning emissions were released in the boundary layer. This was because CO at the surface over PSEA was efficiently lifted into the free troposphere by deep convection associated with synoptic-scale weather systems. For pollutants with lifetimes shorter than the synoptic timescale, such as black carbon aerosol (BC), their long-range transport was much more sensitive to the initial plume injection height. The direct injection of NOx from PSEA biomass burning into the free troposphere drove increased formation and transport of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), which in turn led to a small increase in ozone over downwind southern China and the northwestern Pacific. The Pacific subtropical high transported BC emitted from PSEA biomass burning to the marine boundary layer over the tropical northwestern Pacific. We compared our model results to aircraft measurements over the northwestern Pacific during the TRACE-P campaign (March 2001). The direct injection of 40% of the PSEA biomass-burning pollutants into the free troposphere in the model led to a more pronounced BC peak at 3 km over the northwestern Pacific. Our analysis highlights the point that the injection heights of smoke plumes presents great uncertainty over the interpretation of BC measurements downwind of biomass-burning regions.

Atmospheric parameters in a subtropical cloud regime transition derived by AIRS and MODIS: observed statistical variability compared to ERA-Interim	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Cloud occurrence, microphysical and optical properties, and atmospheric profiles within a subtropical cloud regime transition in the northeastern Pacific Ocean are obtained from a synergistic combination of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The observed cloud parameters and atmospheric thermodynamic profile retrievals are binned by cloud type and analyzed based on their probability density functions (PDFs). Comparison of the PDFs to data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting reanalysis (ERA-Interim) shows a strong difference in the occurrence of the different cloud types compared to clear sky. An increasing non-Gaussian behavior is observed in cloud optical thickness (tau(c)), effective radius (r(e)) and cloud-top temperature (T-c) distributions from stratocumulus to trade cumulus, while decreasing values of lowertropospheric stability are seen. However, variations in the mean, width and shape of the distributions are found. The AIRS potential temperature (theta) and water vapor (q) profiles in the presence of varying marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud types show overall similarities to the ERA-Interim in the mean profiles, but differences arise in the higher moments at some altitudes. The differences between the PDFs from AIRS+MODIS and ERA-Interim make it possible to pinpoint systematic errors in both systems and help to understand joint PDFs of cloud properties and coincident thermodynamic profiles from satellite observations.

High-resolution (375 m) cloud microstructure as seen from the NPP/VIIRS satellite imager	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), onboard the Suomi NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite, has an improved resolution of 750m with respect to the 1000m of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer for the channels that allow retrieving cloud microphysical parameters such as cloud drop effective radius (r(e)). VIIRS also has an imager with five channels of double resolution of 375 m, which was not designed for retrieving cloud products. A methodology for a high-resolution retrieval of r(e) and microphysical presentation of the cloud field based on the VIIRS imager was developed and evaluated with respect to MODIS in this study. The tripled microphysical resolution with respect to MODIS allows obtaining new insights for cloud-aerosol interactions, especially at the smallest cloud scales, because the VIIRS imager can resolve the small convective elements that are sub-pixel for MODIS cloud products. Examples are given for new insights into ship tracks in marine stratocumulus, pollution tracks from point and diffused sources in stratocumulus and cumulus clouds over land, deep tropical convection in pristine air mass over ocean and land, tropical clouds that develop in smoke from forest fires and in heavy pollution haze over densely populated regions in southeastern Asia, and for pyrocumulonimbus clouds. It is found that the VIIRS imager provides more robust physical interpretation and refined information for cloud and aerosol microphysics as compared to MODIS, especially in the initial stage of cloud formation. VIIRS is found to identify significantly more fully cloudy pixels when small boundary layer convective elements are present. This, in turn, al-lows for a better quantification of cloud-aerosol interactions and impacts on precipitation-forming processes.

J	Diaz-Ochoa, JA; Pantoja, S				Diaz-Ochoa, Javier A.; Pantoja, Silvio			Solid phase phosphorus species and preservation of fish remains in marine sediments of areas of high primary productivity and oxygen seasonality (36 degrees S, central South Chile)	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The main input of phosphorus to the ocean is associated with river runoff, while this element leaves the marine system via burial in the sediments. Solid phase P accumulation is a function of bottom water and surface sediment oxygenation. Theory predicts that suboxic/anoxic sediments act as a source of phosphate, which is released from organic matter and iron oxides, while authigenic precipitation and biogenic apatite preservation are both favored in a phosphate saturated environment. In this paper, we present the results of solid phase phosphorus speciation in sediments collected in central south Chile on the continental shelf off Concepcion. This area is characterized by very high biological productivity and the formation of a strong oxygen minimum zone during summer. We found that total solid phase P was dominated by inorganic phases (60%), mostly comprised by iron-bound P and biogenic apatite P. As expected, biogenic apatite P and iron-bound P were negatively correlated and reflected bottom water oxygen fluctuations during the period analyzed (February September 2009). The biogenic apatite (fish debris) preservation potential was negatively correlated with bottom water dissolved oxygen and its burial averaged 16% of water column's fish production estimated with a trophic dynamic-model that included SeaWIFS-MODIS satellite primary productivity estimations. In spite of intrusions of oxygen in the water column evidenced by the thinning of the oxygen minimum layer in autumn-winter, bottom waters remained suboxic during the studied period and appear to have favored biogenic apatite P (P-fish) preservation. This finding supports the potential of P-fish as a paleotracer for fish abundance in areas previously not considered because of the lack of laminated sediments.																	0016-7002	1880-5973					2014	48	1					63	71		10.2343/geochemj.2.0286								WOS:000333138200006

For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (Res) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS Res anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002-2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed Res anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM Res anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	De Carolis, G; Adamo, M; Pasquariello, G				De Carolis, Giacomo; Adamo, Maria; Pasquariello, Guido			On the Estimation of Thickness of Marine Oil Slicks From Sun-Glittered, Near-Infrared MERIS and MODIS Imagery: The Lebanon Oil Spill Case Study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The detection of marine oil slicks using satellite sun-glittered optical imagery has been recently assessed. As the nature of the imaging mechanism involves the altered features of the wind-roughened oil-covered sea surface, it is expected that the radiation reflected from the oil-water system carries information about the physical properties of the floating oil layer. In this paper, we report an investigation on the capability to retrieve the average thickness of thin marine oil slicks by using the sun-glittered component of the solar radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) bands of MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Instrument (MERIS) and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The developed procedure exploits the Cox and Munk model to compute sun glint reflectance at the sea surface level for both clean and oil polluted sea surface as well. It is assumed that the Fresnel reflection coefficient of the oil-water system carries the relevant optical dependence on oil layer thickness and oil type. The expected oil-water system reflectance is computed by taking into account the non-uniform spatial distribution of the oil volume. This is achieved by considering a pdf of oil thicknesses that matches the observations on controlled oil slicks already reported in the scientific literature. MERIS and MODIS images gathered during the Lebanon oil spill occurred on July and August 2006 were selected as case study. When available, co-located SAR imagery was also considered to corroborate NIR-detected oil slicks.				pasquariello, guido/G-9191-2011	pasquariello, guido/0000-0001-8622-2058; ADAMO, MARIA/0000-0002-6042-8565												0196-2892	1558-0644				JAN	2014	52	1	2				559	573		10.1109/TGRS.2013.2242476								WOS:000328939500015

Comparison of aerosol optical depth between CALIOP and MODIS-Aqua for CALIOP aerosol subtypes over the ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua AOD using Level 2 products of both instruments. Such comparisons have been performed for five different aerosol subtypes classified by CALIOP algorithm, namely clean marine, dust, polluted dust, polluted continental, and biomass burning, over the ocean from June 2006 to December 2010. MODIS AOD at 550nm (0.1110.079) for the collocated data pairs is about 63% higher than CALIOP AOD at 532nm (0.0680.073). For clean marine, MODIS AOD (0.1100.064) is almost twice the CALIOP AOD (0.0560.038), and the difference between the AOD values has a strong latitude dependence likely related to the surface wind speed over the ocean. The difference in AOD for dust (13%) is observed to be the lowest among the five aerosol types under consideration, but it shows a slight regional variation. The discrepancy of AOD for dust also shows strong dependency on the layer mean of the particulate depolarization ratio. CALIOP AOD is higher than MODIS AOD for both polluted dust and polluted continental by 15% and 29%, respectively, for most of the ocean. One of the possible reasons for the difference is the misclassification of clean marine (or marine+dust) as polluted dust and polluted continental in the CALIOP algorithm. For biomass burning, uncertainty in the layer base altitude is thought to be one of the main reasons for the lower value of CALIOP AOD.

A Coastal Seawater Temperature Dataset for Biogeographical Studies: Large Biases between In Situ and Remotely-Sensed Data Sets around the Coast of South Africa	PLOS ONE												Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6 degrees C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.

Illuminating the Capabilities of the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band	REMOTE SENSING												Daytime measurements of reflected sunlight in the visible spectrum have been a staple of Earth-viewing radiometers since the advent of the environmental satellite platform. At night, these same optical-spectrum sensors have traditionally been limited to thermal infrared emission, which contains relatively poor information content for many important weather and climate parameters. These deficiencies have limited our ability to characterize the full diurnal behavior and processes of parameters relevant to improved monitoring, understanding and modeling of weather and climate processes. Visible-spectrum light information does exist during the nighttime hours, originating from a wide variety of sources, but its detection requires specialized technology. Such measurements have existed, in a limited way, on USA Department of Defense satellites, but the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite, which carries a new Day/Night Band (DNB) radiometer, offers the first quantitative measurements of nocturnal visible and near-infrared light. Here, we demonstrate the expanded potential for nocturnal low-light visible applications enabled by the DNB. Via a combination of terrestrial and extraterrestrial light sources, such observations are always available-expanding many current existing applications while enabling entirely new capabilities. These novel low-light measurements open doors to a wealth of new interdisciplinary research topics while lighting a pathway toward the optimized design of follow-on satellite based low light visible sensors.

The results reveal the average relationship of adult pelagic redfish to their physical habitat from 100 to 800 m depth: the most preferred latitude, longitude, depth, temperature and salinity for redfish are approximately 58 degrees N, 41 degrees W, 557 m, 4.5 degrees C and 34.87, respectively. The redfish habitat corresponds in a temperature-salinity (TS) diagram to a mixing triangle between East Greenland Current Water (EGCW), Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Irminger Current Water (ICW). The geographical centre of mass of the redfish distribution (as revealed by acoustic fish density) indicates displacements from year to year. Changes in hydrographic conditions were investigated in detail for possible reasons for these displacements. Empirical Orthogonal Analysis reveals that maximum variations of water mass volume on an interannual time-scale in the study region correspond to ICW and LSW changes, while EGCW remains comparatively stable. Indices of redfish geographical centroid, LSW volume, ICW temperature and Subpolar Gyre (SPG) intensity suggest that the geographical redfish displacements are closely related to interannual changes of ICW modulated by the SPG intensity with a lag of 1 or 2 years. In comparison, LSW seems to have no impact on the redfish distribution at the studied depth range. The time lag between ICW and redfish displacements indicates an indirect influence of temperature on redfish. Hence, changes of chlorophyll-a (from satellite imagery), as a proxy for primary production, were used in a first approach to study the role of food availability. The analysis is based on acoustic and trawl data from nine expeditions coordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), around 71,000 hydrographic stations from the Integrated Climate Data Center, World Ocean Database 2009 and Coriolis (among others), 60 years of circulation data from the Max-Planck Institute Ocean Model and 14 years of satellite chlorophyll-a from SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS.

The eStation, an Earth Observation processing service in support to ecological monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The eStation is a collecting and processing system designed to automatically deal with the reception, processing, analysis and dissemination of key environmental parameters derived from remotely sensed data. Developed mainly at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the eStation has been distributed to 47 sub-Saharan countries in the frame of the AMESD (African Monitoring of Environment for Sustainable Development) project to provide local institutions with the capacity to easily access a large range of remote sensing products on vegetation, precipitation, fires and oceans. These products, derived from the processing of images coming from various instruments including SPOT-Vegetation, MSG-SEVIRI and MODIS are developed to allow end-users to make local and regional assessments of the state of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The products, dispatched to the users through the EUMETSAT data broadcasting system (EUMETCast) or provided by other Earth Observation (EO) data agencies (e.g. NASA), are further processed by the eStation to allow end-users to generate their own environmental, whether terrestrial or marine, assessments and reports. Initially designed as a stand-alone system using an open source development framework, the eStation has recently been further developed as a web processing service to allow a broader range of end-users to access the data and services over the Internet. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce the readers to the eStation and its products, to share the lessons learnt in deploying these services as well as to discuss its more recent use in chained environmental web based modeling services.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH; Jiang, LD				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua; Jiang, Lide			Tidal effects on ecosystem variability in the Chesapeake Bay from MODIS-Aqua	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Eight-year ocean color observations between 2002 and 2009 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the satellite Aqua are used to quantitatively assess the tidal effects on variability of ocean's optical, biological, and biogeochemical properties in the Chesapeake Bay. We demonstrate that tidal variation in the lower Chesapeake Bay is one of the important ocean processes that drive significant changes of the ocean's optical and biogeochemical properties. Normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nL(w)(lambda)), water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), and total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration show significant tidal variations in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Indeed, in the lower Bay region, K-d(490) increases from 0.9 m(-1) under low tidal current conditions at 0.10-0.15 m/s to 1.35 m(-1) under high tidal current conditions at 0.45-0.50 m/s, while chlorophyll-a concentration in the lower Bay region decreases slightly with an increase of the tidal current. Tide-driven variability in K-d(490) and TSS in the lower Bay is similar to and slightly larger than the seasonal variability in the region. On the other hand, different from the variability in the lower Bay, the tidal effects on the ecosystem are small and negligible in the middle and a large part of upper Chesapeake Bay regions.

J	Zhang, SP; Yi, L				Zhang, Suping; Yi, Li			A Comprehensive Dynamic Threshold Algorithm for Daytime Sea Fog Retrieval over the Chinese Adjacent Seas	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												Sea fog influences human activities over oceans. It is somewhat difficult to separate sea fog from marine boundary stratus (low stratus and stratocumulus) by satellites due to their microphysical similarities and shared spectral features. For the purpose of improving sea fog detection over the Chinese adjacent seas where fog is common during the spring-summer seasons, the vertical structures of fog and stratus were analyzed using ground-based soundings, resulting in the observation of very explicit discrepancies between them, in terms of TAT - SST (TAT, the temperature at tops of fog or stratus; SST, the sea surface temperature). Based on these discrepancies and on previous related studies, we suggest a comprehensive dynamic threshold algorithm. The method combines real-time brightness temperature from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer channel 31 (similar to 11 mu m) with climatological monthly mean SSTs to produce a threshold that is monthly-dependent. The retrieved results are generally consistent with the observations from meteorological stations near the coast, on islands and from ships, and the scores of validation by conventional methods are promising. The distribution patterns of the retrieved sea fog frequency in May and June from 2006 to 2010 are both compatible with that from ship-based observations and exhibit more details that are consistent with our understanding of sea fog characteristics. This study is helpful for marine weather service and the improvement of models for sea fog forecasting.																	0033-4553	1420-9136				NOV	2013	170	11					1931	1944		10.1007/s00024-013-0641-6								WOS:000326093600016

Relationship between methanesulfonate (MS-) in atmospheric particulate and remotely sensed phytoplankton activity in oligo-mesotrophic central Mediterranean Sea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The coupling between oceanic and atmospheric sulfur cycles is fundamental for the understanding of the role of sulfate particles as potential climate regulators. We discuss existing relationships among methanesulfonate (MS- - one of the end products of oxidation of biogenic dimethylsulfide - DMS) in the atmospheric particulate, phytoplankton biomass, and remotely-sensed activity in the central Mediterranean. The MS- concentration in the aerosol particles is based on PM10 sampling (from 2005 to 2008) of atmospheric aerosols at the island of Lampedusa (35.5 degrees N, 12.6 degrees E) in the central Mediterranean Sea. The marine primary production in the sea sector surrounding the sampling site is obtained by using Ocean Color remote sensed data (SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua). In particular, primary production is calculated using a bio-optical model of sea reflectance and a Wavelength-Depth-Resolved Model (WDRM), fed by elaborated satellite data (chlorophyll concentration in the euphotic layer - Chl, sea surface temperature) and daily solar surface irradiance measurements. The multi-year evolution of MS- atmospheric concentration shows a well-defined seasonal cycle with a summer maximum, corresponding to the annual peak of solar radiation and a minimum of phytoplankton biomass (expressed as Chl). Statistically significant linear relationships between monthly means of atmospheric MS- and both the phytoplankton productivity index P-B (r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.001) and the solar radiation dose (SRD; r(2) = 0.87, p < 0.001) in the upper mixed layer of the sea around Lampedusa are found. These correlations are mainly driven by the common seasonal pattern and suggest that DMS production in the marine surface layer is mainly related to the phytoplankton physiology. High values of P-B are also the expression of stressed cells. The main stress factors in Mediterranean Sea during summer are high irradiance and shallow depth of the upper mixed layer, which lead to enhanced DMS emissions and higher MS- amounts in the atmosphere. During spring 2005 high biomass and primary productivity values are observed in February and April, just one month before the peaks of atmospheric MS- (March and May). The occurrence of anomalously high values at this time is hypothesized to be related to the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and to related oceanic and atmospheric processes. The possible role of the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton assemblages is also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Following radiative transfer theory, K-d is a function of angular distribution of incident light and water's absorption and backscattering coefficients. Because these optical products are now generated routinely from satellite measurements, it is logical to evolve the empirical K-d to a semianalytical K-d that is not only spectrally flexible, but also the sun-angle effect is accounted for explicitly. Here, the semianalytical model developed in Lee et al. (2005b) is revised to account for the shift of phase function between molecular and particulate scattering from the short to long wavelengths. Further, using field data collected independently from oligotrophic ocean to coastal waters covering >99% of the K-d range for the global oceans, the semianalytically derived K-d was evaluated and found to agree with measured data within approximate to 7-26%. The updated processing system was applied to MODIS measurements to reveal the penetration of UVA-visible radiation in the global oceans, where an empirical procedure to correct Raman effect was also included. The results indicated that the penetration of the blue-green radiation for most oceanic waters is approximate to 30-40% deeper than the commonly used euphotic zone depth; and confirmed that at a depth of 50-70 m there is still approximate to 10% of the surface UVA radiation (at 360 nm) in most oligotrophic waters. The results suggest a necessity to modify or expand the light attenuation product from satellite ocean-color measurements in order to be more applicable for studies of ocean physics and biogeochemistry.

W.; Raitsos, Dionysios E.; Pradhan, Yaswant; Hoteit, Ibrahim			Comparison of chlorophyll in the Red Sea derived from MODIS-Aqua and in vivo fluorescence	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Red Sea is a unique marine environment but relatively unexplored. The only available long-term biological dataset at large spatial and temporal scales is remotely-sensed chlorophyll observations (an index of phytoplankton biomass) derived using satellite measurements of ocean colour. Yet such observations have rarely been compared with in situ data in the Red Sea. In this paper, satellite chlorophyll estimates in the Red Sea from the MODIS instrument onboard the Aqua satellite are compared with three recent cruises of in vivo fluorometric chlorophyll measurements taken in October 2008, March 2010 and September to October 2011. The performance of the standard NASA chlorophyll algorithm, and that of a new band-difference algorithm, is found to be comparable with other oligotrophic regions in the global ocean, supporting the use of satellite ocean colour in the Red Sea. However, given the unique environmental conditions of the study area, regional algorithms are likely to fare better and this is demonstrated through a simple adjustment to the band-difference algorithm.

The inversion algorithm was applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiances (at the wavelengths of 0.865, 1.24, 1.6, and 2.1 mu m), and the results were validated against in situ airborne measurements of cloud vertical profiles of the effective radius. We found that the results were more reliable for the cases with large vertical gradients of droplet sizes. The new retrieval method, based on the optimal estimation approach, enabled a higher accuracy of the liquid water path estimate than that produced with the standard MODIS vertically homogeneous algorithm.

A new approach to retrieve cloud base height of marine boundary layer clouds	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A novel approach for estimating marine boundary layer cloud base height (CBH) is proposed based on calculated boundary layer lapse rates, collocated cloud top height (CTH), cloud top, and ocean surface temperatures from the A-Train satellite constellation. The method takes advantage of the assumption that decreases of temperature within and below water clouds may follow the different constant apparent lapse rates in the same region, respectively. The CBHs derived from the new method compare well with the coincident CBH product from the active sensors of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and CloudSat. The correlation coefficient, the mean difference, and the standard deviation are 0.79 (0.54), 0.02 km (0.03 km), and 0.35 km (0.54 km), respectively, when CTH is derived from CALIPSO data (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer retrieval). Besides the relatively small bias, the most important advantage of this method compared to previous CBH retrieval techniques is that it is independent of boundary layer cloud types, optical thickness, and illumination.

Previous theoretical and numerical modeling studies have shown that the persistence or breakup of marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds may be sensitive to the CTEI parameter. Collocated thermodynamic profile and cloud observations obtained from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are used to quantify the relationship between the CTEI parameter and the cloud-topped MBL transition from stratocumulus to trade cumulus in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Results derived from AIRS and MODIS are compared with numerical results from the UCLA large eddy simulation (LES) model for both well-mixed and decoupled MBLs. The satellite and model results both demonstrate a clear correlation between the CTEI parameter and MBL cloud fraction. Despite fundamental differences between LES steady state results and the instantaneous snapshot type of observations from satellites, significant correlations for both the instantaneous pixel-scale observations and the long-term averaged spatial patterns between the CTEI parameter and MBL cloud fraction are found from the satellite observations and are consistent with LES results. This suggests the potential of using AIRS and MODIS to quantify global and temporal characteristics of the cloud-topped MBL transition.

In previous work we used Hydrolight5 simulations of Rrs with widely varying globally representative constituent physical parameters as a training basis to develop a neural network algorithm, which, using the Rrs at the MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667 nm) as input, retrieves the in-water particulate backscattering (b(bp)), phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-phytoplankton (a(dg)) absorption coefficients at 443 nm. In this work, using the same dataset, we develop a NN which takes these same Rrs as input, and produces an output which is used to separate the non-phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(dg)) at 443 nm into dissolved (a(g)) and particulate (a(dm)) components. We then apply this synthetically trained algorithm to the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) Rrs to retrieve IOP at 443 nm, with the measured NOMAD and retrieved IOP values showing good agreement. These retrieved MP along with their related Rrs values are then used to train an additional NN that produces chlorophyll concentration [Chl] as output. It is shown that these [Chl] values are retrieved more accurately when compared with ones retrieved with a similar approach which does not use IOP as input, as well as with those derived using the MODIS OC3 algorithm.

MODIS-derived spatiotemporal water clarity patterns in optically shallow Florida Keys waters: A new approach to remove bottom contamination	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Retrievals of water quality parameters from satellite measurements over optically shallow waters have been problematic due to bottom contamination of the signals. As a result, large errors are associated with derived water column properties. These deficiencies greatly reduce the ability to use satellites to assess the shallow water environments around coral reefs and seagrass beds. Here, a modified version of an existing algorithm is used to derive multispectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) from MODIS/Aqua measurements over optically shallow waters in the Florida Keys. Results were validated against concurrent in situ data (K-d(488) from 0.02 to 0.20 m(-1), N = 22, R-2 = 0.68, Mean Ratio = 0.93, unbiased RMS = 31%), and showed significant improvement over current products when compared to the same in situ data (N = 13, R-2 = 037, Mean Ratio = 1.61, unbiased RMS = 50%). The modified algorithm was then applied to time series of MODIS/Aqua data over the Florida Keys (in particular, the Florida Keys Reef Tract), whereby spatial and temporal patterns of water clarity between 2002 and 2011 were elucidated. Climatologies, time series, anomaly images, and empirical orthogonal function analysis showed primarily nearshore-offshore gradients in water clarity and its variability, with peaks in both at the major channels draining Florida Bay. ANOVA revealed significant differences in K-d(488) according to distance from shore and geographic region. Excluding the Dry Tortugas, which had the lowest climatological K-d(488), water was clearest at the northern extent of the Reef Tract, and K-d(488) significantly decreased sequentially for every region along the tract. Tests over other shallow-water tropical waters such as the Belize Barrier Reef also suggested general applicability of the algorithm. As water clarity and light availability on the ocean bottom are key environmental parameters in determining the health of shallow-water plants and animals, the validated new products provide unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring of coral reef and seagrass health, and could further assist ongoing regional zoning efforts.

J	Lebsock, M; Morrison, H; Gettelman, A				Lebsock, Matthew; Morrison, Hugh; Gettelman, Andrew			Microphysical implications of cloud-precipitation covariance derived from satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Covariance between cloud and precipitation water in shallow marine boundary layer clouds is assessed using collocated satellite observations from CloudSat and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) at spatial scales typical of global models. An analytic construct is presented, which suggests that global models that do not take subgrid scale cloud-precipitation covariance into account in their microphysical parameterizations may significantly underestimate grid mean microphysical process rates in warm clouds. The proposed framework indicates a mean bias in autoconversion rates of 129% when subgrid scale cloud water variability is neglected and bias in accretion rates of 60% when subgrid cloud-precipitation covariability is neglected at a model grid resolution of 141km. The bias in accretion rate is dependent on the significant correlation () found between cloud and precipitation, which in the global mean is found to be =0.44. The regional distribution of the process rate biases is largely governed by the spatial pattern of cloud water variance. Specific areas of low cloud water variance are found in the subtropical eastern ocean basins and the high latitudes, whereas much of the tropics display relatively larger cloud water variance. These regional distinctions in cloud water variance are associated with commensurate regionality in the process rate biases. The magnitude of the bias has a scale dependence that is governed by the spatial scaling behavior of the cloud and precipitation variances, which follow a power law scaling with exponent of 2/3 at scales below about 10km and decreasing exponent above this length scale. While the parametric framework reduces biases in the accretion rate estimated from the grid-mean values of cloud and precipitation water, it is shown that it still undercorrects the accretion rate because it neglects the fact that the precipitation fractional area is less than the cloud fractional area and is preferentially colocated with the highest cloud water concentrations. These results imply that (1) predicting the appropriate balance of autoconversion to accretion in global models requires not only the subgrid scale cloud water variability but also the subgrid scale covariability of cloud and precipitation water and (2) the ability of a global model to calculate the correct regional variation in process rates depends crucially on the fidelity of that model to predict or diagnose the spatial distribution of the variance in cloud water.																	2169-897X					JUN 27	2013	118	12					6521	6533		10.1002/jgrd.50347								WOS:000322129600045

A satellite perspective on cloud water to rain water conversion rates and relationships with environmental conditions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A two-year satellite remote sensing data set from the NASA A-Train is used to examine conversion rates of cloud water to rain water for warm maritime clouds with different ranges of mean cloud-layer radar reflectivity and rain rate. Recent work has demonstrated the utility of a novel procedure that relies on the differing sensitivities of passive MODIS measurements and active CloudSat radar measurements to estimate warm cloud conversion rates and associated time scales. That work is extended here to examine regional differences in conversion rates, including sensitivity to environmental parameters such as atmospheric stability and the presence of different aerosol types defined based on values of aerosol optical depth, fine mode fraction, and angstrom ngstrom Exponent. Among eight subregions examined, the tropical Pacific Ocean is characterized by the highest average conversion rate while subtropical stratocumulus cloud regions (far northeastern Pacific Ocean, far southeastern Pacific Ocean, Western Africa coastal region) exhibit the lowest rates. Conversion rates are generally higher at reduced values of lower tropospheric static stability (LTSS). When examining data in two selected ranges for LTSS, higher conversion rates are coincident with higher LWP and factors covarying or rooted in the presence of aerosol types exhibiting lower aerosol index values.

Satellite observations and modeling of oil spill trajectories in the Bohai Sea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												On June 4 and 17, 2011, separate oil spill accidents occurred at two oil platforms in the Bohai Sea, China. The oil spills were subsequently observed on different types of satellite images including SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Chinese HJ-1-B CCD and NASA MODIS. To illustrate the fate of the oil spills, we performed two numerical simulations to simulate the trajectories of the oil spills with the GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment) model. For the first time, we drive the GNOME with currents obtained from an operational ocean model (NCOM, Navy Coastal Ocean Model) and surface winds from operational scatterometer measurements (ASCAT, the Advanced Scatterometer). Both data sets are freely and openly available. The initial oil spill location inputs to the model are based on the detected oil spill locations from the SAR images acquired on June 11 and 14. Three oil slicks are tracked simultaneously and our results show good agreement between model simulations and subsequent satellite observations in the semi-enclosed shallow sea. Moreover, GNOME simulation shows that the number of 'splots', which denotes the extent of spilled oil, is a vital factor for GNOME running stability when the number is less than 500. Therefore, oil spill area information obtained from satellite sensors, especially SAR, is an important factor for setting up the initial model conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

W.; Stenchikov, Georgiy; Hoteit, Ibrahim			Remote Sensing the Phytoplankton Seasonal Succession of the Red Sea	PLOS ONE												The Red Sea holds one of the most diverse marine ecosystems, primarily due to coral reefs. However, knowledge on large-scale phytoplankton dynamics is limited. Analysis of a 10-year high resolution Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) dataset, along with remotely-sensed sea surface temperature and wind, provided a detailed description of the spatiotemporal seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass in the Red Sea. Based on MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, four distinct Red Sea provinces and seasons are suggested, covering the major patterns of surface phytoplankton production. The Red Sea Chl-a depicts a distinct seasonality with maximum concentrations seen during the winter time (attributed to vertical mixing in the north and wind-induced horizontal intrusion of nutrient-rich water in the south), and minimum concentrations during the summer (associated with strong seasonal stratification). The initiation of the seasonal succession occurs in autumn and lasts until early spring. However, weekly Chl-a seasonal succession data revealed that during the month of June, consistent anti-cyclonic eddies transfer nutrients and/or Chl-a to the open waters of the central Red Sea. This phenomenon occurs during the stratified nutrient depleted season, and thus could provide an important source of nutrients to the open waters. Remotely-sensed synoptic observations highlight that Chl-a does not increase regularly from north to south as previously thought. The Northern part of the Central Red Sea province appears to be the most oligotrophic area (opposed to southern and northern domains). This is likely due to the absence of strong mixing, which is apparent at the northern end of the Red Sea, and low nutrient intrusion in comparison with the southern end. Although the Red Sea is considered an oligotrophic sea, sporadic blooms occur that reach mesotrophic levels. The water temperature and the prevailing winds control the nutrient concentrations within the euphotic zone and enable the horizontal transportation of nutrients.

A critical step in determining accurate daily averaged flux involves estimating the flux between CERES Terra or Aqua overpass times. CERES employs the CERES-only (CO) and the CERES geostationary (CG) temporal interpolation methods. The CO method assumes that the cloud properties at the time of the CERES observation remain constant and that it only accounts for changes in albedo with solar zenith angle and diurnal land heating, by assuming a shape for unresolved changes in the diurnal cycle. The CG method enhances the CERES data by explicitly accounting for changes in cloud and radiation between CERES observation times using 3-hourly imager data from five geostationary (GEO) satellites. To maintain calibration traceability, GEO radiances are calibrated against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the derived GEO fluxes are normalized to the CERES measurements. While the regional (1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude) monthly-mean difference between the CG and CO methods can exceed 25 W m(-2) over marine stratus and land convection, these regional biases nearly cancel in the global mean. The regional monthly CG shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) flux uncertainty is reduced by 20%, whereas the daily uncertainty is reduced by 50% and 20%, respectively, over the CO method, based on comparisons with 15-min Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) data.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				JUN	2013	30	6					1072	1090		10.1175/JTECH-D-12-00136.1								WOS:000330514900004

Rama			Ship-Borne Measurements of Columnar and Surface Aerosol Loading over the Bay of Bengal during W-ICARB Campaign: Role of Airmass Transport, Latitudinal and Longitudinal Gradients	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												The present study analyzes simultaneous and collocated measurements of spectral columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the variations in total mass concentration of near surface aerosols in the marine atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the winter phase of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB) expedition of December and January 2008/2009 on board the Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV) of Sagar Kanya. High AOD(500) values (> 0.8) are found close to coastal regions in the western and northern BoB due to outflow of aerosols and pollutants from the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). In these regions, the (sic)ngstrom exponent a380-1020 values are also found to be high (similar to 1.2-1.3), indicating relative abundance of accumulation-mode continental aerosols. Low AOD(500) (0.1-0.2) values are observed in central and southern BoB, far away from the mainland. The AOD(500) and total aerosol mass loading increased along with the latitude. The total mass concentration is found to vary between 15 mu g/m3 and 45 mu g/m(3), with higher loadings near the east coast and northern parts of the BoB. NCEP reanalysis of the data with winds at 925 hPa, along with airmass trajectories calculated using the HYSPLIT model, suggest transport of continental aerosols from central and northern India over the BoB at lower heights, and mineral dust aerosol transport from arid regions in the west of India at higher altitudes; while the increase in aerosol loading over eastern BoB was strongly affected by airmasses originating from Southeast Asia. The spatial correlation map between the MODIS and MISR AOD data is analyzed, revealing a strong correlation between the two datasets. The influence of wind speed and continental airmass on AOD is also examined, which provides information on the effects of the adjoining landmass on the marine aerosol field.

J	Meyer, K; Platnick, S; Oreopoulos, L; Lee, DM				Meyer, Kerry; Platnick, Steven; Oreopoulos, Lazaros; Lee, Dongmin			Estimating the direct radiative effect of absorbing aerosols overlying marine boundary layer clouds in the southeast Atlantic using MODIS and CALIOP	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Absorbing aerosols such as smoke strongly absorb solar radiation, particularly at ultraviolet and visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) wavelengths, and their presence above clouds can have considerable implications. It has been previously shown that they have a positive (i.e., warming) direct aerosol radiative effect (DARE) when overlying bright clouds. Additionally, they can cause biased passive instrument satellite retrievals in techniques that rely on VIS/NIR wavelengths for inferring the cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective radius (r(e)) of underlying clouds, which can in turn yield biased above-cloud DARE estimates. Here we investigate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud optical property retrieval biases due to overlying absorbing aerosols observed by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and examine the impact of these biases on above-cloud DARE estimates. The investigation focuses on a region in the southeast Atlantic Ocean during August and September (2006-2011), where smoke from biomass burning in southern Africa overlies persistent marine boundary layer stratocumulus clouds. Adjusting for above-cloud aerosol attenuation yields increases in the regional mean liquid COT (averaged over all ocean-only liquid clouds) by roughly 6%; mean r(e) increases by roughly 2.6%, almost exclusively due to the COT adjustment in the non-orthogonal retrieval space. It is found that these two biases lead to an underestimate of DARE. For liquid cloud Aqua MODIS pixels with CALIOP-observed above-cloud smoke, the regional mean above-cloud radiative forcing efficiency (DARE per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)) at time of observation (near local noon for Aqua overpass) increases from 50.9Wm(-2)AOD(-1) to 65.1Wm(-2)AOD(-1) when using bias-adjusted instead of nonadjusted MODIS cloud retrievals.

Ground/satellite observations and atmospheric modeling of dust storms originating in the high Puna-Altiplano deserts (South America): Implications for the interpretation of paleo-climatic archives	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study provides a detailed description of the sources, transport, dispersion, and deposition of two major dust events originating from the high-altitude subtropical Puna-Altiplano Plateau (15-26 degrees S; 65-69 degrees W) in South America. A long and severe drought provided the right conditions for the onset of both events in July 2009 and 2010. Dust was transported SE and deposited over the Pampas region and was observed to continue to the Atlantic Ocean. Dust monitoring stations located downwind recorded both events, and samples were characterized through chemical and textural analysis. Through a combination of meteorological data and satellite observations (CALIPSO and MODIS detectors), we estimate the emission flux for the 2010 event. This estimate was used to constrain the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) transport model and simulate the dust event. Both satellite imagery and model results agree in the location and extension of the dust cloud. CALIPSO detected dust between similar to 6000 and similar to 8500 m a.s.l., which remained at this height during most of its trajectory. The dust cloud mixed with a strong convective system in the region, and the associated precipitation brought down significant amounts of dust to the ground. Dust particle size analysis for both events indicates that near the sources dust samples show median modes of 12.4-14.1 mu m, similar to modes observed 1300 km away. Chemical composition of sediments from potential dust sources shows distinct signatures within the Puna-Altiplano Plateau, the Puna sector being clearly different from the Altiplano area. In addition, both sources are markedly different from the Patagonian chemical fingerprint. These results have important implications to improve the interpretation of paleo-environmental archives preserved on the Argentine loess, Antarctic ice cores, and Southern Ocean marine sediments.

Seasonal variability of chlorophyll-a and oceanographic conditions in Sabah waters in relation to Asian monsoon-a remote sensing study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study was conducted to investigate the influence of Asian monsoon on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content in Sabah waters and to identify the related oceanographic conditions that caused phytoplankton blooms at the eastern and western coasts of Sabah, Malaysia. A series of remote sensing measurements including surface Chl-a, sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, wind speed, wind stress curl, and Ekman pumping were analyzed to study the oceanographic conditions that lead to large-scale nutrients enrichment in the surface layer. The results showed that the Chl-a content increased at the northwest coast from December to April due to strong northeasterly wind and coastal upwelling in Kota Kinabalu water. The southwest coast (Labuan water) maintained high concentrations throughout the year due to the effect of Padas River discharge during the rainy season and the changing direction of Baram River plume during the northeast monsoon (NEM). However, with the continuous supply of nutrients from the upwelling area, the high Chl-a batches were maintained at the offshore water off Labuan for a longer time during NEM. On the other side, the northeast coast illustrated a high Chl-a in Sandakan water during NEM, whereas the northern tip off Kudat did not show a pronounced change throughout the year. The southeast coast (Tawau water) was highly influenced by the direction of the surface water transport between the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas and the prevailing surface currents. The study demonstrates the presence of seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Sabah waters which will aid in forecasting the possible biological response and could further assist in marine resource managements.

Identifying the affected marine areas and the scale of influence on ecosystems is critical to assess the impacts of degraded water quality and to inform planning for catchment management and marine conservation. Studies using remotely-sensed data have contributed to our understanding of the occurrence and influence of river plumes, and to our ability to assess exposure of marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. However, refinement of plume modeling techniques is required to improve risk assessments. We developed a novel, complementary, approach to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. We used supervised classification of MODIS-Aqua true-color satellite imagery to map the extent of plumes and to qualitatively assess the dispersal of pollutants in plumes. We used the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest coral reef system, to test our approach. We combined frequency of plume occurrence with spatially distributed loads (based on a cost-distance function) to create maps of exposure to suspended sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We then compared annual exposure maps (2007-2011) to assess inter-annual variability in the exposure of coral reefs and seagrass beds to these pollutants. We found this method useful to map plumes and qualitatively assess exposure to land-based pollutants. We observed inter-annual variation in exposure of ecosystems to pollutants in the GBR, stressing the need to incorporate a temporal component into plume exposure/risk models. Our study contributes to our understanding of plume spatial-temporal dynamics of the GBR and offers a method that can also be applied to monitor exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to plumes and explore their ecological influences.

J	Tang, HY; Liu, G; Zhu, JG; Han, Y; Kobayashi, K				Tang, Haoye; Liu, Gang; Zhu, Jianguo; Han, Yong; Kobayashi, Kazuhiko			Seasonal variations in surface ozone as influenced by Asian summer monsoon and biomass burning in agricultural fields of the northern Yangtze River Delta	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Surface ozone (O-3) concentration was measured continuously at an agricultural site of Jiangdu in the northern Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China for the period from March 2007 to December 2011. Extremely high O-3 concentrations ([O-3]) were frequently observed in May and June with the highest hourly mean of 144 ppb. The monthly 7-h mean of [O-3] showed a bimodal pattern in the seasonal change with peaks in June and October. The depression of [O-3] in summer was due mostly to the monsoonal climate, which was adverse to photochemical O-3 generation. Analyses of the wind direction and air mass trajectories showed that pollutants from the industrialized area of YRD were carried by the prevailing wind, causing an increased [O-3] in the spring, whereas, in the summer, frequent incursions of maritime air mass diluted the high [O-3] in the polluted air mass. Furthermore, it was found that extensive open crop residue burning in central eastern China made a significant contribution to the peak [O-3] in June. The increase of [O-3] by the residue burning in June was estimated to be 39% on sunny days and 27% on rainy days. The inter-annual variation of [O-3] showed that [O-3] in June tends to be lower in the years with more maritime air mass incursions, and the lowest [O-3] in June 2008 could be partially attributed to the low frequency of residue burning events. This study has thus demonstrated that the variations in marine air mass incursions as influenced by the monsoonal climate and the open crop residue burning are the major determinants of the seasonal trends in surface [O-3] across the agricultural areas of the northern YRD.

Monitoring estuarine water quality using satellite imagery. The Mondego river estuary (Portugal) as a case study	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Monitoring water bodies is a task not only scientifically relevant but also legally binding in several countries (e.g. Water Framework Directive and the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive). Ecosystem health assessment projects are greatly enhanced by the use of remote sensing technologies. In the present study, a small Portuguese estuary (Mondego river estuary), was used as a case study to assess the feasibility of measuring several key indicators using satellite imagery. The feasibility of using MODIS land/cloud bands to evaluate Secchi Disk Depth (SD) was addressed. The ratio of remote sensing reflectance at 469 and 555 nm was the best predictor for this parameter (R-2 = 0.9678; p < 0.05). Landsat-7 ETM+ was, in turn, used to estimate Chlorophyll-a concentration (OC), Turbidity and Salinity. Reflectance values were compared with concurrent in situ data recorded by an automatic sampling buoy. ETM-F data was also used to develop a local water color index, which takes advantage of the relative differences in the reflectance values of the three bands in the visible range of the spectrum. Overall, remote sensing data yielded robust estimates of the selected indicators, favoring its future operational use in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The degree of spatial and seasonal variability in the ocean colour chlorophyll-a values (monthly re-analysed values originating from MODIS, MERIS and SeaWiFS sensors available from the MyOcean Marine Core Service) for these water bodies in the 2003-2011 period was evaluated graphically and statistically. Weekly values from the same satellite platforms were only available for the period 2010-2011 and these were analysed separately. The nine coastal water bodies were characterized by ocean colour values consistent with an oligotrophic water body, with seasonal mean values ranging from 0.06 to 0.35 mg/m(3). The same nine coastal water bodies were classified according to an arbitrary ocean colour index based on seasonal mean values calculated over the entire 2003-2011 period. The seasonal pattern of variability within ocean colour values across the different coastal water bodies over a single year was highly homogenous, with highest values being recorded during the December-February period, and lowest values being recorded during the May-August period, with very few exceptions (solely recorded in 2010 and 2011). Although statistical analyses (PERMANOVA) showed significant inter-annual differences between seasonal ocean colour values of the different water bodies, spatial variations among the same values were statistically significant only in the spring and summer seasons, over the entire nine-year period. However, the pairwise tests revealed that most of these significantly different comparisons were registered during the 2010-2011 summer seasons. These spatial differences could either be due to an artefact (the 2010 and 2011 ocean colour data sets were derived using a different chlorophyll-a algorithm and different satellites than the 2003-2009 ones) or else they could be real (e.g. some of the coastal water bodies exhibiting higher ocean colour values are optically more complex since they host large coastal embayments, intensive aquaculture activities, treated sewage discharges and other anthropogenic activities).

While the daily data were used to produce the potential fishing ground maps of Rastrelliger kanagurta at the study area. Climatological images showed that the SST during the Southeast monsoon is lower thanthe Northwest monsoon, while chl-a during the Southeast monsoon is higher than the Northwest monsoonand isscattered along the coast. SST and chl-a showed an inverse correlation, with coefficient of correlation at R = 0.542. Preferred range of R. kanagurta were 30.75 +/- 0.(21)degrees C for SST and 0.31 +/- 0.10 mg m(-3) for chl-a. Potential fishing grounds were found located around the coast. This study indicates that satellite image is able to determine the relationship between SST and chl-a and identify aggregation grounds of R. kanagurta.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1199-9				2013	1571						466	472		10.1063/1.4858699								WOS:000331836300079

This study was conducted to determined Chl-a and nutrient distribution during the southwest monsoon in the coastal water of Pahang, Malaysia. Data of Chl-a from Level 1A data (1 km spatial resolution) were processed to monthly composites Level 3 of Aqua MODIS data from January 2006 to December 2011 to get climatological images. Distribution of Chl-a was described by the spatial map using satellite image of the ocean color properties. While nutrient distribution were explained using kriging technique and mapped using ArcGIS. Chl-a was higher near coastal area and lower towards off shore area due to the terrestrial influence especially from river discharge and aquaculture activity. High value of nitrate, ammonia and phosphate in Pahang coastal area during the southwest monsoon indicates influence of terrestrial discharge especially from river outflow and aquaculture.

Evaluation of ocean color data processing schemes for VIIRS sensor using in-situ data of coastal AERONET-OC sites	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2013	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24, 2013	Dresden, GERMANY	SPIE				In the processing of Ocean Color (OC) data from sensor data recorded by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard JPSS-Suomi satellite, NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) is deriving a continuous temporal calibration based on the on-board calibration measurements for the visible bands, and then reprocessing the full mission to produce a continuously calibrated sensor data record (SDR) product. In addition, a vicarious calibration during SDR to OC Level-2 processing is applied. In the latest processing the vicarious calibration is derived from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) data, whereas in the initial processing it was derived from a sea surface reflectance model and a climatology of chlorophyll-a concentration. Furthermore, NASA has recently reprocessed the OC data for the entire VIIRS mission with lunar-based temporal calibration and updated vicarious gains. On the other hand, in fulfilling the mission of the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS) developed by Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems, for the processing of the environmental data products from sensor data records, has gained beta status for evaluation. As these processing schemes continue to evolve, monitoring the validity and assessments of the related VIIRS ocean color products are necessary, especially for coastal waters, to evaluate the consistency of these processing and calibration schemes. The ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) has been designed to support long-term satellite ocean color investigations through cross-site measurements collected by autonomous multispectral radiometer systems deployed above water. As part of this network, the Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory (LISCO) near New York City and WaveCIS in the Gulf of Mexico expand those observational capabilities with continuous monitoring as well as (for the LISCO site) additional assessment of the hyper-spectral properties of coastal waters. In the investigations carried out over a one and half year period dataset of VIIRS, based on the data from two coastal AERONET-OC sites, it has been observed that the VIIRS sensor captures well the seasonal and temporal variations in the nLw data, exhibiting significant correlation with in-situ data (R = 0.929 and 0.985 for LISCO and WaveCIS respectively). For the WaveCIS site, VIIRS nLw data retrievals are seen to be enhanced with each incremental adjustments of vicarious and calibration procedures. However, that is not the case for the LISCO site which exhibits more frequent occurrences of negative water-leaving radiances, while underestimation in VIIRS nLw data is further exacerbated. Strong consistency between the time-series nLw data retrieved from the VIIRS and MODIS sensors was also observed.

As a result, marine oil pollution has caused huge economic losses. The remote sensing sensors can detect and record the spectral information of sea film and background seawater. Here we chose to use 250-resolution MODIS data in the area of Dalian Xingang, China where ill spill case was happened on April. 4th, 2005. Based on the image pre-processing and enhanced image processing, the spectral features of different bands were analyzed. More obvious characteristics of the spectral range of film was obtained. The oil-water contrast was calculated to evaluate the feature of oil at different spectral band. The result indicates that IR band has the maximum value of reflective. So band ratio was used between 400nm and 800nm and the original radiance images were used between 800nm and 2130nm. In order to get the most obvious images of entropy windows of different sizes were tested in order to decide the optimum window. At last, a FCM fuzzy clustering method and image texture analysis was combined for the MODIS images of the oil spill area segmentation. At last, the oil spill zone was estimated, the results were satisfied.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9806-9				2013	8921								UNSP 892106	10.1117/12.2030393								WOS:000327588700006

In China, the East China Sea has a high incidence of red tide disasters. Remote sensing technology has been proven an effective means of monitoring red tides. Spectral information of red tide water is an important basis for establishing red tide remote sensing monitoring models. This paper analyzes and compares the differences between red tide event spectral curves and multiyear monthly averaged spectral curves of MODIS data from July 2002 to June 2012, and develops a red tide monitoring algorithm based on the background field, to extract red tide information of the East China Sea. With the application of the algorithm in the East China Sea, it reveals that it can effectively determine the location of red tide and extract red tide information.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9719-2				2013	8869								88690V	10.1117/12.2022715								WOS:000326721100017

Aerosol optical depth assimilation for a size-resolved sectional model: impacts of observationally constrained, multi-wavelength and fine mode retrievals on regional scale analyses and forecasts	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												An aerosol optical depth (AOD) three-dimensional variational data assimilation technique is developed for the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system for which WRF-Chem forecasts are performed with a detailed sectional model, the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC). Within GSI, forward AOD and adjoint sensitivities are performed using Mie computations from the WRF-Chem optical properties module, providing consistency with the forecast. GSI tools such as recursive filters and weak constraints are used to provide correlation within aerosol size bins and upper and lower bounds for the optimization. The system is used to perform assimilation experiments with fine vertical structure and no data thinning or re-gridding on a 12 km horizontal grid over the region of California, USA, where improvements on analyses and forecasts is demonstrated. A first set of simulations was performed, comparing the assimilation impacts of using the operational MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) dark target retrievals to those using observationally constrained ones, i.e., calibrated with AERONET (Aerosol RObotic NETwork) data. It was found that using the observationally constrained retrievals produced the best results when evaluated against ground based monitors, with the error in PM2.5 predictions reduced at over 90% of the stations and AOD errors reduced at 100% of the monitors, along with larger overall error reductions when grouping all sites. A second set of experiments reveals that the use of fine mode fraction AOD and ocean multi-wavelength retrievals can improve the representation of the aerosol size distribution, while assimilating only 550 nm AOD retrievals produces no or at times degraded impact. While assimilation of multi-wavelength AOD shows positive impacts on all analyses performed, future work is needed to generate observationally constrained multi-wavelength retrievals, which when assimilated will generate size distributions more consistent with AERONET data and will provide better aerosol estimates.

For this reason, satellite images from ENVISAT/MERIS and Aqua/MODIS were used along with collocated in-situ measurements. The latter were in-sync with the satellite images acquisition so that rigorous and validation could be performed. Chlorophyll-a concentration and total suspended matter were estimated using the CASE-II algorithm and MERIS satellite images, while sea surface temperature was estimated from MODIS Ocean Team products. The results show that the satellite images covered the study area completely, with some data gaps due to cloud coverage. Comparisons show a good correspondence with in-situ measurements. Thus, the time series of satellite images that was produced suggests that it is possible to monitor the biological changes on an operational basis. The produced maps described a detailed spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter that could not have been identified from the sparse in-situ measurements.

This separation is problematic due to the similar absorption spectra of these substances. Due to this complication, we approach the problem by constructing a neural network which relates the remote sensing reflectance at the available MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667nm) with the ratio of the absorption coefficient of non-algal particulates to the absorption coefficient of dissolved species, thereby permitting analytical separation of the total non-algal absorption into particulate and dissolved components. The resulting synthetically trained algorithm is tested on simulated data as well as independently on the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Very good agreement is obtained, with R-2 values of 87% and 78% for the non-algal particulate and dissolved absorption components, respectively for the NOMAD. Finally, we apply the algorithm to MODIS data and present global distributions for these parameters.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9638-6				2013	8795								UNSP 87951N	10.1117/12.2028379								WOS:000325475000059

The mean in situ N-d during the period of study was 217 cm(-3), while the MODIS-based N-d was 171 cm(-3). The absolute values, and the dependence of both N-d observations on the measured aerosol number concentration in the accumulation mode (N-acc), are quite similar. In both data sets N-d is clearly dependent on N-acc, for N-acc values lower than approximately 450 cm(-3). Also, the values of the aerosol-cloud-interaction parameter [ACI = (1/3)*d ln(N-d)/d ln(N-acc)] are quite similar for N-acc <400 cm(-3) with values of 0.16 and 0.14 from in situ and MODIS measurements, respectively. With higher N-acc (>450 cm(-3)) N-d increases only slowly. Similarly, the effect of aerosol on MODIS-retrieved R-eff is visible only at low N-acc values. In a sub set of data, the cloud and aerosol properties were measured simultaneously. For that data the comparison between MODIS-derived N-d and directly measured N-d, or the cloud droplet number concentration estimated from N-acc values (N-d,N-p), shows a correlation, which is greatly improved after careful screening using a ceilometer to make sure that only single cloud layers existed. This suggests that such determination of the number of cloud layers is very important when trying to match ground-based measurements to MODIS measurements.

These NNs are used to relate the water leaving remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at available MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667nm) to the phytoplankton (a(ph)), non-phytoplankton particulate (a(dm)), dissolved (a(g)) absorption and particulate backscattering (b(bp)) coefficients at 443nm. These reflectance derived parameters (a(ph)(443), a(dm)(443), a(g)(443), b(b)p(443)) are then combined with the measured reflectance values and used as input to a fourth NN, (IOP NN [Chl]), to derive chlorophyll concentration ([Chl]). Unlike NNs previously developed by us that were trained on a synthetic dataset and then tested on the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD), the (IOP NN [Chl]) network was both trained and tested solely on NOMAD. Although the inherent optical properties (IOP) can be derived from the optical signal through their direct relation to the Rrs, the relationship of [Chl] to IOP varies with location and season, and is therefore difficult to model globally. In order to demonstrate that the inclusion of derived IOP estimates along with radiance measurements can improve the retrieval of [Chl], we construct a neural network that is trained to derive [Chl] from reflectance measurements only We also compare our [Chl] product to that obtained from the current OC3 algorithm implemented by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Finally, we apply our algorithm to MODIS data and present and analyze the global seasonal variability for all three parameters.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9515-0				2013	8724								UNSP 87240P	10.1117/12.2018143								WOS:000323517900023

Assuming a skewed probability density function (pdf) of oil parcel thicknesses, a model of the NIR image oil-water contrast reflectance was developed to characterize the expected oil slick distribution in terms of average and maximum oil slick thickness. Since MIKE 21 Spill Analysis (SA) also allows non-uniform distribution of oil volume within the oil slick, both distributions were thus compared by coincidence of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Aqua) acquisition, which imaged the oil slick 3 days after the oil spill started. Results showed an excellent agreement in the numerical values of both the expected average and the maximum thickness. In addition, repartition of the oil volume within the slick in the usual thin (sheen) and thick (brown) parts resulted, consistent with the empirical rule of 20% and 80% of the total oil volume, respectively.

A 4-D climatology (1979-2009) of the monthly tropospheric aerosol optical depth distribution over the Mediterranean region from a comparative evaluation and blending of remote sensing and model products	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Since the 1980s several spaceborne sensors have been used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region. In parallel, AOD climatologies coming from different numerical model simulations are now also available, permitting to distinguish the contribution of several aerosol types to the total AOD. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of this unique multiyear database in terms of total AOD and of its apportionment by the five main aerosol types (soil dust, sea-salt, sulfate, black and organic carbon). We use 9 different satellite-derived monthly AOD products: NOAA/AVHRR, SeaWiFS (2 products), TERRA/MISR, TERRA/MODIS, AQUA/MODIS, ENVISAT/MERIS, PARASOL/POLDER and MSG/SEVIRI, as well as 3 more historical datasets: NIMBUS7/CZCS, TOMS (onboard NIMBUS7 and Earth- Probe) and METEOSAT/MVIRI. Monthly model datasets include the aerosol climatology from Tegen et al. (1997), the climate-chemistry models LMDz-OR-INCA and RegCM-4, the multi-model mean coming from the ACCMIP exercise, and the reanalyses GEMS and MACC. Ground-based Level-2 AERONET AOD observations from 47 stations around the basin are used here to evaluate the model and satellite data. The sensor MODIS (on AQUA and TERRA) has the best average AOD scores over this region, showing a relevant spatio-temporal variability and highlighting high dust loads over Northern Africa and the sea (spring and summer), and sulfate aerosols over continental Europe (summer). The comparison also shows limitations of certain datasets (especially MERIS and SeaWiFS standard products). Models reproduce the main patterns of the AOD variability over the basin. The MACC reanalysis is the closest to AERONET data, but appears to underestimate dust over Northern Africa, where RegCM-4 is found closer to MODIS thanks to its interactive scheme for dust emissions. The vertical dimension is also investigated using the CALIOP instrument. This study confirms differences of vertical distribution between dust aerosols showing a large vertical spread, and other continental and marine aerosols which are confined in the boundary layer. From this compilation, we propose a 4-D blended product from model and satellite data, consisting in monthly time series of 3-D aerosol distribution at a 50 km horizontal resolution over the Euro-Mediterranean marine and continental region for the 2003-2009 period. The product is based on the total AOD from AQUA/MODIS, apportioned into sulfates, black and organic carbon from the MACC reanalysis, and into dust and sea-salt aerosols from RegCM-4 simulations, which are distributed vertically based on CALIOP climatology. We extend the 2003-2009 reconstruction to the past up to 1979 using the 2003-2009 average and applying the decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols from LMDz-OR-INCA, whose AOD trends over Europe and the Mediterranean are median among the ACCMIP models. Finally optical properties of the different aerosol types in this region are proposed from Mie calculations so that this reconstruction can be included in regional climate models for aerosol radiative forcing and aerosol-climate studies.

We discuss applications of OC-SMART to analyze SeaWiFS, MERIS, and MODIS images obtained over coastal waters.

It is very important to take corresponding measures that how to quickly master the location of the oil spill when this event occurs. Satellite remote sensing has advantages of large, multi-temporal, all-weather, real-time, quick and economic and has become an important means of monitoring marine oil spill, playing an important role in the monitoring of marine oil spill treatment. This paper illustrates by Penglai 19-3 oil spill accident, using MODIS remote sensing data, the use of the Robert operator, Sobel operator, Laplacian operator and LOG operator to extract the oil spill edge, and extraction accuracy of the comparison and analysis.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-550-8				2013	610-613		1-4				3747	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.610-613.3747								WOS:000319792101354

Investigation of radiative effects of the optically thick dust layer over the Indian tropical region	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												Optical and physical properties of aerosols derived from multi-satellite observations (MODIS-Aqua, OMI-Aura, MISR-Terra, CALIOP-CALIPSO) have been used to estimate radiative effects of the dust layer over southern India. The vertical distribution of aerosol radiative forcing and heating rates are calculated with 100 m resolution in the lower atmosphere, using temperature and relative humidity data from balloon-borne radiosonde observations. The present study investigates the optically thick dust layer of optical thickness 0.18 +/- 0.06 at an altitude of 2.5 +/- 0.7 km over Gadanki, transported from the Thar Desert, producing radiative forcing and heating rate of 11.5 +/- 3.3 W m(-2) and 0.6 +/- 0.26 K day(-1), respectively, with a forcing efficiency of 43 W m(-2) and an effective heating rate of 4 K day(-1) per unit dust optical depth. Presence of the dust layer increases radiative forcing by 60% and heating rate by 60 times at that altitude compared to non-dusty cloud-free days. Calculation shows that the radiative effects of the dust layer strongly depend on the boundary layer aerosol type and mass loading. An increase of 25% of heating by the dust layer is found over relatively cleaner regions than urban regions in southern India and further 15% of heating increases over the marine region. Such heating differences in free troposphere may have significant consequences in the atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle over the tropical Indian region.

Several PP retrieval algorithms were tested against the collected in situ data, and it was shown that the algorithm by Behrenfeld and Falkowski gave the best results (with the coefficient of correlation, r, equal to 0.8 and 0.75, respectively, for the pelagic and shelf zones). Based on the performed test, the Behrenfeld and Falkowski algorithm was further applied for determining both the annual PP in the Arctic and the PP trend over the above-mentioned time period. Results of our analysis indicate that PP in the Arctic has increased by 15.9% over 13 years (19982010). This finding, as well as the absolute annual values of PP remotely quantified in the present study, is at odds with analogous numerical assessments by other workers. These disagreements are thought to be due to differences in the applied methodologies of satellite data processing such as cloud masking and determination of phytoplankton concentration within (1) overcast areas and (2) areas of massive growth of coccolithophores as well as (3) in the shelf zone prone to a significant influence of land and river run-off.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				JAN 1	2013	34	11					3903	3937		10.1080/01431161.2012.762698								WOS:000315384500012

Satellite-Observed Black Water Events off Southwest Florida: Implications for Coral Reef Health in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary	REMOTE SENSING												A "black water" event, as observed from satellites, occurred off southwest Florida in 2012. Satellite observations suggested that the event started in early January and ended in mid-April 2012. The black water patch formed off central west Florida and advected southward towards Florida Bay and the Florida Keys with the shelf circulation, which was confirmed by satellite-tracked surface drifter trajectories. Compared with a previous black water event in 2002, the 2012 event was weaker in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. An in situ survey indicated that the 2012 black water patch contained toxic K. brevis and had relatively low CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) and turbidity but high chlorophyll-a concentrations, while salinity was somewhat high compared with historical values. Further analysis revealed that the 2012 black water was formed by the K. brevis bloom initiated off central west Florida in late September 2011, while river runoff, Trichodesmium and possibly submarine groundwater discharge also played important roles in its formation. Black water patches can affect benthic coral reef communities by decreasing light availability at the bottom, and enhanced nutrient concentrations from black water patches support massive macroalgae growth that can overgrow coral reefs. It is thus important to continue the integrated observations where satellites provide synoptic and repeated observations of such adverse water quality events.

J	Painemal, D; Zuidema, P				Painemal, D.; Zuidema, P.			The first aerosol indirect effect quantified through airborne remote sensing during VOCALS-REx	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The first aerosol indirect effect (1AIE) is investigated using a combination of in situ and remotely-sensed aircraft (NCAR C-130) observations acquired during VOCALS-REx over the southeast Pacific stratocumulus cloud regime. Satellite analyses have previously identified a high albedo susceptibitility to changes in cloud microphysics and aerosols over this region. The 1AIE was broken down into the product of two independently-estimated terms: the cloud aerosol interaction metric ACI(tau) = d ln tau/d ln N-a vertical bar(LWP), and the relative albedo (A) susceptibility SR-tau = d A/3d ln tau vertical bar(LWP), with tau and N-a denoting retrieved cloud optical thickness and in situ aerosol concentration respectively and calculated for fixed intervals of liquid water path (LWP). ACI(tau) was estimated by combining in situ N-a sampled below the cloud, with tau and LWP derived from, respectively, simultaneous upward-looking broadband irradiance and narrow field-of-view millimeter-wave radiometer measurements, collected at 1 Hz during four eight-hour daytime flights by the C-130 aircraft. ACI tau values were typically large, close to the physical upper limit (0.33), with a modest increase with LWP. The high ACI tau values slightly exceed values reported from many previous in situ airborne studies in pristine marine stratocumulus and reflect the imposition of a LWP constraint and simultaneity of aerosol and cloud measurements. SR-tau increased with LWP and tau, reached a maximum SR-tau (0.086) for LWP (tau) of 58 gm(-2) (similar to 14), and decreased slightly thereafter. The 1AIE thus increased with LWP and is comparable to a radiative forcing of -3.2- -3.8 W m(-2) for a 10% increase in N-a, exceeding previously-reported global-range values. The aircraft-derived values are consistent with satellite estimates derived from instantaneous, collocated Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) albedo and MOderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-retrieved droplet number concentrations at 50 km resolution. The consistency of the airborne and satellite estimates, despite their independent approaches, differences in observational scales, and retrieval assumptions, is hypothesized to reflect the ideal remote sensing conditions for these homogeneous clouds. We recommend the southeast Pacific for regional model assessments of the first aerosol indirect effect on this basis. This airborne remotely-sensed approach towards quantifying 1AIE should in theory be more robust than in situ calculations because of increased sampling. However, although the technique does not explicitly depend on a remotely-derived cloud droplet number concentration (N-d), the attimes unrealistically-high N-d values suggest more emphasis on accurate airborne radiometric measurements is needed to refine this approach.

Detection and characterization of heavy drizzle cells within subtropical marine stratocumulus using AMSR-E 89-GHz passive microwave measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												This empirical study demonstrates the feasibility of using 89-GHz Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) passive microwave brightness temperature data to detect heavily drizzling cells within subtropical marine stratocumulus. For the purpose of this paper, we define heavily drizzling cells as areas >= 6 km x 4 km with C-band Z > 0 dBZ; equivalent to > 0.084 mm h(-1). A binary heavy drizzle product is described that can be used to determine areal and feature statistics of drizzle cells within the major marine stratocumulus regions. Current satellite liquid water path (LWP) and cloud radar products capable of detecting drizzle are either lacking in resolution (AMSR-E LWP), diurnal coverage (MODIS LWP), or spatial coverage (CloudSat). The AMSR-E 89-GHz data set at 6 km x 4 km spatial resolution is sufficient for resolving individual heavily drizzling cells. Radiant emission at 89 GHz by liquid-water cloud and precipitation particles from drizzling cells in marine stratocumulus regions yields local maxima in brightness temperature against an otherwise cloud-free background brightness temperature. The background brightness temperature is primarily constrained by column-integrated water vapor for moderate sea surface temperatures. Clouds containing ice are screened out. Once heavily drizzling pixels are identified, connected pixels are grouped into discrete drizzle cell features. The identified drizzle cells are used in turn to determine several spatial statistics for each satellite scene, including drizzle cell number and size distribution. The identification of heavily drizzling cells within marine stratocumulus regions with satellite data facilitates analysis of seasonal and regional drizzle cell occurrence and the interrelation between drizzle and changes in cloud fraction.

Evaluating MODIS cloud retrievals with in situ observations from VOCALS-REx	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Microphysical measurements collected during eleven profiles, by the UK BAe-146 aircraft, through marine stratocumulus as part of the Variability of the American Monsoon Systems (VAMOS) Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) are compared to collocated overpasses of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua and Terra satellite platforms. The full depth of the cloud is sampled in each case using a Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP) and a Two-Dimensional Stereo Probe (2DS) together sizing cloud and precipitation droplets in the diameter range 2-1260 mu m. This allows the total optical depth (tau(c)) of the cloud and effective radius (r(e)) of the droplet size distribution to be compared to MODIS cloud retrievals of the same quantities along with the secondarily derived total liquid water path. When compared to the effective radius at cloud top, the MODIS retrieved r(e) using the 2.1 mu m wavelength channel overestimates the in situ measurements on average by 13% with the largest overestimations coinciding with the detection by the 2DS of drizzle sized droplets. We show through consideration of the full vertical profile and penetration depths of the wavelengths used in the retrieval that the expected retrieved values are less than those at cloud top thus increasing the apparent bias in r(e) retrievals particularly when using the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m channels, with the 3.7 mu m channel retrievals displaying the best agreement with in situ values. Retrievals of tau(c) also tend to overestimate in situ values which, coupled with a high bias in r(e) retrievals, lead to an overestimation of liquid water path. There is little apparent correlation between the variation of the three near-infrared r(e) retrievals and the vertical structure of the cloud observed in situ. Retrievals are performed using measured profiles of water vapour and temperature along with an accurate knowledge of the width of the droplet size distribution which improve agreement between in situ and retrieved values but cannot completely explain the observed biases. Additionally we show that cloud heterogeneity and three-dimensional radiative effects may high skew the mean when averaging over comparison domains but cannot explain all of the apparent high bias. An intercomparison between in situ measurements from the BAe-146 and C-130 platforms is also presented, highlighting the uncertainties associated with in situ observations.

Comparing Ship-Track Droplet Sizes Inferred from Terra and Aqua MODIS Data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												In this study of ship tracks, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements from late-morning (Terra) and early-afternoon (Aqua) Earth Observing System platforms are analyzed in five separate geographically distributed cases to compare estimates of the sizes (and their changes in time) of droplets associated with ship exhaust. Ship tracks are readily detected in near-infrared imagery as bright features, especially in 2.13-mu m observations. The Terra "MOD06" and Aqua "MYD06" cloud products are used to determine the effective radius of the ship-track droplets; droplet age (time in the atmosphere) is estimated as a function of the distance from the ship. Terra and Aqua MODIS estimates of droplet sizes in ship-track plumes are found to be in agreement, with a correlation greater than 0.90; for the cases studied, droplet sizes in the ship plumes are between 6 and 18 mu m. Moreover, the droplets' size growth rates inferred from the length of the ship track were found to average between 0.5 and 1.0 mu m h(-1).				Menzel, W. Paul/B-8306-2011	Menzel, W.

J	Dong, Q; Shang, SL; Lee, Z				Dong, Qiang; Shang, Shaoling; Lee, Zhongping			An algorithm to retrieve absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from ocean color	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We extended the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) architecture to analytically derive absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(g)). Specifically, we used an empirical formula based on total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients to estimate and then remove detritus absorption coefficient (a(d)), and developed a scheme to use absorption coefficients at three wavelengths (412,443, and 490 nm) for the separation of a(g) and a(ph) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton). The algorithm was tested using an in situ data set collected in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and a global in situ data set the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Our results indicated that this new analytical algorithm for retrieving a(g) performed reasonably well with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 45% for a(g)(412), while it also presented a satisfactory performance for a(ph) and a(d) in both coastal and oceanic waters. Furthermore, the applicability of this new algorithm for general oceanographic studies was briefly illustrated by applying it to MODIS measurements over the Taiwan Strait and the shelf region near the Mississippi River delta. Nevertheless, more independent tests with in situ and satellite data are needed to further validate and improve this innovative approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Calibration procedures and first dataset of Southern Ocean chlorophyll a profiles collected by elephant seals equipped with a newly developed CTD-fluorescence tags	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												In situ observation of the marine environment has traditionally relied on ship-based platforms. The obvious consequence is that physical and biogeochemical properties have been dramatically undersampled, especially in the remote Southern Ocean (SO). The difficulty in obtaining in situ data represents the major limitations to our understanding, and interpretation of the coupling between physical forcing and the biogeochemical response. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) equipped with a new generation of oceanographic sensors can measure ocean structure in regions and seasons rarely observed with traditional oceanographic platforms. Over the last few years, seals have allowed for a considerable increase in temperature and salinity profiles from the SO, but we were still lacking information on the spatiotemporal variation of phytoplankton concentration. This information is critical to assess how the biological productivity of the SO, with direct consequences on the amount of CO2 "fixed" by the biological pump, will respond to global warming. In this research programme, we use an innovative sampling fluorescence approach to quantify phytoplankton concentration at sea. For the first time, a low energy consumption fluorometer was added to Argos CTD-SRDL tags, and these novel instruments were deployed on 27 southern elephant seals between 25 December 2007 and the 4 February 2011. As many as 3388 fluorescence profiles associated with temperature and salinity measurements were thereby collected from a vast sector of the Southern Indian Ocean. This paper addresses the calibration issue of the fluorometer before being deployed on elephant seals and presents the first results obtained for the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. This in situ system is implemented in synergy with satellite ocean colour radiometry. Satellite-derived data is limited to the surface layer and is restricted over the SO by extensive cloud cover. However, with the addition of these new tags, we are able to assess the 3-dimension distribution of phytoplankton concentration by foraging southern elephant seals. This approach reveals that for the Indian sector of the SO, the surface chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations provided by MODIS were underestimated by a factor 2 compared to chl a concentrations estimated from HPLC corrected in situ fluorescence measurements. The scientific outcomes of this programme include an improved understanding of both the present state and variability in ocean biology, and the accompanying biogeochemistry, as well as the delivery of real-time and open-access data to scientists (doi:10.7491/MEMO.1).

The observation of sea surface chlorophyll-a (SSC) and sea surface temperature (SST) in relation to fish catch variability within the Indonesian region were conducted by using satellite data of SeaWiFs, Aqua MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR. The result shows that Sea Surface Chlorophyll-a (SSC) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) within Indonesian water vary among the region and are affected by monsoonal system as well as local and regional environment. The similar situation was also shown on fish catch variability. Seasonal variation in fish productivity has a strong correlation with SSC variability. High fish productivity was well corresponded to high concentration of SSC and the productivity tended to decrease when the SSC concentration was reduced. High SSC variability in the southern coastal area of Java and Lampung Bay was governed by the upwelling that occurred during the southeast monsoon, while in the northern coastal area of Java and South Kalimantan was governed by high precipitation occurred during the northwest monsoon.

J	Wong, MS; Nichol, JE; Lee, KH				Wong, Man Sing; Nichol, Janet E.; Lee, Kwon Ho			Estimation of aerosol sources and aerosol transport pathways using AERONET clustering and backward trajectories: a case study of Hong Kong	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Hong Kong, located adjacent to the rapidly growing urban-industrial region of south China, provides a case of mixed aerosol types (urban, industrial, marine, and long-distance, including dust) from diverse activities and has suffered many serious air pollution episodes over the last decade. However, the sources and transport pathways of aerosols measured and recorded in Hong Kong have not been well researched due to the lack of air quality monitoring stations in east Asia. Here, an integrated method combining Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, backward trajectories, and Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) modelling is used to identify probable transport pathways and magnitudes of source contributions for four characteristic aerosol types. These types, which are dominant in Hong Kong during defined climatic and environmental conditions, are urban fine aerosols, urban mixed aerosols, dust, and heavy pollution. They were defined by clustering a total of 730 AERONET data sets between 2005 and 2008. Results show that aerosol types 1 and 2 (urban fine and urban mixed) are associated with regional fine particulate urban emissions and predominantly local urban emissions, respectively, suggesting that mitigating measures taken within Hong Kong itself would be partially effective. Heavy pollution and dust (types 4 and 3) are more associated with short-and long-distance sources, notably heavy industries in nearby southern Guangdong and the Pearl River Delta region, and desert dust from arid regions in north China. The PSCF map representing dust aerosol type shows a wide range of eastward and southeastward trajectories from northwest China to Hong Kong. Although the contribution of dust sources is small compared to anthropogenic aerosols, a serious recent dust outbreak observed in Hong Kong was associated with an elevation of the air pollution index to 500, compared with 50-100 on normal days. The combined use of clustered AERONET, backward trajectories, and PSCF model can help to resolve long-standing issues about source regions and characteristics of pollutants carried to Hong Kong.

In this study, we explore direct ground based remote sensing methods to assess the Aerosol-Cloud Indirect Effect directly, as space-borne retrievals are not directly suitable for simultaneous aerosol/cloud retrievals. To illustrate some of these difficulties, a statistical assessment of existing multispectral imagers on geostationary (e.g., GOES)/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite retrievals of the Cloud Droplet Effective Radius (R-eff) showed significant biases especially at larger solar zenith angles, further motivating the use of ground based remote sensing approaches. In particular, we discuss the potential of using a combined Microwave Radiometer (MWR)-Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) system for real-time monitoring of Cloud Optical Depth (COD) and Cloud Droplet Effective Radius (R-eff), which are combined with aerosol vertical properties from an aerosol lidar. An iterative approach combining the simultaneous observations from MFRSR and MWR are used to retrieve the COD and R-eff for thick cloud cases and are extensively validated using the DoE Southern Great Plains (SGP) retrievals as well as regression based parameterized model retrievals. In addition, we account for uncertainties in background aerosol, surface albedo and the combined measurement uncertainties from the MWR and MFRSR in order to provide realistic uncertainty estimates, which is found to be similar to 10% for the parameter range of interest in Aerosol-Cloud Interactions. Finally, we analyze a particular case of possible aerosol-cloud interaction described in the literature at the SGP site and demonstrate that aerosol properties obtained at the surface can lead to inconclusive results in comparison to lidar-derived aerosol properties near the cloud base.

Satellite observations of regular eddies in bays of the Shantar Archipelago, Sea of Okhotsk	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												Eddies with diameters of 4-40 km are formed near headlands running out into the sea in bays of the Shantar Archipelago. Such eddies play an important part in the dispersion of ice and plankton. The formation of these eddies is studied based on satellite and marine observations. To construct velocity vectors, images from the Aqua and Terra satellites were used (the data of channel 1 of the MODIS radiometer with a spatial resolution of 250 m). The measurements of currents were made by sequential satellite images with an interval of about 100 min. Large ice floes were chosen to determine currents by satellite data. Vectors of ice displacement were constructed and their velocities were calculated for each pair of images. The flow convergence is estimated using these data. The marine observations include direct observations of currents and CTD data. The observations of currents were obtained with electromagnetic meters mounted on anchored buoys. The results of direct observations point to tidal currents as the main mechanism for the formation of short-lived but regular convergence regions associated with headland eddies.																	0001-4338					DEC	2012	48	9					993	998		10.1134/S0001433812090149								WOS:000314029500013

Long-term patterns in water transparency determine geographical and depth distributions, while acute reductions cause short-term stress, potentially mortality and may increase the organisms' vulnerability to other environmental stressors. Here, we investigated the optimal, operational algorithm for light attenuation through the water column across the scale of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. We implemented and tested a quasi-analytical algorithm to determine the photic depth in GBR waters and matched regional Secchi depth (ZSD) data to MODIS-Aqua (2002-2010) and SeaWiFS (1997-2010) satellite data. The results of the in situ ZSD/satellite data matchup showed a simple bias offset between the in situ and satellite retrievals. Using a Type II linear regression of log-transformed satellite and in situ data, we estimated ZSD and implemented the validated ZSD algorithm to generate a decadal satellite time series (2002-2012) for the GBR. Water clarity varied significantly in space and time. Seasonal effects were distinct, with lower values during the austral summer, most likely due to river runoff and increased vertical mixing, and a decline in water clarity between 2008-2012, reflecting a prevailing La Nina weather pattern. The decline in water clarity was most pronounced in the inshore area, where a significant decrease in mean inner shelf ZSD of 2.1 m (from 8.3 m to 6.2 m) occurred over the decade. Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis determined the dominance of Mode 1 (51.3%), with the greatest variation in water clarity along the mid-shelf, reflecting the strong influence of oceanic intrusions on the spatio-temporal patterns of water clarity. The newly developed photic depth product has many potential applications for the GBR from water quality monitoring to analyses of ecosystem responses to changes in water clarity.

They are compared with the assumed modes used in the operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ocean aerosol algorithm, and the results show that 1) the standard deviation values of three fine aerosol modes (0.6) and one dustlike aerosol mode (0.8) are much higher than the corresponding statistical AERONET modal values (0.45 and 0.6, respectively.). The values of three sea salt aerosol modes (0.6) are somewhat lower than the corresponding statistical AERONET modal value (0.675). 2) The number median radius of the current fine and dustlike aerosol modes cannot span the dynamic range of corresponding aerosol distribution properly. 3) AERONET products show that the standard deviation and the number median radius exhibit an obvious negative correlation, especially for sea salt and dustlike aerosol modes. According to this, a refinement of the current aerosol modes is made. These revised modes are used in a version of the MODIS retrieval over ocean. Compared with the current aerosol modes: 1) more retrieved aerosol optical depths (AODs) from the revised aerosol modes lie within the expected error bars and 2) the linear regression lines of the retrievals from the revised aerosol modes and AERONET are closer to the 1:1 line.																	0022-4928	1520-0469				DEC	2012	69	12					3595	3605		10.1175/JAS-D-12-051.1								WOS:000312430200010

The apportionment of DOC by age into millennial and decadal pools is necessary to understand the temporal connection between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. We measured Delta C-14-DOC and chemical composition indices (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)), fluorescence index (FI), hydrophobic organic acid fraction (HPOA) content) for 15 large river basins in the conterminous United States. Across all rivers the average proportion of HPOA in DOC correlated strongly with SUVA(254) (r(2) = 0.93 p < 0.001). Individual Delta C-14-DOC ranged from a low of -92.9% (726 y.b.p.) in the Colorado River to 73.4% (>Modern) in the Altamaha River for the year 2009. When adjusted by total discharge, these U.S. Rivers export modern carbon at between 34 and 46%, a signal dominated by the Mississippi River. The variation in Delta C-14 correlates to indices of the aromaticity of the DOC measured by the SUVA(254) (r(2) = 0.87, p < 0.001), and FI (r(2) = 0.6; p < 0.001) as well as differences in annual river discharge (r(2) = 0.46, p < 0.006). SUVA(254) was further correlated to broad scale vegetation phenology estimated from the Enhanced Vegetation Index derived from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). We show that basins with high discharge, high proportions of vegetation cover, and low human population densities export DOC enriched in aromatic material that corresponds to recently fixed atmospheric CO2. Conversely old DOC is exported from low discharge watersheds draining arid regions, and watersheds more strongly impacted by humans. The potential influence from fossil carbon from human inputs to aquatic systems may be important and requires more research.																	0886-6236	1944-9224				NOV 29	2012	26								GB4014	10.1029/2012GB004361								WOS:000311842100001

Retrieval of the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda) in open and coastal ocean waters using a neural network inversion	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d(lambda) is a fundamental radiometric parameter that is used to assess the light availability in the water column. A neural network approach is developed to assess K-d(lambda) at any visible wavelengths from the remote sensing reflectances as measured by the SeaWiFS satellite sensor. The neural network (NN) inversion is trained using a combination of simulated and in-situ data sets covering a broad range of K-d(lambda), between 0.0073 m(-1) at 412 nm and 12.41 m(-1) at 510 nm. The performance of the retrieval is evaluated against two data sets, one consisting of mainly synthetic data while the other one contains in-situ data only and is compared to those obtained with previous published empirical (NASA, Morel and Maritorena (2001) and Zhang and Fell (2007)) and semi-analytical (Lee et al., 2005b) algorithms. On the in-situ data set from the COASTLOOC campaign, the retrieval accuracy of the present algorithm is quite similar to published algorithms for oligotrophic and mesotrophic ocean waters. But for Kd(490) > 0.25 m(-1), the NN approach allows to retrieve Kd(490) with a much better accuracy than the four other methods. The results are consistent when compared with other SeaWiFS wavelengths. This new inversion is as suitable in the open ocean waters as in the turbid waters. The work here is straightforwardly applicable to the MERIS sensor and with few changes to the MODIS-AQUA sensor. The algorithm in matlab and C code is provided as auxiliary material.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 27	2012	117								C10023	10.1029/2012JC008076								WOS:000310344200001						
J	Su, H; Wang, YP				Su, Hua; Wang, Yunpeng			Using MODIS data to estimate sea ice thickness in the Bohai Sea (China) in the 2009-2010 winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												To estimate sea ice thickness over a large spatial scale is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a direct approach to effectively estimate sea ice thickness over a large spatial area of the Bohai Sea using EOS MODIS data. It is based on the model of an exponential relation between albedo and thickness of sea ice. Eighteen images of EOS MODIS L1B data in the 2009-2010 winter were used to estimate the sea ice thickness and to monitor its spatiotemporal evolution in the Bohai Sea. The estimated thickness results are in accordance with results based on the Lebedev and Zubov empirical models as well as the forecasting data from the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Centre of China. Model correlation coefficients (R-2 = 0.864 and 0.858) and close similarity in thickness prediction attest to the reliability and applicability of the proposed method. The average ice thickness of the whole Bohai Sea ranged from 3 to 21 cm, with an estimated maximum about 40 cm in Liaodong Bay. Multiple-temporal maps of sea-ice thickness show that the sea ice formed initially along the coastline, and gradually expanded away from the shore. Sea ice first appeared in the Liaodong Bay, and hugged the coast southwards to Bohai and Laizhou Bay. During melting the inverse sequence occurred. Our results also show that sea ice coverage and thickness are significantly correlated with the value of theta, the difference between cumulative FDD (Freezing Degree Days) and TDD (Thawing Degree Days).

ASAR imaging for coastal upwelling in the Baltic Sea	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Analysis of Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Aqua/Terra Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) infrared (IR) imagery of coastal upwelling in the southeastern Baltic Sea is presented. It is found that upwelling features are well distinct in the SAR images, and the leading imaging mechanism appears to be the change of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) stratification over the sea surface temperature (SST) front. This finding is supported by model calculations of the MABL transformation supplemented with the SAR backscatter calculations based on the CMOD4 model. In addition an empirical dependence of the SAR contrasts over the upwelling region on the wind speed and the SST drop is suggested. Finally, surface slicks accumulated in the sea surface current convergence zones generate additional distinct features in SAR imagery. This effect is interpreted within the framework of the coastal current circulation model based on analysis of the SST snapshot. (C) 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A study of how marine low-level clouds over Barents Sea and the northern parts of the Norwegian Sea are affected by air mass origin has been performed by combining ground-based aerosol measurements with satellite cloud retrievals. Aerosol number size distributions have been obtained from measurement stations in northern Finland, and a trajectory model has been used to estimate the movement of the air masses. To identify anthropogenic influences on the clouds, the dataset has been divided according to aerosol loading. The clean air masses arrived to the investigation area from the north and the polluted air masses arrived from the south. Satellite derived microphysical and optical cloud parameters from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) have then been analyzed for days when the trajectories coincided with marine low-level clouds over the investigated area. The cloud optical thickness (tau), cloud depth (H) and droplet number concentration (N-d) were significantly higher for the polluted days compared to the clean conditions, while the opposite was found for the cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)). The H and N-d were derived from the satellite retrievals of tau and r(e). Furthermore, calculations of the aerosol cloud interaction relationship (ACI), relating N-d to boundary layer aerosol concentrations, resulted in a value of 0.17, which is in line with previous remote sensing studies. The results demonstrate that ground-based aerosol measurements can be combined with satellite cloud observations to study the indirect aerosol effect, and that the microphysics of marine sub-polar clouds can be considerably affected by continental aerosols.

Kirk; O'Neill, Larry			GOES-10 microphysical retrievals in marine warm clouds: Multi-instrument validation and daytime cycle over the southeast Pacific	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The daytime evolution of warm cloud microphysical properties over the southeast Pacific during October-November 2008 is investigated with optical/infrared retrievals from the Tenth Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-10) imager. GOES-10 retrievals, produced at NASA Langley Research Center, are validated against in situ aircraft observations and with independent satellite observations. Comparisons with in situ observations reveal high linear correlations (r) for cloud effective radius (r(e)) and optical thickness (tau) (r = 0.89 and 0.69 respectively); nevertheless, a GOES-10 positive mean r(e) bias of 2.3 mu m is apparent, and consistent with other previously reported satellite biases. Smaller biases are found for liquid water path (LWP) and an adiabatic-based cloud droplet number concentration (N-d), both variables derived by combining r(e) and tau. In addition, GOES-10 observations are well correlated with their Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) counterparts, but with smaller biases and root-mean-square errors for the Aqua satellite passes, arguably associated with a better calibrated MODIS-Aqua instrument relative to MODIS-Terra. Furthermore, the excellent agreement between GOES-10 LWP and microwave-based satellite retrievals, especially at high solar zenith angles (>60 degrees), provide further evidence of the utility of using GOES-10 retrievals to represent the daytime cloud cycle. In terms of the daytime cycle, GOES-10 observations show an afternoon minimum in LWP and an increase thereafter, consistent with satellite microwave climatologies. The tau cycle explains most of the LWP variance with both variables in phase, minima near noon along the coast, and a 13:30-14:00 local solar time (LST) minimum offshore. In contrast, r(e) is not exactly in phase with LWP and tau, having a minimum approximately at 12: 30 LST throughout the domain. A unique feature is a striking r(e) maximum along the coast at 16: 15 LST, concomitant with a faster tau recovery. An explanation for a coastal r(e) afternoon maximum is lacking although this is consistent with an enhancement of the updraft velocity reported in previous modeling studies. Finally, the GOES-derived Nd (N-d (proportional to) tau(1/2) r(e) (5/2)) shows a complex daytime cycle with maxima at 7: 15 and 13: 15 LST. While the first maximum is driven by large tau, the second one is mainly explained by a minimum in r(e).

J	Ostrowska, M				Ostrowska, Miroslawa			Model of the dependence of the sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence quantum yield on the environmental factors in the sea	OPTICS EXPRESS												The paper discusses a physical model, obtained with the aid of statistical analyses, of the relationships between the sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence quantum yield and marine environmental factors. The relationships are based on a large set of empirical data from various ocean regions with basins of different trophicity, at different depths and in different seasons. Underwater spectral radiance and irradiance in the PAR spectral range were used to determine the quantum yield of sun-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence. From a statistical analysis a preliminary mathematical expression was derived to describe the fluorescence quantum yield as a function of the scalar irradiance, basin trophicity and the water temperature in situ. These relationships may be useful for analysing the budget of the light energy absorbed by phytoplankton pigments utilized in chemical and non-chemical quenching.

The performances of three operational algorithms (OC4v6, OC3Mv6, OC4Mev6), two Arctic adapted algorithms (OC4L, OC4P), and one semi-analytical (GSM01) algorithm to estimate Chla were evaluated using in situ measurements collected in the southeastern Beaufort Sea. All evaluated algorithms clearly overestimated Chla by a factor of three to five. A high contribution of colored dissolved organic matter and nonalgal particles to the blue light absorption appeared as the source of that poor performance. It was also found that fluorometrically measured Chla were two times greater than those determined from high-performance liquid chromatography, contributing to the observed discrepancies between our findings and previous studies carried out in the Arctic. We propose regionally adapted and new algorithms allowing accurate estimation of Chla in the southeastern Beaufort Sea. Finally, a matchup analysis of coincident in situ data and satellite overpass showed that the normalized water-leaving reflectance and the blue-to-green ratio retrieval were more accurate for SeaWiFS than for MODIS and MERIS.																	0703-8992	1712-7971				OCT	2012	38	5					535	556										WOS:000312838600001						
J	Jorquera, H; Barraza, F				Jorquera, Hector; Barraza, Francisco			Source apportionment of ambient PM2.5 in Santiago, Chile: 1999 and 2004 results	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A receptor model analysis has been applied to ambient PM2.5 measurements taken at Santiago, Chile (33.5 degrees S, 70.7 degrees W) in 2004 (117 samples) and in 1999 (95 samples) on a receptor site on the eastern side of the city. For both campaigns, six sources have been identified at Santiago and their contributions in 1999/2004 are: motor vehicles: 28 +/- 2.5/31.2 +/- 3.4%, wood burning: 24.8 +/- 2.3/28.9 +/- 3.3%, sulfates: 18.8 +/- 1.7/16.2 +/- 2.5%, marine aerosol: 13 +/- 2.1/9.9 +/- 1.5%, copper smelters: 11.5 +/- 1.4/9.7 +/- 3.3% and soil dust: 3.9 +/- 1.5/4.0 +/- 2.4%. Hence relative contributions are statistically the same but the absolute contributions have been reduced because ambient PM2.5 has decreased from 34.2 to 25.1 mu g/m(3) between 1999 and 2004 at Santiago. Similarity of results for both data sets - analyzed with different techniques at different laboratory facilities - shows that the analysis performed here is robust. Source identification was carried out by inspection of key species in source profiles, seasonality of source contributions, comparison with published source profiles and by looking at wind trajectories computed using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) from USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); for the wood burning sources the MODIS burned area daily product was used to confirm wildfire events along the year. Using this combined methodology we have shown conclusively that: a) marine air masses do reach Santiago's basin in significant amounts but combined with anthropogenic sources; b) all copper smelters surrounding Santiago - and perhaps coal-fired power plants as well - contribute to ambient PM2.5; c) wood burning is the second largest source, coming from residential wood burning in fall and winter and from regional wildfires in spring and summer. The results of the present analysis can be used to improve emission inventories, air quality forecasting systems and cost-benefit analyses at local and regional scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Solberg, AHS				Solberg, Anne H. Schistad			Remote Sensing of Ocean Oil-Spill Pollution	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE												Oil spills on the sea surface are observed relatively often. Pollution due to either accidents or deliberate oily discharges from ships represents a serious threat to the marine environment. Operational oil spill monitoring is currently done using a combination of satellite monitoring and aircraft surveillance. The combined use of satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and aircraft surveillance flights is a cost-effective way to monitor oil spills in large ocean areas and catch the polluters. SAR images enable covering large areas, but aircraft observations are needed to prosecute the polluter, and in certain cases to verity the oil spill. Traditionally, oil spill detection is based on single polarization SAR images. Oil spills can be discriminated from look-alikes based on a set of features describing the contrast, shape, homogeneity, source, and surroundings of the slick. Good performance is reported for single-polarization oil spill detection, but in certain cases the oil slicks cannot be discriminated from biogenic films. In the recent years, a number of studies have shown that polarimetric SAR can improve the discrimination between oil slicks and biogenic films. Several features computed from dual-pol or quad-pol images have been proposed. These include both quad-pol features like polarimetric entropy and anisotropy, mean scattering angle, polarimetric span, conformity coefficient, as well as the dual-pol features standard deviation of the copolarized phase difference and the copolarized correlation coefficient. As dual-pol SAR imagery is now available on a regular basis from Cosmo Skymed and TerraSAR-X, and quad-pol data are available from RADARSAT-2, polarimetric SAR can now be utilized on a more regular basis. Optical data from sensors like Aqua MODIS and ENVISAT MERIS can be a useful supplement under certain cloud-free conditions.																	0018-9219	1558-2256				OCT	2012	100	10			SI		2931	2945		10.1109/JPROC.2012.2196250								WOS:000308996200012

Standard ocean color algorithms applicable to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, such as OC3M and MedOC3, are known to overestimate chlorophyll concentration ([CHL]) in Mediterranean oligotrophic waters. The performances of these algorithms are currently evaluated together with two relatively new algorithms, OC5 and SAM_LT, which make use of more of the spectral information of MODIS data. This evaluation exercise has been carried out using in situ data collected in the North Tyrrhenian and Ligurian Seas during three recent oceanographic campaigns. The four algorithms perform differently in Case 1 and Case 2 waters defined following global and local classification criteria. In particular, the mentioned [CHL] overestimation of OC3M and MedOC3 is not evident for typical Case 1 waters; this overestimation is instead significant in intermediate and Case 2 waters. OC5 and SAM_LT are less sensitive to this problem, and are generally more accurate in Case 2 waters. These results are finally interpreted and discussed in light of a possible operational utilization of the [CHL] estimation methods. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J	Goren, T; Rosenfeld, D				Goren, Tom; Rosenfeld, Daniel			Satellite observations of ship emission induced transitions from broken to closed cell marine stratocumulus over large areas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Documentation of the evolution of ship tracks during 42 h demonstrated that ship emissions are able to convert a marine stratocumulus regime of open cells into closed cells, along with significant negative radiative forcing. This was possible by examining continuous day and night geostationary satellite data that allowed for an uninterrupted documentation of the full life cycle of ship tracks. After nearly one day the ship tracks lost their linear appearance and expanded to cover large areas. These areas, when viewed out of sequence and context, would not be attributable to aerosol perturbations. A rejuvenation of previously dissipated ship tracks in the form of extensive closed cells was also observed. It is suggested that ship emissions may undergo photochemical reactions which nucleate new aerosols that, along with remaining ultrafine particles, grow to CCN that are activated hours later and close the open cells. The added radiative forcing from the closed cells that can be related to the ship tracks, which is mainly coming from the cloud cover effect, may exceed -100 Wm(-2), depending on the season and latitude. This implies that anthropogenic aerosols that can be transported from continents through the boundary layer, or travel in the free troposphere and mix with the boundary layer from above, may explain the formation of large closed cells areas that are presently not recognized as originated by aerosol perturbations. The observations reported here pose a demanding test of the ability of cloud resolving models to replicate cloud-aerosol interactions.

Although experienced observers are a spill response's mainstay, few trained observers and confounding factors including weather, oil emulsification, and scene illumination geometry present challenges. DWH spill and impact monitoring was aided by extensive airborne and spaceborne passive and active remote sensing. Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (>0.1 mm) slicks from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach based on the shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response thickness class maps. Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however. SAR generally cannot discriminate thick (> 100 mu m) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0.1 mu m). The UAVSAR's (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related to a combination of oil slick thickness, fractional Surface coverage, and emulsification. In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with AVIRIS and corroborated spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. CALIPSO and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation. Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as MODIS thermal data. However, interpretation challenges and a lack of Rapid Response Products prevented significant use. Rapid Response Products were key to response utilization data needs are time critical; thus, a high technological readiness level is critical to operational use of remote sensing products. DWH's experience demonstrated that development and operationalization of new spill response remote sensing tools must precede the next major oil spill. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The light signal recorded at eight wavelengths by the sensor allows, after correction for Solar illumination and atmospheric effects, the retrieval of coloured biogeochemical products such as the chlorophyll, suspended sediment and coloured dissolved organic matter concentrations every hour between 9: 00 am and 4: 00 pm local time around the Korean peninsula. However operational exploitation of the mission needs beforehand a sound validation of first the radiometric calibration, i.e. inspection of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and second atmospheric corrections for retrieval of the water-leaving reflectance at sea surface. This study constitutes a contribution to the quality assessment of the GOCI radiometric products generated by the Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) through comparison with concurrent data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, NASA) and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS, ESA) sensors as well as in situ measurements. These comparisons are made with spatially and temporally collocated data. We focus on Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho(RC)) and normalized remote-sensing marine reflectance (nRrs). Although GOCI compares reasonably well with MERIS and MODIS, what demonstrates the success of Ocean Colour in geostationary orbit, we show that the current GOCI atmospheric correction systematically masks out data over very turbid waters and needs further examination and correction for future release of the GOCI products.

MODIS revealed that algal blooms persisted in the spring annually at the dump site in the Yellow Sea since year 2000 to the present. A number of implications of using products of the satellite ocean color imagers were exploited here based on the measurements in the Yellow Sea. GOCI observes almost every hour during the daylight period, every day since June 2011. Therefore, GOCI provides a powerful tool to monitor waste disposal at sea in real time. Tracking of disposal activity from a large tanker was possible hour by hour from the GOCI timeseries images compared to MODIS. Smaller changes in the color of the ocean surface can be easily observed, as GOCI resolves images at smaller scales in space and time in comparison to polar orbiting satellites, e. g., MODIS. GOCI may be widely used to monitor various marine activities in the sea, including waste disposal activity from ships.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				SEP	2012	47	3					387	394		10.1007/s12601-012-0036-0								WOS:000315720600021

Establishing a global climatology of marine phytoplankton phenological characteristics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The timing or phenology of the annual cycle of phytoplankton biomass can be monitored to better understand the underpinnings of the marine ecosystem and assess its response to environmental change. Ten-year, global maps of the mean date of bloom onset, peak concentration and termination of bloom duration were constructed by extracting these phenological metrics from Generalized Linear Models (GLM) fit to time series of 1 degrees x 1 degrees daily estimates of SeaWiFS chlorophyll concentrations dating from September 1997 to December 2007 as well as to MODIS chlorophyll concentrations from July 2002 to July 2010. The fitted models quantitatively define the annual cycle of phytoplankton throughout the global ocean and from which a baseline of phenological characteristics was extracted. The analysis revealed regionally consistent patterns in the shape and timing of the annual cycle of chlorophyll concentration that are broadly consistent with other published studies. The results showed that a single bloom predominates over the global ocean with secondary, autumn blooms being limited in both location and spatial extent. Bloom duration tended to be zonally consistent, but meridionally complex and did not become progressively shorter with increasing latitude as is sometimes depicted. Both the shape of the annual cycle and the phenological climatologies can be used in future studies to detect significant departures over time.

Constraining cloud lifetime effects of aerosols using A-Train satellite observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Aerosol indirect effects have remained the largest uncertainty in estimates of the radiative forcing of past and future climate change. Observational constraints on cloud lifetime effects are particularly challenging since it is difficult to separate aerosol effects from meteorological influences. Here we use three global climate models, including a multi-scale aerosol-climate model PNNL-MMF, to show that the dependence of the probability of precipitation on aerosol loading, termed the precipitation frequency susceptibility (S-pop), is a good measure of the liquid water path response to aerosol perturbation (lambda), as both S-pop and lambda strongly depend on the magnitude of autoconversion, a model representation of precipitation formation via collisions among cloud droplets. This provides a method to use satellite observations to constrain cloud lifetime effects in global climate models. S-pop in marine clouds estimated from CloudSat, MODIS and AMSR-E observations is substantially lower than that from global climate models and suggests a liquid water path increase of less than 5% from doubled cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. This implies a substantially smaller impact on shortwave cloud radiative forcing over ocean due to aerosol indirect effects than simulated by current global climate models (a reduction by one-third for one of the conventional aerosol-climate models). Further work is needed to quantify the uncertainties in satellite-derived estimates of S-pop and to examine S-pop in high-resolution models. Citation: Wang, M., et al.

Using passive remote sensing to retrieve the vertical variation of cloud droplet size in marine stratocumulus: An assessment of information content and the potential for improved retrievals from hyperspectral measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We present a theoretical study into the information content of solar reflectance measurements at multiple near-infrared wavelengths in the context of deriving the vertical variation of cloud droplet size from marine stratocumulus. We employ a Bayesian optimal estimation approach to retrieve a profile of droplet effective radius as a function of optical depth in the cloud. This allows an assessment of the information content of the measurement of reflectance at different wavelengths and the potential for a new generation of hyperspectral sensors to improve the retrieval. Our results show that using the three absorbing near-infrared channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) centered at 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m a retrieval of droplet sizes lower in the cloud is highly sensitive to small changes in reflectance. Consequently instrument and modeling errors must be reduced to <1% in order to gain a useful uncertainty constraint on droplet size near to cloud base. By introducing many high spectral resolution wavelength channels, such as those available from hyperspectral sensors, we find that the information content pertaining to all retrieval variables increases significantly. This results in a reduction in the uncertainty estimates on all retrieved quantities. We also test the ability of a vertical profile retrieval to provide improved liquid water path estimates by using several in situ profiling measurements of marine stratocumulus in the South-East Pacific region. We find that a vertical profile retrieval significantly improves the liquid water path estimate when compared to a two-band lookup table retrieval.

Remotely sensed estimates of surface salinity in the Chesapeake Bay: A statistical approach	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In coastal and estuarine environments, near-surface salinity varies significantly in space and time. As absolute salinity and salinity gradients are central to many physical and ecological processes in these environments, reliable and consistent salinity estimates are a priority for marine research and application communities. Satellite remote sensing has a great potential to meet this need, yet sensors and algorithms designed to monitor open ocean salinity are typically ill-suited for high resolution applications to coastlines and estuaries. Here we present results of multiple statistical models that predict daily. gridded surface salinity at 1 km resolution across Chesapeake Bay as a function of level 2 surface reflectance estimates from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard the Aqua platform. Eight statistical methods were tested and it was found that sea surface salinity can be accurately predicted via remote sensed products with an accuracy that is more than sufficient for many physical and ecological applications. For the best-performing statistical model, mean absolute error was 1.82 relative to mean Chesapeake Bay salinity of 16.5. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Robert; Hannon, Mark			Floods, floodplains, delta plains - A satellite imaging approach	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Thirty-three lowland floodplains and their associated delta plains are characterized with data from three remote sensing systems (AMSR-E, SRTM and MODIS). These data provide new quantitative information to characterize Late Quaternary floodplain landscapes and their penchant for flooding over the last decade. Daily proxy records for discharge since 2002 and for each of the 33 river systems can be derived with novel Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) methods. A descriptive framework based on analysis of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data is used to capture the major landscape-scale floodplain elements or zones: 1) container valleys with their long and narrow pathways of largely sediment transit and bypass, 2) floodplain depressions that act as loci for frequent flooding and sediment storage, 3) zones of nodal avulsions common to many continental scale rivers, and often located seaward of container valleys, and 4) coastal floodplains and delta plains that offer both sediment bypass and storage but under the influence of marine processes. The SRTM data allow mapping of smaller-scale architectural elements in unprecedented systematic manner. Floodplain depressions were found to play a major role, which may largely be overlooked in conceptual floodplain models. Lastly, MODIS data (independently and combined with AMSR-E) allows the tracking of flood hydrographs and pathways and sedimentation patterns on a near-daily timescale worldwide. These remote-sensing data show that 85% of the studied major river systems experienced extensive flooding in the last decade. A new quantitative paradigm of floodplain processes, honoring the frequency and extent of floods, can be develop by careful analysis of these new remotely sensed data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Sea ice properties in the Bohai Sea measured by MODIS-Aqua: 2. Study of sea ice seasonal and interannual variability	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												During the 2009-2010 winter, the Bohai Sea experienced its most severe sea ice event in four decades, which caused significant economic losses, affected marine transportation and fishery, and impacted the entire marine ecosystem in the region. Measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite from 2002 to 2010 and surface atmosphere temperature (SAT) data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are used to study and quantify the extreme sea ice event in the 2009-2010 winter and the interannual variability of the regional sea ice properties, as well as the relationship between sea ice and the climate variability in the Bohai Sea. The mean sea ice reflectance from MODIS-Aqua visible and near-infrared wavelengths are 933%, 13.26%, and 12.60% in the months of December 2009, January 2010, and February 2010, respectively, compared with the monthly average sea ice reflectance values (from 2002 to 2010) of 9.35%, 11.21%, and 11.41% in the same three winter months. The sea ice monthly average coverages are similar to 5427, similar to 27,414, and similar to 21,156 km(2) in these three winter months. These values are significantly higher than the averages of monthly sea ice coverage of similar to 2735, similar to 11,119, and similar to 10,287 km(2) in the Bohai Sea in December, January, and February between 2002 and 2010. Most of the sea ice coverage was located in the northern Bohai Sea. Both the intra-seasonal and interannual sea ice variability in the Bohai Sea is found to be related closely to SAT. The mechanism of anomalous SAT and intense sea ice severity are also discussed and attributed to large-scale climate changes due to the variability of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Siberian High (SH).

Impacts of haze on precipitating clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The 94-GHz cloud profiling radar on the CloudSat satellite was used to examine the precipitation response of marine stratocumulus clouds to the increased aerosol burden from oceangoing vessels. Aerosol plumes generated by ships sometimes influence cloud microphysics and, to a largely undetermined extent, precipitation. To assess this response, the locations of over one thousand ship tracks coinciding with the radar were meticulously logged by hand from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Although precipitation detectable by the radar was infrequent, drizzle rates were often suppressed (72% of cases) and lighter in the ship tracks compared to the clouds adjacent to them. Ship plumes primarily decreased average rain rates through reducing the spatial coverage of precipitation. However, larger liquid water paths in ship tracks seldom coincided with the reduced cloud water sink from the suppression of precipitation (in less than 20% of cases). The sign and strength of the precipitation response was primarily tied to the mesoscale convective structure of the clouds. When closed cellular clouds were identified, significant decreases in the relative average liquid water path, rain rate (an average relative decrease of 68%), and rain cover fraction were observed in ship tracks compared to the surrounding clouds. The opposite occurred in the open cell regime where it was more common to find enhanced precipitation in the perturbed clouds. Ship plumes ingested into this regime resulted in significantly deeper and brighter clouds with higher liquid water amounts and rain rates (an average relative increase of 89%).

Effects of Additional Particles on Already Polluted Marine Stratus	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The response of already polluted marine stratocumulus to additional particles was examined by studying the clouds where two ship tracks cross. Nearly 100 such crossings were collected and analyzed using Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral imagery for the daytime passes off the western coast of the United States during the summer months of 4 years. To reduce biases in the retrieved cloud properties caused by the subpixel spatial structure of the clouds, results are presented only for ship tracks found in regions overcast by extensive layers of marine stratus. When two ship tracks cross, one of the tracks exhibits much larger changes in droplet radii when compared with the surrounding unpolluted clouds and is referred to as the dominant ship track. The clouds at the crossing typically exhibit properties that are closer to those of the dominant than to those of the subordinate ship track. To determine whether the additional particles at the crossing affect the dominant track, local gradients in the retrieved cloud properties near the crossing were determined for both ship tracks. Based on the gradients, the clouds at the junction were found to have significantly smaller droplet radii and significantly larger column droplet number concentrations than were predicted based on their values in both ship tracks on either side of the crossing. Comparing the effects of particle loading at the crossings and elsewhere along the ship tracks revealed that the effects decreased as the column droplet number concentration of the clouds being affected increased.																	0022-4928					JUN	2012	69	6					1975	1993		10.1175/JAS-D-11-0291.1								WOS:000304736500014

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 aerosol products (2000-2007) were used to study aerosol spatial and temporal distributions, as well as their variations with local meteorological conditions over East China. By combining Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and aerosol Fine Mode Fraction (FMF), we found that the urban/industrial aerosol and soil dust are possibly two dominant species over northern part, whereas continental and marine aerosols possibly dominate the southern part of East China. Both annual mean AOD and area with high AOD increased from 2000 to 2007, with the largest increase seen in Yangtze River Delta region (YRD). In summer, AOD in East China reached the maximum of about 0.8 in YRD, dominated by fine mode particles. The minimum AOD occurred in winter with mostly coarse mode particles. Local aerosol properties were analyzed in three typical zones: the northern dry zone (I), the central urban/industrial zone (II) and the southern natural background zone (III). Monthly mean AODs in zone I and II were above 0.5 throughout the entire year, with the maximum AOD in June. High FMFs in this period indicated heavy urban and industrial pollution. Monthly mean AODs and FMFs in zone III reached maximum of 0.51 in April and September (up to 90.7%) respectively. High AOD in spring in zone III appears mostly due to the long-range dust transport from the North.

However, products derived from satellite ocean color data continue to suffer from high levels of inaccuracy when compared with in situ measurements of the surface layer of the ocean. This has been particularly pronounced for coastal waters and waters optically classified as Case-II. The early success of using empirical relationships between chlorophyll and simple band ratios to derive estimates of surface layer chlorophyll from the first ocean color satellite sensors' data (i.e. CZCS), has led mainstream ocean color remote sensing and standard ocean color products towards following this approach for subsequent sensors (e.g. SeaWiFS and MODIS). Chlorophyll has continued to be the main focus product but is only related to one of the optical properties of sea water, namely the absorption of light by phytoplankton, whereas empirical band ratio approaches use wavelength banded water leaving radiance resultant from all absorption and scattering of light by all the optically active components of the ocean surface layer. We suggest that using approaches that do not fully exploit remote sensing optical data through a parameterization of the optical properties of sea water, is the main reason for the poor performance of many ocean color products when compared with in situ data. This is in concordance with the International Ocean Color Coordinating Group (IOCCG) and following their recent guidelines, novel inherent optical properties approaches (e.g. for MERIS) and the lines of research that are being used in atmospheric remote sensing, we present a demonstration 'observation operator' system that is based on biogeochemical model output, optical properties (apparent and inherent), and radiative transfer modeling. In the forward mode we demonstrate the system by producing MODIS and SeaWiFS synthetic images of water leaving radiance for the coastal test sites of INSEA. We show that the observation operator approach has the potential to allow the consistent mapping of model variables into observed quantities which simplifies the transport of measurement errors and reduces the need for approximations inherent in previous approaches. In conclusion we discuss the future development and potential of inversion of the system in order to obtain more accurate ocean color biogeochemical products (including chlorophyll) from satellite radiance data for eutrophication assessment. We also highlight the additional advantages there may be for ecological models from having stronger links to bio-optics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Remote sensing is an efficient tool for monitoring these harmful algal blooms (HABs) and studying concerned marine conditions. This study investigated two intensive S. costatum HABs in the ECS by analysis of water distribution and spatial-temporal pattern of four oceanographic parameters derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and QuickSCAT satellite data using multiple remote sensing approaches (composite imagery interpretation, classification, and parameters retrieval). Results show that high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and net primary production (NPP) decrease from the HAB areas toward the open sea. A peak of Chl-a (>10 mg m(-3)) and NPP (>5000 mg.C.m(-2).d(-1)) are considered indicators of large-scale S. costatum blooms in the ECS. Low sea surface temperature (SST; approximately 23 degrees C) are observed in S. costatum HAB areas. In early stages, winds in terms of direction and speed can bring nutrients to facilitate the formation of S. costatum blooms, but then sharply change into unfavorable conditions to cause the final disappearance of HABs. This study also explored multiple oceanographic explanations in the ECS from biochemical, meteorological, physical, and geological perspectives for a better understanding of such S. costatum HABs mechanisms.

Anjana			Advection induced short period anomalies and seasonal features in aerosol optical depth over Bay of Bengal in the W-ICARB region	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Advection of aerosols from adjoining continental regions into the Bay of Bengal (BOB) is considered important in view of its potential aerosol radiative impacts on Indian summer monsoon and the mesoscale weather. Though several reports are available on the features of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over BoB region based on cruise as well as satellite data, day to day variability over the oceanic regions due to day to day variability at the aerosol source regions and advection pathways is yet incomplete. In this article results on a systematic investigation carried out on the AOD vis-a-vis the advection pathways indicate that the day to day variability in AOD could possibly be reflected as spatial variation when short period cruise measurements are made. A statistical analysis of the short period variations using W-ICARB cruise data and the MODIS satellite data for the whole winter 2008-09 show that in 65% of the case, the airmass pathways have the potential of inducing large day to day variability in AOD with 79% of the cases over eastern BoB affected by east Asian airmass, 98% of the cases over western BoB affected by airmass pathways from the Indian region, while the southern BoB is mostly affected by the east Asian aerosol transport, which is significant in altering the mean AOD features over the regions. Long term assessment using MODIS data for the period 2005-2010 indicate that there is a steady increase in AOD over the western BoB during 2005-2010, while it is more or less stable over southern BoB.

J	Bulgarelli, B; Djavidnia, S				Bulgarelli, Barbara; Djavidnia, Samuel			On MODIS Retrieval of Oil Spill Spectral Properties in the Marine Environment	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												With its two daily acquisitions and the possibility to obtain near-real-time data free of charge, the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) shows interesting potential as a cost-effective supplementary tool for oil spill monitoring in the marine environment. The mechanism behind MODIS oil feature detection, as well as the type of information that might be retrieved, strictly depends on the illumination conditions. In the presence of sunglint contamination, MODIS can just locate the oil spill as a sea surface roughness anomaly, in similarity with radar observations, and no additional spectral information can be retrieved. MODIS detection in the absence of sunglint contamination however might allow extraction of oil feature spectral properties, which, in turn, may help in oil discrimination and classification. Careful atmospheric correction must be applied. An example of oil spill spectral property extraction from MODIS images is here shown for the Deepwater Horizon accidental oil spill.																	1545-598X					MAY	2012	9	3					398	402		10.1109/LGRS.2011.2169647								WOS:000301236900016						
J	Heiblum, RH; Koren, I; Altaratz, O				Heiblum, Reuven H.; Koren, Ilan; Altaratz, Orit			New evidence of cloud invigoration from TRMM measurements of rain center of gravity	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Much of the recent focus regarding aerosol effects on convective clouds and rain patterns has been on the possible invigoration of convective clouds by aerosols. Here we approach the issue using new methods, as rain vertical profiles' center of gravity (RCOG) and spread (RS) from TRMM are combined with aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from MODIS to examine this effect in various marine regions worldwide. Careful attention is also given to the meteorological, spatial and temporal variance in each region, as we try to extract and isolate the regional aerosol effect out of the dominant dynamic forcing. We show that for the majority of cases, high AOD values are correlated with higher RCOG and larger RS, indicating significant invigoration of the rain vertical distribution by aerosols.

Krishna			Radiative properties of Bay of Bengal aerosols: Spatial distinctiveness and source impacts	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Simultaneous and collocated measurements of spectrally resolved scattering and absorption coefficients and mass concentration of near-surface composite aerosols in the marine atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), along with incoming shortwave (0.3-3 mm) global solar radiation and columnar spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD), were made on a research cruise during the winter phase of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, Gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB). The aerosol radiative properties revealed distinct spatial features associated with the contrasting outflows from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and East Asia. Both scattering and absorption coefficients depicted very high values (>200 and >15 Mm(-1)) over the northwestern and southeastern BOB and extremely low values (<50 and <10 Mm(-1)) over the central BOB. The mean value of the total scattering coefficient at 550 nm (similar to 123.7 +/- 85.3 Mm(-1)) over the entire BOB during winter was higher than the mean values (similar to 94 +/- 47 Mm(-1)) reported for the premonsoon season. While SSA at 550 nm showed very low values (<0.8) over a very large region in the central BOB and moderately low values over the southern BOB (similar to 0.85-0.9), the columnar AOD varied from the least values of similar to 0.1 over the northeastern BOB to the highest values of similar to 0.8 over the northwestern BOB. While significant cooling was observed at the top of the atmosphere and surface over the northwestern BOB, the atmospheric forcing was found to be significantly high (similar to 15 W m(-2)) over the southern BOB, where the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) at the surface was also found to be high. Examination of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived fire count along with the advection pathways revealed a strong contribution from the emissions of biomass smoke from East Asia, which might be contributing to the enhanced aerosol induced warming over the southern BOB. However, the ARFE at the surface was low over the northwestern BOB, where the advection from IGP was predominant.					Moorthy, K.

An A-train and model perspective on the vertical distribution of aerosols and CO in the Northern Hemisphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We use A-train satellite observations of aerosols and carbon monoxide (CO) (CALIOP, MODIS, and TES) with GEOS-Chem model simulations to analyze long range transport in the Northern Hemisphere over 3 years (December 2006-November 2009), with a focus on the vertical distribution of pollutants. GEOS-Chem underestimates TES observations of CO in all seasons (<25%) except winter. MODIS and GEOS-Chem aerosol optical depths (AOD) are both generally biased high in comparison with CALIOP (0.042 over land/0.036 over ocean and 0.016 over land/-0.0071 over ocean, respectively; for spring seasons, but similar results for all seasons). Comparisons between GEOS-Chem and CALIOP improve when the CALIOP detection limits are accounted for, and the bias over land in particular is reduced (0.010). However, we find that GEOS-Chem with applied detection limits still overestimates the CALIOP observations of aerosol extinction over sources in Asia and Europe, but underestimates in marine environments and over North America in spring and summer. Vertical cross-sections indicate that GEOS-Chem may be removing aerosol too efficiently in the boundary layer in addition to underestimating marine aerosol sources. We show that mimicking the single aerosol type per layer retrieval of CALIOP with GEOS-Chem could lower simulated AOD by 10-30% at midlatitudes. TES and CALIOP observations confirm that while CO is efficiently transported aloft (only 12% of the CO column is within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on average), the efficient removal of aerosol limits export and subsequent transport with over 50% of observed aerosol extinction occurring within the PBL.

J	Painemal, D; Minnis, P				Painemal, David; Minnis, Patrick			On the dependence of albedo on cloud microphysics over marine stratocumulus clouds regimes determined from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The dependence of the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) albedo A on cloud microphysical properties was investigated for the three largest maritime stratocumulus clouds regimes: off California, Southeast Pacific (Chile-Peru), and southwest Africa (Namibia-Angola). Absolute S and relative S-R albedo susceptibilities to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentrations N-d, defined as dA/dN(d) and dA/dln(N-d) respectively, were calculated for the season having maximum cloud cover during the period 2006-2010. Satellite-based susceptibilities were computed by combining an adiabatically based N-d estimate and liquid water path (LWP) derived from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals matched with TOA A from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System. Empirical susceptibility maps were calculated for three constant LWP intervals at 25, 50, and 90 g(-2). It was found that S increases with LWP, with small and spatially homogeneous values for low LWP, and a contrasting increase far offshore for larger LWP values. An overall increase of S-R with LWP was also observed, with larger values near the coast for LWP = 25 and 50 g(-2). A relatively homogeneous spatial pattern of maximum SR values covered most of each regime's domain for a LWP of 90 g(-2). These results highlight the importance of LWP in modulating the albedo susceptibility. The dependencies of S and S-R on LWP are mostly explained by variations in the mean Nd and cloud optical thickness (tau), with an increase of S with LWP linked to a decrease in Nd, whereas S-R increased with t and A, until reaching a maximum for A and t near 0.36-0.4 and 12-14 respectively, and decreasing thereafter, consistent with expectations based on two-stream estimates. Larger S-R values in the Southeast Pacific are thought to be the consequence of a drier and more pristine atmosphere. Radiative transfer simulations with realistic values of above-cloud water vapor path and aerosol optical thickness showed that differing atmospheric compositions could explain why the Chile-Peru regime was the marine stratocumulus cloud deck most susceptible to change its TOA albedo due to fractional changes in N-d.

Krishna			Role of circulation parameters in long range aerosol transport: Evidence from Winter-ICARB	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												This study explores the inevitable role of wind parameters such as wind speed, wind convergence and wind vorticity in the long range transport and distribution of aerosols in the winter time atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the campaign Winter ICARB. MODIS observed aerosol optical depth (AOD), with an excellent agreement with ship borne Microtops AOD, was found to increase over the BoB particularly, in the eastern parts during the course of the campaign. The influence of atmospheric circulation on this increase is examined using the wind field from NCEP reanalysis and computed wind convergence and vorticity for first and second halves (FH and SH) of the campaign along with a back trajectory analysis using HYSPLIT transport and dispersion model. While surface winds over the BoB remained nearly the same throughout the campaign denying the possibility of enhancement in marine aerosol generation, the higher altitude winds altered significantly in SH providing a channel for aerosol transport from the Indian landmass to the BoB in addition to the increased forest fire contribution from south Asia. This suggested mechanism is supported by CALIPSO aerosol extinction profiles over the eastern BoB and the surrounding land masses. Fine particle dominance in MODIS AOD and diminished correlation between ship borne AOD and surface aerosol mass measurements during SH corroborate this inference by indicating the presence of elevated aerosol layers, which can contribute substantially to the radiative effects of the earth-atmosphere system. This study throws light on the importance of wind convergence and vorticity in the investigations on the long range transport and spatial distribution of aerosols.

J	Sumit, K; Devara, PCS; Manoj, MG				Sumit, Kumar; Devara, P. C. S.; Manoj, M. G.			Multi-site characterization of tropical aerosols: Implications for regional radiative forcing	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												A land campaign, as a part of the Indian Space Research Organization-Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISRO-GBP), has been organized using a suit of instruments like AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) Sun/Sky sunphotometer, Microtops-II (MICROprocessor-controlled Total Ozone Portable Spectrometer), short-wave pyranometer from December 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007, over five locations (Ahmedabad, Pune, Sinhgad, Trivandrum and Gadanki) representing different environments. The dominance of different aerosol types such as biomass burning, urban/industrial pollution, marine origin and desert-dust particles is expected at these five sites. In all locations, significant day-to-day variability in AOD and Angstrom exponent is observed. The Angstrom exponent exhibits its lowest values over semi-arid region (Ahmedabad) 0.4-0.7, while it is around 1.8 at rural site (Gadanki). The retrieved volume size distributions for Pune, Ahmedabad and Trivandrum are found to be bimodal with varying concentration of each mode. Interesting feature of this observation is, very low coarse-mode volume concentration observed at Trivandrum even though observations were made about 300 m from the coast. The synergy of results from these complementary measurements is reflected in the computed regional aerosol radiative forcing and heating rates. We have used a radiative transfer model (SBDART) to examine the variations of aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) and heating rates to give an overall estimation of the effect on climate. The ADRE, over different measurement sites, at short wavelength is found to be negative at the surface in the range of -18 to -59W m(-2), and TOA forcing values varied from +0.9 to -8W m(-2).

However, valid relationships between ground level and columnar ground based quantities should be known beforehand. In this study we have performed a comparison between particulate matter measurements at ground level at different cut sizes (10, 2.5 and 1.0 mu m), and the aerosol optical depth obtained by means of a ground based sunphotometer during a multiinstrumental field campaign held in El Arenosillo (Huelva, Spain) from 28 June to 4 July 2006. All the PM fractions were very well correlated with AOD with correlation coefficients that ranged from 0.71 to 0.81 for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. Furthermore, the influence of the mixing layer height in the correlations was explored. The improvement in the correlation when the vertical distribution is taken into account was significant for days with a homogeneous mixing layer. Moreover, the chemical analysis of the individual size fractions allowed us to study the origin of the particulate matter. Secondary components were the most abundant and also well correlated in the three size fractions; but for PM10 fraction, chemical species related to marine origin were best correlated. Finally, we obtained a relationship between MODIS L3 AOD from collection 5.1 and the three PM cut sizes. In spite of being a relatively clean environment, all the techniques were able to capture similar day to day variations during this field campaign.

J	Min, JE; Ryu, JH; Lee, S; Son, S				Min, Jee-Eun; Ryu, Joo-Hyung; Lee, Seok; Son, SeungHyun			Monitoring of suspended sediment variation using Landsat and MODIS in the Saemangeum coastal area of Korea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Suspended sediment concentration (SS) is an important indicator of marine environmental changes due to natural causes such as tides, tidal currents, and river discharges, as well as human activities such as construction in coastal regions. In the Saemangeum area on the west coast of Korea, construction of a huge tidal dyke for land reclamation has strongly influenced the coastal environment. This study used remotely sensed data to analyze the SS changes in coastal waters caused by the dyke construction. Landsat and MODIS satellite images were used for the spatial analysis of finer patterns and for the detailed temporal analysis, respectively. Forty Landsat scenes and 105 monthly composite MODIS images observed during 1985-2010 were employed, and four field campaigns (from 2005 to 2006) were performed to verify the image-derived SS. The results of the satellite data analyses showed that the seawater was clear before the dyke construction, with SS values lower than 20 g/m(3). These values increased continuously as the dyke construction progressed. The maximum SS values appeared just before completion of the fourth dyke. Values decreased to below 5 g/m(3) after dyke construction. These changes indicated tidal current modification. Some eddies and plumes were observed in the images generated from Landsat data. Landsat and MODIS can reveal that coastal water turbidity was greatly reduced after completion of the construction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

QUANTIFICATION OF SOUTHERN OCEAN PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS AND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY VIA SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODELS	CCAMLR SCIENCE												This paper reviews Southern Ocean primary productivity within the framework of satellite remote sensing and the development of food-web models. The satellite ocean colour (chlorophyll) data record is described, from the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) in the late 1970s through to the Ocean Colour and Temperature Scanner (OCTS), the Sea-viewing, Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The characteristics of these data and limitations, such as cloud cover and high solar zenith angle, are discussed with regard to their use in the Southern Ocean. A brief history of algorithms linking ocean colour to primary productivity is presented, focusing on the vertically generalised production model (VGPM) and more recent regional approaches. Using monthly climatologies of SeaWiFS chlorophyll, a phenology of phytoplankton blooms is presented for the major provinces surrounding Antarctica. Some of the published information regarding phytoplankton species composition and succession is summarised. A review of ecosystem and biogeochemical models for the Southern Ocean is presented, with a focus on those models that have been validated using satellite ocean colour data.

Comparison of MODIS cloud microphysical properties with in-situ measurements over the Southeast Pacific	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Utilizing the unique characteristics of the cloud over the Southeast Pacific (SEP) off the coast of Chile during the VOCALS field campaign, we compared satellite remote sensing of cloud microphysical properties against in-situ data from multi-aircraft observations, and studied the extent to which these retrieved properties are sufficiently constrained and consistent to reliably quantify the influence of aerosol loading on cloud droplet sizes. After constraining the spatial-temporal coincidence between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements, we selected 17 non-drizzle comparison pairs. For these cases the mean aircraft profiling times were within one hour of Terra overpasses at both projected and un-projected (actual) aircraft positions for two different averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km. Retrieved quantities that were averaged over a larger domain of 25 km compared better statistically with in-situ observations than averages over a smaller domain of 5 km. Comparison at projected aircraft positions was slightly better than un-projected aircraft positions for some parameters. Overall, both MODIS-retrieved effective radius and LWP were larger but highly correlated with the in-situ measured effective radius and LWP, e. g., for averaging domains of 5 km, the biases are up to 1.75 mu m and 0.02 mm whilst the correlation coefficients are about 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. The observed effective radius difference between the two decreased with increasing cloud drop number concentration (CDNC), and increased with increasing cloud geometrical thickness. Compared to the absolute effective radius difference, the correlations between the relative effective radius difference and CDNC or cloud geometric thickness are weaker. For averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km, the correlation coefficients between MODIS-retrieved and in-situ measured CDNC are 0.91 and 0.93 with fitting slopes of 1.23 and 1.27, respectively. If the cloud adiabaticity is taken into account, better agreements are achieved for both averaging domains (the fitting slopes are 1.04 and 1.07, respectively). Our comparison and sensitivity analysis of simulated retrievals demonstrate that both cloud geometrical thickness and cloud adiabaticity are important factors in satellite retrievals of effective radius and cloud drop number concentration. The large variabilities in cloud geometrical thickness and adiabaticity, the dependencies of cloud microphysical properties on both quantities (as demonstrated in our sensitivity study of simulated retrievals), and the inability to accurately account for either of them in retrievals lead to some uncertainties and biases in satellite retrieved cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration. However, strong correlations between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements suggest that satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration can be used to investigate aerosol indirect effects qualitatively.

Assimilating GlobColour ocean colour data into a pre-operational physical-biogeochemical model	OCEAN SCIENCE												As part of the GlobColour project, daily chlorophyll a observations, derived using remotely sensed ocean colour data from the MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors, are produced. The ability of these products to be assimilated into a pre-operational global coupled physical-biogeochemical model has been tested, on both a hindcast and near-real-time basis, and the impact on the system assessed. The assimilation was found to immediately and considerably improve the bias, root mean square error and correlation of modelled surface chlorophyll concentration compared to the GlobColour observations, an improvement which was sustained throughout the year and in every ocean basin. Errors against independent in situ chlorophyll observations were also reduced, both at and beneath the ocean surface. However, the model fit to in situ observations was not consistently better than that of climatology, due to errors in the underlying model. The assimilation scheme used is multivariate, updating all biogeochemical model state variables at all depths. The other variables were not degraded by the assimilation, with annual mean surface fields of nutrients, alkalinity and carbon variables remaining of similar quality compared to climatology. There was evidence of improved representation of zooplankton concentration, and reduced errors were seen against in situ observations of nitrate and pCO(2), but too few observations were available to conclude about global model skill. The near-real-time GlobColour products were found to be sufficiently reliable for operational purposes, and of benefit to both operational-style systems and reanalyses.																	1812-0784						2012	8	5					751	771		10.5194/os-8-751-2012								WOS:000310472500002

Fate of river Tiber discharge investigated through numerical simulation and satellite monitoring	OCEAN SCIENCE												The aim of this study was to determine the dispersion of passive pollutants associated with the Tiber discharge into the Tyrrhenian Sea using numerical marine dispersion models and satellite data. Numerical results obtained in the simulation of realistic discharge episodes were compared with the corresponding evolution of the spatial distributions of MODIS diffuse light attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K490), and the results were discussed with reference to the local climate and the seasonal sub-regional circulation regime. The numerical model used for the simulation of the sub-tidal circulation was a Mediterranean sub-regional scale implementation of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), nested in the large-scale Mediterranean Forecasting System. The nesting method enabled the model to be applied to almost every area in the Mediterranean Sea and also to be used in seasons for which imposing climatological boundary conditions would have been questionable. Dynamical effects on coastal circulation and on water density due to the Tiber discharge were additionally accounted for in the oceanographic model by implementing the river estuary as a point source of a buoyant jet. A Lagrangian particle dispersion model fed with the POM current fields was then run in order to reproduce the effect of the turbulent transport of passive tracers mixed in the plume with the coastal flow. Two significant episodes of river discharge in both winter and summer conditions were discussed in this paper. It was found that the winter regime was characterized by the presence of a strong coastal jet flowing with the ambient current. In summer the prevailing wind regime induced coastal downwelling conditions, which tended to confine the riverine waters close to the shore. In such conditions sudden wind reversals due to local weather perturbations, causing moderate local upwelling, proved to be the only effective way to disperse the tracers offshore, moving the plume from the coast and detaching large pools of freshwater.

Estimating marine aerosol particle volume and number from Maritime Aerosol Network data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												As well as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol composition and concentration (number, volume, or mass) are of interest for a variety of applications. However, remote sensing of these quantities is more difficult than for AOD, as it is more sensitive to assumptions relating to aerosol composition. This study uses spectral AOD measured on Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) cruises, with the additional constraint of a microphysical model for unpolluted maritime aerosol based on analysis of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) inversions, to estimate these quantities over open ocean. When the MAN data are subset to those likely to be comprised of maritime aerosol, number and volume concentrations obtained are physically reasonable. Attempts to estimate surface concentration from columnar abundance, however, are shown to be limited by uncertainties in vertical distribution. Columnar AOD at 550 nm and aerosol number for unpolluted maritime cases are also compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, for both the present Collection 5.1 and forthcoming Collection 6. MODIS provides a best-fitting retrieval solution, as well as the average for several different solutions, with different aerosol microphysical models. The "average solution" MODIS dataset agrees more closely with MAN than the "best solution" dataset. Terra tends to retrieve lower aerosol number than MAN, and Aqua higher, linked with differences in the aerosol models commonly chosen. Collection 6 AOD is likely to agree more closely with MAN over open ocean than Collection 5.1. In situations where spectral AOD is measured accurately, and aerosol microphysical properties are reasonably well-constrained, estimates of aerosol number and volume using MAN or similar data would provide for a greater variety of potential comparisons with aerosol properties derived from satellite or chemistry transport model data. However, without accurate AOD data and prior knowledge of microphysical properties, such attempts are fraught with high uncertainties.

Potential for a biogenic influence on cloud microphysics over the ocean: a correlation study with satellite-derived data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosols have a large potential to influence climate through their effects on the microphysics and optical properties of clouds and, hence, on the Earth's radiation budget. Aerosol-cloud interactions have been intensively studied in polluted air, but the possibility that the marine biosphere plays an important role in regulating cloud brightness in the pristine oceanic atmosphere remains largely unexplored. We used 9 yr of global satellite data and ocean cli-matologies to derive parameterizations of the temporal variability of (a) production fluxes of sulfur aerosols formed by the oxidation of the biogenic gas dimethylsulfide emitted from the sea surface; (b) production fluxes of secondary organic aerosols from biogenic organic volatiles; (c) emission fluxes of biogenic primary organic aerosols ejected by wind action on sea surface; and (d) emission fluxes of sea salt also lifted by the wind upon bubble bursting. Series of global monthly estimates of these fluxes were correlated to series of potential cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) numbers derived from satellite (MODIS). More detailed comparisons among weekly series of estimated fluxes and satellite-derived cloud droplet effective radius (re) data were conducted at locations spread among polluted and clean regions of the oceanic atmosphere. The outcome of the statistical analysis was that positive correlation to CCN numbers and negative correlation to re were common at mid and high latitude for sulfur and organic secondary aerosols, indicating both might be important in seeding cloud droplet activation. Conversely, primary aerosols (organic and sea salt) showed widespread positive correlations to CCN only at low latitudes. Correlations to re were more variable, non-significant or positive, suggesting that, despite contributing to large shares of the marine aerosol mass, primary aerosols are not widespread major drivers of the variability of cloud microphysics. Validation against ground measurements pointed out that the parameterizations used captured fairly well the variability of aerosol production fluxes in most cases, yet some caution is warranted because there is room for further improvement, particularly for primary organic aerosol. Uncertainties and synergies are discussed, and recommendations of research needs are given.

Automated remote sensing of sediment plumes for identification of runoff from the Greenland ice sheet	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The viability of employing sediment plumes emanating from outlets along the western margin of the Greenland ice sheet as indicators of runoff is assessed. An automated sediment plume quantification system based on daily 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) band 1 reflectance imagery is developed. Coherent plumes are identified using spectral thresholds and polygon tracing. Validation employs imagery quality-control procedures and manual verification of plume areas. Outlets at land-terminating margins with wide and straight fjord geometries deliver the most accurate and consistent results. Plume area observations are also possible at marine-terminating margins with relatively static fronts and low proximal sea-ice concentrations. Variability in plume area is examined with reference to Special Satellite Microwave Imager (SSM/I)-derived daily melt extent at the hydrologic catchment scale. At annual timescales, plume areas tend to co-vary with surface melt extent, indicating that more mass is lost by runoff during years of extensive melting. Some synchronicity in plume areas from different catchments is apparent. At seasonal and daily timescales, plumes from individual outlets primarily relate to catchment-specific melting.

Optical characterisation of suspended particles in the Mackenzie River plume (Canadian Arctic Ocean) and implications for ocean colour remote sensing	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate change significantly impacts Arctic shelf regions in terms of air temperature, ultraviolet radiation, melting of sea ice, precipitation, thawing of permafrost and coastal erosion. Direct consequences have been observed on the increasing Arctic river flow and a large amount of organic carbon sequestered in soils at high latitudes since the last glacial maximum can be expected to be delivered to the Arctic Ocean during the coming decade. Monitoring the fluxes and fate of this terrigenous organic carbon is problematic in such sparsely populated regions unless remote sensing techniques can be developed and proved to be operational. The main objective of this study is to develop an ocean colour algorithm to operationally monitor dynamics of suspended particulate matter (SPM) on the Mackenzie River continental shelf (Canadian Arctic Ocean) using satellite imagery. The water optical properties are documented across the study area and related to concentrations of SPM and particulate organic carbon (POC). Robust SPM and POC : SPM proxies are identified, such as the light backscattering and attenuation coefficients, and relationships are established between these optical and biogeochemical parameters. Following a semi-analytical approach, a regional SPM quantification relationship is obtained for the inversion of the water reflectance signal into SPM concentration. This relationship is reproduced based on independent field optical measurements. It is successfully applied to a selection of MODIS satellite data which allow estimating fluxes at the river mouth and monitoring the extension and dynamics of the Mackenzie River surface plume in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Good agreement is obtained with field observations representative of the whole water column in the river delta zone where terrigenous SPM is mainly constrained (out of short periods of maximum river outflow). Most of the seaward export of SPM is observed to occur within the west side of the river mouth. Future work will require the validation of the developed SPM regional algorithm based on match-ups with field measurements, then the routine application to ocean colour satellite data in order to better estimate the fluxes and fate of SPM and POC delivered by the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean.

Knowledge of the variability of the freshwater extent into the GBR lagoon is relevant for marine park management to develop strategies for improving ecosystem health and risk assessments. In this study, freshwater extent has been estimated for the entire GBR lagoon area from daily satellite observations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) between 2002 and 2010. To enable a reliable mapping of freshwater plumes we applied a physics-based coastal ocean colour algorithm, that simultaneously retrieves chlorophyll-a, non-algal particulate matter and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), from which we used CDOM as a surrogate for salinity (S) for mapping the freshwater extent.

No significant changes were found in marine phytoplankton in the first few months after the oil spill. However, a big phytoplankton bloom was observed after 10 months, when Chl-a increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mg m(-3). After considering the time-series variability of Chl-a and SST and the spatial variability of Chl-a and bathymetry, we concluded that this phytoplankton bloom was probably related to the Lebanon oil spill.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013	Pan, Gang/0000-0003-0054-6516												0143-1161						2012	33	23			SI		7482	7490		10.1080/01431161.2012.685982								WOS:000306286200012

Sensitivity to deliberate sea salt seeding of marine clouds - observations and model simulations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Sea salt seeding of marine clouds to increase their albedo is a proposed technique to counteract or slow global warming. In this study, we first investigate the susceptibility of marine clouds to sea salt injections, using observational data of cloud droplet number concentration, cloud optical depth, and liquid cloud fraction from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board the Aqua and Terra satellites. We then compare the derived susceptibility function to a corresponding estimate from the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM). Results compare well between simulations and observations, showing that stratocumulus regions off the west coast of the major continents along with large regions over the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are susceptible. At low and mid latitudes the signal is dominated by the cloud fraction. We then carry out geo-engineering experiments with a uniform increase over ocean of 10(-9) kg m(-2) s(-1) in emissions of sea salt particles with a dry modal radius of 0.13 mu m, an emission strength and areal coverage much greater than proposed in earlier studies. The increased sea salt concentrations and the resulting change in marine cloud properties lead to a globally averaged forcing of -4.8 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, more than cancelling the forcing associated with a doubling of CO2 concentrations. The forcing is large in areas found to be sensitive by using the susceptibility function, confirming its usefulness as an indicator of where to inject sea salt for maximum effect. Results also show that the effectiveness of sea salt seeding is reduced because the injected sea salt provides a large surface area for water vapor and gaseous sulphuric acid to condense on, thereby lowering the maximum supersaturation and suppressing the formation and lifetime of sulphate particles. In some areas, our simulations show an overall reduction in the CCN concentration and the number of activated cloud droplets decreases, resulting in a positive forcing.																	1680-7316						2012	12	5					2795	2807		10.5194/acp-12-2795-2012								WOS:000301547500035

The composition and variability of atmospheric aerosol over Southeast Asia during 2008	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We use a nested version of the GEOS-Chem global 3-D chemistry transport model to better understand the composition and variation of aerosol over Borneo and the broader Southeast Asian region in conjunction with aircraft and satellite observations. Our focus on Southeast Asia reflects the importance of this region as a source of reactive organic gases and aerosols from natural forests, biomass burning, and food and fuel crops. We particularly focus on July 2008 when the UK BAe-146 research aircraft was deployed over northern Malaysian Borneo as part of the ACES/OP3 measurement campaign. During July 2008 we find using the model that Borneo (defined as Borneo Island and the surrounding Indonesian islands) was a net exporter of primary organic aerosol (42 kT) and black carbon aerosol (11 kT). We find only 13% of volatile organic compound oxidation products partition to secondary organic aerosol (SOA), with Borneo being a net exporter of SOA (15 kT). SOA represents approximately 19% of the total organic aerosol over the region. Sulphate is mainly from aqueous-phase oxidation (68%), with smaller contributions from gas-phase oxidation (15%) and advection into the regions (14%). We find that there is a large source of sea salt, as expected, but this largely deposits within the region; we find that dust aerosol plays only a relatively small role in the aerosol burden. In contrast to coincident surface measurements over Northern Borneo that find a pristine environment with evidence for substantial biogenic SOA formation we find that the free troposphere is influenced by biomass burning aerosol transported from the northwest of the Island and further afield. We find several transport events during July 2008 over Borneo associated with elevated aerosol concentrations, none of which coincide with the aircraft flights. We use MODIS aerosol optical depths (AOD) data and the model to put the July campaign into a longer temporal perspective. We find that Borneo is where the model has the least skill at reproducing the data, where the model has a negative bias of 76% and only captures 14% of the observed variability. This model performance reflects the small-scale island-marine environment and the mix of aerosol species, with the model showing more skill at reproducing observed AOD over larger continental regions such as China where AOD is dominated by one aerosol type. The model shows that AOD over Borneo is approximately evenly split between organic and sulphate aerosol with sea salt representing 10-20% during May-September; we find a similar breakdown over continental Southeast Asia but with less sea salt aerosol and more dust aerosol. In contrast, East China AOD is determined mainly by sulphate aerosol and a seasonal source of dust aerosol, as expected. Realistic sensitivity runs, designed to test our underlying assumptions about emissions and chemistry over Borneo, show that model AOD is most sensitive to isoprene emissions and organic gas-phase partitioning but all fail to improve significantly upon the control model calculation. This emphasises the multi-faceted dimension of the problem and the need for concurrent and coordinated development of BVOC emissions, and BVOC chemistry and organic aerosol formation mechanisms.

Hydrologic controls on coastal suspended sediment plumes around the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Rising sea levels and increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet have heightened the need for direct observations of meltwater release from the ice edge to ocean. Buoyant sediment plumes that develop in fjords downstream of outlet glaciers are controlled by numerous factors, including meltwater runoff. Here, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery is used to average surface suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in fjords around similar to 80% of Greenland from 2000-2009. Spatial and temporal patterns in SSC are compared with positive-degree-days (PDD), a proxy for surface melting, from the Polar MM5 regional climate model. Over this decade significant geographic covariance occurred between ice sheet PDD and fjord SSC, with outlet type (land-vs. marine-terminating glaciers) also important. In general, high SSC is associated with high PDD and/or a high proportion of land-terminating glaciers. Unlike previous site-specific studies of the Watson River plume at Kangerlussuaq, temporal covariance is low, suggesting that plume dimensions best capture interannual runoff dynamics whereas SSC allows assessment of meltwater signals across much broader fjord environments around the ice sheet. Remote sensing of both plume characteristics thus offers a viable approach for observing spatial and temporal patterns of meltwater release from the Greenland ice sheet to the global ocean.

Basal crevasses in Larsen C Ice Shelf and implications for their global abundance	CRYOSPHERE												Basal crevasses extend upwards from the base of ice bodies and can penetrate more than halfway through the ice column under conditions found commonly on ice shelves. As a result, they may locally modify the exchange of mass and energy between ice shelf and ocean, and by altering the shelf's mechanical properties could play a fundamental role in ice shelf stability. Although early studies revealed that such features may be abundant on Antarctic ice shelves, their geometrical properties and spatial distribution has gained little attention. We investigate basal crevasses in Larsen C Ice Shelf using field radar survey, remote sensing and numerical modelling. We demonstrate that a group of features visible in MODIS imagery are the surface expressions of basal crevasses in the form of surface troughs, and find that basal crevasses can be generated as a result of stresses well downstream of the grounding line. We show that linear elastic fracture mechanics modelling is a good predictor of basal crevasse penetration height where stresses are predominantly tensile, and that measured surface trough depth does not always reflect this height, probably because of snow accumulation in the trough, marine ice accretion in the crevasse, or stress bridging from the surrounding ice. We conclude that all features visible in MODIS imagery of ice shelves and previously labelled simply as "crevasses", where they are not full thickness rifts, must be basal crevasse troughs, highlighting a fundamental structural property of many ice shelves that may have been previously overlooked.

A search for large-scale effects of ship emissions on clouds and radiation in satellite data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Ship tracks are regarded as the most obvious manifestations of the effect of anthropogenic aerosol particles on clouds (indirect effect). However, it is not yet fully quantified whether there are climatically relevant effects on large scales beyond the narrow ship tracks visible in selected satellite images. A combination of satellite and reanalysis data is used here to analyze regions in which major shipping lanes cut through otherwise pristine marine environments in subtropical and tropical oceans. We expect the region downwind of a shipping lane is affected by the aerosol produced by shipping emissions but not the one upwind. Thus, differences in microphysical and macrophysical cloud properties are analyzed statistically. We investigate microphysical and macrophysical cloud properties as well as the aerosol optical depth and its fine-mode fraction for the years 2005-2007 as provided for by retrievals of the two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments. Water-cloud properties include cloud optical depth, cloud droplet effective radius, cloud top temperature, and cloud top pressure. Large-scale meteorological parameters are taken from ERA-Interim reanalysis data and microwave remote sensing (sea surface temperature). We analyze the regions of interest in a Eulerian and Lagrangian sense, i.e., sampling along shipping lanes and sampling along wind trajectories, respectively. No statistically significant impacts of shipping emissions on large-scale cloud fields could be found in any of the selected regions close to major shipping lanes. In conclusion, the net indirect effects of aerosols from ship emissions are not large enough to be distinguishable from the natural dynamics controlling cloud presence and formation.

In general, SMVs had weaker westerlies and southerlies than CMVs at all latitudes and levels. The E-W wind comparison showed small vertical variations with a mean difference of -0.4 m s(-1), -1 m s(-1), -0.7 m s(-1) and corresponding rmsd of 2.4 m s(-1), 3.8 m s(-1), 3.5 m s(-1) for low-, mid-, and high-level clouds, respectively. The N-S wind discrepancies were larger and steadily increased with altitude, having a mean difference of -0.8 m s(-1), -2.9 m s(-1), -4.4 m s(-1) and rmsd of 3.5 m s(-1), 6.9 m s(-1), 9.5 m s(-1) at low, mid, and high levels. The best overall agreement was found in marine stratocumulus off Namibia, while differences were larger in the Tropics and convective clouds. The SMVs were typically assigned to higher altitudes than CMVs. Attributing each observed height difference to MISR and/or Meteosat-9 retrieval biases will require further research; nevertheless, we already identified a few regions and cloud types where CMV height assignment seemed to be the one in error. In thin mid-and high-level clouds over Africa and Arabia as well as in broken marine boundary layer clouds the 10.8-mm brightness temperature-based heights were often biased low due to radiance contributions from the warm surface. Contrarily, low-level CMVs in the South Atlantic were frequently assigned to mid levels by the CO2-slicing method in multilayer situations. We also noticed an apparent cross-swath dependence in SMVs, whereby retrievals were less accurate on the eastern side of the MISR swath than on the western side. This artifact was traced back to sub-pixel MISR co-registration errors, which introduced cross-swath biases in E-W wind, N-S wind, and height of 0.6 m s(-1), 2.6 m s(-1), and 210 m.

The spaceborne ocean color sensors provide synoptic and regular radiometric data and can be used for applying environmental policies if the data is converted into relevant biogeochemical properties. We adapted and developed semi-analytical and empirical algorithms to estimate the Secchi depth from satellite ocean color data in both coastal and oceanic waters. The development of the algorithms is based on the use of a comprehensive in situ bio-optical dataset The algorithms are validated using an extensive set of coincident satellite estimates and in situ measurements of the Secchi depth (so-called matchups). More than 400 matchups are compiled for the MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors. The comparison between Secchi depth retrievals from remote sensing data and in situ measurements yields determination coefficients (R-2) between 0.50 and 0.73, depending on the sensor and algorithm. The type II linear regression slopes and intercepts vary between 0.95 and 1.46, and between -0.8 and 6.2 in, respectively. While semi-analytical algorithms provide the most promising results on in situ data, the empirical one proves to be more robust on remote sensing data because it is less sensitive to error due to erroneous atmospheric corrections. Using ocean color archives, one can derive maps of ocean transparency for different areas.

In agreement with the strategy applied for other sensors, a vicarious calibration is conducted using in situ data from the Marine Optical BuoY offshore Hawaii, and leads to vicarious adjustment factors departing from 1 by 0.2% to 1.6%. The three field data sets used for validation have been collected at fixed stations in the northern Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea, and in a variety of European waters in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean and North Seas. Excluding Baltic waters, the mean absolute relative difference vertical bar psi vertical bar between satellite and field data is 10-14% for the spectral interval 490-560 nm, 16-18% at 443 nm, and 24-26% at 413 nm. In the Baltic Sea, the vertical bar psi vertical bar values are much higher for the blue bands characterized by low R-RS amplitudes, but similar or lower at 560 and 665 nm. For the three validation sets, the root-mean-square differences decrease from approximately 0.0013 sr(-1) at 413 nm to 0.0002 sr(-1) at 665 nm, and are found similar or lower than those obtained for SeaWiFS or MODIS-Aqua. As derived from SeaDAS, the R-RS records associated with these three missions thus provide a multi-mission data stream of consistent accuracy.

On the Structural Approach to Studying the Variability of the Marine Environment Using Data from Color Ocean Scanners	OCEANOLOGY												The authors propose to treat the structure of the sea surface images from the ocean color scanners (OCS) as a complex integrated indication of the state of the marine environment. Supposedly, such an approach will make current the information on the water environment processes hidden in the spectral-radiance patterns of arbitrary shapes. They are typical of inland seas, straits, and other transition areas but attract no attention due to recognition difficulties. The authors give preliminary estimates of the repeatability of mesoscale structures found from data of the OCSs SeaWiFS and MODIS for the period of 1998-2007 in the oceanologically diverse Caspian Sea regions. The authors' approach is shown to be useful for studying the long-term variability of marine aquatic areas from the satellite data archives.

High-resolution simulations and tracking of air masses	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This article investigates an extreme rainfall event occurred over wide areas of central Europe on August 11-13, 2002. By using a synergistic approach that includes regional modeling, air mass tracking, and observational data sets, the importance of moisture accumulation processes in the Western Mediterranean basin (WMB) is acknowledged as an important mechanism responsible for the magnitude of this event. The RAMS-HYPACT modeling system is used to track air masses from potential marine sources of evaporation. MODIS water vapor products, wind profilers and surface rain gauge measurements are used to substantiate our simulations. Results show that most of the precipitation occurring in central Europe during the initiation of the rainfall episode (August 11) came from vapor accumulated over 4 days (August 6-9) within the WMB: the vapor was transported, after the irruption of the Vb cyclone Ilse, through the Italian Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea, into the target area, causing the precipitation episode. On August 12 and 13 the marine sources of evaporation changed to include the north-Atlantic region. The north-African convergence region, the eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea are revealed to be sources more related to the intense rainfall experienced in eastern Europe. The subsidence-related processes through which pollutants and water vapor can accumulate for several days in the WMB are shown to be very relevant for this event. The quantification of the evaporative sources, responsible for the extreme rainfall events in central Europe, and the relative importance of marine and terrestrial sources within a chosen regional domain are discussed in the companion following article.

In addition to pollutants, Asian dust particles are also transported to the island during long-range transport events. Episodic transport of dust and secondary particles was observed during intensive measurements in the spring (March 31-April 11) and fall (October 13-26) of 2009. In this study, the chemical characteristics of long-range-transported particles were investigated based on highly time-resolved ionic measurements with a particle-into-liquid system coupled with an online ion chromatograph (PILS-IC) that simultaneously measures concentrations of cations (Li(+), Na(+) NH(4)(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+)) and anions (F(-), Cl(-), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-)). The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) distribution retrieved by the modified Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (M-BAER) algorithm from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data confirmed the presence of a thick aerosol plume coming from the Asian continent towards the Korean peninsula. Seven distinctive events involving the long-range transport (LRT) of aerosols were identified and studied, the chemical components of which were strongly related to sector sources. Enrichment of acidic secondary aerosols on mineral dust particles, and even of sea-salt components, during transport was observed in this study. Backward trajectory, chemical analyses, and satellite aerosol retrievals identified two distinct events: a distinctively high [Ca(2+)+Mg(2+)]/[Na(+)] ratio (> 2.0), which was indicative of a preprocessed mineral dust transport event, and a low [Ca(2+)+Mg(2+)]/[Na(+)] ratio (< 2.0), which was indicative of severe aging of sea-salt components on the processed dust particles. Particulate Cl(-) was depleted by up to 85% in spring and 50% in the fall. A consistent fraction of carbonate replacement (FCR) averaged 0.53 in spring and 0.55 in the fall. Supporting evidences of Cl(-) enrichment on the marine boundary layer prior to a dust front were also found. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

Multi-sensor satellite time series of optical properties and chlorophyll-a concentration in the Adriatic Sea	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Advanced remote sensing techniques and regional algorithms are combined to produce and analyze a 12-year multi-sensor time series of bio-optical properties for the Adriatic Sea. First, a multi-sensor series of normalized water-leaving radiance L-WN is created with an optically-based merging technique applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS data, then distributions of inherent optical properties (IOPs) are obtained with a semi-analytical bio-optical model. Additionally, Chla is computed by two regional empirical algorithms associated with two classes of optical properties representative of open ocean waters and Adriatic coastal regions (Classes 1 and 2, respectively). The domain of applicability of each algorithm is dynamically determined on the basis of the L-WN input spectrum by a novelty detection approach. The various satellite products are validated using a comprehensive bio-optical time series collected in the northern Adriatic. At the basin level, the frequency of occurrence of Classes 1 and 2 are 61% and 10%, respectively, with Class 2 waters particularly located in the northern part and characterized by higher levels of Chla and IOPs. The annual cycle of Chla over the 12-year period exhibits significant variations in amplitude and phase: moreover, the annual cycle shows a reduced amplitude during a period centered on 2004 for a time interval that varies with the region. In the northern Adriatic, the overall level of Chla appears lower between 2003 and 2008 compared to the beginning of the series. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, ZB; Platnick, S				Zhang, Zhibo; Platnick, Steven			An assessment of differences between cloud effective particle radius retrievals for marine water clouds from three MODIS spectral bands	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud product provides three separate 1 km resolution retrievals of cloud particle effective radii (r(e)), derived from 1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m band observations. In this study, differences among the three size retrievals for maritime water clouds (designated as r(e,1.6) r(e,2.1) and r(e,3.7)) were systematically investigated through a series of case studies and global analyses. Substantial differences are found between r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) retrievals (Delta r(e,3.7-2.1)), with a strong dependence on cloud regime. The differences are typically small, within +/- 2 mu m, over relatively spatially homogeneous costal stratocumulus cloud regions. However, for trade wind cumulus regimes, r(e,3.7) was found to be substantially smaller than r(e,2.1), sometimes by more than 10 mu m. The correlation of Delta r(e,3.7-2.1) with key cloud parameters, including the cloud optical thickness (tau), r(e) and a cloud horizontal heterogeneity index (H-sigma) derived from 250m resolution MODIS 0.86 mu m band observations, were investigated using one month of MODIS Terra data. It was found that differences among the three r(e) retrievals for optically thin clouds (tau < 5) are highly variable, ranging from -15 mu m to 10 mu m, likely due to the large MODIS retrieval uncertainties when the cloud is thin. The Delta r(e),(3.7-2.1) exhibited a threshold-like dependence on both r(e,2.1) and H-sigma. The r(e,3.7) is found to agree reasonably well with re,(2.1) when r(e,2.1) is smaller than about 15 mu m, but becomes increasingly smaller than r(e,2.1) once r(e,2.1) exceeds this size. All three r(e) retrievals showed little dependence when cloud is relatively homogenous (H-sigma < 0.3 defined as standard deviation divided by the mean for the 250 m pixels within a 1 km pixel retrieval). However, for inhomogeneous clouds (H-sigma > 0.3), both r(e, 1.6) and r(e,2.1) were seen to increase quickly with H-sigma. On the other hand, r(e,3.7) statistics showed little dependence on H-sigma and remained relatively stable over the whole range of H-sigma values. Potential contributing causes to the substantial r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) differences are discussed. In particular, based on both 1-D and 3-D radiative transfer simulations, we have elucidated mechanisms by which cloud heterogeneity and 3-D radiative effects can cause large differences between r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) retrievals for highly inhomogeneous clouds. Our results suggest that the contrast in observed Delta r(e,3.7-2.1) between cloud regimes is correlated with increases in both cloud re and Hs. We also speculate that in some highly inhomogeneous drizzling clouds, vertical structure induced by drizzle and 3-D radiative effects might operate together to cause dramatic differences between r(e,3.7) and r(e,2.1) retrievals.

Effect of coarse marine aerosols on stratocumulus clouds	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In contrast to fine anthropogenic aerosols (radii similar to<0.5 mu m), large aerosol particles are thought to enhance cloud droplet growth, promote precipitation formation and reduce cloud albedo. While shown in cloud simulation models, the impact of coarse aerosols on marine stratocumulus clouds lacks observational evidence. Here, by combining data from AMSR-E and MODIS, both aboard NASA's satellite Aqua, we link the amount of coarse marine aerosols emitted to the atmosphere through wind-driven processes with the size of cloud droplets, at the world's largest deck of marine stratocumulus clouds over the southeastern Pacific. For constrained meteorological conditions, approximately 1/2 of the change in droplet effective radius (r(eff)) is attributed to increase in coarse marine aerosol optical depth (tau(cm)), as surface winds intensify. Accordingly, a twofold increase in tau(cm) is associated with a 1.4 mu m +/-0.11 increase in r(eff). Our results suggest that climatic changes in surface winds may play an important role not only over land for wind-power estimation but also over the oceans by changing clouds reflectance and lifetime.

Quantification of Monthly Mean Regional-Scale Albedo of Marine Stratiform Clouds in Satellite Observations and GCMs	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Planetary albedo the reflectivity for solar radiation is of singular importance in determining the amount of solar energy taken in by the Earth-atmosphere system. Modeling albedo, and specifically cloud albedo, correctly is crucial for realistic climate simulations. A method is presented herein by which regional cloud albedo can be quantified from the relation between total albedo and cloud fraction, which in observations is found to be approximately linear on a monthly mean scale. This analysis is based primarily on the combination of cloud fraction data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and albedo data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), but the results presented are also supported by the combination of cloud fraction and proxy albedo data from satelliteborne lidar [Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CA LIPSO)]. These data are measured and derived completely independently from the CERES-MODIS data. Applied to low-level marine stratiform clouds in three regions (off the coasts of South America, Africa, and North America), the analysis reveals regionally uniform monthly mean cloud albedos, indicating that the variation in cloud shortwave radiative properties is small on this scale. A coherent picture of low "effective" cloud albedo emerges, in the range from 0.35 to 0.42, on the basis of data from CERES and MODIS. In its simplicity, the method presented appears to be useful as a diagnostic tool and as a constraint on climate models. To demonstrate this, the same method is applied to cloud fraction and albedo output from several current-generation climate models [from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP3), archive]. Although the multimodel mean cloud albedo estimates agree to within 20% with the satellite-based estimates for the three focus regions, model-based estimates of cloud albedo are found to display much larger variability than do the observations, within individual models as well as between models.

Suresh			Spatial heterogeneities in aerosol size distribution over Bay of Bengal during Winter-ICARB Experiment	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This work examines the aerosol physical properties and size distribution measured in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) over entire Bay of Bengal (BOB) and Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) during the Winter Integrated Campaign on Aerosols, Gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB). The measurements were taken using the GRIMM optical particle counter from 27th December 2008 to 30th January 2009. The results show large spatial heterogeneities regarding both the total aerosol number concentrations (N-T) and the size distributions over BoB, which in turn indicates the variations in the source strength or advection from different regions. The aerosol number size distribution seems to be bimodal in the 72% of the cases and can also be parameterized by uni-modal or by a combination of power-law and uni-modal distributions for the rest of the cases. The mode radius for accumulation and coarse-mode particles ranges from similar to 0.1-0.2 mu m and similar to 0.6-0.8 mu m, respectively. In the northern BoB and along the Indian coast, the aerosols are mainly of sub-micron size with effective radius (R-eff) ranging between 0.25 and 0.3 mu m highlighting the strong anthropogenic influence, while in the open oceanic areas they are much higher (0.4-0.6 mu m). It was also found that the sea-surface wind plays a considerable role in the super-micron number concentration. R-eff and mode radius for coarse-mode aerosols. Using the relation between N-T and columnar AOD from Terra and Aqua-MODIS we found that the majority of the aerosols are within the lower MABL, while in some areas vertical heterogeneities also exist.

Comparison of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ocean aerosol retrievals with ship-based Sun photometer measurements from the Around the Americas expedition	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Around the Americas expedition was a 25,000 mile sailing circumnavigation of the North and South American continents, in coastal waters, that took place from June 2009 to June 2010. The broad geographical span of the voyage made it possible to measure marine aerosol optical depths in regions where surface measurements are not frequently taken. These were measured with a handheld Microtops II Sun photometer. In this study we compare these measurements with the ocean aerosol product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua and Terra platforms. Results for aerosol optical depth (AOD) show a strong relationship between both measurements, with most values from MODIS falling within published expectations. However, MODIS values are biased high relative to surface observations for small optical depth values. There appears to be a relationship between these discrepancies in measurements and surface wind speed, with a group of values showing overestimation at wind speeds near and over 6 m/s and a second, smaller group showing underestimation for calmer conditions. For derived Angstrom exponents, it is found that higher differences occur at low AOD. No relationship between these differences and wind speed is found.

This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties in the visible from the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region assuming that the seawater is totally absorbant in this latter part of the spectrum. However, the non-negligible water-leaving radiance in the NIR which is characteristic of turbid waters may lead to an overestimate of the atmospheric radiance in the whole visible spectrum with increasing severity at shorter wavelengths. This may result in significant errors, if not complete failure, of various algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration, inherent optical properties and biogeochemical parameters of surface waters. This paper presents results of an inter-comparison study of three methods that compensate for NIR water-leaving radiances and that are based on very different hypothesis: 1) the standard Sea WiFS algorithm (Stumpfet al., 2003; Bailey et al., 2010) based on a bio-optical model and an iterative process; 2) the algorithm developed by Ruddick et al. (2000) based on the spatial homogeneity of the NIR ratios of the aerosol and water-leaving radiances; and 3) the algorithm of Kuchinke et al. (2009) based on a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean spectral optimization inversion. They are compared using normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w) in the visible. The reference source for comparison is ground-based measurements from three AERONET-Ocean Color sites, one in the Adriatic Sea and two in the East Coast of USA. Based on the matchup exercise, the best overall estimates of the nL(w) are obtained with the latest SeaWiFS standard algorithm version with relative error varying from 14.97% to 35.27% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 670 nm respectively. The least accurate estimates are given by the algorithm of Ruddick, the relative errors being between 16.36% and 42.92% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 412 nm, respectively. The algorithm of Kuchinke appears to be the most accurate algorithm at 412 nm (30.02%), 510 (15.54%) and 670 nm (32.32%) using its default optimization and bio-optical model coefficient settings. Similar conclusions are obtained for the aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical thickness tau(865) and the Angstrom exponent, alpha(510, 865)). Those parameters are retrieved more accurately with the SeaWiFS standard algorithm (relative error of 33% and 54.15% for tau(865) and alpha(510, 865)). A detailed analysis of the hypotheses of the methods is given for explaining the differences between the algorithms. The determination of the aerosol parameters is critical for the algorithm of Ruddick et al. (2000) while the bio-optical model is critical for the algorithm of Stumpf et al. (2003) utilized in the standard SeaWiFS atmospheric correction and both aerosol and bio-optical model for the coupled atmospheric-ocean algorithm of Kuchinke. The Kuchinke algorithm presents model aerosol-size distributions that differ from real aerosol-size distribution pertaining to the measurements. In conclusion, the results show that for the given atmospheric and oceanic conditions of this study, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm is most appropriate for estimating the marine and aerosol parameters in the given turbid waters regions.

J	Oo, M; Holz, R				Oo, Min; Holz, Robert			Improving the CALIOP aerosol optical depth using combined MODIS-CALIOP observations and CALIOP integrated attenuated total color ratio	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This paper aims to evaluate CALIOP aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval using MODIS AOD with the goal of improving the CALIOP selection of the lidar ratio leveraging the vertical resolved CALIOP and multispectral MODIS observations. Comparing the MODIS fine mode ratio to CALIOP, we find that the CALIOP integrated attenuated total color ratio provides sensitivity to the aerosol size and type. This finding can be used to better constrain the lidar ratio and improve the CALIOP AOD independent from MODIS. To retrieve the aerosol optical depth from CALIOP requires knowledge of the aerosol lidar ratio that varies significantly as a function of aerosol type. For most CALIOP retrievals the lidar ratio is estimated by correlating CALIOP observables (depolarization and backscatter) with precomputed lidar ratio climatologies. Applying a lidar ratio not representative of the observed aerosols can result in significant AOD biases and is one of the primary sources of uncertainty in the current CALIOP AOD. We demonstrate that over ocean the MODIS sensitivity to the fine-and coarse-mode aerosol mixing ratios provides additional constraints to the aerosol lidar ratio. When MODIS fine-mode retrievals are collocated with CALIOP, the improved lidar ratio significantly reduces the CALIOP AOD mean biases from vertical bar 0.064 vertical bar to vertical bar 0.020 vertical bar when compared to MODIS. In addition, we demonstrate that the CALIOP integrated attenuated total color ratio is correlated with the MODIS fine and coarse mixing ratios in marine environments. This finding suggests that for a CALIOP-only AOD retrieval the integrated attenuated total color ratio can be used to better constrain the lidar ratio. Using the CALIOP integrated attenuated total color ratio, the CALIOP-only AOD retrieval improves the AOD mean biases (vertical bar 0.064 vertical bar to vertical bar 0.007 vertical bar) when compared to the MODIS AOD.																	2169-897X					JUL 16	2011	116								D14201	10.1029/2010JD014894								WOS:000292840600001

Model Estimates of the Land and Ocean Contributions to Biospheric Carbon and Water Fluxes Using MODIS Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Land and ocean are often treated separately in modeling studies despite their close links through the carbon, water, and energy cycles. However, biospheric models, particularly when used in conjunction with recent satellite datasets, provide a new, fully coupled, global perspective. The current investigation uses a new version of the Grid Enabled Integrated Earth system (GENIE-SF) to compare both the magnitude and the seasonal and zonal variation in water flux [evaporation E and precipitation (PPT)] and carbon flux [net primary productivity (NPP)] above land and ocean. GENIE-SF contains state-of-the-art representations of photosynthesis and is driven by the phenological cycles of leaf area index (LAI) and marine chlorophyll concentration, both recorded with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors. The current study reveals the striking uniformity of the ocean-atmosphere carbon and water flux exchange, both temporally and spatially, compared to the corresponding land-atmosphere exchange. Although biospheric annual NPP (108 +/- 27 GtC yr(-1)) is split almost equally between land (52% +/- 9%) and ocean (48% +/- 9%), the oceanic contribution to biospheric annual E exceeds that of the land by a factor of 6.7 +/- 1.7. Simulations conducted over a 50-yr period (1951-2000) suggest that a 16% increase in land NPP, owing mainly to CO2 fertilization, may be partially offset by a decline in marine productivity.																	0894-8755					JUL	2011	24	14					3558	3574		10.1175/2011JCLI3957.1								WOS:000292863300002

In such cases, neural network (NN) techniques have a long history in inverting complex nonlinear systems. The process we adopt utilizes two NNs in parallel. The first NN is used to relate the remote sensing reflectance at available MODIS-visible wavelengths (except the 678 nm fluorescence channel) to the absorption and backscatter coefficients at 442 nm (peak of chlorophyll absorption). The second NN separates algal and nonalgal absorption components, outputting the ratio of algal-to-nonalgal absorption. The resulting synthetically trained algorithm is tested using both the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data Set (NOMAD), as well as our own field datasets from the Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound, New York. Very good agreement is obtained, with R-2 values of 93.75%, 90.67%, and 86.43% for the total, algal, and nonalgal absorption, respectively, for the NOMAD. For our field data, which cover absorbing waters up to about 6 m(-1), R-2 is 91.87% for the total measured absorption.

Direct and semidirect aerosol effects of southern African biomass burning aerosol	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Direct and semidirect radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols from southern African fires during July-October are investigated using 20 year runs of the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) coupled to a slab ocean model. Aerosol optical depth is constrained using observations in clear skies from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and for aerosol layers above clouds from Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). Over the ocean, where the aerosol layers are primarily located above cloud, negative top of atmosphere (TOA) semidirect radiative effects associated with increased low cloud cover dominate over a weaker positive all-sky direct radiative effect (DRE). In contrast, over the land where the aerosols are often below or within cloud layers, reductions in cloud liquid water path (LWP) lead to a positive semidirect radiative effect that dominates over a near-zero DRE. Over the ocean, the cloud response can be understood as a response to increased lower tropospheric stability (LTS) which is caused both by radiative heating in overlying layers and surface cooling in response to direct aerosol forcing. The marine cloud changes are robust to changes in the cloud parameterization (removal of the hard-wired dependence of clouds on LTS), suggesting that they are physically realistic. Over land, decreased LWP is consistent with weaker convection driven by increased static stability. Over the entire region the overall TOA radiative effect from the biomass burning aerosols is almost zero due to opposing effects over the land and ocean. However, the surface forcing is strongly negative, which leads to a reduction in precipitation and also a reduction in sensible heat flux. The former is primarily realized through reductions in convective precipitation on both the southern and northern flanks of the convective precipitation region spanning the equatorial rain forest and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the southern Sahel. The changes are consistent with the low-level aerosol-forced cooling pattern. The results highlight the importance of semidirect radiative effects and precipitation responses for determining the climatic effects of aerosols in the African region.

Two-component modeling of the optical properties of a diatom bloom in the Southern Ocean	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Diatom cells have distinctive optical characteristics, originating from their relatively large cell size, fucoxanthin content and silica cell wall. It has been proposed that diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooms can be identified by optical remote sensing and that specifically tuned chlorophyll and primary production algorithms should be applied in regions where these blooms are present. However there have been few studies on how the optical properties of diatom blooms change as they progress from active growth to senescence, and it is unlikely that measurements on laboratory cultures encompass the full range of physiological states found in natural waters. We have therefore examined the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the waters around the island of South Georgia at the end of the spring diatom bloom. Considerable variability was found in the relationships between the inherent optical properties and analytically determined chlorophyll a concentrations even in the surface layer, which meant that the usual bio-optical assumptions for Case 1 waters did not apply. To account for this variability, phytoplankton absorption and scattering were modeled as a two-component mixture, with the components representing actively growing and senescent material. The specific inherent optical properties of the two components were derived by linear regression of total IOPs against chlorophyll concentration and a fraction of the suspended mineral concentration. These specific IOPs were used to develop radiative transfer models of diatom blooms in varying stages of growth and senescence. Remote sensing reflectances calculated using this technique confirmed the tendency of the standard algorithms employed in SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS data processing to under-estimate near-surface chlorophyll concentrations in diatom blooms. However the inclusion of increasing proportions of senescent material had a significant effect on algorithm performance only at chlorophyll concentrations below 10 mg m(-3). Optical depths predicted by the model around South Georgia were 9+/-2 m at 512 nm, indicating that a large fraction of the phytoplankton biomass was located below the depth from which the remote sensing signals originated.

A novel Satellite-based Ocean Monitoring System for Mexico	CIENCIAS MARINAS												To analyze patterns in marine productivity, harmful algal blooms, thermal stress in coral reefs, and oceanographic processes, optical and biophysical marine parameters, such as sea surface temperature, and ocean color products, such as chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient, total suspended matter concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence line height, and remote sensing reflectance, are required. In this paper we present a novel automatic Satellite-based Ocean Monitoring System (SATMO) developed to provide, in near real-time, continuous spatial data sets of the above-mentioned variables for marine-coastal ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico, northeastern Pacific Ocean, and western Caribbean Sea, with 1 km spatial resolution. The products are obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images received at the Direct Readout Ground Station (located at CONABIO) after each overpass of the Aqua and Terra satellites. In addition, at the end of each week and month the system provides composite images for several ocean products, as well as weekly and monthly anomaly composites for chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature. These anomaly data are reported for the first time for the study region and represent valuable information for analyzing time series of ocean color data for the study of coastal and marine ecosystems in Mexico, Central America, and the western Caribbean.

Did the northeastern Gulf of Mexico become greener after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Assessment of direct and indirect impacts of oil and dispersants on the marine ecosystem in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (April - July 2010) requires sustained observations over multiple years. Here, using satellite measurements, numerical circulation models, and other environmental data, we present some initial results on observed biological changes at the base of the food web. MODIS fluorescence line height (FLH, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass) shows two interesting anomalies. The first is statistically significant (> 1 mg m(-3) of chlorophyll-a anomaly), in an area exceeding 11,000 km(2) in the NEGOM during August 2010, about 3 weeks after the oil well was capped. FLH values in this area are higher (i. e., water is greener) than in any August since 2002, and higher than ever since 2002 in an area of similar to 3,000 km(2). Analyses of ocean circulation and other environmental data suggest that this anomaly may be attributed to the oil spill. The second is a spatially coherent FLH anomaly during December 2010 and January 2011, extending from Mobile Bay to the Florida Keys (mainly between 30 and 100(-m) isobaths). This anomaly appears to have resulted from unusually strong upwelling and mixing events during late fall. Available data are insufficient to support or reject a hypothesis that the subsurface oil may have contributed to the enhanced biomass during December 2010 and January 2011. Citation: Hu, C., R. H.

J	Kruger, O; Grassl, H				Krueger, Olaf; Grassl, Hartmut			Southern Ocean phytoplankton increases cloud albedo and reduces precipitation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Effects of natural and anthropogenic aerosol particles on the radiation budget in cloudy atmospheres are still a major research topic. For example, can an increase or decrease in aerosol particle number, originating from changed dimethylsulfide (DMS) and isoprene emissions by marine phytoplankton, impact the earth radiation budget via increasing or decreasing planetary albedo and lifetime of clouds? And if so, is a shifted cloud droplet spectrum accompanied by a regional change in precipitation? Here, we show by a synergistic analysis of satellite observations (MODIS, SeaWiFS, AIRS, SSM/I and CERES) that the phytoplankton related emission of the mentioned gases into the atmosphere strongly influences cloud properties within a broad latitude belt in the Southern Hemisphere during the austral summer. For this season we detected indirect aerosol effects over the Southern Ocean from 45 degrees S to 65 degrees S, especially in regions with plankton blooms, indicated by high chlorophyll-a concentration in seawater. The strong increase in cloud condensation nuclei column content from 2.0 x 10(8) to more than 5.0 x 10(8) CCN/cm(2) for a chlorophyll increase from 0.3 to about 0.5 mg/m(3) in these regions decreases cloud droplet effective radius and increases cloud optical thickness for water clouds. Consequently, the upward short-wave radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere increases. Our analysis also reveals reduced precipitation over the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone during strong plankton blooms. We suggest that due to fine particles formed in the atmosphere originating from gaseous DMS and possibly isoprene emissions the reduction of precipitation is caused by delayed homogeneous freezing in water clouds.

Modeled optical thickness of sea-salt aerosol	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We simulate the generation and microphysical evolution of sea-salt aerosol using a climatologically driven 3-D microphysical model for the year 2006. We then apply Mie theory to calculate the extinction and scattering efficiencies of our transported, size-resolved sea-salt aerosol, accounting for hygroscopic growth due to changes in ambient relative humidity. We calculate the column optical thickness of our modeled sea-salt aerosol for comparison to three previously published wind speed-dependent clean marine air optical thickness formulations. Variously derived from optical thickness measurements and retrievals taken from the Midway Island AERONET site, the satellite-based MODIS instruments, and the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) site at Mace Head, Ireland, the three formulations report similar background levels of clean marine AOT at zero wind speed but significantly different functional dependencies for nonzero wind speeds. We find that our modeled sea-salt aerosol optical thickness very closely depends on the square of surface wind speed under steady state conditions. This relationship is consistent across all latitudes. However, due to the fact that steady state winds are seldom maintained, the 24 h mean wind is more frequently applicable to calculations of sea-salt AOT, with only slightly diminished accuracy.

We introduce a new method, the strong constraint iterative ensemble smoother, for solving the general coupled physical-biological parameter estimation problem where model nonlinearities may be relevant. The forward model is posed in four ways: (1) advection-diffusion, (2) linear advection-diffusion-reaction, (3) nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction, and (4) a nonlinear nutrient-phytoplankton model. Hindcast skill is demonstrated through analysis of the fit to independent data in a series of experiments utilizing MODIS chlorophyll imagery from the Middle Atlantic Bight during summer of 2006. The data assimilative model demonstrates skill over a range of presumed observational error. Both the purely physical model (advection-diffusion only) and the coupled physical-biological models exhibit skill fitting unassimilated data. The skill of the coupled physical-biological models is greater than the skill of the advection-diffusion model, owing at least in part to greater degrees of freedom in those inversions.

J	Fettweis, MP; Nechad, B				Fettweis, Michael P.; Nechad, Bouchra			Evaluation of in situ and remote sensing sampling methods for SPM concentrations, Belgian continental shelf (southern North Sea)	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Large sets of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration data from in situ and remote sensing (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, MODIS) samplings in the Belgian nearshore area (southern North Sea) are combined in order to evaluate their heterogeneity and the sampling techniques. In situ SPM concentration measurements are from a vessel (tidal cycle) and from a tripod. During the tidal cycle measurements, vertical profiles of SPM concentration have been collected; these profiles have been used as a link between satellite surface and near-bed tripod SPM concentrations. In situ time series at fixed locations using a tripod are excellent witnesses of SPM concentrations under all weather conditions and may catch SPM concentration variability with a much finer scale. The heterogeneity has been statistically assessed by comparing the SPM concentration frequency distributions. Tidal cycle, tripod and MODIS datasets have different distributions and represent a different subpopulation of the whole SPM concentrations population. The differences between the datasets are related to meteorological conditions during the measurements; to near-bed SPM concentration dynamics, which are partially uncoupled from processes higher up in the water column; to the sampling methods or schemes and to measurement uncertainties. In order to explain the differences between the datasets, the tripod data have been subsampled using wave height conditions and satellite and tidal cycle sampling schemes. It was found that satellites and low-frequent tidal cycle measurements are biased towards good weather condition or spring-summer seasons (satellite). The data show that the mean surface SPM concentration derived from satellite data is slightly lower than from in situ tidal cycle measurements, whereas it is significantly lower than the mean SPM concentration interpolated to the water surface from the tripod measurements. This is explained by the errors arising from the interpolation along the vertical profiles, but also by the fact that satellite-measured signal saturates in the visible band used to retrieve SPM concentration in very turbid waters.																	1616-7341	1616-7228				MAR	2011	61	2-3			SI		157	171		10.1007/s10236-010-0310-6								WOS:000289528200002

Analyses of pigment and absorption data revealed that the phytoplankton community was dominated by pico- and nanophytoplankton, particularly at the deep chlorophyll maximum. Based on cluster analysis of remotely sensed data, three dynamic provinces were defined for the region. A 5-year time-series of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration provided information on the annual cycle of these properties. To implement the computation of primary production on a synoptic scale, parameters characterizing the biomass profiles and photosynthesis-irradiance relationships were assigned using four protocols: two regional approaches, a regression with surface chlorophyll, and the nearest-neighbour method (NNM), which has the advantage of assigning parameters on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Monthly images of primary production were computed over an annual cycle using MODIS chlorophyll a concentration. The NNM and the use of dynamic provinces emerged as the methods of choice for parameter assignment. Finally, a new approach from remotely sensed data was developed to estimate production-to-carbon ratios, a key input to Ecopath models. The results contribute to ecotrophic analysis of the Lesser Antilles Pelagic Ecosystem project.																	1054-3139					MAR	2011	68	4					751	765		10.1093/icesjms/fsq182								WOS:000287495200014

Coastal Aerosol Profiling with a Camera Lidar and Nephelometer	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												A bistatic lidar configuration of a wide-angle camera (100 degrees) and vertically pointed laser (532 nm) was used to profile aerosols at a coastal site. Aerosol profiles were measured on two evenings from the surface through the boundary layer. The site, on the eastern tip of the Big Island of Hawaii, is influenced by both marine boundary layer aerosols and breaking waves. Two nephelometers, located at 7 and 25 m above sea level, were compared directly with the 0.5-m-altitude resolution of the camera lidar (clidar). At 7 m, changes in aerosol were tracked quite well by the clidar. At 25 m the aerosol was fairly constant and a useful comparison could only be made with averaged values. The clidar results showed a steep gradient (decreasing with altitude) in the aerosol extinction from 7 to about 35 m. The gradient continued to 200 m at a lower rate. This demonstrated the use of the clidar in characterizing the environment for the in situ aerosol sampling. Both a measured and a NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-derived aerosol phase function, representing similar marine conditions but from different locations, were used to convert the single-angle clidar scatter to extinction. The measured function gave the best fit to the near-surface nephelometer data. The extinction/backscatter ratio, derived by comparing the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth to the integrated clidar profile, was higher than the long-term average value from the AERONET aerosol phase function.																	0739-0572					MAR	2011	28	3					418	425		10.1175/2010JTECHA1482.1								WOS:000289045900010

Based on nine different types of remote sensing data provided by NASA, laboratory experiment of the Anatahan samples, and a 3-D ocean circulation model developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the postvolcanic ocean biogeochemical response to the Anatahan eruption was explored. It was observed that soon after the eruption, the aerosol optical depth abruptly increased from the pre-eruption loading of similar to 0.1 to similar to 2. In the week following the eruption, a "bloom-like" patch was observed by NASA's Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ocean color sensor. Based on the chlorophyll a, fluorescence line height (FLH), at-sensor total radiance, and normalized water-leaving radiance data obtained by MODIS, the cause of the bloom-like patch was diagnosed. The results suggest that the patch was most likely a mixture of suspended volcanic particles and a phytoplankton bloom. FLH was found to be similar to 9-17 x 10(-3) mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) in the patch and similar to 3-5 x 10-3 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) in the ambient water, indicating that a 2-5-fold increase in biological activity occurred during the week following the eruption. Satellite altimetry indicated that the bloom took place in the presence of downwelling and was not a result of upwelled nutrients in this oligotrophic ocean. Analysis of satellite ocean color spectra of the bloom region found similar spectra as the reference Trichodesmium spectra. Laboratory experiments further substantiate the satellite observations which show elevated concentrations of limiting nutrients provided by the Anatahan samples, and the averaged soluble nitrate, phosphate, and Fe were 42, 3.1, and 2.0 nM, respectively. Though it was not possible to obtain in situ observations of the ocean biogeochemical responses that followed the Anatahan eruption, this study provided evidence based on remote sensing data and laboratory experiment that fertilization of volcanic aerosols occurred following this eruption in one of the most oligotrophic low-nutrient low-chlorophyll ocean deserts on Earth.

Detecting the Ratio of Rain and Cloud Water in Low-Latitude Shallow Marine Clouds	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Satellite observations are used to deduce the relationship between cloud water and precipitation water for low-latitude shallow marine clouds. The specific sensors that facilitate the analysis are the collocated Cloud Sat profiling radar and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The separation of the cloud water and precipitation water signals relies on the relative insensitivity of MODIS to the presence of precipitation water in conjunction with estimates of the path-integrated attenuation of the Cloud Sat radar beam while explicitly accounting for the effect of precipitation water on the observed MODIS optical depth. Variations in the precipitation water path are shown to be associated with both the cloud water path and the cloud effective radius, suggesting both macrophysical and microphysical controls on the production of precipitation water. The method outlined here is used to place broad bounds on the mean relationship between the precipitation water path and the cloud water path in shallow marine clouds, given certain clearly stated assumptions. The ratio of precipitation water to cloud water is shown to increase from zero at low cloud water path values to roughly 0.5 at 500 g m(-2) of cloud water. The retrieval results further show that the median influence of precipitation on the observed optical depth increases monotonically with optical depth varying between 1% and 5% at 500 g m(-2) of cloud water with the source of the uncertainty deriving from the assumption of the nature of the precipitation drop size distribution.

J	Christensen, MW; Stephens, GL				Christensen, Matthew W.; Stephens, Graeme L.			Microphysical and macrophysical responses of marine stratocumulus polluted by underlying ships: Evidence of cloud deepening	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Ship tracks observed by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) were analyzed to determine the extent to which aerosol plumes from ships passing below marine stratocumulus alter the microphysical and macrophysical properties of the clouds. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery was used to distinguish ship tracks embedded in closed, open, and undefined mesoscale cellular cloud structures. The impact of aerosol on the microphysical cloud properties in both the closed and open cell regimes were consistent with the changes predicted by the Twomey hypothesis. For the macrophysical changes, differences were observed between regimes. In the open cell regime, polluted clouds had significantly higher cloud tops (16%) and more liquid water (39%) than nearby unpolluted clouds. However, in the closed cell regime, polluted clouds exhibited no change in cloud top height and had less liquid water (-6%). Both microphysical (effective radius) and macrophysical (liquid water path) cloud properties contribute to a fractional change in cloud optical depth; in the closed cell regime the microphysical contribution was 3 times larger than the macrophysical contribution. However, the opposite was true in the open cell regime where the macrophysical contribution was nearly 2 times larger than the microphysical contribution because the aerosol probably increased cloud coverage. The results presented here demonstrate key differences aerosols have on the microphysical and macrophysical responses of boundary layer clouds between mesoscale stratocumulus convective regimes.

A simple, binary classification algorithm for the detection of Trichodesmium spp. within the Great Barrier Reef using MODIS imagery	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												A binary classification algorithm to detect the presence of high surface concentrations of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. was developed for high spatial resolution (250 m) imagery of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Above-water hyperspectral radiometric measurements of dense Trichodesmium surface aggregations (>10 mu g/L Chlorophyll a) showed that the water-leaving radiance L-w at wavelengths greater than 700 nm were much higher in magnitude (>0.05 W m(-2)sr(-1)) relative to the visible wavelengths 400-700 nm (<0.03 W m(-2)sr(-1)). The binary classification algorithm is based on three criteria. The first criteria relied on the difference in magnitude between the MODIS normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) at the 859 and 678 nm wavebands. The magnitude of the nLw at the 555 and 645 nm wavebands relative to nLw 678 nm waveband formed the second and third criteria, respectively. The classification algorithm was tested on a small subset of 13 MODIS images with corresponding Trichodesmium sea-truths and yielded an 85% accuracy. Fine-scale features consistent with dense Trichodesmium surface aggregations, such as eddy swirls and windrows, appear to be well represented with the algorithm results. The algorithm was also found to be robust in the presence of highly reflective, potential confounding effects.

Time series data suggested a decrease in Chl a concentration following the oil spill, but an increase occurring in May 2010. A 4000 km(2) patchy phytoplankton bloom with a high concentration of 13.8 mg m(-3) occurred southeast of the platform, which coincided with the location the residual oil spill finally moved to. The Chl a was usually high in that area in May, but reached a peak in May 2010: the monthly Chl a for May 2010 was one and a half times higher than that of the average value for May between 2003 and 2009. The present study also analysed as many as 15 cases of major marine oil spills in the world and discussed their impacts on phytoplankton. The results suggested that the increase of Chl a may have relations with the oil spill incident. Natural seasonal variability is also an important factor for the formation of the phytoplankton bloom.

The [CHL] retrieval algorithms which are applied to MODIS imagery show various degrees of accuracy depending on the presence of Case 1 and Case 2 waters (C1W and C2W). The current paper presents the adaptation of a recently proposed algorithm based on Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) to characterize water types using MODIS data. The algorithm is applied to 26 MODIS images taken over the Western Mediterranean basin from 2003 to 2009. The value of a SAM indicator of proximity to Case 1 waters is first assessed towards in situ measurements collected during the same period. The results confirm that the fuzzy categorization into C1-C2W can be used to guide the application of different algorithms. In this way, the accuracy of [CHL] estimation is decidedly enhanced both in oceanic and coastal areas.

Influence of continental advection on aerosol characteristics over Bay of Bengal (BoB) in winter: results from W-ICARB cruise experiment	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The transport of aerosols and pollutants from continental India to the adjoining oceanic areas is a major topic of concern and several experimental campaigns have been conducted over the region focusing on aerosol characteristics and their climate implications. The present study analyzes the spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) variations over Bay of Bengal (BoB) during Winter-Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB) from 27 December 2008 to 30 January 2009 and investigates the influence of the adjoining landmass to the marine aerosol field. High AOD(500) values (>0.7) occurred over northern BoB due to outflow of aerosols and pollutants from the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP); low AOD(500) (0.1-0.2) was observed in central and southern BoB, far away from the mainland. The Angstrom exponent "alpha" was observed to be high (>1.2) near coastal waters, indicating relative abundance of accumulation-mode continental aerosols. On the other hand, over southern BoB its values dropped below similar to 0.7. National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data on winds at 850 and 700 hPa, along with air-mass trajectories calculated using Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, suggested transport of continental aerosols from central and northern India over the BoB. On the other hand, when the ship was crossing the eastern BoB, the aerosol loading was strongly affected by air-masses originating from Southeast Asia, causing an increase in AOD and alpha. Biomass-burning episodes over the region played an important role in the observed aerosol properties. Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD(550) and cruise measured AOD(550) showed good agreement (R-2 = 0.86 and 0.77, respectively) over BoB, exhibiting similar AOD and alpha spatio-temporal variation.																	0992-7689	1432-0576					2011	29	8					1423	1438		10.5194/angeo-29-1423-2011								WOS:000294455800010

Study of internal wave generation and propagation features in non-tidal seas based on satellite synthetic aperture radar data	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												Despite the intense attention paid to internal wave (IW) investigation, the most experimentally studied and theoretically described are internal gravitational waves in shelf zones of oceans and tidal seas appearing during the interaction of tidal currents with the margin of the shelf. Information on surface manifestations of internal waves in enclosed seas, such as the Black and Caspian seas, is almost absent. In this paper, the results of study of the peculiarities of generation and propagation of nontidal internal waves are presented; the study is carried out on the basis of combined analysis in data of marine surface radiolocation and data of optical and infrared satellite-borne sensors. The experimental basis of investigation is radar images of the marine surface derived with the help of Synthetic Aperture Radars, onboard the Envisat and ERS-2 satellites. Additionally, the data of the following sensors belonging to the optical and infrared ranges were used for the purpose of radar image interpretation: MODIS (onboard the Aqua/Terra satellite), MERIS (Envisat), and AVHRR (NOAA). Surface manifestations of IWs in the northeastern part of the Black Sea and in the Caspian Sea have been found in radar imagery for the first time, their pattern of spatial and temporal variation has been reconstructed. The possible factors leading to generation of the observed nontidal IWs are determined and suppositions about the corresponding generation mechanisms are made. In particular, the IW manifestations recorded in the northeastern part of the Black Sea are localized in the vicinity of the boundaries of eddies or hydrological fronts; this fact evidences for the frontal mechanism of generation, at which IWs are radiated by a nonstationary (moving and/or inertially oscillating) front. The most probable main sources of generation of IWs detected in the Caspian Sea are longitudinal one-knot seiches, whose knot point is located near the Apsheron sill.

However, applications are hampered by the incompleteness of imagery and by some quality problems. The Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions methodology (DINEOF) allows calculation of missing data in geophysical datasets without requiring a priori knowledge about statistics of the full dataset and has previously been applied to SST reconstructions. This study demonstrates the reconstruction of complete space-time information for 4 years of surface chlorophyll a (CHL), total suspended matter (TSM) and sea surface temperature (SST) over the Southern North Sea (SNS) and English Channel (EC). Optimal reconstructions were obtained when synthesising the original signal into 8 modes for MERIS CHL and into 18 modes for MERIS TSM. Despite the very high proportion of missing data (70%), the variability of original signals explained by the EOF synthesis reached 93.5% for CHL and 97.2% for TSM. For the MODIS TSM dataset, 97.5% of the original variability of the signal was synthesised into 14 modes. The MODIS SST dataset could be synthesised into 13 modes explaining 98% of the input signal variability. Validation of the method is achieved for 3 dates below 2 artificial clouds, by comparing reconstructed data with excluded input information. Complete weekly and monthly averaged climatologies, suitable for use with ecosystem models, were derived from regular daily reconstructions. Error maps associated with every reconstruction were produced according to Beckers et al. (2006). Embedded in this error calculation scheme, a methodology was implemented to produce maps of outliers, allowing identification of unusual or suspicious data points compared to the global dynamics of the dataset Various algorithm artefacts were associated with high values in the outlier maps (undetected cloud edges, haze areas, contrails, and cloud shadows). With the production of outlier maps, the data reconstruction technique becomes also a very efficient tool for quality control of optical remote sensing data and for change detection within large databases.

Greenland marine-terminating glacier area changes: 2000-2010	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Area changes at 39 of the widest Greenland marine-terminating glacier outlets are measured in consecutive annual end-of-melt-season Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scenes spanning ten annual intervals (2000-10). The rates of cumulative area change for glaciers and ice shelves are well represented by linear least-squares fits, R = -0.99 and R = -0.94, with average rates of -70 and -65 km(2) a(-1), respectively. Collectively, during this decade, the 39 glaciers lost a cumulative area of 1368 km2. More than three-quarters of the total area change occurred north of 72 degrees N. The largest 11-year area change for a single glacier during the survey period is the 311 km(2) loss. at Humboldt Glacier. The largest annual change for a single glacier was extreme compared with the others, where Petermann glacier retreated 17 km between 3 and 5 August 2010. For the 10 year sample, on average, the count of glaciers retreating is twice that advancing. A larger distinction is evident considering area change, with the ratio of retreat and advance, on average, nine times the gain. For glaciers with ice shelves, we find no year with collective area gain.

A new method for retrieval of the extinction coefficient of water clouds by using the tail of the CALIOP signal	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A method is developed based on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) level 1 attenuated backscatter profile data for deriving the mean extinction coefficient of water droplets close to cloud top. The method is applicable to low level (cloud top < 2 km), opaque water clouds in which the lidar signal is completely attenuated beyond about 100 m of penetration into the cloud. The photo multiplier tubes (PMTs) of the 532 nm detectors (parallel and perpendicular polarizations) of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) both exhibit a non-ideal recovery of the lidar signal after striking a strongly backscattering target (such as water cloud or surface). Therefore, the effects of any transient responses of CALIOP on the attenuated backscatter profile of the water cloud must first be removed in order to obtain a reliable (validated) attenuated backscatter profile. Then, the slope of the exponential decay of the validated water cloud attenuated backscatter profile, and the multiple scattering factor are used for deriving the mean extinction coefficient of low-level water cloud droplets close to cloud top. This novel method was evaluated and compared with the previous method which combined the cloud effective radius (3.7-mu m) reported by MODIS with the lidar depolarization ratios measured by CALIPSO to estimate the mean extinction coefficient. Statistical results show that the extinction coefficients derived by the new method based on CALIOP alone agree reasonbably well with those obtained in the previous study using combined CALIOP and MODIS data. The mean absolute relative difference in extinction coefficient is about 13.4%. An important advantage of the new method is that it can be used to derive the extinction coefficient also during night time, and it is also applicable when multi-layered clouds are present. Overall, the stratocumulus dominated regions experience larger day-night differences which are all negative and seasonal. However, a contrary tendency consisted in the global mean values. The global mean cloud water extinction coefficients during different seasons range from 26 to 30 km(-1), and the differences between day and night time are all positive and small (about 1-2 km(-1)). In addition, the global mean layer-integrated depolarization ratios of liquid water clouds during different seasons range from 0.2 to 0.23, and the differences between day and night also are small, about 0.01.

Global distribution of sea salt aerosols: new constraints from in situ and remote sensing observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We combine in situ measurements of sea salt aerosols (SS) from open ocean cruises and ground-based stations together with aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from MODIS and AERONET, and the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to provide new constraints on SS emissions over the world's oceans. We find that the GEOS-Chem model using the Gong (2003) source function overestimates cruise observations of coarse mode SS mass concentrations by factors of 2-3 at high wind speeds over the cold waters of the Southern, North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Furthermore, the model systematically underestimates SS over the warm tropical waters of the Central Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. This pattern is confirmed by SS measurements from a global network of 15 island and coastal stations. The model discrepancy at high wind speeds (>6 m s(-1)) has a clear dependence on sea surface temperature (SST). We use the cruise observations to derive an empirical SS source function depending on both wind speed and SST. Implementing this new source function in GEOS-Chem results in improved agreement with in situ observations, with a decrease in the model bias from +64% to +33% for the cruises and from +32% to -5% for the ground-based sites. We also show that the wind speed-SST source function significantly improves agreement with MODIS and AERONET AOD, and provides an explanation for the high AOD observed over the tropical oceans. With the wind speed-SST formulation, global SS emissions show a small decrease from 5200 Mg yr(-1) to 4600 Mg yr(-1), while the SS burden decreases from 9.1 to 8.5 mg m(-2). The spatial distribution of SS, however, is greatly affected, with the SS burden increasing by 50% in the tropics and decreasing by 40% at mid- and high-latitudes. Our results imply a stronger than expected halogen source from SS in the tropical marine boundary layer. They also imply stronger radiative forcing of SS in the tropics and a larger response of SS emissions to climate change than previously thought.

Space-based evaluation of interactions between aerosols and low-level Arctic clouds during the Spring and Summer of 2008	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study explores the indirect effects of anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols on Arctic clouds by co-locating a combination of MODIS and POLDER cloud products with output from the FLEXPART tracer transport model. During the activities of the International Polar Year for the Spring and Summer of 2008, we find a high sensitivity of Arctic cloud radiative properties to both anthropogenic and biomass burning pollution plumes, particularly at air temperatures near freezing or potential temperatures near 286 K. However, the sensitivity is much lower at both colder and warmer temperatures, possibly due to increases in the wet and dry scavenging of cloud condensation nuclei: the pollution plumes remain but the component that influences Arctic clouds has been removed along transport pathways. The analysis shows that, independent of local temperature, cloud optical depth is approximately four times more sensitive to changes in pollution levels than is cloud effective radius. This suggests that some form of feedback mechanism amplifies the radiative response of Arctic clouds to pollution through changes in cloud liquid water path.

Investigating organic aerosol loading in the remote marine environment	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosol loading in the marine environment is investigated using aerosol composition measurements from several research ship campaigns (ICEALOT, MAP, RHaMBLe, VOCALS and OOMPH), observations of total AOD column from satellite (MODIS) and ship-based instruments (Maritime Aerosol Network, MAN), and a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of oceanic OM emission inventories to date, by employing aerosol composition measurements obtained from campaigns with wide spatial and temporal coverage. The model underestimates AOD over the remote ocean on average by 0.02 (21 %), compared to satellite observations, but provides an unbiased simulation of ground-based Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations. Comparison with cruise data demonstrates that the GEOS-Chem simulation of marine sulfate, with the mean observed values ranging between 0.22 mu gm(-3) and 1.34 mu gm(-3), is generally unbiased, however surface organic matter (OM) concentrations, with the mean observed concentrations between 0.07 mu gm(-3) and 0.77 mu gm(-3), are underestimated by a factor of 2-5 for the standard model run. Addition of a sub-micron marine OM source of approximately 9 TgC yr(-1) brings the model into agreement with the ship-based measurements, however this additional OM source does not explain the model underestimate of marine AOD. The model underestimate of marine AOD is therefore likely the result of a combination of satellite retrieval bias and a missing marine aerosol source (which exhibits a different spatial pattern than existing aerosol in the model).

Assessing regional scale predictions of aerosols, marine stratocumulus, and their interactions during VOCALS-REx using WRF-Chem	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study assesses the ability of the recent chemistry version (v3.3) of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) model to simulate boundary layer structure, aerosols, stratocumulus clouds, and energy fluxes over the Southeast Pacific Ocean. Measurements from the VA-MOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) and satellite retrievals (i.e., products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), and GOES-10) are used for this assessment. The Morrison double-moment microphysics scheme is newly coupled with interactive aerosols in the model. The 31-day (15 October-16 November 2008) WRF-Chem simulation with aerosol-cloud interactions (AERO hereafter) is also compared to a simulation (MET hereafter) with fixed cloud droplet number concentrations in the microphysics scheme and simplified cloud and aerosol treatments in the radiation scheme. The well-simulated aerosol quantities (aerosol number, mass composition and optical properties), and the inclusion of full aerosol-cloud couplings lead to significant improvements in many features of the simulated stratocumulus clouds: cloud optical properties and microphysical properties such as cloud top effective radius, cloud water path, and cloud optical thickness. In addition to accounting for the aerosol direct and semi-direct effects, these improvements feed back to the simulation of boundary-layer characteristics and energy budgets. Particularly, inclusion of interactive aerosols in AERO strengthens the temperature and humidity gradients within the capping inversion layer and lowers the marine boundary layer (MBL) depth by 130 m from that of the MET simulation. These differences are associated with weaker entrainment and stronger mean subsidence at the top of the MBL in AERO. Mean top-of-atmosphere outgoing shortwave fluxes, surface latent heat, and surface downwelling longwave fluxes are in better agreement with observations in AERO, compared to the MET simulation. Nevertheless, biases in some of the simulated meteorological quantities (e. g., MBL temperature and humidity) and aerosol quantities (e. g., underestimations of accumulation mode aerosol number) might affect simulated stratocumulus and energy fluxes over the Southeastern Pacific, and require further investigation. The well-simulated timing and outflow patterns of polluted and clean episodes demonstrate the model's ability to capture daily/synoptic scale variations of aerosol and cloud properties, and suggest that the model is suitable for studying atmospheric processes associated with pollution outflow over the ocean. The overall performance of the regional model in simulating mesoscale clouds and boundary layer properties is encouraging and suggests that reproducing gradients of aerosol and cloud droplet concentrations and coupling cloud-aerosol-radiation processes are important when simulating marine stratocumulus over the Southeast Pacific.

J	Martucci, G; O'Dowd, CD				Martucci, G.; O'Dowd, C. D.			Ground-based retrieval of continental and marine warm cloud microphysics	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												A technique for retrieving warm cloud microphysics using synergistic ground based remote sensing instruments is presented. The SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Cloud) technique utilises a K-a-band Doppler cloud RADAR, a LIDAR (or ceilometer) and a multichannel microwave radiometer. SYRSOC retrieves the main microphysical parameters such as cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), droplets effective radius (r(eff)), cloud liquid water content (LWC), and the departure from adiabatic conditions within the cloud. Two retrievals are presented for continental and marine stratocumulus advected over the Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station. Whilst the continental case exhibited high CDCN ((N) over bar = 382 cm(-3); 10th-to-90th percentile [9.4-842.4] cm(-3)) and small mean effective radius ((r(eff)) over bar = 4.3; 10th-to-90th percentile [2.9-6.5] mu m), the marine case showed low CDNC and large mean effective radius ((N) over bar = 25 cm(-3), 10th-to-90th percentile [1.5-69] cm(-3); (r(eff)) over bar = 28.4 mu m, 10th-to-90th percentile [11.2-42.7] mu m) as expected since continental air at this location is typically more polluted than marine air. The mean LWC was comparable for the two cases (continental: 0.19 gm(-3); marine: 0.16 gm(-3)) but the 10th-90th percentile range was wider in marine air (continental: 0.11-0.22 gm(-3); marine: 0.01-0.38 gm(-3)). The calculated algorithm uncertainty for the continental and marine case for each variable was, respectively, sigma(N) = 161.58 cm(-3) and 12.2 cm(-3), sigma(reff) = 0.86 mu m and 5.6 mu m, sigma(LWC) = 0.03 gm(-3) and 0.04 gm(-3). The retrieved CDNC are compared to the cloud condensation nuclei concentrations and the best agreement is achieved for a supersaturation of 0.1% in the continental case and between 0.1 %-0.75% for the marine stratocumulus. The retrieved r(eff) at the top of the clouds are compared to the MODIS satellite r(eff): 7 mu m (MODIS) vs. 6.2 mu m (SYRSOC) and 16.3 mu m (MODIS) vs. 17 mu m (SYRSOC) for continental and marine cases, respectively. The combined analysis of the CDNC and the r(eff), for the marine case shows that the drizzle modifies the droplet size distribution and (r(eff)) over bar especially if compared to r(eff)(MOD). The study of the cloud subadiabaticity and the LWC shows the general sub-adiabatic character of both clouds with more pronounced departure from adiabatic conditions in the continental case than in the marine.

J	Bierman, P; Lewis, M; Ostendorf, B; Tanner, J				Bierman, Paul; Lewis, Megan; Ostendorf, Bertram; Tanner, Jason			A review of methods for analysing spatial and temporal patterns in coastal water quality	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Coastal environments contain some of the marine world's most important ecosystems and represent significant resources for human industry and recreation. Water quality in the coastal environment is extremely important for a number of reasons from the protection of marine organisms and the well being of marine ecosystems to the health of people in the region and the safety of industries such as aquaculture. As a result it is essential that environmental health in coastal environments is monitored. Traditional monitoring methods include assessment of biological indices or direct measurements of water quality, which are based on in situ data collection and hence are often spatially or temporally limited. Remote sensing imagery is increasingly used as a rich source of spatial information, providing more detailed coverage then other methods. But the complexity of information in the imagery requires new analysis techniques that allow us to identify the components and possible causes of spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a review of methods to analyse spatial and temporal variations in remote sensing data of coastal water quality and discusses and compares these methods and the outcomes they achieve. Selected techniques are illustrated by using a sample dataset of MODIS chlorophyll-a imagery. We consider classification methods (cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) that may be used in exploratory, confirmatory and predictive ways, methods that summarize and identify patterns within complex datasets (factor analysis, principal components analysis, self-organizing maps), and techniques that explicitly analyse spatial relationships (the semivariogram and geographically weighted regression). Each technique has a different purpose and addresses different questions. This review identifies how these methods can be utilized to address water quality variability in order to foster a wider application of such techniques for coastal water quality assessment and monitoring.

Characterization and transport of aerosols over the Bay of Bengal during the winter monsoon: a comparative study using in-situ and satellite measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Natural processes, such as dust storms and sea salt spray, and anthropogenic activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, introduce aerosols into the atmosphere. Their concentration, geographic distribution and particle size promote significant climatic consequences. Aerosol transport processes, from landmasses to oceans, are scarcely understood because of inadequate in-situ observations. This study reports the results of spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements using a five-channel (380, 440, 500, 675 and 870 nm) handheld MICROTOPS Sun-photometer used during a sea-truth data collection campaign conducted in the central Bay of Bengal (BOB) during the northeastern monsoon period (10 November to 13 December 2007). For the entire cruise period, the mean values of the daily average of the AODs at 500 nm and 870 nm were 0.39 +/- 0.065 and 0.22 +/- 0.047, respectively, the mean value of the Angstrom exponent (alpha) was 1.23 +/- 0.2 and the turbidity parameter (beta) was 0.183 +/- 0.044. A smaller alpha value together with a larger beta value suggests the presence of an abundance of smaller aerosol particles near the coast. An air mass back-trajectory analysis was undertaken to identify the potential source regions of the aerosols. Analysis of the results demonstrated the effect of the aerosol transport and source regions on the spectral behaviour of the AODs. In-situ measured AOD (550 nm) and alpha (550 nm, 865 nm) values were further compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived parameters. The in-situ and MODIS-derived AOD values were found to be in good agreement, with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.78 and a standard error of 0.05, while the R(2) for alpha was 0.68 with a standard error of 0.14.																	0143-1161						2011	32	5					1253	1267		10.1080/01431160903527454								WOS:000288693800003						
J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Satellite observations of environmental changes from the Tonga volcano eruption in the southern tropical Pacific	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Satellite measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua were used to study changes of the ocean and atmosphere following the eruption of a submarine volcano in March 2009 in the southern tropical Pacific. Significant increase of water turbidity was observed in an area of similar to 368 km(2) near the location of the eruption due to the deposition of volcanic ash. In the ocean region close to the volcanic eruption, the diffuse attenuation coefficient at a wavelength of 490 nm, K-d(490), increased from similar to 0.025 to 0.16 m(-1) before and after the volcanic eruption. Within two weeks of the event, the coverage of the ash-laden waters decreased to similar to 30 km(2), and after four weeks the satellite-measured marine environment parameters returned back to the pre-eruption condition. The normalized water-leaving reflectance spectra, derived from the combined near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm for the ash-laden water, show some unique optical features, different from those of the sediment-dominated turbid waters, river plume waters or other productive waters. No significant sea surface temperature (SST) change was detected from satellite measurements near the eruption site. Volcanic ash plumes in the atmosphere were observed moving north-eastward following the ocean winds on 18 March 2009. The aerosol optical thickness increased from 0.06 on the previous day to 0.25 at a location similar to 60 km north-east of the volcanic eruption site.

J	Melin, F				Melin, F.			Comparison of SeaWiFS and MODIS time series of inherent optical properties for the Adriatic Sea	OCEAN SCIENCE												Time series of inherent optical properties (IOPs) derived from SeaWiFS and MODIS are compared for the Adriatic Sea. The IOPs are outputs of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm and include total absorption a, phytoplankton absorption a(ph), absorption associated with colored detrital material (CDM) a(cdm), and particle backscattering coefficient b(bp). The average root-mean square difference Delta computed for log-transformed distributions decreases for a from 0.084 at 412 nm to 0.052 at 490 nm, is higher for a(ph)(443) (0.149) than for a(cdm)(443) (0.071), and is approximately 0.165 for b(bp) at various wavelengths. The SeaWiFS a at 443 and 490 nm, a(ph) at 443 nm and b(bp) are on average higher than the MODIS counterparts. Statistics show significant variations in space and time. There is an overall increasing gradient for Delta associated with the absorption terms from the open southern and central Adriatic to the northwest part of the basin, and a reversed gradient for the particulate backscattering coefficient. For time series analysis, only a(412) and a(cdm)(443) currently present an unbiased continuity bridging the SeaWiFS and MODIS periods for the Adriatic Sea.																	1812-0784						2011	7	3					351	361		10.5194/os-7-351-2011								WOS:000291928000006

A model study of Saharan dust emissions and distributions during the SAMUM-1 campaign	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Simulations of Saharan dust emission, transport, and deposition are performed using new developments of the regional model COSMO-MUSCAT for the Saharan Mineral Dust Experiment (SAMUM-1), which took place in May-June 2006. Up-to-date surface soil data sets developed especially to model dust emissions are used, and a new representation of the dust size distribution is proposed. Compared with previous model studies performed with COSMO-MUSCAT, the advantage of our approach is that no tuning factor on the erosion threshold is needed for the whole Sahara. The performances and limitations of COSMO-MUSCAT to model the regional dust cycle are discussed. The spatiotemporal variability of simulated Saharan emissions is evaluated using a backtracking approach to locate dust sources with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) infrared difference images and using dust observations of North African meteorological stations. The Saharan dust emissions are estimated to be 78 Tg during the studied period. The model dust size distributions agree well with SAMUM-1 airborne measurements, previous model simulations, and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) inversion products. Our ability to simulate the vertical cross section of a dust plume is also discussed with regard to airborne lidar measurements and former simulations. The horizontal distribution of model-derived aerosol optical thicknesses (AOT) is compared with Aqua-MODIS Deep Blue AOT and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol indexes. Dry and wet deposition rates are simulated. About 67% of the emitted dust is deposited in the vicinity of the emitted source areas over North Africa and close marine areas, and 33% is transported out of the studied area toward other continents and remote ocean areas.

Evaluation of shortwave infrared atmospheric correction for ocean color remote sensing of Chesapeake Bay	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua platform (MODIS-Aqua) provides a viable data stream for operational water quality monitoring of Chesapeake Bay. Marine geophysical products from MODIS-Aqua depend on the efficacy of the atmospheric correction process, which can be problematic in coastal environments. The operational atmospheric correction algorithm for MODIS-Aqua requires an assumption of negligible near-infrared water-leaving radiance, nL(w)(NIR). This assumption progressively degrades with increasing turbidity and, as such, methods exist to account for non-negligible nL(w)(NIR) within the atmospheric correction process or to use alternate radiometric bands where the assumption is satisfied, such as those positioned within shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum. We evaluated a decade-long time-series of nL(w)(lambda) from MODIS-Aqua in Chesapeake Bay derived using NIR and SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. Low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for the SWIR bands of MODIS-Aqua added noise errors to the derived radiances, which produced broad, flat frequency distributions of nL(w)(lambda) relative to those produced using the NIR bands. The SWIR approach produced an increased number of negative nL(w)(lambda) and decreased sample size relative to the NIR approach. Revised vicarious calibration and regional tuning of the scheme to switch between the NIR and SWIR approaches may improve retrievals in Chesapeake Bay, however, poor SNR values for the MODIS-Aqua SWIR bands remain the primary deficiency of the SWIR-based atmospheric correction approach.

AERONET-OC: an overview	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) was established to support satellite ocean color validation activities in coastal waters through standardized measurements of atmospheric and marine optical quantities. Specifically, AERONET-OC can provide in situ spectral values of the normalized water-leaving radiance, L-WN, and aerosol optical thickness, tau(a), through autonomous radiometers operating on fixed platforms in coastal waters. This work presents the rationale for the network and an overview of the measurement sites and applications. Focus is brought to the assessment of accuracies of coastal L-WN from current satellite ocean color sensors: the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) onboard the OrbView-2 satellite, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua platforms, and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard the Envisat platform.

J	Hu, CM; Cannizzaro, J; Carder, KL; Muller-Karger, FE; Hardy, R				Hu, Chuanmin; Cannizzaro, Jennifer; Carder, Kendall L.; Muller-Karger, Frank E.; Hardy, Robert			Remote detection of Trichodesmium blooms in optically complex coastal waters: Examples with MODIS full-spectral data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote detection of the Trichodesmium spp cyanobacteria blooms on the west Florida shelf (WFS) has been problematic due to optical complexity caused by sediment resuspension, coastal runoff, and bottom interference By combining MODIS data measured by the ocean bands and land bands, an approach was developed to identify surface mats of Trichodesmium on the WFS. The approach first identifies possible bloom patches in MODIS FAI (floating algae index) 250 m resolution imagery derived from the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance at 667, 859, and 1240 nm. Then, spectral analysis examines the unique reflectance characteristics of Trichodesmium at 469, 488, 531, 551, and 555 nm clue to specific optical properties (absorption, backscattering, and fluorescence) of the unusual pigments in Trichodesmium. These spectral characteristics (i.e., high-low-high-low-high reflectance at 469-488-531-551-555 nm, respectively) differentiate Trichodesmium mats unambiguously from other features observed in the FAI imagery, such as Sargassum spp. Tests in other coastal locations show that the approach is robust and applicable to other optically complex waters. Results shown here can help study Trichodesmium bloom dynamics (e.g., initiation and bloom formation) and may also help design future sensors to better detect and quantify Trichodesmium, an important N(2) fixer in the global oceans.

J	Yoon, SC; Kim, SW; Choi, SJ; Choi, IJ				Yoon, Soon-Chang; Kim, Sang-Woo; Choi, Suk-Jin; Choi, In-Jin			Regional-scale relationships between aerosol and summer monsoon circulation, and precipitation over northeast Asia	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												We investigated the regional-scale relationships between columnar aerosol loads and summer monsoon circulation, and also the precipitation over northeast Asia using aerosol optical depth (AOD) data obtained from the 8-year MODIS, AERONET Sun/sky radiometer, and precipitation data acquired under the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). These high-quality data revealed the regional-scale link between AOD and summer monsoon circulation, precipitation in July over northeast Asian countries, and their distinct spatial and annual variabilities. Compared to the mean AOD for the entire period of 2001-2008, the increase of almost 40-50% in the AOD value in July 2005 and July 2007 was found over the downwind regions of China (Yellow Sea, Korean peninsula, and East Sea), with negative precipitation anomalies. This can be attributable to the strong westerly confluent flows, between cyclone flows by continental thermal low centered over the northern China and anticyclonic flows by the western North Pacific High, which transport anthropogenic pollution aerosols emitted from east China to aforementioned downwind high AOD regions along the rim of the Pacific marine airmass. In July 2002, however, the easterly flows transported anthropogenic aerosols from east China to the southwestern part of China in July 2002. As a result, the AOD off the coast of China was dramatically reduced in spite of decreasing rainfall. From the calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient between MODIS-derived AOD anomalies and GPCP precipitation anomalies in July over the period 2001-2008, we found negative correlations over the areas encompassed by 105-115A degrees E and 30-35A degrees N and by 120-140A degrees E and 35-40A degrees N (Yellow Sea, Korean peninsula, and East Sea). This suggests that aerosol loads over these regions are easily influenced by the Asian monsoon flow system and associated precipitation.																	1976-7633					AUG	2010	46	3					279	286		10.1007/s13143-010-1002-3								WOS:000281318100005

Remote sensing of radiative and microphysical properties of clouds during TC4: Results from MAS, MASTER, MODIS, and MISR	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) and MODIS/Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Airborne Simulator (MASTER) were used to obtain measurements of the bidirectional reflectance and brightness temperature of clouds at 50 discrete wavelengths between 0.47 and 14.2 mu m (12.9 mu m for MASTER). These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment conducted over Central America and surrounding Pacific and Atlantic Oceans between 17 July and 8 August 2007. Multispectral images in eleven distinct bands were used to derive a confidence in clear sky (or alternatively the probability of cloud) over land and ocean ecosystems. Based on the results of individual tests run as part of the cloud mask, an algorithm was developed to estimate the phase of the clouds (liquid water, ice, or undetermined phase). The cloud optical thickness and effective radius were derived for both liquid water and ice clouds that were detected during each flight, using a nearly identical algorithm to that implemented operationally to process MODIS cloud data from the Aqua and Terra satellites (Collection 5). This analysis shows that the cloud mask developed for operational use on MODIS, and tested using MAS and MASTER data in TC4, is quite capable of distinguishing both liquid water and ice clouds during daytime conditions over both land and ocean. The cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals use five distinct bands of the MAS (or MASTER), and these results were compared with nearly simultaneous retrievals of marine liquid water clouds from MODIS on the Terra spacecraft. Finally, this MODIS-based algorithm was adapted to Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data to infer the cloud optical thickness of liquid water clouds from MISR. Results of this analysis are compared and contrasted.

CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (a(g)(412) in m(-1)) showed an inversed linear relationship with salinity, indicating conservative mixing between freshwater and seawater, although the relationship changed with seasons and locations. On average, except in the vicinity of two major rivers (Minjiang River and Jiulongjiang River), a(g)(412) was higher in October (dry season) (0.173 +/- 0.036 m(-1)) than in April (wet season) (0.123 +/- 0.059 m(-1)). This observation is counter intuitive but consistent with those derived from MODIS satellite measurements. Combined with the CDOM EEM spectra (fluorescence excitation-emission matrix), the results suggest that 1) Minjiang River and jiulongjiang River were the primary land-based CDOM sources; 2) The marine end-members were controlled by the South China Sea Warm Current in April and the Zhe-Min Coastal Water in October; 3) The land-based CDOM was more from sewage than from soil leaching; and 4) Light absorption in the blue wavelengths was dominated by CDOM and detritus.

J	Seethala, C; Horvath, A				Seethala, C.; Horvath, Akos			Global assessment of AMSR-E and MODIS cloud liquid water path retrievals in warm oceanic clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We compared 1 year of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) Wentz and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud liquid water path estimates in warm marine clouds. In broken scenes AMSR-E increasingly overestimated MODIS, and retrievals became uncorrelated as cloud fraction decreased, while in overcast scenes the techniques showed generally better agreement, but with a MODIS overestimation. We found microwave and visible near-infrared retrievals being most consistent in extensive marine Sc clouds with correlations up to 0.95 and typical RMS differences of 15 g m(-2). The overall MODIS high bias in overcast domains could be removed, in a global mean sense, by adiabatic correction; however, large regional differences remained. Most notably, MODIS showed strong overestimations at high latitudes, which we traced to 3-D effects in plane-parallel visible-near-infrared retrievals over heterogeneous clouds at low Sun. In the tropics or subtropics, AMSR-E-MODIS differences also depended on cloud type, with MODIS overestimating in stratiform clouds and underestimating in cumuliform clouds, resulting in large-scale coherent bias patterns where marine Sc transitioned into trade wind Cu. We noted similar geographic variations in Wentz cloud temperature errors and MODIS 1.6-3.7 mu m droplet effective radius differences, suggesting that microwave retrieval errors due to cloud absorption uncertainties, and visible near-infrared retrieval errors due to cloud vertical stratification might have contributed to the observed liquid water path bias patterns. Finally, cloud-rain partitioning was found to introduce a systematic low bias in Wentz retrievals above 180 g m(-2) as the microwave algorithm erroneously assigned an increasing portion of the liquid water content of thicker nonprecipitating clouds to rain.

Carboxylic acids, sulfates, and organosulfates in processed continental organic aerosol over the southeast Pacific Ocean during VOCALS-REx 2008	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Submicron particles were collected on board the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) in the southeast Pacific marine boundary layer in October and November 2008. The aerosol in this region was characterized by low numbers of particles (150-700 cm(-3)) that were dominated by sulfate ions at concentrations of 0.9 +/- 0.7 mu g m(-3) and organic mass at 0.6 +/- 0.4 mu g m(-3), with no measurable nitrate and low ammonium ion concentrations. Measurements of submicron organic aerosol functional groups and trace elements show that continental outflow of anthropogenic emissions is the dominant source of organic mass (OM) to the southeast Pacific with an additional, smaller contribution of organic mass from primary marine sources. This continental source is supported by a correlation between OM and radon. Saturated aliphatic C-CH (alkane) composed 41 +/- 27% of OM. Carboxylic acid COOH (32 +/- 23% of OM) was observed in single particles internally mixed with ketonic carbonyl, carbonate, and potassium. Organosulfate COSO3 (4 +/- 8% of OM) was observed only during the periods of highest organic and sulfate concentrations and lowest ammonium concentrations, consistent with a sulfuric acid epoxide hydrolysis for proposed surrogate compounds (e. g., isoprene oxidation products) or reactive glyoxal uptake mechanisms from laboratory studies. This correlation suggests that in high-sulfate, low-ammonium conditions, the formation of organosulfate compounds in the atmosphere contributes a significant fraction of aerosol OM (up to 13% in continental air masses). Organic hydroxyl C-OH composed 20 +/- 12% of OM and up to 50% of remote marine OM and was inversely correlated with radon indicating a marine source. A two-factor solution of positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis resulted in one factor dominated by organic hydroxyl (>70% by mass) and one factor dominated by saturated aliphatic C-CH (alkane) and carboxylic acid (together, 90% by mass), identified as the marine and combustion factors, respectively. Measurements of particle concentrations in the study region compared with concentrations estimated from MODIS aerosol optical depth indicate that continental outflow results in MBL particle concentrations elevated up to 2 times the background level (less than 300 cm(-3)) away from shore and up to 10 times the background level at the coast. The presence of both coastal fossil fuel combustion and marine sources of oxygenated organic aerosol results in little change in the oxygenated fraction and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) along the outflow of the region's dominant organic particle source.

The simultaneous measurements between Lin'an and ZFU showed a very high consistency of AOD at all wavelengths. The differences are less than 0.02 for Angstrom exponent and ADD at all wavelengths. The mean values of AOD at 440 nm at the Pudong, Taihu and Lin'an were about 0.74 +/- 0.43, 0.85 +/- 0.46, and 0.89 +/- 0.46, respectively. The mean values of Angstrom exponents were about 1.27 +/- 0.30, 1.20 +/- 0.28 and 1.32 +/- 0.35, respectively. The variation of monthly averaged ADD over Pudong showed a single peak distribution, with the maximum value occurring in July (AOD(440nm) 1.26 +/- 0.61) and minimum in January (AOD(440nm) 0.50 +/- 0.27). However, the variations of monthly averaged ADD at Taihu and Lin'an showed a hi-modal distribution. There were peak values of AOD occurring in July (AOD(440nm) 1.41 +/- 0.49) and September (AOD(440nm) 1.22 +/- 0.52) for Taihu. For Lin'an, the two peak values of ADD occurred in June (AOD(440nm) 1.17 +/- 0.69) and September (AOD(440nm) 1.28 +/- 0.46). The ADD accumulated mainly between 0.30-0.90(68%), 0.30-1.20(75%) and 0.30-1.20 (similar to 75%) at Pudong, Taihu, and Lin'an, respectively. The Angstrom exponent accumulated mainly between 1.10-1.60 (75%), 1.10-1.50 (63%) and 1.20-1.60, 50% (50%) at Pudong. Taihu, and Lin'an, respectively. The synchronized observation showed that the ADD at Pudong was larger than those at Dongtan by 0.03, 0.03, 0.04, 0.07, and 0.08 at wavelengths of 1020 nm, 870 nm, 670 nm, 500 nm and 440 rim, respectively. The synchronized observations at Pudong. Taihu and Lin'an showed that the three stations had high level ADD with means at 440 nm about 0.68, 0.73, and 0.78, respectively. The relationship between MODIS retrieved and ground-based measured ADD shows good agreement with R-2 ranging from 0.68 to 0.79 at Pudong, Taihu, Lin'an and Dongtan. The MODIS results were overestimated comparing the ground measurements at Pudong, Taihu, and Dongtan but exceptional at Lin'an. The analysis results between aerosol optical properties and wind measurement at Pudong showed that the wind speed from the east correlates with the lower observed ADD. The back trajectory analysis indicates that more than 50% airmasses were from the marine area at Pudong, while back trajectories distribution is relatively homogeneous at Lin'an.

J	Scheffer, A; Trathan, PN; Collins, M				Scheffer, Annette; Trathan, Philip N.; Collins, Martin			Foraging behaviour of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) in relation to predictable mesoscale oceanographic features in the Polar Front Zone to the north of South Georgia	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY					International Symposium on Climate Impacts on Oceanic Top Predators (CLIOTOP)	DEC 03-07, 2007	La Paz, MEXICO	IMBER, SCOR, EUR OCEANS, IRD, CLS, PFRP, LPRC, NOAA, PICES				Marine predators are thought to utilise oceanic features adjusting their foraging strategy in a scale-dependent manner. Thus, they are thought to dynamically alter their foraging behaviour in response to environmental conditions encountered. In this study, we examined the foraging behaviour of King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) breeding at South Georgia in relation to predictable and stable oceanographic features. We studied penguins during their long post-laying foraging trips during December 2005 and January 2006. For this investigation, we undertook a simultaneous analysis of ARGOS satellite-tracking data and Mk 7 Wild Life Computers Time Depth Recorder (TDR) dive data. To investigate correlations between foraging behaviour and oceanographic conditions, we used SST data from January 2006 from MODIS satellite AQUA. To determine changes in search effort, first passage time (FPT) was calculated; for analysis of dive behaviour, we used several dive parameters that are thought to be reliable indicators of changes in foraging behaviour. King Penguins appeared to target predictable mesoscale features in the Polar Front Zone (PFZ), either a warm-core eddy in the PFZ or regions of strong temperature gradients at oceanic fronts. Two different trip types could be distinguished: direct trips with a straight path to one foraging area at the edge of an eddy or at a thermal front, and circular trips where birds foraged along strong thermal gradients at the northern limit of the PFZ. It is likely that both trip types were a direct consequence of prey encounter rates and distributions, both of which are likely to be associated with these oceanographic features. Circular trips often included passages across the centre of an eddy where birds made deep foraging dives, but remained only a short time in the eddy, possibly because prey were too deep. All birds showed Area Restricted Search (ARS) at scales of <10 km. The two trip types had different ARS patterns, with clear ARS hotspots for direct trips and several ARS hotspots over the whole duration of the trip for circular trips. Dive behaviour had clear relationships with the changing water temperature and the time of day, presumably in response to different prey distribution. Especially for direct trips, dive behaviour showed significant differences within and outside of ARS hotspots. Thus, King Penguins appear to target predictable mesoscale features in the PFZ. They use ARS in different patterns to exploit the environment and adjust their foraging strategy and diving behaviour depending upon conditions they encountered. Diving behaviour showed correlations to ARS patterns, especially for direct trips, which may represent a favourable foraging strategy. The presence of predictable oceanic features allows King Penguins to focus their foraging effort, presumably allowing them to increase their foraging success and decrease their diving effort.

J	Dinoi, A; Perrone, MR; Burlizzi, P				Dinoi, Adelaide; Perrone, Maria Rita; Burlizzi, Pasquale			Application of MODIS Products for Air Quality Studies Over Southeastern Italy	REMOTE SENSING												Aerosol optical thicknesses (AOTs) by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Aqua and Terra satellites, and ground-based measurements of PM10 mass concentrations, collected over three years (2006-2008) at two suburban sites which are 20 km apart, are correlated to assess the use of satellite data for regional air quality studies over Southeastern Italy, in the central Mediterranean. Due to the geographical location, this area is affected by local and long-range transported marine, desert (from Sahara), and anthropogenic (from continental Europe) aerosols. 24-hour averaged PM10 mass concentrations span the 1.6-152 mu g/m(3) range. Yearly means of PM10 mass concentrations decrease from 2006 to 2008 and vary within the 26-36 mu g/m(3) range. Daily mean values of MODIS AOTs vary up to 0.8 at 550 nm, while yearly means span the 0.15-0.17 range. A first assessment of the regression relationship between daily averaged PM10 mass concentrations and MODIS-AOTs shows that linear correlation coefficients (R) vary within the 0.20-0.35 range and are affected by the sampling year and the site location. The PM10-AOT correlation becomes stronger (0.34 <= R <= 0.57) when the analysis is restricted to clear-sky MODIS measurements. The cloud screening procedure adopted within the AERONET network is used in this study to select clear-sky MODIS measurements, since it allows obtaining larger R values than the ones obtained using the cloud fraction MODIS product to select clear-sky MODIS measurements. Using three years of clear-sky measurements to estimate PM10 mass concentrations from MODIS-AOTs, the empirical relation we have found is: PM10 (mu g/m(3)) = 25 (mu g/m(3)) + 65 (mu g/m(3)) x AOT. Over 80% of the differences between the measured and satellite estimated PM10 mass concentrations over the three years are within +/- 1 standard deviation of the yearly means. The differences between yearly means of calculated and measured mass concentrations that are close to zero in 2006, increase up to 4 mu g/m(3) at one site and 8 mu g/m(3) at the other site in 2008. The PM10 mass concentration decrease from 2006 to 2008 contributes to this last result. Our results demonstrate the potential of MODIS data for deriving indirect estimates of PM10 over Southeastern Italy. It is also shown that a stronger relationship between PM10 and MODIS-AOTs is obtained when the AOT is divided by the product of the mixing layer height with the ground wind speed and the analysis restricted to clear sky MODIS measurements. However, we have found that the stronger correlation (0.52 <= R <= 0.66) does not allow a significant improvement of MODIS-based-estimates of PM10 mass concentrations.

Examining the impact of overlying aerosols on the retrieval of cloud optical properties from passive remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Haywood et al. (2004) show that an aerosol layer above a cloud can cause a bias in the retrieved cloud optical thickness and effective radius. Monitoring for this potential bias is difficult because space-based passive remote sensing cannot unambiguously detect or characterize aerosol above cloud. We show that cloud retrievals from aircraft measurements above cloud and below an overlying aerosol layer are a means to test this bias. The data were collected during the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-A) study based out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States, above extensive, marine stratus cloud banks affected by industrial outflow. Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) irradiance measurements taken along a lower level flight leg above cloud and below aerosol were unaffected by the overlying aerosol. Along upper level flight legs, the irradiance reflected from cloud top was transmitted through an aerosol layer. We compare SSFR cloud retrievals from below-aerosol legs to satellite retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in order to detect an aerosol-induced bias. In regions of small variation in cloud properties, we find that SSFR and MODIS-retrieved cloud optical thickness compares within the uncertainty range for each instrument while SSFR effective radius tend to be smaller than MODIS values (by 1-2 mu m) and at the low end of MODIS uncertainty estimates. In regions of large variation in cloud properties, differences in SSFR and MODIS-retrieved cloud optical thickness and effective radius can reach values of 10 and 10 mu m, respectively. We include aerosols in forward modeling to test the sensitivity of SSFR cloud retrievals to overlying aerosol layers. We find an overlying absorbing aerosol layer biases SSFR cloud retrievals to smaller effective radii and optical thickness while nonabsorbing aerosols had no impact.

Comparison of SeaWiFS, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS satellites in the Southern Ocean	OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS-RAPID COMMUNICATIONS												Contemporary ocean color satellite radiometers provide an unprecedented insight into spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of oceanic chlorophyll-a. That information favors a deeper understanding of the atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration by marine phytoplankton and, as a consequence, of the role of the Earth's oceans in the global carbon cycle. Nevertheless, radiometers data need to be accurate in order to be useful. In this study, the accuracy of SeaWiFS, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS is tested both thanks to an intercomparison among those radiomers, and thanks a validation with a lidar fluorosensor. From one hand, the satellite radiometers monthly averages were in mutual agreement within their estimated accuracy (about 35%), from the other hand the mean difference between lidar fluorosensor measurements and satellite radiometers retrievals was less than 30%. In both cases larger deviations were possible in particular regions and short periods, suggesting that the chlorophyll-a bio-optical algorithms of the satellite radiometers should be calibrated in specific regions and limited periods.

Relationships among properties of marine stratocumulus derived from collocated CALIPSO and MODIS observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) 532 nm total attenuated backscatter coefficients were used to identify 50 km scale segments for ocean regions that had only a single layer of marine stratocumulus. On the basis of whether the underlying ocean surface was detected in the backscatter coefficients, the segments were separated into those for which all of the 1 km MODIS pixels were identified as being overcast (no surface detected) and those for which there were breaks in the cloud layer (surface detected). Cloud properties for the collocated MODIS pixels were obtained from the MODIS MOD06 cloud product and from a retrieval scheme designed to account for broken clouds within imager pixels. For the 50 km overcast segments the variations in optical depth, tau, and droplet effective radius, R-e, obtained from the MOD06 and partly cloudy pixel retrievals were in agreement, and the variations in layer temperature were consistent with those inferred from the CALIPSO backscatter coefficients. In addition, the droplet effective radii retrieved separately using the 1.6, 2.1, and 3.7 mu m MODIS reflectances were consistent with droplets growing as clouds thickened and mean values of dlnR(e)/dln tau were close to 0.2, as predicted by adiabatic cloud parcel models. When the segments contained broken clouds, however, the droplet effective radii for the three near-infrared wavelengths were inconsistent with droplets growing as clouds thickened and dlnR(e)/dln tau departed from 0.2. This breakdown is thought to result from biases in the retrieved cloud properties caused by subpixel-scale variations in liquid water amount and droplet radius.																	2169-897X					MAR 27	2010	115								D00H17	10.1029/2009JD012046								WOS:000276026100001

The aerosol size distributions in clean marine environment were dominated by an accumulate mode with radius of 0.15 mu m and a coarse mode with radius of 4.5 mu m. The mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent were 0.26 and 1.26, respectively. In the frontal zone the aerosol size distribution was dominated by an accumulate mode with radius of 0.25 mu m and two coarse modes with radii of 1.69 and 7.73 mu m, and the AOD and Angstrom exponent were 2.46 and 0.84, respectively. In the nonfrontal dust conditions, the concentration of coarse modes with radii of 2.5 mu m increased to a maximum of 0.3 mu m(3)/mu m(2), and the mean AOD and Angstrom exponent were 0.70 and 0.30, respectively. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations combined with shipboard measurements reveal the decreasing concentration of dust aerosol during its transport from continent to Japan. The spatial distribution of dust aerosol was studied using the Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) and Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) products. On 22 April, for frontal dust, their AOD and UV aerosol index (UVAI) increased with decreasing distance to the frontal line, peaked with values of 4.36 and 5.21 in the frontal zone, and decreased rapidly with increasing distance off the frontal line. On 23 April, nonfrontal dust showed the lower AOD and UVAI with peak values of 2.0 and 2.7, respectively.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 17	2010	115								D00K04	10.1029/2009JD012684								WOS:000275857400003

Spatial Synchrony in Intertidal Benthic Algal Biomass in Temperate Coastal and Estuarine Ecosystems	ECOSYSTEMS												Microphytobenthos plays a vital role in estuarine and coastal carbon cycling and food webs. Yet, the role of exogenous factors, and thus the effects of climate change, in regulating microphytobenthic biomass is poorly understood. We aimed to unravel the mechanisms structuring microphytobenthic biomass both within and across ecosystems. The spatiotemporal distribution of the biomass of intertidal benthic algae (dominated by diatoms) was estimated with an unprecedented spatial extent from time-series of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a 6-year period of daily Aqua MODIS 250-m images of seven temperate, mostly turbid, estuarine and coastal ecosystems. These NDVI time-series were related to meteorological and environmental conditions. Intertidal benthic algal biomass varied seasonally in all ecosystems, in parallel with meteorology and water quality. Seasonal variation was more pronounced in mud than in sand. Interannual variation in biomass was small, but synchronized year-to-year biomass fluctuations occurred in a number of disjointed ecosystems. Air temperature explained interannual fluctuations in biomass in a number of sites, but the synchrony was mainly driven by the wind/wave climate: high wind velocities reduced microphytobenthic biomass, either through increased resuspension or reduced emersion duration. Spatial variation in biomass was largely explained by emersion duration and mud content, both within and across ecosystems. The results imply that effects on microphytobenthic standing stock can be anticipated when the position in the tidal frame is altered, for example due to sea level rise. Increased storminess will also result in a large-scale decrease of biomass.				van der Wal, Daphne/A-8875-2011; Herman, Peter/A-9018-2011	van der Wal, Daphne/0000-0002-2319-056X; Herman, Peter/0000-0003-2188-6341												1432-9840					MAR	2010	13	2					338	351		10.1007/s10021-010-9322-9								WOS:000275785700013

Small closed, large closed, and open cells were identified in about 65% of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S) satellite images during 2003. The MODIS imagery was combined with ceilometer and surface meteorological measurements, human observations of cloud types and drizzle, and large-scale meteorological analyses for January through June. The authors identified two drizzle regimes: a synoptically quiescent summer (January March) regime characterized by a strong anticyclone, large closed cells, and frequent drizzle, and an autumn (April June) regime characterized by a weaker anticyclone, small closed cells and open cells, and precipitation that was mainly associated with synoptic activity. The large closed cells had higher mean cloud bases and tops than the small closed cells and accounted for 45% of the cumulus-under-stratocumulus reports and 29% of the total drizzle and rain reports. Large closed cells occupied more intermittently coupled boundary layers than did the small closed cells. Open cells also occurred in more decoupled conditions but only accounted for 18% of the total reports of drizzle and rain. The atmospheric stability of large and small closed cells was similar, but large closed cells were more commonly associated with a strong anticyclone, and small closed cells with wave activity superimposed upon a weakened anticyclone. The increased drizzle and occurrence of cumulus-under-stratocumulus in the summer rather than autumn is consistent with higher nighttime liquid water paths. A contribution of this study is the documentation of the ways in which synoptic activity can affect stratocumulus decks.

Relating Satellite-Observed Cloud Properties from MODIS to Meteorological Conditions for Marine Boundary Layer Clouds	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study examines 6 yr of cloud properties observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the NASA Terra satellite in five prominent marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud regions (California, Peru, Canary, Angola, and Australia) and investigates their relationships with near-surface meteorological parameters obtained from NCEP reanalyses. About 62 000 independent scenes are used to examine the instantaneous relationships between cloud properties and meteorological parameters that may be used for global climate model (GCM) diagnostics and parameterization. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) generally increases with lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and lifting condensation level (LCL), whereas cloud drizzle frequency is favored by weak LTS and negligible cold air advection. Cloud fraction (CF) depends strongly on variations in LTS, and to a lesser extent on surface air temperature advection and LCL, although the relationships vary from region to region. The authors propose capturing the effects of these three parameters on CF via their linear combination in terms of a single parameter, the effective lower-tropospheric stability (eLTS). Results indicate that eLTS offers a marked improvement over LTS alone in explaining the median CF variations within the different study regions. A parameterization of CF in terms of eLTS is provided, which produces results that are improved over those of Klein and Hartmann's LTS-only parameterization. However, the new parameterization may not predict the observed variability correctly, and the authors propose a method that might address this shortcoming via a statistical approach.

The examination of L1B and L2 data revealed that L2 products such as SST, Rrs and BRDF were not very useful due to erroneous atmospheric corrections. Visual examination of raw radiance data i.e. L1B data in the 250 and 500 m spatial resolution was found to be the simplest yet feasible method for spill detection. The study further revealed that atmospherically uncorrected radiances at 469, 555 and 645 nm were showing significant signature of oil spill. Therefore an attempt was made to perform ratio operations to enhance the feature. The study concluded that the ratio of difference and sum at 645 and 555 nm, normalized by 469 nm, provides the best result. The result was validated by comparing with the previous published literature. The result clearly indicates the potential of MODIS-Aqua high resolution data in oil spill monitoring. Therefore, MODIS-Aqua data with daily coverage and high resolution can be reliable and cost-effective for such events.

Validation of SeaWiFS and MODIS aerosol products with globally distributed AERONET data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The validation of aerosol products derived from ocean color missions is required for the assessment of their uncertainties and as a diagnostic for the atmospheric correction schemes used for determining the ocean apparent optical properties. A comprehensive validation of the aerosol products obtained from the ocean color missions SeaWiFS and MODIS is presented; it relies on the field observations collected at 85 AERONET sites and is completed by preliminary results obtained with the data of the maritime AERONET component. A robust match-up selection protocol yields approximately 7000 match-ups for each sensor. The median absolute relative difference for the aerosol optical thickness tau(a) increases from 20-22% at 443 nm to 45-48% in the near-infrared. The validation statistics are comparable for both sensors but MODIS results appear degraded particularly for sites located on isolated islands. The median absolute difference is approximately 0.03 at all wavelengths. Results are further analyzed for specific geographic regions or groups of sites selected to represent oceanic, continental, or desert dust conditions. Importantly, the match-up sets appear generally representative of the regional natural variability in tau(a) amplitude and spectral shape, with the notable exception of high tau(a) conditions that are excluded. An important finding is the underestimate by the atmospheric correction of the Angstrom exponent alpha with a median bias of -0.52. This underestimate is apparent even at low alpha values and regularly increases with alpha. This discrepancy in tau(a) spectral shape might result from an inappropriate set of candidate aerosol models and/or uncertainties in the calibration at the near-infrared bands. As the validation data base is expanded and updated in relation to new versions of the processing chains, this work provides a benchmark for the assessment of the aerosol products derived from the SeaWiFS and MODIS ocean color missions.

Global scale emission and distribution of sea-spray aerosol: Sea-salt and organic enrichment	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The chemical composition of marine aerosols as a function of their size is an important parameter for the evaluation of their impact on the global climate system. In this work we model fine particle organic matter emitted by sea spray processes and its influence on the aerosol chemical properties at the global scale using the off-line global Chemistry-Transport Model TM5. TM5 is coupled to a microphysical aerosol dynamics model providing size resolved information on particle masses and numbers. The mass of the emitted sea spray particles is partitioned between water insoluble organic matter (WIOM) and sea salt components in the accumulation mode using a function that relates the emitted organic fraction to the surface ocean chlorophyll-a concentrations. The global emission in the sub-micron size range of organic matter by sea spray process is 8.2 Tg yr(-1), compared to 24 Tg fine yr(-1) sea-salt emissions. When the marine sources are included, the concentrations of modelled primary particulate organic matter (POM) increase mainly over the oceans. The model predictions of WIOM and sea salt are evaluated against measurements carried out at Mace Head (Northern Hemisphere) and Amsterdam Island (Southern Hemisphere), showing that in clean marine conditions WIOM marine emissions contribute significantly to POM values.

MODIS and SeaWiFS satellite data of Chlorophyll-a and ECMWF solar incoming radiation, wind speed, and temperature are driving the oceanic emissions in the model. Based on the adopted parameterisations, the SOA and the submicron POA marine sources are evaluated at about 5 Tg yr(-1) (similar to 1.5 Tg C yr(-1)) and 7 to 8 Tg yr(-1) (similar to 4 Tg C yr(-1)), respectively. The computed marine SOA originates from the dimethylsulfide oxidation (similar to 78%), the potentially formed dialkyl amine salts (similar to 21%), and marine hydrocarbon oxidation (similar to 0.1%). Comparison of calculations with observations indicates an additional marine source of soluble organic carbon that could be partially encountered by marine POA chemical ageing.				rinaldi, matteo/K-6083-2012; Tsigaridis, Kostas/K-8292-2012; CHEMATMO Group, Isac/P-7180-2014; O'Dowd , Colin/K-8904-2012; Myriokefalitakis, Stylianos/J-3701-2014; FACCHINI, MARIA CRISTINA/O-1230-2015; Facchini, Maria Cristina/B-3369-2014; Kanakidou, Maria/D-7882-2012	rinaldi, matteo/0000-0001-6543-4000; Tsigaridis, Kostas/0000-0001-5328-819X; O'Dowd , Colin/0000-0002-3068-2212; Myriokefalitakis, Stylianos/0000-0002-1541-7680; FACCHINI, MARIA CRISTINA/0000-0003-4833-9305; Facchini, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-4833-9305; Kanakidou, Maria/0000-0002-1724-9692												1687-9309						2010									939171	10.1155/2010/939171								WOS:000208403000047

Gerard			Wind Speed Influences on Marine Aerosol Optical Depth	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												The Mulcahy (Mulcahy et al., 2008) power-law parameterization, derived at the coastal Atlantic station Mace Head, between clean marine aerosol optical depth (AOD) and wind speed is compared to open ocean MODIS-derived AOD versus wind speed. The reported AOD versus wind speed (U) was a function of similar to U-2. The open ocean MODIS-derived AOD at 550 nm and 860 nm wavelengths, while in good agreement with the general magnitude of the Mulcahy parameterization, follows a power-law with the exponent ranging from 0.72 to 2.47 for a wind speed range of 2-18 m s(-1). For the four cases examined, some MODIS cases underestimated AOD while other cases overestimated AOD relative to the Mulcahy scheme. Overall, the results from MODIS support the general power-law relationship of Mulcahy, although some linear cases were also encountered in the MODIS dataset. Deviations also arise between MODIS and Mulcahy at higher wind speeds (> 15 m s(-1)), where MODIS-derived AOD returns lower values as compared to Mulcahy. The results also support the suggestion than wind generated sea spray, under moderately high winds, can rival anthropogenic pollution plumes advecting out into marine environments with wind driven AOD contributing to AOD values approaching 0.3.

Evaluation of aerosol distributions in the GISS-TOMAS global aerosol microphysics model with remote sensing observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Coefficient (AC) predictions in the GISS-TOMAS model of global aerosol microphysics are evaluated against remote sensing data from MODIS, MISR, and AERONET. The model AOD agrees well (within a factor of two) over polluted continental (or high sulfate), dusty, and moderate sea-salt regions but less well over the equatorial, high sea-salt, and biomass burning regions. Underprediction of sea-salt in the equatorial region is likely due to GCM meteorology (low wind speeds and high precipitation). For the Southern Ocean, overprediction of AOD is very likely due to high sea-salt emissions and perhaps aerosol water uptake in the model. However, uncertainties in cloud screening at high latitudes make it difficult to evaluate the model AOD there with the satellite-based AOD. AOD in biomass burning regions is underpredicted, a tendency found in other global models but more severely here. Using measurements from the LBA-SMOCC 2002 campaign, the surface-level OC concentration in the model are found to be underpredicted severely during the dry season while much less severely for EC concentration, suggesting the low AOD in the model is due to underpredictions in OM mass. The potential for errors in emissions and wet deposition to contribute to this bias is discussed.

Statistical properties of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions in South America	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Given the complex interaction between aerosol, cloud, and atmospheric properties, it is difficult to extract their individual effects to observed rainfall amount. This research uses principle component analysis (PCA) that combines Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and cloud products, NCEP Reanalysis atmospheric products, and rainrate estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) to assess if aerosols affect warm rain processes. Data collected during September 2006 over the Amazon basin in South America during the biomass-burning season are used. The goal of this research is to combine these observations into a smaller number of variables through PCA with each new variable having a unique physical interpretation. In particular, we are concerned with PC variables whose weightings include aerosol optical thickness (AOT), as these may be an indicator of aerosol indirect effects. If they are indeed occurring, then PC values that include AOT should change as a function of rainrate. To emphasize the advantage of PCA, changes in aerosol, cloud, and atmospheric observations are compared to rainrate. Comparing no-rain, rain, and heavy rain only (> 5 mm h(-1)) samples, we find that cloud thicknesses, humidity, and upward motion are all greater during rain and heavy rain conditions. However, no statistically significant difference in AOT exists between each sample, indicating that atmospheric conditions are more important to rainfall than aerosol concentrations as expected. If aerosols are affecting warm process clouds, it would be expected that stratiform precipitation would decrease as a function increasing aerosol concentration through either Twomey and/or semi-direct effects. PCA extracts the latter signal in a variable labeled PC2, which explains 15% of the total variance and is second in importance the variable (PC1) containing the broad atmospheric conditions. PC2 contains weightings showing that AOT is inversely proportional to low-level humidity and cloud optical thickness. Increasing AOT is also positively correlated with increasing low-level instability due to aerosol absorption. The nature of these weightings is strongly suggestive that PC2 is an indicator of the semi-direct effect with larger values associated with lower rainfall rates. PC weightings consistent with the Twomey effect (an anti-correlation between AOT and cloud droplet effective radius) are only present in higher order PC variables that explain less than 1% of the total variance, and do not vary significantly as a function of rainrate. If the Twomey effect is occurring, it is highly non-linear and/or being overshadowed by other processes. Using the raw variables alone, these determinations could not be made; thus, we are able to show the advantage of using advanced statistical techniques such as PCA for analysis of aerosols impacts on precipitation in South America.

On the transitions in marine boundary layer cloudiness	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Satellite observations and meteorological reanalysis are used to examine the transition from unbroken sheets of stratocumulus to fields of scattered cumulus, and the processes controlling them, in four subtropical oceans. A Lagrangian analysis suggests that both the transition, defined as the temporal evolution in cloudiness, and the processes driving the transition, are quite similar among the subtropical oceans. The increase in sea surface temperature and the associated decrease in lower tropospheric stability appear to play a far more important role in cloud evolution than other factors including changes in large scale divergence and upper tropospheric humidity. During the summer months, the transitions in marine boundary layer cloudiness appear so systematically that their characteristics obtained by documenting the flow of thousands of individual air masses are well reproduced by the mean (or climatological) fields of the different data sets. This highlights interesting opportunities for future observational and modeling studies of these transitions.

Model of optical response of marine aerosols to Forbush decreases	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												In order to elucidate the effect of galactic cosmic rays on cloud formation, we investigate the optical response of marine aerosols to Forbush decreases - abrupt decreases in galactic cosmic rays - by means of modeling. We vary the nucleation rate of new aerosols, in a sectional coagulation and condensation model, according to changes in ionization by the Forbush decrease. From the resulting size distribution we then calculate the aerosol optical thickness and Angstrom exponent, for the wavelength pairs 350, 450 nm and 550, 900 nm. In the cases where the output parameters from the model seem to compare best with atmospheric observations we observe, for the shorter wavelength pair, a change in Angstrom exponent, following the Forbush Decrease, of -6 to +3%. In some cases we also observe a delay in the change of Angstrom exponent, compared to the maximum of the Forbush decrease, which is caused by different sensitivities of the probing wavelengths to changes in aerosol number concentration and size. For the long wavelengths these changes are generally smaller. The types and magnitude of change is investigated for a suite of nucleation rates, condensable gas production rates, and aerosol loss rates. Furthermore we compare the model output with observations of 5 of the largest Forbush decreases after year 2000. For the 350, 450 nm pair we use AERONET data and find a comparable change in signal while the Angstrom Exponent is lower in the model than in the data, due to AERONET being mainly sampled over land. For 550, 900 nm we compare with both AERONET and MODIS and find little to no response in both model and observations. In summary our study shows that the optical properties of aerosols show a distinct response to Forbush Decreases, assuming that the nucleation of fresh aerosols is driven by ions. Shorter wavelengths seem more favorable for observing these effects and great care should be taken when analyzing observations, in order to avoid the signal being drowned out by noise.																	1680-7316	1680-7324					2010	10	6					2765	2776		10.5194/acp-10-2765-2010								WOS:000276182100014

Subseasonal variability of low cloud radiative properties over the southeast Pacific Ocean	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Subseasonal variability of cloud radiative properties in the persistent southeast Pacific stratocumulus deck is investigated using MODIS satellite observations and NCEP reanalysis data. A once-daily albedo proxy is derived based on the fractional coverage of low cloud (a macrophysical field) and the cloud albedo, with the latter broken down into contributions from microphysics (cloud droplet concentration) and macrophysics (liquid water path). Subseasonal albedo variability is dominated by the contribution of low cloud fraction variability, except within 10-15 degrees of the South American coast, where cloud albedo variability contributes significantly. Covariance between cloud fraction and cloud albedo also contributes significantly and positively to the variance in albedo, which highlights how complex and inseparable the factors controlling albedo are. Droplet concentration variability contributes only weakly to the subseasonal variability of albedo, which emphasizes that attributing albedo variability to the indirect effects of aerosols against the backdrop of natural meteorological variability is extremely challenging. The dominant large scale meteorological variability is associated with the subtropical high pressure system. Two indices representing changes in the subtropical high strength and extent explain 80-90% of this variability, and significantly modulate the cloud microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative cloud properties. Variations in droplet concentration of up to 50% of the mean are associated with the meteorological driving. We hypothesize that these fluctuations in droplet concentration are a result of the large scale meteorology and their correlation with cloud macrophysical properties should not be used as evidence of aerosol effects. Mechanisms by which large scale meteorology affects cloud properties are explored. Our results support existing hypotheses linking cloud cover variability to changes in cold advection, subsidence, and lower tropospheric stability. Within 10 degrees of the coast interactions between variability in the surface high pressure system and the orography appear to modulate both cloud macrophysical properties and aerosol transport through suppression of the marine boundary layer depth near the coast. This suggests one possible way in which cloud macrophysical properties and droplet concentration may be correlated independently of the second aerosol indirect effect. The results provide variability constraints for models that strive to represent both meteorological and aerosol impacts on stratocumulus clouds.

The PreVOCA experiment: modeling the lower troposphere in the Southeast Pacific	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Preliminary VOCALS Model Assessment (PreVOCA) aims to assess contemporary atmospheric modeling of the subtropical South East Pacific, with a particular focus on the clouds and the marine boundary layer (MBL). Models results from fourteen modeling centers were collected including operational forecast models, regional models, and global climate models for the month of October 2006. Forecast models and global climate models produced daily forecasts, while most regional models were run continuously during the study period, initialized and forced at the boundaries with global model analyses. Results are compared in the region from 40 degrees S to the equator and from 110 degrees W to 70 degrees W, corresponding to the Pacific coast of South America. Mean-monthly model surface winds agree well with QuikSCAT observed winds and models agree fairly well on mean weak large-scale subsidence in the region next to the coast. However they have greatly differing geographic patterns of mean cloud fraction with only a few models agreeing well with MODIS observations. Most models also underestimate the MBL depth by several hundred meters in the eastern part of the study region. The diurnal cycle of liquid water path is underestimated by most models at the 85 degrees W 20 degrees S stratus buoy site compared with satellite, consistent with previous modeling studies. The low cloud fraction is also underestimated during all parts of the diurnal cycle compared to surface-based climatologies. Most models qualitatively capture the MBL deepening around 15 October 2006 at the stratus buoy, associated with colder air at 700 hPa.

Microphysical variability in southeast Pacific Stratocumulus clouds: synoptic conditions and radiative response	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Synoptic and satellite-derived cloud property variations for the southeast Pacific stratocumulus region associated with changes in coastal satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentrations (N-d) are explored. MAX and MIN N-d composites are defined by the top and bottom terciles of daily area-mean N-d values over the Arica Bight, the region with the largest mean oceanic N-d, for the five October months of 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The ability of the satellite retrievals to capture composite differences is assessed with ship-based data. N-d and ship-based accumulation mode aerosol concentrations (N-a) correlate well (r = 0.65), with a best-fit aerosol activation value dlnN(d)/dlnN(a) of 0.56 for pixels with N-d > 50 cm(-3). The adiabatically-derived MODIS cloud depths also correlate well with the ship-based cloud depths (r = 0.7), though are consistently higher (mean bias of almost 60 m). The MAX-N-d composite is characterized by a weaker subtropical anticyclone and weaker winds both at the surface and the lower free troposphere than the MIN-N-d composite. The MAX-N-d composite clouds over the Arica Bight are thinner than the MIN-N-d composite clouds, have lower cloud tops, lower near-coastal cloud albedos, and occur below warmer and drier free tropospheres (as deduced from radiosondes and NCEP Reanalysis). CloudSat radar reflectivities indicate little near-coastal precipitation. The co-occurrence of more boundary-layer aerosol/higher N-d within a more stable atmosphere suggests a boundary layer source for the aerosol, rather than the free troposphere. The MAX-N-d composite cloud thinning extends offshore to 80 degrees W, with lower cloud top heights out to 95 degrees W. At 85 degrees W, the top-of-atmosphere shortwave fluxes are significantly higher (similar to 50%) for the MAX-N-d composite, with thicker, lower clouds and higher cloud fractions than for the MIN-N-d composite. The change in N-d at this location is small (though positive), suggesting that the MAX-MIN N-d composite differences in radiative properties primarily reflects synoptic changes. Circulation anomalies and a one-point spatial correlation map reveal a weakening of the 850 hPa southerly winds decreases the free tropospheric cold temperature advection. The resulting increase in the static stability along 85 degrees W is highly correlated to the increased cloud fraction, despite accompanying weaker free tropospheric subsidence.

Estimating the maritime component of aerosol optical depth and its dependency on surface wind speed using satellite data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Six years (2003-2008) of satellite measurements of aerosol parameters from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface wind speeds from Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), are used to provide a comprehensive perspective on the link between surface wind speed and marine aerosol optical depth over tropical and subtropical oceanic regions. A systematic comparison between the satellite derived fields in these regions allows to: (i) separate the relative contribution of wind-induced marine aerosol to the aerosol optical depth; (ii) extract an empirical linear equation linking coarse marine aerosol optical depth and wind intensity; and (iii) identify a time scale for correlating marine aerosol optical depth and surface wind speed. The contribution of wind induced marine aerosol to aerosol optical depth is found to be dominated by the coarse mode elements. When wind intensity exceeds 4 m/s, coarse marine aerosol optical depth is linearly correlated with the surface wind speed, with a remarkably consistent slope of 0.009 +/- 0.002 s/m. A detailed time scale analysis shows that the linear correlation between the fields is well kept within a 12 h time frame, while sharply decreasing when the time lag between measurements is longer. The background aerosol optical depth, associated with aerosols that are not produced in-situ through wind driven processes, can be used for estimating the contributions of terrestrial and biogenic marine aerosol to over-ocean satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth.

Dust aerosol effect on semi-arid climate over Northwest China detected from A-Train satellite measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The impact of dust aerosols on the semi-arid climate of Northwest China is analyzed by comparing aerosol and cloud properties derived over the China semi-arid region (hereafter, CSR) and the United States semi-arid region (hereafter, USR) using several years of surface and A-Train satellite observations during active dust event seasons. These regions have similar climatic conditions, but aerosol concentrations are greater over the CSR. Because the CSR is close to two major dust source regions (Taklamakan and Gobi deserts), the aerosols over the CSR not only contain local anthropogenic aerosols (agricultural dust, black carbon and other anthropogenic aerosols), but also include natural dust transported from the source regions. The aerosol optical depth, averaged over a 3-month period, derived from MODIS for the CSR is 0.27, which is 47% higher than that over the USR (0.19). Although transported natural dust only accounts for 53% of this difference, it is a major contributor to the average absorbing aerosol index, which is 27% higher in the CSR (1.07) than in the USR (0.84). During dust event periods, liquid water cloud particle size, optical depth and liquid water path are smaller by 9%, 30% and 33% compared to dust-free conditions, respectively.

A combined observational and modeling approach to study modern dust transport from the Patagonia desert to East Antarctica	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The understanding of present atmospheric transport processes from Southern Hemisphere (SH) landmasses to Antarctica can improve the interpretation of stratigraphic data in Antarctic ice cores. In addition, long range transport can deliver key nutrients normally not available to marine ecosystems in the Southern Ocean and may trigger or enhance primary productivity. However, there is a dearth of observational based studies of dust transport in the SH. This work aims to improve current understanding of dust transport in the SH by showing a characterization of two dust events originating in the Patagonia desert (south end of South America). The approach is based on a combined and complementary use of satellite retrievals (detectors MISR, MODIS, GLAS, POLDER, OMI), transport model simulation (HYSPLIT) and surface observations near the sources and aerosol measurements in Antarctica (Neumayer and Concordia sites). Satellite imagery and visibility observations confirm dust emission in a stretch of dry lakes along the coast of the Tierra del Fuego (TdF) island (similar to 54A degrees S) and from the shores of the Colihue Huapi lake in Central Patagonia (similar to 46A degrees S) in February 2005. Model simulations initialized by these observations reproduce the timing of an observed increase in dust concentration at the Concordia Station and some of the observed increases in atmospheric aerosol absorption (here used as a dust proxy) in the Neumayer station. The TdF sources were the largest contributors of dust at both sites. The transit times from TdF to the Neumayer and Concordia sites are 6-7 and 9-10 days respectively. Lidar observations and model outputs coincide in placing most of the dust cloud in the boundary layer and suggest significant deposition over the ocean immediately downwind. Boundary layer dust was detected as far as 1800 km from the source and similar to 800 km north of the South Georgia Island over the central sub-Antarctic Atlantic Ocean. Although the analysis suggests the presence of dust at similar to 1500 km SW of South Africa five days after, the limited capabilities of existing satellite platforms to differentiate between aerosol types do not permit a definitive conclusion. In addition, the model simulations show dust lifting to the free troposphere as it travels south but it could not be confirmed by the satellite observations due to cloudiness. This work demonstrates that complementary information from existing transport models, satellite and surface data can yield a consistent picture of the dust transport from the Patagonia desert to Antarctica. It also illustrates the limitation of using any of these approaches individually to characterize the transport of dust in a heavily cloudy area.

Testing remote sensing on artificial observations: impact of drizzle and 3-D cloud structure on effective radius retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Remote sensing of cloud effective particle size with passive sensors like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an important tool for cloud microphysical studies. As a measure of the radiatively relevant droplet size, effective radius can be retrieved with different combinations of visible through shortwave and midwave infrared channels. In practice, retrieved effective radii from these combinations can be quite different. This difference is perhaps indicative of different penetration depths and path lengths for the spectral reflectances used. In addition, operational liquid water cloud retrievals are based on the assumption of a relatively narrow distribution of droplet sizes; the role of larger precipitation particles in these distributions is neglected. Therefore, possible explanations for the discrepancy in some MODIS spectral size retrievals could include 3-D radiative transport effects, including sub-pixel cloud inhomogeneity, and/or the impact of drizzle formation. For three cloud cases the possible factors of influence are isolated and investigated in detail by the use of simulated cloud scenes and synthetic satellite data: marine boundary layer cloud scenes from large eddy simulations (LES) with detailed microphysics are combined with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations that explicitly account for the detailed droplet size distributions as well as 3-D radiative transfer to simulate MODIS observations. The operational MODIS optical thickness and effective radius retrieval algorithm is applied to these and the results are compared to the given LES microphysics. We investigate two types of marine cloud situations each with and without drizzle from LES simulations: (1) a typical daytime stratocumulus deck at two times in the diurnal cycle and (2) one scene with scattered cumulus. Only small impact of drizzle formation on the retrieved domain average and on the differences between the three effective radius retrievals is noticed for both cloud scene types for different reasons. For our, presumably typical, overcast stratocumulus scenes with an optical thickness of 8 to 9 and rain rates at cloud bottom up to 0.05 mm/h clear drizzle impact on the retrievals can be excluded. The cumulus scene does not show much drizzle sensitivity either despite extended drizzle areas being directly visible from above (locally >1 mm/h), which is mainly due to technical characteristics of the standard retrieval approach. 3-D effects, on the other hand, produce large discrepancies between the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m channel observations compared to 3.7 mu m retrievals in the latter case. A general sensitivity of MODIS particle size data to drizzle formation is not corroborated by our case studies.

Constraints on interactions between aerosols and clouds on a global scale from a combination of MODIS-CERES satellite data and climate simulations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Satellite-based cloud top effective radius retrieved by the CERES Science Team were combined with simulated aerosol concentrations from CCCma CanAM4 to examine relationships between aerosol and cloud that underlie the first aerosol indirect (cloud albedo) effect. Evidence of a strong negative relationship between sulphate, and organic aerosols, with cloud top effective radius was found for low clouds, indicating both aerosol types are contributing to the first indirect effect on a global scale. Furthermore, effects of aerosol on the cloud droplet effective radius are more pronounced for larger cloud liquid water paths. While CanAM4 broadly reproduces the observed relationship between sulphate aerosols and cloud droplets, it does not reproduce the dependency of cloud top droplet size on organic aerosol concentrations nor the dependency on cloud liquid water path. Simulations with a modified version of the model yield a more realistic dependency of cloud droplets on organic carbon. The robustness of the methods used in the study are investigated by repeating the analysis using aerosol simulated by the GOCART model and cloud top effective radii derived from the MODIS Science Team.				ma, xiaoyan/D-2308-2014													1680-7316						2010	10	20					9851	9861		10.5194/acp-10-9851-2010								WOS:000283663000009

The regional land use is dominated by sugarcane cultivation, beef grazing and urban uses. The high nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fluxes from these land uses via river runoff produced a massive phytoplankton bloom in the GBR lagoon, which, after 9 days, had spread 150 km offshore. The plume and algal bloom surrounded inner-shelf reefs of the GBR such as Brampton Island Reef and its spread was tracked with a variety of satellite sensors including MODIS, SeaWiFS and Landsat over the 9-day period. The ability to be able to access imagery from a large number of satellite sensors allowed almost daily estimates of the extent of plume to be made, despite periods of cloud. Analysis of water samples from the plume revealed elevated (2-50 times higher) concentrations of Chlorophyll a (and hence phytoplankton biomass), up to 50 times higher than in non-flood conditions, nutrients (2-100 times higher) and herbicide residues (10-100 times higher) compared with GBR lagoon waters in non-discharge conditions. The concentration data from the samples and estimated exposure periods from the satellite images allowed estimates of the exposure of GBR marine ecosystems (coral reefs, the pelagic community, seagrass beds and mangrove forests) to the terrestrial contaminants to be made.

The data were used to (1) characterize the three-dimensional spatial pattern of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the water column, (2) to examine the relationships between whale foraging areas and productive zones, and (3) to examine the correlation between whale-derived in situ values of Chl-a and those from concurrent satellite images using the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EOS-AQUA satellite (MOD21, SeaWifs analogue OC3M and SST MOD37). Bowhead whales traversed 1600 km2, providing information on diving, Chl-a structure and temperature profiles to depths below 200 m. Feeding dives frequently passed through surface waters (50 m) and targeted depths close to the bottom, and whales did not always target patches of high concentrations of Chl-a in the upper 50 m. Five satellite images were available within the periods whales carried fluorometers. Whales traversed 91 pixels collecting on average 761 s (SD 826) of Chl-a samples per pixel (0-136 m). The depth of the Chl-a maximum ranged widely, from 1 to 66 m. Estimates of Chl-a made from the water-leaving radiance measurements using the OC3M algorithm were highly skewed with most samples estimated as 1 mg m-3 Chl-a, while data collected from whales had a broad distribution with Chl-a reaching 9 mg m-3. The correlation between the satellite-derived and whale-derived Chl-a maxima was poor, a linear fit explained only 10% of the variance.																	1745-1000						2010	6	6					519	529	PII 924373410	10.1080/17451000903505616								WOS:000282581100001

Prediction of ecological niches and carbon export by appendicularians using a new multispecies ecophysiological model	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We developed, calibrated and validated an ecophysiological model that represents food consumption, growth and production of faecal pellets and discarded houses during the life cycle of Oikopleura dioica, O. longicauda, O. fusiformis and O. rufescens, which are among the most abundant appendicularian species in the ocean. The forcing variables of the model are temperature (T) and food concentration. We calculated the growth rates of the 4 species and predicted the dominant species as a function of environmental conditions on 3 ecological applications. Firstly, we used the seasonal changes in T and chlorophyll a (chl a) in the English Channel to predict the seasonal succession of the 4 species. Secondly, using sea surface T and chl a data from the MODIS satellite, we determined the dominant appendicularian species over the World Ocean, thus providing a first-ever description of appendicularian biogeography over the 4 different seasons. Thirdly, we applied our model to in situ observations performed with the Underwater Video Profiler during the POMIAE 3 cruise in the Northeastern Atlantic in 2001. In areas of high appendicularian concentrations (135 ind. m(-3)), the appendicularians grazed daily only 0.6% of the stock of total particulate carbon. Of this grazed material, 21 % was used for growth, 14 % was respired and 65% was lost as detritus. Based on our model predictions, we concluded that at 2 of the 4 sampling stations, the integrated mass of detritus produced by the appendicularian population equalled or exceeded the carbon flux recorded in sediment traps at 200 m depth. This indicated high rates of disaggregation and/or consumption of these particles during their transit to depth.

Comparison of global ocean colour data records	OCEAN SCIENCE												The extending record of ocean colour derived information, an important asset for the study of marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry, presently relies on individual satellite missions launched by several space agencies with differences in sensor design, calibration strategies and algorithms. In this study we present an extensive comparative analysis of standard products obtained from operational global ocean colour sensors (SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS-Aqua, MODIS-Terra), on both global and regional scales. The analysis is based on monthly mean chlorophyll a (Chl-a) sea surface concentration between 2002 and 2009. Based on global statistics, the Chl-a records appear relatively consistent. The root mean square (RMS) difference Delta between (log-transformed) Chl-a from SeaWiFS and MODIS Aqua amounts to 0.137, with a bias of 0.074 (SeaWiFS Chl-a higher). The difference between these two products and MERIS Chl-a is approximately 0.15. Restricting the analysis to 2007 only, Delta between MODIS Aqua and Terra is 0.142. This global convergence is significantly modulated regionally. Statistics for biogeographic provinces representing a partition of the global ocean, show Delta values varying between 0.08 and 0.3. High latitude regions, as well as coastal and shelf provinces are generally the areas with the largest differences. Moreover, RMS differences and biases are modulated in time, with a coefficient of variation of Delta varying between 10% and 40%, with clear seasonal patterns in some provinces. The comparison of the province-averaged time series obtained from the various satellite products also shows a level of agreement that is geographically variable. Overall, the Chl-a SeaWiFS and MODIS Aqua series appear to have similar levels of variance and display high correlation coefficients, an agreement likely favoured by the common elements shared by the two missions. These results are degraded if the MERIS series is compared to either SeaWiFS or MODIS Aqua. An important outcome of the study is that the results of the inter-comparison analysis are variable with time and location, and therefore globally averaged statistics are not necessarily applicable on a seasonal or regional basis.																	1812-0784						2010	6	1					61	76		10.5194/os-6-61-2010								WOS:000276175700006

Three AERONET-OC European coastal sites exhibiting different atmospheric and marine optical properties were considered for the study: the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) in the northern Adriatic Sea representing Case-1 and Case-2 moderately sediment dominated waters; and, the Gustaf Dalen Lighthouse Tower (GDLT) in the northern Baltic Proper and the Helsinki Lighthouse Tower (HLT) in the Gulf of Finland, both characterized by Case-2 waters dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The analysis of MODIS derived normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm, L-WN(551), has shown relatively good results for all sites with uncertainties of the order of 10% and biases ranging from -1 to -4%. Larger uncertainty and bias have been observed at 443 nm for the AAOT (i.e., 18 and -7%, respectively). At the same center wavelength, results for GDLT and HLT have exhibited much larger uncertainties (i.e., 56 and 67%, respectively) and biases (i.e., 18 and 25%, respectively), which undermine the possibility of presently using remote sensing L-WN data at the blue center wavelengths for bio-optical investigations in the Baltic Sea. An evaluation of satellite derived aerosol optical thickness, tau(a), has shown uncertainties and biases of the order of tens of percent increasing with wavelength at all sites. Specifically, MODIS derived tau(a) at 869 rim, has shown an overestimate of 71% at the AAOT, 101% at GDLT and 91% at HLT, respectively. This result highlights the effects of a limited number of aerosol models for the atmospheric correction process, and might also indicate the need of applying a vicarious calibration factor to the remote sensing data at the 869 nm center wavelength to remove the effects of uncertainties in the atmospheric optical model and the space sensor radiometric calibration. Similar results have been obtained from the analysis of SeaWiFS data. Finally, in view of illustrating the possibility of increasing the accuracy of satellite regional radiometric products, AERONET-OC data have been applied to reduce systematic errors in MODIS and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) L-WN data likely due to the atmospheric correction process. Results relying on MODIS match-ups for the Baltic Sites (i.e., GDLT and HLT) and MERIS matchups for the AAOT, have indicated a substantial reduction of both uncertainty and bias in the blue and red center wavelengths.

Variations in the aerosol optical properties and types over the tropical urban site of Hyderabad, India	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol measurements over the tropical urban site of Hyderabad, India, provide a way of determining the variability of the aerosol characteristics over a duration of 1 year (October 2007 to September 2008). The meteorological pattern over India, mainly driven by the regional monsoons, has a great effect on the amount and size distribution of the aerosols. Higher aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are observed in premonsoon, while the variability of the Angstrom exponent (alpha) seems to be more pronounced, with higher values in winter and premonsoon and lower values in the monsoon periods. The AOD at 500 nm (AOD(500)) is very large over Hyderabad, varying from 0.46 +/- 0.17 in postmonsoon to 0.65 +/- 0.22 in premonsoon periods. A discrimination of the different aerosol types over Hyderabad is also attempted using values of AOD(500) and alpha(380-870). Such discrimination is rather difficult to interpret since a single aerosol type can partly be identified only under specific conditions (e. g., anthropogenic emissions, biomass burning or dust outbreaks), while the presence of mixed aerosols, without dominance of the coarse or accumulation mode, is the usual situation. According to the analysis the three individual components of differing origin, composition and optical characteristics are (1) an urban/industrial aerosol type composed of aerosols produced locally and all year round by combustion activities in the city or long-range transported (mainly in spring) biomass burning, (2) an aerosol type of mineral origin raised by the wind in the deserts (mainly in premonsoon) or constituting coarse-mode aerosols under high relative humidity conditions mainly in the monsoon period, and (3) an aerosol type with a marine influence under background conditions occurring in monsoon and postmonsoon periods. Nevertheless, the mixed or undetermined aerosol type dominates with percentages varying from 44.3% (premonsoon) to 72.9% (postmonsoon). Spectral AOD and a data are analyzed to obtain information about the adequacy of the simple use of the Angstrom exponent for characterizing the aerosols. This is achieved by taking advantage of the spectral variation of lnAOD versus ln lambda, the so-called curvature. The results show that the spectral curvature can be effectively used as a tool for aerosol types discrimination, since the fine-mode aerosols exhibit negative curvature, while the coarse-mode particles are positive.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 19	2009	114								D22204	10.1029/2009JD012423								WOS:000271996000002

To ensure long-term sustainability of scallop production, suitable sites need to be selected. This study was conducted to identify the most suitable sites for hanging culture of Japanese scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) based on measured biophysical parameters and modeled using geographic information system (GIS) models. Four biophysical parameters that influence Japanese scallop aquaculture in Funka Bay were selected: sea temperature, food availability (chlorophyll-a), suspended solid, and bathymetry. The SeaWiFS and MODIS images were used to extract most of these parameters. A series of GIS models was developed to identify suitable sites for scallop culture using a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) known as weighted linear combination. Suitability scores were ranked on a scale from 1 (least suitable) to 8 (most suitable), and about 83% of the total potential area with bottom depths less than 60 m had scores of 7 and 8. The final model outputs were compared with field verification data and found to be consistent. Local sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model output. Based on this analysis, the order of importance of the variables affecting the model was as follows: suspended solid > chlorophyll-a > sea temperature.

J	Kubar, TL; Hartmann, DL; Wood, R				Kubar, Terence L.; Hartmann, Dennis L.; Wood, Robert			Understanding the Importance of Microphysics and Macrophysics for Warm Rain in Marine Low Clouds. Part I: Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The importance of macrophysical variables [cloud thickness, liquid water path (LWP)] and microphysical variables (effective radius r(e), effective droplet concentration N-eff) on warm drizzle intensity and frequency across the tropics and subtropics is studied. In this first part of a two-part study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical and CloudSat cloud radar data are used to understand warm rain in marine clouds. Part 11 uses simple heuristic models. Cloud-top height and LWP substantially increase as drizzle intensity increases. Droplet radius estimated from MODIS also increases with cloud radar reflectivity (dBZ) but levels off as dBZ > 0, except where the influence of continental pollution is present, in which case a monotonic increase of r(e) with drizzle intensity occurs. Off the Asian coast and over the Gulf of Mexico, r(e) values are smaller (by several mu m) and N-eff values are larger compared to more remote marine regions. For heavy drizzle intensity, both r(e) and N-eff values off the Asian coast and over the Gulf of Mexico approach r(e) and N-eff values in more remote marine regions. Drizzle frequency, defined as profiles in which maximum dBZ > -15, increases dramatically and nearly uniformly when cloud tops grow from 1 to 2 km. Drizzle frequencies exceed 90% in all regions when LWPs exceed 250 g m(-2) and N-eff values are below 50 cm(-3), even in regions where drizzle occurs infrequently on the whole. The fact that the relationship among drizzle frequency, LWP, and N-eff is essentially the same for all regions suggests a near universality among tropical and subtropical regions.

J	Ohde, T				Ohde, Thomas			Investigation of hydrogen sulphide eruptions along the Namibian coastline using different remote sensing systems	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Hydrogen sulphide eruptions with their typical turquoise discolorations at the water surface are a unique phenomenon along the Namibian coastline. The remote sensing techniques of ocean colour sensors and microwave scatterometers were used for the investigation of such events. The studies with ocean colour sensors showed that the turquoise discolorations near the Namibian coast were neither linked to dust deposition into the water column by desert storms nor to the reflection of bright material in shallow water areas. In addition, other coloured marine events like algae blooms and river outflows were differentiable from the hydrogen sulphide eruptions by their special optical properties. Quasi-true colour images and spectral identification methods were utilised to monitor and investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of sulphide events. In the past years, they were sometimes and locally limited discovered. Newest remote sensing observations including our own investigations have established that the occurrence of sulphide events is more frequent and longer lasting. The north-westerly direction of propagation and their velocity between 12 cm s(-1) and 15 cm s(-1) were derived from an event on 14 April 2004. Lastly, the microwave scatterometer remote sensing was applied to investigate the relation of sulphide events to oceanographic conditions. The events from May 2004 were clearly related to strong coastal upwelling.

This study provides a proof of concept for mapping of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid coastal waters from geostationary platforms with the existing SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) meteorological sensor on the METEOSAT Second Generation platform. Data are available in near real time every 15 minutes. SEVIRI lacks sufficient bands for chlorophyll remote sensing but its spectral resolution is sufficient for quantification of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid waters, using a single broad red band, combined with a suitable near infrared band. A test data set for mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea was obtained covering 35 consecutive days from June 28 until July 31 2006. Atmospheric correction of SEVIRI images includes corrections for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering, absorption by atmospheric gases and atmospheric transmittances. The aerosol correction uses assumptions on the ratio of marine reflectances and aerosol reflectances in the red and near-infrared bands. A single band TSM retrieval algorithm, calibrated by non-linear regression of seaborne measurements of TSM and marine reflectance was applied. The effect of the above assumptions on the uncertainty of the marine reflectance and TSM products was analysed. Results show that (1) mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea is feasible with SEVIRI for turbid waters, though with considerable uncertainties in clearer waters, (2) TSM maps are well correlated with TSM maps obtained from MODIS AQUA and (3) during cloud-free days, high frequency dynamics of TSM are detected.

Validating the Validation: The Influence of Liquid Water Distribution in Clouds on the Intercomparison of Satellite and Surface Observations	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The intercomparison of LWP retrievals from observations by a geostationary satellite imager [ Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)] and a ground-based microwave ( MW) radiometer is examined in the context of the inhomogeneity of overcast cloudy skies. Although the influence of cloud inhomogeneity on satellite observations has received much attention, relatively little is known about its impact on validation studies. Given SEVIRI's large field of view ( 3 km 3 6 km for northern Europe), especially when compared to the narrow width of the radiometer tracks (100-200 m), cloud inhomogeneity may be expected to significantly affect the satellite retrieval validation. This paper quantifies the various validation uncertainties resulting from cloud inhomogeneities and proposes an approach to minimize these uncertainties. The study is performed by simulating both satellite and ground-based observations through resampling a set of high-resolution (100 m) cloud fields that are derived from 1 km 3 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) observations. The authors' technique for generating realistic high-resolution LWP fields preserves the information present in the original observations and creates extra LWP variation at smaller-length scales by considering clouds as simple fractals. The authors believe that this is a new technique for creating high-resolution LWP fields. Validation errors resulting from cloud inhomogeneity can be classified in two groups. The first group relates entirely to the retrieval process for satellite observations and includes the well-known plane-parallel bias as well as field-of-view mismatches between different channels used in the retrieval. The second group relates to differences in the scene observed by satellite and ground-based sensors. This includes systematic shifts in the observed scene resulting from viewing conditions ( parallax effect), offsets between satellite images and ground sites, and different fields of view. Results indicate that the plane-parallel bias for the authors' sample of 604 clouds has a median value of -3.3 g m(-2). All other error contributions appear to be random and have no biases. For individual observations, the parallax effect easily dominates the total error budget for sites that are observed under large viewing angles (e.g., northern Europe). The authors show that this error may be partly compensated by using information about cloud-top heights and by spatially interpolating among an array of SEVIRI pixels to obtain the best estimate of the satellite-retrieved LWP value over the ground site. Optimal intercomparison of satellite and ground-based observations is also possible by matching the track length of the ground observations to the imager's pixel size in the wind direction. Thus, one surprising conclusion is that the LWP errors resulting from the second group ( scene differences) are significantly larger than those resulting from the first group (satellite retrieval), even after corrections have been applied. Smaller satellite pixels do not alleviate the problem but rather aggravate it, unless the parallax error is corrected. Temporal or spatial averages of observations may be used to reduce the random errors, but the statistical properties of such aggregates are, at the moment, not obvious for reasons that will be discussed. Calibration errors are not considered in the present study.

J	Nagler, PL; Glenn, EP; Hinojosa-Huerta, O				Nagler, Pamela L.; Glenn, Edward P.; Hinojosa-Huerta, Osvel			Synthesis of ground and remote sensing data for monitoring ecosystem functions in the Colorado River Delta, Mexico	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The delta of the Colorado River in Mexico supports a rich mix of estuarine, wetland and riparian ecosystems that provide habitat for over 350 species of birds as well as fish, marine mammals, and other wildlife. An important part of the delta ecosystem is the riparian corridor, which is supported by agricultural return flows and waste spills of water originating in the U.S. and Mexico. These flows may be curtailed in the future due to climate change and changing land use practices (out-of-basin water transfers, increased agricultural efficiency, and more optimal management of dams) in the U.S. and Mexico, and resource managers need to monitor the effects of their water management practices on these ecosystems. We developed ground-validated, remote sensing methods to monitor the vegetation status, habitat value, and water use of wetland and riparian ecosystems using multi-temporal, multi-resolution images. The integrated methodology allowed us to project species composition, leaf area index, fractional cover, habitat value, and evapotranspiration over seasons and years throughout the delta, in response to variable water flows from the U.S. to Mexico. Waste spills of water from the U.S. have regenerated native cottonwood and willow trees in the riparian corridor and created backwater and marsh areas that support birds and other wildlife. However, the main source of water supporting the riparian vegetation is the regional aquifer recharged by underflow from U.S. and Mexico irrigation districts. Native trees have a short half-life in the riparian zone due to human-set fires and harvesting for timber. Active management, monitoring, and restoration programs are needed to maintain the habitat value of this ecosystem for the future.

Morning-to-Afternoon Evolution of Marine Stratus Polluted by Underlying Ships: Implications for the Relative Lifetimes of Polluted and Unpolluted Clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Ship tracks appearing in both the morning and afternoon Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of the United States were used to study the morning-to-afternoon evolution of marine stratus polluted by underlying ships and nearby uncontaminated stratus. Analyzed 925-hPa winds were used to predict the afternoon positions of ship tracks found in the morning imagery. Droplet effective radii, visible optical depths, and liquid water amounts were analyzed for morning and afternoon clouds that, based on the low-level winds, were taken to be the same clouds. As found in a previous study by Segrin et al., both morning and afternoon polluted clouds had smaller droplet radii, larger optical depths, and smaller liquid water amounts than the nearby unpolluted clouds. In contrast to the Segrin et al. study, however, the droplet effective radii decreased significantly from morning to afternoon in both the polluted and unpolluted clouds, with the rate of decrease being twice as large for the unpolluted clouds. The larger decrease in the unpolluted clouds is thought to be caused by drizzle, which is probably absent in the polluted clouds. The observations suggest that, with their slower rate of liquid loss, polluted clouds could have longer lifetimes than their unpolluted counterparts. Of interest is that clouds with similar droplet radii but smaller optical depths, and thus smaller droplet number concentrations and liquid water amounts, exhibited higher sensitivities to the effects of elevated particle concentrations and a greater likelihood of appearing in both the morning and afternoon satellite overpasses.

A combinated approach to investigate the biochemistry and hydrography of a shallow bay in the South Adriatic Sea: the Gulf of Manfredonia (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The main goal of this study is to understand the hydrological and biochemical set up and processes of a marine coastal area located in the western side of the south Adriatic sea (the gulf of Manfredonia) by the use of both satellite images and in situ investigations A water sampling in the gulf of Manfredonia was performed at 18 fixed stations in June 2003; physico-chemical and biological parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence) were measured along the water column and water samples were collected to analyse dissolved nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. Surface spatial distributions of field collected data were examined to characterize biochemical and hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Manfredonia and these results were related with the remote sensing analysis data. Remote sensed data (obtained by Landsat 7 TM and Modis Terra) were processed to obtain maps of chlorophyll a, temperature and optical characteristics of the gulf; these maps were compared to in situ data. From physico-chemical measurements no stratification was observed in the water column except for the south-eastern area. High concentrations of silicate and ammonia were observed in the northern zone of the gulf, while nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll a and total suspended solids distributions showed higher values in the central coastal zone. These results were confirmed by remote sensing analysis; Modis elaboration showed a distribution with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a near the coast and Landsat images highlighted the extension of the surrounding agricultural areas crossed by the two main rivers which discharge into the gulf. The integration between field data with the remote sensing analysis showed to be a valid support in coastal zone management.

A proxy of f(m), empirically derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 data, shows large seasonal and geographical variations that are consistent with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation Transport (GOCART) and Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) model simulations. The so-derived seasonally and spatially varying f(m) is then implemented into a method of estimating tau(a) and direct radiative forcing from the MODIS measurements. It is found that the use of a constant value for f(m) as in previous studies would have overestimated tau(a) by about 20% over global ocean, with the overestimation up to similar to 45% in some regions and seasons. The 7-year (2001-2007) global ocean average tau(a) is 0.035, with yearly average ranging from 0.031 to 0.039. Future improvement in measurements is needed to better separate anthropogenic aerosol from natural ones and to narrow down the wide range of aerosol direct radiative forcing.

Consistency is quantified by the root-mean-square of relative differences between MISR-measured BRF and their plane-parallel values and variation of plane-parallel retrieved optical thickness and spherical albedo across multiple view-angles. Probability distribution functions of consistency show that, for example, these clouds are angularly consistent within 5% in BRF, optical thickness and spherical albedo 72.2%, 39.0% and 81.1% of the time, respectively. We relate angular consistency to the spatial variability of nadir-BRF, thus allowing us to potentially identify, with a prescribed confidence level, which MODIS microphysical retrievals within the MISR swath meet the plane-parallel assumption to within any desired range in view-angle consistency.

Satellite-Observed Location of Stratocumulus Cloud-Top Heights in the Presence of Strong Inversions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Infrared channels on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to infer cloud-top pressure (CTP), temperature, and effective cloud amount or emissivity. For low clouds, those with tops at pressures greater than 700 hPa, the infrared window 11-mu m channel brightness temperature is used to determine the CTP and the corresponding cloud-top temperature by comparison with the temperature profile obtained from the NCEP Global Data Assimilation System meteorological analysis. In the presence of strong inversions which are common for marine stratus and stratocumulus, this leads to the identification of an erroneously high cloud-top height (CTH), This discrepancy is illustrated by comparing MODIS CTHs with those inferred from the geometric method used by the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer on the same satellite platform, and field observations. The error in CTH is typically about 2 km and depends on the shape of the actual temperature profile. It is shown that column water vapor above cloud retrieved from the MODIS solar infrared channels in the vicinity of the 0.94-mu m water vapor absorption band can be used to flag the error and that the location of the true CTH could possibly be obtained using lapse rate formulations for cloud-topped boundary layers.																	0196-2892					MAY	2009	47	5					1421	1428		10.1109/TGRS.2008.2005406								WOS:000265487100017

Seasonal Variation of the Physical Properties of Marine Boundary Layer Clouds off the California Coast	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds can significantly regulate the sensitivity of climate models, yet they are currently poorly simulated. This study aims to characterize the seasonal variations of physical properties of these clouds and their associated processes by using multisatellite data. Measurements from several independent satellite datasets [ International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (CERES-MODIS), Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO)], in conjunction with balloon soundings from the mobile facility of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement ( ARM) program at Point Reyes and reanalysis products, are used to characterize the seasonal variations of MBL cloud-top and cloud-base heights, cloud thickness, the degree of decoupling between clouds and MBL, and inversion strength off the California coast. The main results from this study are as follows: (i) MBL clouds over the northeast subtropical Pacific in the summer are more prevalent and associated with a larger in-cloud water path than in winter. The cloud-top and cloud-base heights are lower in the summer than in the winter. (ii) Although the lower-tropospheric stability of the atmosphere is higher in the summer, the MBL inversion strength is only weakly stronger in the summer because of a negative feedback from the cloud-top altitude. Summertime MBL clouds are more homogeneous and are associated with lower surface latent heat flux than those in the winter. (iii) Seasonal variations of low-cloud properties from summer to winter resemble the downstream stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition of MBL clouds in terms of MBL depth, cloud-top and cloud-base heights, inversion strength, and spatial homogeneity. The "deepening-warming'' mechanism of Bretherton and Wyant for the stratocumulus-to-trade-cumulus transition downstream of the cold eastern ocean can also explain the seasonal variation of low clouds from the summer to the winter, except that warming of the sea surface temperature needs to be taken as relative to the free-tropospheric air temperature, which occurs in the winter. The observed variation of low clouds from summer to winter is attributed to the much larger seasonal cooling of the free-tropospheric air temperature than that of the sea surface temperature.																	0894-8755	1520-0442				MAY	2009	22	10					2624	2638		10.1175/2008JCLI2478.1								WOS:000266587200009

Spectral Angle Minimization for the Retrieval of Optically Active Seawater Constituents from MODIS Data	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												The application of global algorithms to optical satellite imagery often fails to correctly assess the concentrations of seawater constituents (chlorophyll, CHL, suspended sediments, SS, and yellow substance, YS) in spectrally complex marine environments. Additional problems may come from inaccurate radiometric, atmospheric, and geometric corrections of the remotely sensed imagery. This, issue is Currently analyzed using a data set of seawater samples and MODIS images taken in the Tuscany Sea (Central Italy). The analysis demonstrates that the mentioned problems mainly introduce amplitude variations in the measured reflectance. This may have negative effects oil the outcome of inversion algorithms based on the minimization of conventional spectral errors. Such effects can be notably reduced by using an error index derived from the angle between measured and simulated reflectance vectors, which is insensitive to spectral amplitude variations. The potential of a classical and the new error indices is first evaluated by regressing their values against concentration differences of optically active constituents found over the available sample pairs. The performance of the two error indices are then assessed within an inversion algorithms applied to the same samples. The results obtained show the potential of the new error index particularly to improve the estimation of CHL concentration,				Maselli, Fabio/K-6190-2013													0099-1112					MAY	2009	75	5					595	605		10.14358/PERS.75.5.595								WOS:000266134000010

Seasonal variations in lipid composition of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus from the Menez Gwen vent field	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Specimens of the hydrothermal mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus collected in Menez Gwen hydrothermal vent field (NE Atlantic) during 2002-2003 were examined for feeding patterns variations through three seasons. The fatty acid profile and lipid classes of the mussels were studied, together with the MODIS/AQUA-derived near-surface chlorophyll a to test the hypothesis that surface productivity might be related to the feeding patterns of this species. The lipid levels showed pronounced seasonal fluctuations with the highest values occurring in January and August. Seasonal variations in lipid classes and fatty acid composition of neutral and polar lipids in the mussels are presented. Differences in the fatty acid profile of lipid classes in different seasons suggest that the higher energy requirements in summer and winter were supplied by bacterial biomarkers omega 7 MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids), whereas omega 6 PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) and NMI (non-methylene-interrupted) fatty acids predominated during the spring. The MODIS/AQUA data show marked seasonal variability and an anomalous peak during January of 2003, although this cannot be directly linked to lipid composition variation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wilcox, EM; Harshvardhan; Platnick, S				Wilcox, Eric M.; Harshvardhan; Platnick, Steven			Estimate of the impact of absorbing aerosol over cloud on the MODIS retrievals of cloud optical thickness and effective radius using two independent retrievals of liquid water path	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Two independent satellite retrievals of cloud liquid water path (LWP) from the NASA Aqua satellite are used to diagnose the impact of absorbing biomass burning aerosol overlaying boundary-layer marine water clouds on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) retrievals of cloud optical thickness (tau) and cloud droplet effective radius (re). In the MODIS retrieval over oceans, cloud reflectance in the 0.86-mu m and 2.13-mu m bands is used to simultaneously retrieve t and re. A low bias in the MODIS t retrieval may result from reductions in the 0.86-mm reflectance, which is only very weakly absorbed by clouds, owing to absorption by aerosols in cases where biomass burning aerosols occur above water clouds. MODIS LWP, derived from the product of the retrieved t and re, is compared with LWP ocean retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), determined from cloud microwave emission that is transparent to aerosols. For the coastal Atlantic southern African region investigated in this study, a systematic difference between AMSR-E and MODIS LWP retrievals is found for stratocumulus clouds over three biomass burning months in 2005 and 2006 that is consistent with above-cloud absorbing aerosols. Biomass burning aerosol is detected using the ultraviolet aerosol index from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite. The LWP difference (AMSR-E minus MODIS) increases both with increasing t and increasing OMI aerosol index. During the biomass burning season the mean LWP difference is 14 g m(-2), which is within the 15-20 g m(-2) range of estimated uncertainties in instantaneous LWP retrievals. For samples with only low amounts of overlaying smoke (OMI AI <= 1) the difference is 9.4, suggesting that the impact of smoke aerosols on the mean MODIS LWP is 5.6 g m(-2). Only for scenes with OMI aerosol index greater than 2 does the average LWP difference and the estimated bias in MODIS cloud optical thickness attributable to the impact of overlaying biomass burning aerosol exceed the instantaneous uncertainty in the retrievals.

J	Kato, S; Marshak, A				Kato, Seiji; Marshak, Alexander			Solar zenith and viewing geometry-dependent errors in satellite retrieved cloud optical thickness: Marine stratocumulus case	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The error in the domain-averaged cloud optical thickness retrieved from satellite-based imagers is investigated using a cloud field generated by a cloud model and a 3D radiative transfer model. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal geometry for the optical thickness retrieval and quantify the error. The cloud field used in the simulation is a relatively uniform (retrieved shape parameter of a gamma distribution averaged over all simulated viewing and solar zenith angles is 18) and nearly isotropic stratocumulus field. The retrieved cloud cover with a 1-km pixel resolution is 100%. The domain-averaged optical thickness error is separated into two terms, the error caused by an assumption of a horizontally uniform cloud over a 1-km pixel (internal variability) and error caused by neglecting the horizontal flux through the boundary of subpixels ( external variability). For the cloud field used in this study, the external variability term increases with solar zenith angle and the sign changes from negative to positive while the internal variability term is generally negative and becomes more negative as the solar zenith angle increases. At a small solar zenith angle, therefore, both terms are negative, but the error partially cancels at a large solar zenith angle. When the solar zenith angle is less than 30 degrees, both terms are small; the error in the viewing zenith angle and domain-averaged cloud optical thickness derived from the relative azimuth angle smaller than 150 is less than 10%. However, if the optical thickness is derived from nadir view only for overhead sun, the domain-averaged optical thickness is underestimated by more than 10%. When the solar zenith angle increases to 60 degrees, the internal variability term exceeds 10%, especially viewed from the forward direction, but the domain and viewing zenith angle averaged optical thickness error can be less than 10% in the backward direction. When the solar zenith angle is less than 30 degrees, both terms are greater than 10%. The shape parameter of a gamma distribution derived from retrieved optical thicknesses increases with the viewing zenith angle but decreases with solar zenith angle. On the basis of this simulation and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) viewing geometry and solar zenith angle at the sampling time over the northeastern Pacific, the error in the domain-averaged retrieved optical thickness of uniform stratocumulus over northeastern Pacific is less than 10% in March and September.

Krishna			Validation of MODIS derived aerosol optical depth and an investigation on aerosol transport over the South East Arabian Sea during ARMEX-II	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The influence of wind and humidity on aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Arabian sea is being investigated using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Level 3 (Collection-5) and NCEP (National Centres for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data for the second phase of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX-II) over the South East Arabian Sea (SEAS) in the pre-monsoon period (14 March-10 April 2003). In order to qualify MODIS data for this study, MODIS aerosol parameters were first compared with ship borne Microtops measurements. This showed correlations 0.96-0.97 in the case of spectral AODs and a correlation 0.72 for the angstrom exponents. The daily AOD data from MODIS and winds from NCEP reveal that the ship observed episodic enhancement and decay of AOD at the TSL (Time Series Location) during 23 March-6 April 2003 was caused by the southward drift of an aerosol pocket driven by an intensification and reduction of surface pressure in the North Western Arabian Sea with a low altitude convergence prevailing over SEAS. The AOD increase coincided with a decrease in the Angstrom exponent and the fine mode fraction suggesting the pocket being dominated by coarse mode particles. A partial correlation analysis reveals that the lower altitude wind convergence is the most influential atmospheric variable in modulating AOD over the ARMEX-II domain during the TSL period. However, surface winds at a distant zone in the north/north west upwind direction also had a moderate influence, though with a lag of two days. But this effect was minor since the winds were not strong enough to produce marine aerosols matching with the high AODs over the ARMEX-II domain. These findings and the similarity between MODIS column mass concentration and the ship borne QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) measured coarse mode mass concentration, suggest that the aerosol pocket was mostly composed of coarse mode mineral dust in the lower atmospheric altitudes transported from the Arabian deserts.

A Decade of Satellite Ocean Color Observations	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE	Annual Review of Marine Science											After the successful Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1978-1986) demonstration that quantitative estimations of geophysical variables such is chlorophyll a mid diffuse attenuation coefficient could be derived from top of the atmosphere radiances, a number of international missions with ocean color capabilities were launched beginning in the late 1990s. Most notable were those with global data acquisition capabilities, i.e., the Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS, Japan, 1996-1997), the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS, United States, 1997-present), two Moderate Rcsolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS, United States, Terra/2000-present and Aqua/2002-present), the Global Imager (GLI, Japan, 2002-2003), and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS, European Space Agency, 2002-present). These missions have provided data of exceptional quality and continuity, allowing for scientific inquiries into a wide variety of marine research topics not possible with the CZCS. This review focuses on the scientific advances made over the past decade using these data sets.																	1941-1405	1941-0611					2009	1						19	42		10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163650								WOS:000267421700002	21141028

Exploring the differences in cloud properties observed by the Terra and Aqua MODIS Sensors	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The aerosol-cloud interaction in different parts of the globe is examined here using multi-year statistics of remotely sensed data from two MODIS sensors aboard NASA's Terra (morning) and Aqua (afternoon) satellites. Simultaneous retrievals of aerosol loadings and cloud properties by the MODIS sensor allowed us to explore morning-to-afternoon variation of liquid cloud fraction (CF) and optical thickness (COT) for clean, moderately polluted and heavily polluted clouds in different seasons. Data analysis for seven-years of MODIS retrievals revealed strong temporal and spatial patterns in morning-to-afternoon variation of cloud fraction and optical thickness over different parts of the global oceans and the land. For the vast areas of stratocumulus cloud regions, the data shows that the days with elevated aerosol abundance were also associated with enhanced afternoon reduction of CF and COT pointing to the possible reduction of the indirect climate forcing. A positive correlation between aerosol optical depth and morning-to-afternoon variation of trade wind cumulus cloud cover was also found over the northern Indian Ocean, though no clear relationship between the concentration of Indo-Asian haze and morning-to-afternoon variation of COT was established. Over the Amazon region during wet conditions, aerosols are associated with an enhanced convective process in which morning shallow warm clouds are organized into afternoon deep convection with greater ice cloud coverage. Analysis presented here demonstrates that the new technique for exploring morning-to-afternoon variability in cloud properties by using the differences in data products from the two daily MODIS overpasses is capable of capturing some of the major features of diurnal variations in cloud properties and can be used for better understanding of aerosol radiative effects.

The shortwave radiative forcing bias of liquid and ice clouds from MODIS observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We present an assessment of the plane-parallel bias of the shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCRF) of liquid and ice clouds at 1 deg scales using global MODIS (Terra and Aqua) cloud optical property retrievals for four months of the year 2005 representative of the meteorological seasons. The (negative) bias is estimated as the difference of SWCRF calculated using the Plane-Parallel Homogeneous (PPH) approximation and the Independent Column Approximation (ICA). PPH calculations use MODIS-derived gridpoint means while ICA calculations use distributions of cloud optical thickness and effective radius. Assisted by a broadband solar radiative transfer algorithm, we find that the absolute value of global SWCRF bias of liquid clouds at the top of the atmosphere is about 6 W m(-2) for MODIS overpass times while the SWCRF bias for ice clouds is smaller in absolute terms by about 0.7 W m(-2), but with stronger spatial variability. If effective radius variability is neglected and only optical thickness horizontal variations are accounted for, the absolute SWCRF biases increase by about 0.3-0.4 W m(-2) on average. Marine clouds of both phases exhibit greater (more negative) SWCRF biases than continental clouds. Finally, morning (Terra)-afternoon (Aqua) differences in SWCRF bias are much more pronounced for ice clouds, up to about 15% (Aqua producing stronger negative bias) on global scales, with virtually all contribution to the difference coming from land areas. The substantial magnitude of the global SWCRF bias, which for clouds of both phases is collectively about 4 W m(-2) for diurnal averages, should be considered a strong motivation for global climate modelers to accelerate efforts linking cloud schemes capable of subgrid condensate variability with appropriate radiative transfer schemes.

Effect of biomass burning on marine stratocumulus clouds off the California coast	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosol-cloud interactions are considered to be one of the most important and least known forcings in the climate system. Biomass burning aerosols are of special interest due to their radiative impact (direct and indirect effect) and their potential to increase in the future due to climate change. Combining data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with passive tracers from the FLEXPART Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model, the impact of biomass burning aerosols on marine stratocumulus clouds has been examined in June and July of 2006-2008 off the California coast. Using a continental tracer, the indirect effect of biomass burning aerosols has been isolated by comparing the average cloud fraction and cloud albedo for different meteorological situations, and for clean versus polluted (in terms of biomass burning) continental air masses at 14:00 local time. Within a 500 km-wide band along the coast of California, biomass burning aerosols, which tend to reside above the marine boundary layer, increased the cloud fraction by 0.143, and the cloud albedo by 0.038. Absorbing aerosols located above the marine boundary layer lead to an increase of the lower tropospheric stability and a reduction in the vertical entrainment of dry air from above, leading to increased cloud formation. The combined effect was an indirect radiative forcing of -7.5% +/- 1.7% (cooling effect) of the outgoing radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere on average, with a bias due to meteorology of +0.9%. Further away from the coast, the biomass burning aerosols, which were located within the boundary layer, reduced the cloud fraction by 0.023 and the cloud albedo by 0.006, resulting in an indirect radiative forcing of +1.3% +/- 0.3% (warming effect) with a bias of +0.5%. These results underscore the dual role that absorbing aerosols play in cloud radiative forcing.

Estimating the monthly pCO(2) distribution in the North Atlantic using a self-organizing neural network	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Here we present monthly, basin-wide maps of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) for the North Atlantic on a 1 degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude grid for years 2004 through 2006 inclusive. The maps have been computed using a neural network technique which reconstructs the non-linear relationships between three biogeochemical parameters and marine pCO(2). A self organizing map (SOM) neural network has been trained using 389 000 triplets of the SeaWiFS-MODIS chlorophyll-a concentration, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis sea surface temperature, and the FOAM mixed layer depth. The trained SOM was labelled with 137 000 under-way pCO(2) measurements collected in situ during 2004, 2005 and 2006 in the North Atlantic, spanning the range of 208 to 437 mu atm. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the neural network fit to the data is 11.6 mu atm, which equals to just above 3 percent of an average pCO(2) value in the in situ dataset. The seasonal pCO(2) cycle as well as estimates of the interannual variability in the major biogeochemical provinces are presented and discussed. High resolution combined with basin-wide coverage makes the maps a useful tool for several applications such as the monitoring of basin-wide air-sea CO2 fluxes or improvement of seasonal and interannual marine CO2 cycles in future model predictions. The method itself is a valuable alternative to traditional statistical modelling techniques used in geosciences.

In order to implement a countermeasure in case of oil spills, it is necessary to monitor oil spills using remote sensing techniques. Spectral measurements were undertaken for five oil types in 2007. Based on oil spectral characteristics, this study demonstrates how moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) can monitor oil spills in the Jeyeh storage tank-leaking event in Lebanon. With finer spectral resolutions and more spectral bands, MODIS provides the capability for the identification of oil spills.																	1527-5922						2009	10	4					317	323	PII 917901300	10.1080/15275920903347024								WOS:000272899700008

The gradient images of both types of sensors show the twin-front structure near Cape Henlopen, which is also captured in a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image. Six consecutive SST images are used to track plume variability due to tidal forcing and the features of the plume front are found to be different between ebb and flood tides.

Fishing ground prediction using a knowledge-based expert system geographical information system model in the South and Central Sulawesi coastal waters of Indonesia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A knowledge-based expert system model working on the basis of a geographical information system (GIS) was applied to predict fishing ground spots in the coastal waters of South and Central Sulawesi. The model is designed by the integration of multisource data to answer 'what?', 'where?', and 'why?' questions of the fishing ground location. Despite the fact that GIS is a powerful tool for dealing with the first two questions, GIS is inferior for answering the 'why?' question in geo-studies. One of the possible ways of overcoming the inferiority of GIS for answering the 'why?' question of geo-studies is by integrating an expert system in a GIS to form a knowledge-based expert system GIS model. In this study, we used a series of sea surface temperature (SST) satellite data, sea surface chlorophyll-a (SSC) and turbidity derived from MODIS Aqua in the period 2003-2005 as input data, to understand the temporal and seasonal variability of the marine environment of the study area, and identified the oceanographic phenomena, i.e. upwelling, front or eddy. A spatial configuration map of the predicted fishing ground spots was then developed and integrated using a knowledge-based expert system GIS model generated by the Erdas Macro Language (EML) of Erdas Imagine 9.0 software. To verify this result, a series of in situ fishing ground spot data of the study area were collected for similar periods, and they were then analysed using a simple statistical method. The result shows that the predicted fishing ground spots generated by the knowledge-based expert system GIS model corresponded well with in situ data with a high accuracy level of 85%. This result has demonstrated that the knowledge-based expert system GIS model can be applied to predict, localize and determine fishing ground spots in which their accuracy level will be determined by the completeness of spatial knowledge of the domain expertise and the sophistication level of the programming utilities being used.																	0143-1161						2009	30	24					6429	6440		10.1080/01431160902865780								WOS:000273641500004

Hydrodynamically Induced or Modified Patterns Derived from Satellite Images in the Coastal Waters of Estonia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Due to a complex coastline, water column properties show large temporal and spatial variability in the coastal waters of Estonia. Therefore, as an addition to relatively coarse traditional monitoring, analysis of satellite images has became an increasingly popular method. The present study focuses on the identification of some hydrodynamically induced or modified patterns, recognizable from satellite images, such as river and dredging plumes, frontal zones between water masses of different origin, upwellings and coastal jets. The main aim was to match the patterns either with in situ measurement data or hydrodynamic hindcast modelling results. We used satellite imagery (MODIS, ALI), measurements of currents, waves and water column properties obtained in 2005-2008, as well as 2D hydrodynamic modelling of the coastal waters. The results show that dredging plumes in the shallow coastal waters are often overshadowed by storm induced resuspension; upwellings along straight sections of the coast are quite frequent and well visible from sea surface temperature images, while products for chlorophyll do not reveal straightforward results; river plumes and hydrochemical fronts between marine sub-basins can be monitored both by turbidity and coloured dissolved organic matter products.

Global Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud detection and height evaluation using CALIOP	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A global 2-month comparison is presented between the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization ( CALIOP) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) for both cloud detection and cloud top height ( CTH) retrievals. Both CALIOP and MODIS are part of the NASA A-Train constellation of satellites and provide continuous near-coincident measurements that result in over 28 million cloud detection comparisons and over 5 million CTH comparisons for the months of August 2006 and February 2007. To facilitate the comparison, a computationally efficient and accurate collocation methodology is developed. With the collocated MODIS and CALIOP retrievals, nearly instantaneous comparisons are compiled regionally and globally. Globally, it is found that the MODIS 1-km cloud mask and the CALIOP 1-km averaged layer product agreement is 87% for cloudy conditions for both August 2006 and February 2007. For clear-sky conditions the agreement is 85% ( 86%) for August ( February). The best agreement is found for nonpolar daytime and the poorest agreement in the polar regions. Differences in cloud top heights depend strongly on cloud type. Globally, MODIS underestimates the CTH relative to CALIOP by 1.4 +/- 2.9 km for both August 2006 and February 2007. This value of 1.4 km is obtained using the CALIOP 1 km layer products. When compared to the CALIOP 5-km products, the differences increase to -2.6 +/- 3.9 km as a result of CALIOP's increased sensitivity to optically thin cirrus. When only high clouds above 5 km are considered, the differences are found to be greater than 4 km with individual comparisons having differences larger than 10 km. These large differences (> 10 km) represent approximately 16% of the nonpolar high cloud retrievals (> 5 km). For high clouds it is found that MODIS retrieves a cloud top height for 90% of the clouds detected by the CALIOP 5-km layer products. The large MODIS underestimates for optically thin cirrus occur for cases when MODIS reverts to a window brightness temperature retrieval instead of CO2 slicing. A systematic bias is found for marine low-level stratus clouds, with MODIS overestimating the CTH by over 1 km in dense marine stratocumulus regions. The cause of the bias was identified in the MODIS Collection 5 algorithm; an application of a modified algorithm reduced this bias.

Jeremy; Gentili, Bernard; Claustre, Herve			The origin and global distribution of second order variability in satellite ocean color and its potential applications to algorithm development	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Empirical algorithms based on first order relationships between ocean color and the chlorophyll concentration ([ChI]; mg m(-3)) are widely used, but cannot explain the statistical dispersion or "anomalies" around the mean trends. We use an empirical approach that removes the first order effects of [ChI] from satellite ocean color, thus allowing us to quantify the impact on the ocean color signal of optical anomalies that vary independently of the global mean trends with remotely sensed [ChI]. We then present statistical and modeling analyses to interpret the observed anomalies in terms of their optical sources (i.e. absorption and backscattering coefficients). We identify two main sources of second order variability for a given [ChI]: 1) the amount of non-algal absorption, especially due to colored dissolved organic matter; and 2) the amplitude of the backscattering coefficient of particles. The global distribution of the anomalies displays significant regional and seasonal trends, providing important information for characterizing the marine optical environment and for inferring biogeochemical influences. We subsequently use our empirically determined anomalies to estimate the backscattering coefficient of particles and the combined absorption coefficient for colored detrital and dissolved materials. This purely empirical approach provides an independent assessment of second order optical variability for comparison with existing methods that are generally based on semi-analytical models.

A geographical information system was used to extract satellite-based observations of sea ice concentration from the Nimbus-7 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR, 1979-1987) and the Defence Meteorological Satellite Programs Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI, 1987-2004), and satellite-based observations of chlorophyll a from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS: EOS-Terra satellite) in weekly intervals in circular buffers around each colony site (150 km in radius). Rapid recession of high Arctic seasonal ice cover created a temporally predictable primary production bloom and associated trophic cascade in water gradually exposed to solar radiation. This pattern was largely absent from lower latitudes where little to no sea ice resulted in a temporally variable primary production bloom driven by nutrient cycling and upwelling uncoupled to ice. The relationship between the rate and variability of sea ice recession and colony size of thick-billed murres shows that periodical confinement of the trophic cascade at high latitudes determines the carrying capacity for Arctic seabirds during the breeding period.

A statistical correction scheme based on a multilinear regression algorithm is used here to remove systematic differences between in situ and remote-sensing measurements. The application of the correction scheme to Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOINS) primary radiometric products improves the convergence between remote-sensing and in situ measurements, with the largest effects at 412 and 443 nm. Specifically, the scatter and bias of MODIS derived with respect to in situ L(wn) at 412 nm have shown values of 12% and 3% for corrected with respect to values of 34% and -28% for uncorrected data, respectively. Similarly, the scatter and bias for SeaWiFS-derived L(wn) at 412 nm have shown values of 14% and 4% for corrected with respect to 32% and -20% for uncorrected data. Results at 667 nm for MODIS and at 670 nm for SeaWiFS, although displaying a reduction in the scatter of data, have shown a significant residual bias of about 11% and 17% with respect to in situ values. Finally, it was shown the need for restricting the application of the correction scheme to data with atmospheric and marine optical features represented within the reference data set used to define the correction coefficients.

Dust storms originating over the world's arid regions contribute a large fraction of aerosols in the atmosphere. Using remote sensing data, an anomalous enhancement in the biological productivity of sea was observed in the Gulf of Oman which was attributed only to cold sea surface temperature ( SST) eddies ( during November to early December months of 1996-1999), whereas recent study has shown that during dust storms (June-July-August and October-November-December months of 1997-2004), major nutrient supply is from atmospheric dust deposition. We have carried out a study of individual cases of major dust storms over the Arabian Sea during the entire year ( December 2003-December 2006) to quantify role of dust storms and changes in ocean surface due to chlorophyll bloom. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) Aqua, we have found that the deposition of dust along the passage of major dust storms ( aerosol optical depth (AOD) similar to 0.25-0.41) occuring over the Arabian Sea causes chlorophyll blooming ( usually 10-22.43 mg/m(3)) within a period of 1-2 to up to 3-4 days. However, we have also found significant anomalous cooling of the ocean surface ( SST) and relatively higher ocean wind speeds (QuikSCAT) during dust storms that may lead to favorable conditions for blooming. Exact nature and cause of chlorophyll bloom in the semienclosed northern Arabian Sea, surrounded by one of the world's major sources of dust storms ( Africa, Middle East, Iran, and Afghanistan), are very important in understanding the productivity and the biogeochemical cycles of the marine ecosystem. The results have been validated using the Indian Remote Sensing Polar-4 Ocean Color Monitor (IRS P4 OCM) data.

J	Zhao, Q; Lu, X				Zhao, Qiang; Lu, Xianqing			Parameter estimation in a three-dimensional marine ecosystem model using the adjoint technique	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												An adjoint data assimilation method is applied to estimate the poorly known ecological parameters in a coupled physical-biological model of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea (BYS). The biological model includes five state variables: dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic phosphate, phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus. For the selection of control variables, a new sensitivity analysis method is introduced. This method is based upon the gradient equations of cost function with respect to model parameters. By analyzing the linear combination of Lagrange multiplies in these equations, an unrelated parameter set is selected. In twin experiments, the feasibility of estimated control variables is tested. The results indicate phytoplankton data are the strongest constraints during the parameter estimation process. Climatology daily mean chlorophyll concentrations derived from Modis-Aqua and SeaWiFS are also assimilated into the model to simulate the seasonal cycle of the distributions of phytoplankton. The results indicate a two-bloom characteristic in the BYS, a major bloom at spring and a minor bloom at fall. The simulated horizontal distributions of surface phytoplankton are consistent with the biological roles of seasonal stratification. The concentrations of the nutrients at the surface are lowest in spring, after the phytoplankton bloom. The highest concentrations occur in winter. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The boundary-layer lapse rate in the northeast region of the Pacific Ocean is investigated using sea surface temperature (SST) data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), cloud-top temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and cloud-top height data from CALIPSO. Based on the lapse rate derived from the combined CALIPSO/MODIS/AMSR-E measurements, cloud-top heights in regions within CALIPSO tracks are derived from AMSR SST and MODIS cloud temperature to test the validity of this approach. For homogeneous low-level clouds, the results agree with the cloud-top height from the collocated CALIPSO cloud-top height measurements. These results suggest that the database of derived lapse rates from the combined measurements can he applied to study cloud-top height climate statistics using the MODIS and AMSR data when CALIPSO observations are not available.

Investigation of regional and seasonal variations in marine boundary layer cloud properties from MODIS observations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												To aid in understanding the role that marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds play in climate and assist in improving their representations in general circulation models (GCMs), their long-term microphysical and macroscale characteristics are quantified using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroracdiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Terra satellite. Six years of MODIS pixel-level Cloud products are used from oceanic study regions off the west coasts of California, Peru, the Canary Islands, Angola, and Australia where these cloud types are common. Characterizations are given for their organization (macroscale structure), the associated microphysical properties, and the seasonal dependencies of their variations for scales consistent with the size of a GCM grid box (300 km X 300 km). MBL mesoscale structure is quantified using effective cloud diameter C-D, which is introduced here as a simplified measure of bulk cloud organization; it is straightforward to compute and provides descriptive information beyond that offered by cloud fraction. The interrelationships of these characteristics are explored while considering the influences of the MBL state, such as the occurrence of drizzle. Several commonalities emerge for the five study regions. MBL clouds contain the best natural examples of plane-parallel clouds, but overcast clouds occur in only about 25% of the scenes, which emphasizes the importance of representing broken MBL cloud fields in climate models (that are subgrid scale). During the peak months of cloud occurrence, mesoscale organization (larger C-D) increases such that the fractions of scenes characterized as "overcast" and "clumped" increase at the expense of the "scattered" scenes. Cloud liquid water path and visible optical depth usually trend strongly with C-D, with the largest values occurring for scenes that are drizzling. However, considerable interregional differences exist in these trends, suggesting that different regression functionalities exist for each region. For peak versus off-peak months, the fraction of drizzling scenes (as a function of C-D) are similar for California and Angola, which suggests that a single probability distribution function might be used for their drizzle occurrence in climate models. The patterns are strikingly opposite for Peru and Australia; thus, the contrasts among regions may offer a test bed for model simulations of MBL drizzle occurrence.

Comparison of marine stratocumulus cloud top heights in the Southeastern Pacific retrieved from satellites with coincident ship-based observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In order to better understand the general problem of satellite cloud top height retrievals for low clouds, observations made by NOAA research vessels in the stratocumulus region in the southeastern Pacific during cruises in 2001 and 2003 to 2006 were matched with near-coincident retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instruments on the Terra satellite, along with a limited set of ISCCP 30-km (DX) retrievals. The ISCCP cloud top heights, determined from the cloud top pressures, were found to be biased high by between 1400 and 2000 m within the limited comparison data set. Like the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) results, the MODIS retrievals were biased high by more than 2000 m, while the MISR retrievals had errors on the order of 230 to 420 m, with the wind corrected heights having almost no bias. The extremely large bias in the ISCCP and MODIS retrievals was traced to their reliance on low-resolution observations or models of the atmospheric temperature structure. Cloud top height retrievals based on satellite cloud top temperatures and a constant atmospheric lapse rate agreed substantially better with the ship-based measurements.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2008	113	D18							D18204	10.1029/2008JD009975								WOS:000259607100004						
J	Radiarta, IN; Saitoh, SI				Radiarta, I. Nyoman; Saitoh, Sei-Ichi			Satellite-derived measurements of spatial and temporal chlorophyll-a variability in Funka Bay, Southwestern Hokkaido, Japan	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration has an important economic effect in coastal and marine environments on fisheries resources and marine aquaculture development. Monthly climatologies the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) derived chl-a from February 1998 to August 2004 around Funka Bay were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a concentrations. SeaWiFS-derived suspended sediment, MODIS derived sea surface temperature (SST), solar radiation and wind data were also analyzed. Results showed two distinct chlorophyll blooms in spring and autumn. Chl-a concentrations were relatively low (<0.3 mg m(-3)) in the bay during summer, with high concentrations occurring along the coast, particularly near Yakumo and Shiraoi. In spring, chl-a concentrations increased, and a large (>2 mg m(-3)) phytoplankton bloom occurred. The spatial and temporal patterns were further confirmed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. About 83.94% of the variability could be explained by the first three modes. The first chl-a mode (77.93% of the total variance) explained the general seasonal cycle and quantified interannual variability in the bay. The spring condition was explained by the second mode (3.89% of the total variance), while the third mode (2.12% of the total variance) was associated with autumn condition. Local forcing such as the timing of intrusion of Oyashio water, wind condition and surface heating are the mechanisms that controlled the spatial and temporal variations of chlorophyll concentrations. Moreover, the variation of chlorophyll concentration along the coast seemed to be influenced by suspended sediment caused by resuspension or river discharge. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Asymmetry parameters in the lower troposphere derived from aircraft measurements of aerosol scattering coefficients over tropical India	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol scattering coefficients (total beta(sca) and backscatter beta(backsca)) are measured on board an aircraft using an integrating nephelometer at 450, 550, and 700 nm in the 0 to 3000-m region over four locations in India in an air campaign held during March-May 2006. beta(sca) is a factor of two higher in the east (Bhubaneshwar, Chennai) than in the west (Trivandrum, Goa). beta(sca) is about 5-10 x 10(-5) m(-1) over Bhubaneshwar and Chennai. beta(backsca) is about an order of magnitude lower than beta(sca). Seven-day air back trajectory analysis indicate that air masses originating from arid/semiraid regions, continents, and marine regions are found to influence the aerosol characteristics, in addition to local urban sources. No elevated aerosol layers are seen during the campaign. b, the aerosol backscatter fraction, is greater than 0.13 in the lower troposphere. The columnar mean Angstrom exponent (alpha) is > 1.75. Asymmetry parameter g profiles are derived for the first time over India in the lower troposphere, using the relation between b and g. 550-nmg corresponding to 30% RH is in the 0.3-0.6 range over India. Higher b, higher alpha, and lower g values over these locations suggest the dominance of submicron aerosols during the campaign. Scattering aerosols corrected to 30% RH in the 0 to 3000-m altitude region contribute about 20-35% to MODIS aerosol optical depths (AODs). The variation in the contribution of scattering aerosols to AODs highlights the spatial and vertical differences in aerosol properties.																	2169-897X					AUG 28	2008	113	D16							D16212	10.1029/2008JD009795								WOS:000258821800006

Using satellite data and shipborne data from the East Pacific Investigation of Climate ( EPIC) Stratocumulus Study, this study investigates the cloud re vertical variation for drizzling and nondrizzling clouds. Visible/ near- infrared retrievals from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) are used to estimate the vertical profile of re. MODIS re observations and collocated shipborne scanning C- band precipitation radar data show that re generally increases with height in nondrizzling clouds, consistent with aircraft observations. It is found that in clouds with precipitation rates greater than a few hundredths of a mm h 1 the vertical gradient of re is significantly less than that in nondrizzling clouds and can become negative when the drizzle is heavier than approximately 0.1 mm h 1. High values of re at drizzling cloud base are consistent with estimates of the ratio of liquid water in the drizzle drops to that in the cloud droplets. C- band derived cloud base precipitation rates are found to be better correlated with re at cloud base than with re at cloud top, suggesting that passive remote sensing may be useful for drizzle detection.
