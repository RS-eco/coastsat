J	Turner, IL; Aarninkhof, SGJ; Holman, RA				Turner, IL; Aarninkhof, SGJ; Holman, RA			Coastal imaging applications and research in Australia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Remote sensing methods are increasingly being deployed to measure and investigate morphology and hydrodynamics in the littoral zone, across spatial scales ranging from centimetres to kilometres, and at time-scales ranging from seconds to years. In the past 5 years in Australia, the deployment of video-based coastal imaging systems has grown rapidly, and by 2004, some 32 cameras were operating at eight sites along the coasts of New South Wales and Queensland. Coastal imaging techniques are being applied to a range of coastline monitoring programs. Projects include large- and small-scale sand nourishment works, the construction of a nearshore artificial reef structure, and the ongoing management of sand bypassing operations. At the same time, the growing image databases are underpinning more fundamental coastal research. The focus of recent and current research includes rip current behaviour, climate impacts, nearshore bar dynamics, and the development of new image analysis methods to support future research.

J	Wang, J; Qi, YQ; Jones, ISF				Wang, J; Qi, YQ; Jones, ISF			An analysis of the characteristics of chlorophyll in the Sulu Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The seasonal and spatial variations of chlorophyll concentrations, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), wind fields and wind-induced Ekman pumping in the Sulu Sea are investigated using a set of new remote sensing measurements from October 1997 to December 2004. The results show the seasonality of chlorophyll, wind fields and SST and reveal the phytoplankton blooming events in the Sulu Sea basin during the northeast monsoon season. In summer, chlorophyll concentrations were relatively low (< 0.2 mg/m(3)) and distributed uniformly throughout the basin with a narrow belt of high chlorophyll concentrations along the coastal waters, particularly the coasts of Borneo and of the Sulu Archipelago. In winter, chlorophyll concentrations increased (> 0.2 mg/m(3)) throughout the entire basin, and phytoplankton bloomed southward to the central basin, while chlorophyll concentrations reached high levels (1 mg/m(3)) in the center of the blooms. One peak was observed during the northeast monsoon season each year. SSTs have significant negative correlations with chlorophyll concentrations; i.e., high and uniformly distributed in summer but lower with an obvious tongue of cold waters southward to the central basin in winter. The seasonal variation of chlorophyll concentrations and SST distribution were associated with the seasonally reversing monsoon. The winter phytoplankton blooming and the tongue of the cold waters were correlated to the vertical upwelling cold and nutrient-rich waters drawn by the northeast wind, with the center of the blooms and the location of cold tongues coinciding with the maximum of the wind speeds and the Ekman pumping velocities.

J	Gonzalez, M; Uriarte, A; Pozo, R; Collins, M				Gonzalez, Manuel; Uriarte, Adolfo; Pozo, Rogelio; Collins, Michael			The Prestige crisis: Operational oceanography applied to oil recovery, by the Basque fishing fleet	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												On 19th November 2002, the oil tanker Prestige (containing 77,000 tonnes of heavy fuel no. 2 (M 100)) sank in 3500 in of water, off the coast of northwestern Spain. Intermittent discharge of oil from the stricken tanker, combined with large-scale sea surface dispersion, created a tracking and recovery problem. Initially, conventional oil recovery approaches were adopted, close to the wreck. With time and distance from the source, the oil dispersed dramatically and became less viscous. Consequently, a unique monitoring, prediction and data dissemination system was established, based upon the principles of 'operational oceanography'; this utilised in situ tracked buoys and numerical (spill trajectory) modelling outputs, in combination with remote sensing (satellite sensors and visual observation). Overall, wind effects on the surface waters were found to be the most important mechanism controlling the smaller oil slick movements. The recovery operation involved up to 180 fishing boats, 9-30 m in length. Such labour-intensive recovery of the oil (21,000 tonnes, representing an unprecedented ratio of 6.6 tonnes at sea, per tonne recovered on land) continued over a 10 month period. The overall recovery at sea, by the fishing vessels, represented 63% of the total oil recovered at sea; this compares to only 37% recovered by specialised 'counter-pollution' vessels.

The optical and microwave sensors onboard satellites are now capable of monitoring land, ocean, atmosphere and ionosphere which provide changes associated with natural hazards. In this paper, we have analyzed remote sensing data of the ocean coasts lying near the epicenters of recent four major earthquakes (Gujarat of January 26, 2001, Andaman of September 13, 2002, Algeria of May 21, 2002 and Barn, Iran earthquake of December 26, 2003), our detailed analysis shows increase of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration associated with these recent earthquakes. The increase of Chl-a concentration is due to the change in sea surface temperature (SST) associated with the changes in stress regime in the epicentral region which is responsible for modifying the in situ thermal structure of the water and enhancing the upwelling of nutrient-rich water. The increase of Chl-a concentration also shows one to one relation with the increase of surface latent heat flux (SLHF) which is found to increase significantly prior to the earthquake events. Due to cloud cover, it has not been possible to quantify the effect of the chlorophyll concentrations associated with the earthquake events for each successive day during an event. However, the limited data from the adjacent oceanic regions provide strong evidence of the increase in Chl-a concentration. The monitoring of chlorophyll concentrations with higher spatial and temporal resolutions may provide early information about impending coastal earthquakes. (c) 2005 COSPAR.

Yamase clouds frequently appear over the western North-Pacific region, off the east coast of the Sanriku district, Japan. They occur during the summer season under cool easterly winds blown from Okhotsk anticyclones. Here we discuss optical and microphysical properties estimated from shipboard experiments and satellite remote sensing for Yamase clouds observed in June 2003. This was the first time we were able to observe time-varying features of the marine boundary-layer accompanied with Yamase clouds from formation to decay. At the ship site, the cloud-base height and liquid-water-path, time-averaged during the June Yamase event, were 270 m and 60 gm(-2), respectively. At the same time it is revealed, from satellite remote sensing using the contemporary AVHRR/3 data on morning orbital NOAA-17, that the Yamase clouds were rather thin, stratiform low-level clouds, and their physical parameters gradually grew with time during the Yamase period. The optical thickness, effective particle radius, and liquid-water-path, averaged over the time and area, were estimated to be about 12, 12 mu m, and 110 gm(-2), respectively.																	1349-6476						2006	2						45	48		10.2151/sola.2006-012								WOS:000208289800012						
J	Ayad, YA				Ayad, YA			Remote sensing and GIS in modeling visual landscape change: a case study of the northwestern and coast of Egypt	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Land use planners in many countries have recognized the importance of the aesthetic values of landscape. Their desire to incorporate these values into decision-making processes has created a need to identify valid ways to quantify the scenic characteristics of landscapes. This has led to an increasing interest in the use of spatial data and geographic information systems (GIS) methodology in assessing visual attributes of the landscape. The objective of the present study is to assess the visual changes in a rapidly developing coastal area of Egypt using remotely sensed data (satellite images and aerial photographs) and raster GIS modeling. The analysis assesses changes between a period characterized by a vernacular, relatively natural landscape (1950s) and the beginning of the exploitation of the region for resorts (1990s). Using land use/land cover classes extracted from the satellite images and aerial photographs, four visual attributes of landscape are identified: land use/land cover diversity, activity (degree of naturalness), proximity to the shoreline, and topographic variety. A composite index is also developed. Although these attributes and the composite index rely mostly on the type of land use/land cover information on the landscape under consideration, the adopted techniques succeed in detecting several changes in the attributes, spatially locating them and mapping the magnitude of their changes. This study demonstrates what can be done to analyze and assess what is usually considered an incommensurable resource, the visual attributes of landscapes. It also reveals the extent of the impact of unplanned or ill-planned activities on one of the fragile resources of and landscapes. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It has been proven that thermal or colour gradients revealed by oceanic fronts indicate sites of high biological productivity. Some constraints ill using SST (sea surface temperature) gradients for locating fish in the Indian waters were experienced such as the narrow range of SST and difficulty in detecting gradients, particularly in summer. Two approaches were developed and validated in the coastal waters of the west coast of India. In the first approach, SST contours (using NOAA AVHIRR) were overlaid oil chlorophyll image (from IRS P4 OCM) of corresponding date. This enabled identification of common frontal structures from the composite product. These sites were selected as priority fishing zones for the trial forecasts. Besides, ocean colour images were found to provide information oil additional productive areas not found front SST images alone and hence, a second approach made exclusive use of patterns of ocean colour. Merits of ocean colour arose from penetration of visible radiation below surface up to one attenuation depth and From the frequent repeat cycle of the satellite data. The improvements with use of ocean colour include capability of prediction of oceanic features, exploitation of knowledge of the history of the features, identification of biological fronts in the deep sea waters etc. Also, such features as non-toxic winter blooms and internal waves were identified in the deep waters of the Northern Arabian Sea using chlorophyll images and the response of fish to these features was studied. This paper highlights how ocean colour improves our ability to locate areas of high abundance of fish. Because the time taken in 9 information extraction from satellite data is a critical factor, on-line reception of OCM and AVHRR data was arranged. Fishery forecasts were generated using the integrated approach within 24 hours of satellite over pass, and disseminated to collaborating agencies for follow up fishing operation. The validation experiment for the forecasts was carried out for three years covering different seasons during 1999-2001. It was found that the forecasts were superior in terms of rate of success and magnitude of fish catch. Summary of feedback received indicated 70-90 % success rate (reliability) of the forecasts and 70-200 % increase in catch. In comparison with this, earlier SST-based approaches for the forecast yielded 50 % success rate and 40-50 % increase in catch. The integrated approach is currently being used to generate nation-wide fishery forecasts. In addition to this, cost-benefit analysis for the satellite fishery forecasts was also attempted. It was observed that the benefit:cost ratio increased front 1.27 to 2.12 for bottom trawling and 1.3 to 2.14 for gillnet fishing with the use of satellite forecasts.																	0379-5136					DEC	2005	34	4					430	440										WOS:000234721000011

Krishna			Locating oceanic tuna resources in the eastern arabian sea using remote sensing	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Tuna fishery resources are currently under exploited. The resource potential of tunas in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) beyond 50 m depths is around 2.09 lakh tonnes as estimated by Fishery Survey of India. The distribution and availability of the tuna are governed by environmental factors like temperature, thermocline depth, availability of prey, visibility etc. Remote sensing provides synoptic information on productivity in terms of chlorophyll and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). In the present paper, satellite remote sensing data from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-P4 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) sensor for chlorophylla and diffuse attenuation coefficient (K) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor data for sea surface temperature were analysed and correlated with in situ catch data of oceanic tunas, Skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), off Maharashtra coast. Higher catches were found to be associated with moderate to good primary productivity and in the vicinity of thermal fronts. Relationship between Hooking rate and SST has shown that SST of 28-30 degrees C range is optimum for skipjack and 28-3 degrees C for yellowfin tuna. Besides satellite derived chlorophyll and SST for identification of potential tuna fishing zones, role of diffuse attenuation coefficient (K) for visibility factor is also discussed.																	0255-660X					DEC	2005	33	4					511	520										WOS:000244672200006						
J	Solanki, HU; Mankodi, PC; Nayak, SR; Somvanshi, VS				Solanki, HU; Mankodi, PC; Nayak, SR; Somvanshi, VS			Evaluation of remote-sensing-based potential fishing zones (PFZs) forecast methodology	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Satellite-based potential fishing zones (PFZs) forecasts were generated using integration of Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) derived chlorophyll concentration and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived sea surface temperatures (SST). Validation of the PFZ forecasts was carried out during seasons 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 using Fishery Survey of India vessels. Bottom trawl catches were composed of mixed species from different habitats, i.e. demersal and pelagic. Hence, there is a need to understand the application of satellite-derived PFZs to different species types of fishery resources. The per cent contribution by species was determined from 30m to 100m depth range. Those species contributing 5kg/haul and above were considered as a significant species. Species-wise catch per unit effort (CPUE), seasonal mean CPUE and standard deviation (SD) were computed for remotely sensed PFZs and the entire region. Species-wise comparisons were made between mean CPUE in PFZs and seasonal mean CPUE in other areas from a different habitat. It was observed that fishery resource of pelagic and water column habitats contributed fairly well as compared to the demersal resources in PFZs. The per cent contribution of pelagic and water column species were found more in PFZs catch as compared to the seasonal mean catch in other areas. In this study, diet composition and feeding habitat of fishes and its relationship to satellite-derived parameters have been evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physical forcing analysis	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The morphology and migration of rhythmic intertidal ridge and runnel systems, and subtidal crescentic bars that border the southwest coast of France were characterized using in situ surveys and maps obtained by remote-sensing methods. The period from 1986 to 2000 was investigated. A total of 35 km of coast was mapped. This data set shows several specificities, the origin of which are examined in the present report using hydrodynamic data. A complete analysis of the influence of wave climate on both the shape and the movements of these rhythmic sedimentary patterns was performed. In addition, SWAN and MORPHODYN-coupled numerical models were used to provide quantification of both wave breaking and longshore currents for wave parameters that were representative of the mean values and of the energetic conditions. This study demonstrated the short time response of intertidal systems to the wave forcing. When the offshore significant wave height (H-s) was lower than 2.5 m, regular coastal ridge and runnel systems developed in the intertidal zone and migrated in the longshore-drift direction at a rate of 1.7-3.1 m day(-1). By contrast, the ridge and runnel system morphology abruptly changed when the H-s exceeded 2.5 m, and after the storm, the typical ridge and runnel rhythmic topography was recovered within 5-9 days. The crescentic bars, which had a convex seaward shape, were affected by waves with H-s values greater than 3 m (slightly less for short waves). Depending on the wave orientation, the crescentic bars moved in the longshore-drift direction at a rate that reached 1 m day(-1). The data suggested a slight negative correlation between the mean alongshore length of the crescentic bar and the mean H-s. Finally, it seemed that increasing the wave obliquity with respect to the coast resulted in the flattening of the crescentic bars. Thus, coupling Spot and in situ mapping to hydrodynamic records allow the characterization of coastal morphology and dynamics, with time and space samplings that are particularly well adapted to the little studied alongshore morphodynamics. This approach should improve the difficult parameterization of morphodynamic models in high-energy environments. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Detection of Karenia brevis blooms uses an ecological approach based on anomalies derived from ocean color imagery. The same anomaly product used in Florida produces frequent false positives on the Texas coast. These failures occurred during wind-driven resuspension events. During these events resuspension of benthic algae significantly increases chlorophyll concentrations in the water, resulting in confusion with normal water column phytoplankton, such as Karenia. A method was developed to separate the resuspended chlorophyll from the water column chlorophyll, decreasing the false positives used with the detection method. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In an SST lattice data array, data value sinks describe heterogeneous drops in SST distribution as this is compared to more homogeneously distributed SST in the surrounding area. Using Arc/Info GIS, these thermal discontinuities are flagged and applied on SST and CHL imagery for the calculation of differences in SST and CHL patterns ( DSST and DCHL) inside and outside of these flagged areas. Spatially connected sinks that are characterized by simultaneous negative DSST and positive DCHL pattern are mapped as thermal fronts. Results include a time series of monthly front occurrence GIS maps in Eastern Mediterranean waters along with three calculated front characteristics ( DSST, DCHL and bathymetry). Comparisons between the mapped fronts and isobath distributions present clearly visible front-to-isobath spatial and shape associations while spatial analysis between front and wind data explains 66% of the number of mapped fronts.

J	Finkl, CW; Benedet, L; Andrews, JL				Finkl, CW; Benedet, L; Andrews, JL			Submarine geomorphology of the continental shelf off southeast Florida based on interpretation of airborne laser bathymetry	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Airborne laser bathymetry (ALB) is a new laser bathymetric survey tool that has applicability in clear coastal (Case II) waters to depths of -70 m. The new sounding technique features rapid acquisition of large, high-quality data sets via variable swath widths that are independent of water depth. This advanced ALB system was deployed along the continental shelf of southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties), providing a contiguous data set for 160 km of coast from onshore to 6 km offshore. Image enhancement of the ALB digital data facilitates recognition of numerous seafloor features and bathymetric patterns. Bathymetric analysis of the 600-km(2) survey area on the continental shelf shows inherited lithologic features that are partly covered by surficial sediments. Primary parabathic (shore-parallel) provinces include: (1) nearshore rocky zones dominated by the Anastasia Formation, (2) coral-algal reef systems (Florida Reef Tract [FRT]), and (3) marine platforms (terraces). Sedimentary subprovinces include shoreface sands, interreefal sedimentary infills (coral rubble in basal sequences and near reef gaps), and finer-grained materials seaward of coral reefs. Tertiary topographic features include: (1) longshore bar and trough systems, shoals, sand sheets (flats), and diabathic (cross-shore) channels; (2) reef crests and ledges, forereef spur-and-groove topography, sediment ramps in large reef gaps, and incised paleo-river channels; and (3) drowned karst topography. Hierarchical organization (classification and mapping) of these bathymetric features is now possible for the first time because of the increased accuracy and density of ALB data. These data and related maps allow, for the first time, assessment of links between the influence of seabed morphology on wave transformation patterns and beach morphodynamics in southeast Florida.																	0749-0208					NOV	2005	21	6					1178	1194		10.2112/05A-0021.1								WOS:000233495200012

River discharge changes affect frontal locations, areal extent, and suspended sediment loads of the plume. During high river discharge ( > 20,000 m(3) s(-1)) in spring, the sediment plume extends 23 km southwestward, covers 2700 km(2), with maximum concentrations of 360 mg L-1. Plume temperatures vary seasonally from 10 degrees to 28 degrees C, with maximum surface fronts of 3.3 degrees C km(-1) in winter. East winds, prevalent in autumn, winter, and spring, drive a westward flow of river waters around the delta, linking two isolated shelf regions and increasing river discharge onto the Louisiana/Texas shelf. During peak river flow, this westward current exhibits velocities of 40-90 cm s(-1), is 20 km wide, and transports 140,000-165,000 m(3) s(-1) of river and shelf water. It usually turns toward the coast between 89.5 degrees W and 90 degrees W, feeding a clockwise gyre in the Louisiana Bight and a westward coastal current. The prevalent east winds trap river water and associated nutrients on the shelf where hypoxia later develops in late spring/summer. During autumn and winter, short-term wind reversals from frontal passages rapidly reverse plume direction, initiate off-shelf transport, and reduce residence times for river waters and associated sediments, nutrients, phytoplankton, and carbon. During summer, persistent southwest and south winds force river water eastward, where cross-margin transport is likely due to the relatively narrow shelf. Slope eddies and the Loop Current control river water after leaving the shelf.

J	Rosser, NJ; Petley, DN; Lim, M; Dunning, SA; Allison, RJ				Rosser, NJ; Petley, DN; Lim, M; Dunning, SA; Allison, RJ			Terrestrial laser scanning for monitoring the process of hard rock coastal cliff erosion	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY												Hard rock cliffs represent approximately 75% of the world's coastline. The rate and nature of the mechanisms that govern the retreat of these cliffs remain poorly constrained, primarily because conventional approaches employed to monitor these processes are generally inadequate for describing cliff erosion processes directly. These techniques are usually centred upon the interpretation of data collected periodically from aerial sensors, including stereographic aerial photographs and more recently airborne LIDAR. These methods are generally not capable of assessing the pattern of erosion on the cliff face due to the oblique viewing angles, and hence tend to concentrate upon the resultant recession of the cliff top rather than change on the cliff face. Thus, processes of undercutting and small scale iterative failures of localized sections of the cliff face are generally not recorded. It is only when a failure affects the cliff top that any retreat is recorded. It is therefore unsurprising that cliff erosion is commonly deemed to be episodic. This paper presents a new approach to detailed cliff process monitoring using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), which directly monitors changes on coastal cliff faces. The method allows the quantification of failures ranging in scale from the detachment of blocks of a few centimetres in dimension through to large rock, debris or soil, falls, slides and flows over 1000 m(3). The collection of data is on-site and rapid and hence cost effective, providing a detailed description of the nature of coastal cliff erosion. This paper describes the methodological approach and demonstrates the range of results which can be generated, here shown for 16 months of monitoring collected for a near-vertical cliff section on the coast North Yorkshire, UK. The results demonstrate that trial laser scanning can be used to quantify cliff failures a previously unobtainable precision. The results reveal strong spatial and temporal pattern of cliff collapse contradicts commonly held perceptions of the nature coastal cliff development.

J	Winterbottom, SJ; Dawson, T				Winterbottom, SJ; Dawson, T			Airborne multi-spectral prospection for buried archaeology in mobile sand dominated systems	ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION												Much of the UK's potential archaeological resource is under threat from coastal erosion. Undiscovered sites are often lost or damaged by erosion before rescue excavation can take place. This project tested the use of multispectral remote sensing for detecting archaeological features in mobile sand-dominated systems, which are common on the western and northern coasts and islands around the UK. Airborne multispectral data were collected for a number of coastal areas on the Islands of Coll and Tiree. A range of data processing techniques were used to enhance the data for visual interpretation, which highlighted potential features for further inspection in the field. Features that were successfully detected by the methods used included enclosures, cairns, relict field boundaries and cultivation/soil marks, buried walls and buried structures. Multispectral remote sensing provides an extremely useful tool which can be used to significantly enhance the archaeological record, although further work is required to test the techniques under a range of conditions.

A size-fractionated primary production model was validated by in situ primary production data measured in the Japan Sea. Estimated primary production and in situ primary production showed a good positive correlation. Estimated primary production showed spatial variability. Annual primary production levels were 170, 161, 191 and 222 gC m(-2) year(-1) at the Russian coast, in the middle of the Japan Basin, the southeastern area and the southwestern area, respectively. It was higher to the south around 40 degrees N than to the north, and higher in the western area than in the eastern one. Peaks of primary production appeared twice, in spring and fall, in the southern area, while a single peak appeared in the northern area. Primary production along the Russian coast was higher than in other areas during summer. The spring bloom contributed 42% to the annual primary production in these four areas. Furthermore, estimated primary production showed an interannual variability that was largest in spring. Primary production in fall also showed interannual variability, especially in the middle of the Japan Basin and the southwestern area. This corresponded mainly to the size of the phytoplankton bloom in each year. Winter convection by wind and the depth of nutrient-rich, cold subsurface water underlying the Tsushima Current may contribute to the nutrient supply to upper layer and interannual variations of primary production in spring.

A segmentation algorithm was used to classify lakes and drained thaw lake basins (DTLBs) exceeding I ha in size. A total of 13,214 lakes and 6539 DTLBs were identified. Several indices were obtained from the image processing software and used for a comparative analysis of lakes and basins including object size, goodness of elliptic fit, shape complexity, shape asymmetry, and orientation of the major axis. Nonparametric statistical analyses indicate that lakes and basins share similar orientation only. Three subregions of the western Arctic Coastal Plain were identified based on landscape age, as demarcated by ancient shorelines. The surfaces become progressively older inland and include the Younger Outer Coastal Plain, the Outer Coastal Plain, and the oldest Inner Coastal Plain. Lakes and basins in all subregions have statistically similar orientation, indicating that summer wind direction has not changed appreciably over the past several thousand years. Basin orientation is less clustered than lake orientation. Lakes are highly elliptical, while basins have more complex shapes. Lake coverage (%) is fairly constant across the three subregions, while DTLB coverage decreases on older surfaces. Lake and basin size decreases on progressively older surfaces, but the number of features per unit area increases. It is uncertain if surface age is responsible for differences in regional metrics as an analysis of the Inner Coastal Plain demonstrates significant internal variation. Distance from the coast, ground ice content, surficial sediments. and local relief may also influence lake morphometry.

J	Iampietro, PJ; Kvitek, RG; Morris, E				Iampietro, PJ; Kvitek, RG; Morris, E			Recent advances in automated genus-specific marine habitat mapping enabled by high-resolution multibeam bathymetry	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												There is a great need for accurate, comprehensive maps of seafloor habitat for use in fish stock assessments, marine protected area design, and other resource management pursuits. Recent advances in acoustic remote sensing technology have made it possible to obtain high-resolution (meter to sub-meter) digital elevation models (DEMs) of seafloor bathymetry that can rival or surpass those available for the terrestrial environment. The acquisition and processing of these data are expensive, however, requiring specialized equipment, expertise, and large amounts of both field and laboratory effort per unit area mapped. Further, the interpretation and classification of these data into maps of habitat type is typically (and appropriately) performed only by trained experts that are familiar with both seafloor geomorphology and the nature and limitations of the data sources. Because it is done visually, this interpretation can be very time-consuming and may yield subjective results that are not comparable from site-to-site or between individual interpreters. We applied an algorithmic terrain analysis approach to efficiently and objectively classify seafloor habitats using the quantifiable landscape metric Topographic Position Index (TPI). We used high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, together with precisely geolocated (+/- 5 m) ROV observations of fish distribution, to produce a preliminary genus-specific habitat suitability model for eight rockfish (Sebastes) species in the Del Monte shale beds of Monterey Bay, California. A high-resolution (2 m) multibeam bathymetry Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was generated and used to produce a derived TPI surface model using repeatable, algorithmic methods. This data layer, together with the positions and counts by species from 229 rockfish observations (2892 total fish) was then used to create preliminary predictive models of habitat suitability and fish distribution, as well as stock estimates for the study area. A second, independent fish observation data set was used to validate the models.																	0025-3324					FAL	2005	39	3					83	93		10.4031/002533205787442495								WOS:000233660600009

That ice may nucleate as fast ice at the shelf front, by growth at the sea surface within rifts, or by basal accretion. Here, we investigate the role of such ice in the flow of the Brunt Ice Shelf and adjacent Stancomb-Wills ice tongue, along the Caird Coast of Antarctica. Much of the shelf system is severely rifted, with locally derived ice filling the space between rift walls and around ice rafts. A series of numerical experiments that account for thermal properties of the different ices is used to investigate the influence of that mixture of sea and marine ice on the kinematics and dynamics of the shelf system. The simulations are constrained by a variety of satellite remote-sensing data. We find that the locally derived ice forms a dynamic connection between the ice tongue and the Caird Coast, effectively creating an embayment where no coastal embayment exists. This may have implications for the expansion of ice shelves along arctic coasts during past glaciations.

This research is the first to map DTLBs on a large scale for Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain. Thaw lakes and DTLBs were classified from seven Landsat-7 scenes using texture analysis, spectral transformations, and image segmentation. The overall classification accuracy was 97.7% with, a Kappa coefficient of 0.96. Thaw lakes had a producer accuracy of 99.1% and a user accuracy of 98.6%, while DTLBs had a producer accuracy of 93.8% and user accuracy of 98.1%. A total of 7054 km(2) of thaw lakes were mapped, accounting for 20.4% of the Arctic Coastal Plain; there were 8917 km(2) of DTLBs covering 25.7% of the study area. Continued research in the analysis of thaw lakes and DTLBs is crucial to our understanding of the global carbon cycle, atmospheric methane concentrations, heat flow and climate change.

J	Wang, MH; Shi, W				Wang, MH; Shi, W			Estimation of ocean contribution at the MODIS near-infrared wavelengths along the east coast of the US: Two case studies	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Atmospheric correction for the ocean color products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) uses two near-infrared (NIR) bands centered at 748 and 869 nm. Ocean is usually assumed to be black at these two NIR wavelengths. For Case-2 and high productive Case-1 waters, however, ocean could have significant contributions in the NIR, leading to significant under-estimation of the MODIS-derived water-leaving radiances. This is often the case in coastal regions. In this paper, measurements from the MODIS Terra at the short wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (1240 and 1640 nm) are used to evaluate the ocean contributions at wavelengths 748 and 869 nm. The ocean is black in coastal regions in these SWIR bands due to much stronger water absorption. Studies of two MODIS granules off the east coast of the U. S. show that the ocean could have reflectance values of similar to 3.1% and similar to 1.8% at the top of atmosphere (TOA) for bands 748 and 869 nm in the Outer Banks, while these values are similar to 0.15% and similar to 0.1% in the Chesapeake Bay region. Thus, for the turbid waters, it is important to accurately account for the ocean contributions in the NIR bands for the atmospheric correction of ocean color remote sensing.

To capture small-scale changes in a coastal environment, a flexible high resolution, Doppler L-band radar with high resolution in range has been used. The data exhibit significant sensitivity to current and wind, which justifies the development of a model for inversion. The second part of the paper is thus devoted to our first attempt to model radar echoes, in order to accurately describe the influence of the geophysical parameters of interest. Here, the focus is put on waves generated by a local wind. The key point consists in taking properly into account non-linear hydrodynamic interactions between waves to generate a realistic moving sea surface. From the electromagnetic point of view, since standard low-frequency approximations no longer hold at L-band, a small-slope approximation has been implemented to compute the backscattered field. Numerical results show that for light winds (less than 5 m s(-1)) the model correctly predicts the behaviour of the data with respect to wind speed and direction.																	1631-0705					JUL-AUG	2005	6	6					675	682		10.1016/j.crhy.2005.06.008								WOS:000232542800011

Coastal ocean color remote sensing techniques permit benthic habitats to be explored with higher resolution than ever before. The objective of this research was to develop an accurate benthic habitat map for an area off the northwest coast of Roatan Island, Honduras, using high-resolution multispectral IKONOS data. Atmospheric (Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance) and water column corrections (water depth and water column attenuation) were applied to the imagery, making it a robust method for mapping benthic habitats. Water depth for each pixel was calculated based on a site-specific polynomial model. A mechanistic radiative transfer approach was developed that removed the confound effect of the water column (absorption and scattering) from the imagery to retrieve an estimate of the bottom reflectance (albedo). Albedos were <= 12% for seagrass benthos, 12% to 24% for coral areas, and >= 24% for sand-dominated areas. The retrieved bottom albedos were then used to classify the benthos, generating a detailed map of benthic habitats, followed by accuracy assessment.																	0196-2892					JUL	2005	43	7					1592	1604		10.1109/TGRS.2005.847790								WOS:000230149900017						
J	Andrade, CA; Barton, ED				Andrade, CA; Barton, ED			The Guajira upwelling system	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The coastal upwelled waters of the Guajira coast, the most northerly peninsula of South America, were studied on the basis of historical data bases, remotely sensed data, and three oceanographic cruises. The Guajira Peninsula is the locus of particularly strong upwelling because it protrudes into the Caribbean Low-Level Wind Jet and its west coast parallels the direction of the strongest winds. The year-round upwelling varies with the wind forcing: strongest in December-March and July, and weakest in the October-November rainy season. The east-west temperature, salinity and density front that delimits the upwelling lies over the shelf edge in the east of the peninsula but separates from the south-westward trending topography to the west. A coastal westward surface jet geostrophically adjusted to the upwelling flows along the front, and an eastward sub-surface counterflow is trapped against the Guajira continental slope. The undercurrent shoals toward the western limit of the upwelling, Santa Marta, beyond which point it extends to the surface. Some of the westward jet re-circulates inshore with the counterflow but part continues directly west to form an upwelling filament. Much of the mesoscale variation is associated with upwelling filaments, which expel cooler, chlorophyll- rich coastal upwelling waters westward and northward into the Caribbean Sea. Freshwater plumes from the Magdalena and Orinoco rivers influence the area strongly, and outflow from Lake Maracaibo interacts directly with upwelled waters off Guajira. Another important factor is the Aeolian input of dust from the Guajira desert by episodes of offshore winds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Local ethnobotanical uses of the mangrove forest and local perceptions about the status and recent development of the mangrove forest cover are also analyzed. The results of interviews with 54 inhabitants of four fishing villages in the study area indicated that, overall, Laguncularia racemosa is the most frequently used species in this region of the Mexican Pacific coast, where it serves as firewood and a construction material, particularly for walls and fences. The next-ranked species were Avicennia germinans, which is used for tea, and Rhizophora mangle, which is used for tanning; both these species also serve medicinal purposes. There was a discrepancy between the assessment of actual changes in the mangrove cover and what people perceived them to be. These findings are discussed from a socioeconomic ( utilization) and an ecological ( functionality) point of view and in relation to the use of remote sensing as a tool. The utilization pattern is also discussed against the background of mangrove cover variation.

The overall mean chlorophyll concentration was found higher in year 2001, when compared to years 2000 and 2002 in the selected bloom waters north of 15 degrees N latitude. The algal blooms were most intense during the year 2001. The monthly sea surface temperature (SST) and its anomaly data retrieved from NOAA-NCEP archive have been correlated with the phytoplankton blooming conditions in the study area during February-March, 2000-2002. The SST maps of January and February show similar trend in the bloom (similar to 26 degrees C) and non-bloom (similar to 29 degrees C) water, but in March month the SST has been raised by about 3 degrees C in both the bloom and non-bloom waters for the three years. The SST anomaly has been observed to be of higher range (-3 degrees to +4 degrees C) in February and March 2001 and the gradient is having significant link with the algal bloom period. The phytoplankton bloom and the hike in chlorophyll concentration during the winter monsoon season has been linked with winter cooling and the detrainment phenomenon and it's relationship with SST and SST anomaly has been discussed.																	0379-5136					JUN	2005	34	2					163	173										WOS:000229717000002

Recent lava accumulations starting from the beginning of the eruption (December 28, 2002) and a portion of the subaerial and submarine deposits were detached. As a result, tsunami waves several meters high affected the coasts of the island. After the event, monitoring activities, coordinated by the Italian Civil Protection Department, included systernatic photogrammetric surveys. The digital photogrammetric technique was adopted to extract high-resolution digital elevation models and large-scale orthophotos. The comparison between the data collected before the eruption and that acquired on January 5, 2003, together with bathymetric data, allowed to define the geometry and to estimate the volume of the surfaces involved in the landslides. The following 13 photogrammetric surveys (from January to September 2003) enabled the monitoring of the continuous and relevant morphological changes induced by both the lava flow and the evolution of the instability phenomena.

This study concentrated on analyzing the spatial and temporal aspects of phytoplankton chlorophyll variability in these areas using an integrated dataset from a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Advanced Very High Resolution (AVHRR) sensor, and Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) sensor. The results showed that chlorophyll concentrations were elevated in coastal and open ocean regions, with strong summer and fall blooms, which appeared to spread out in most of the enclosed bays and neighboring waters due to certain oceanographic processes. The chlorophyll concentration was observed to range between 3 and 54 mg m(-3) inside Jin-hae Bay and adjacent coastal bays and 0.5 and 8 mg m(-3) in the southeast sea offshore waters, this gradual decrease towards oceanic waters suggested physical transports of phytoplankton blooms from the shallow shelves to slope waters through the influence of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) along the Tsushima Strait. Horizontal distribution of potential temperature (.) and salinity (S) of water off the southeastern coast exhibited cold and low saline surface water (theta<19 degrees C; S<32.4) and warm and high saline subsurface water (theta>12 degrees C; S>34.4) at 75dBar, corroborating TWC intrusion along the Tsushima Strait. An eastward branch of this current was called the East Korean Warm Current (EKWC), tracked with the help of CTD data and satellite-derived sea surface temperature, which often influenced the dynamics of mesoscale anticyclonic eddy fields off the Korean east coast during the summer season. The process of such mesoscale anticyclonic eddy features might have produced interior upwelling that could have shoaled and steepened the nutricline, enhancing phytoplankton population by advection or diffusion of nutrients in the vicinity of Ulleungdo in the East Sea.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2005	40	2					67	78		10.1007/BF03028587                                                              								WOS:000208917200002						
J	Lamont-Smith, T; Dovey, PR				Lamont-Smith, T; Dovey, PR			The effect of tidal currents on radar backscatter from the sea around Portland Bill	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Low grazing angle radar data of the sea surface were collected using three different frequencies (3, 10 and 16 GHz) from a cliff-top site on the south coast of England. A number of features were observed in the radar imagery that could be related to the tidal current flow around Portland Bill. The strongest, most obvious features occurred near the time of low water, and these features had significantly reduced backscatter levels in horizontal polarization, with reductions up to 20 dB, or more, below the clutter levels around them. In vertical polarization, the reduction in the clutter level was typically somewhat smaller (IOdB or so) than the horizontally polarized backscatter. No convincing explanation of this effect has been found. The strain rate component in the radar line of sight was estimated from measurements of the current component calculated from the radar data. A comparison of range-time intensity images of the radar backscatter and the strain rate showed a number of strongly correlated features that repeated with the semi-diurnal tidal period. The maximum strain rate was around 0.0005 s(-1), which produced modulations in the radar backscatter of around 2-3 dB. On occasions a number of bright streaks with a separation of around 100 in were also observed, moving away from the radar at a few cm s(-1). A satellite image from European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS)-2 of the Portland area suggests that the slow-moving streaks may be internal waves generated by tidal flow over raised bathymetry.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				MAY 20	2005	26	10					2061	2079		10.1080/01431160512331337989								WOS:000230647000004

The study area was divided into four ecoregions differing widely in climatic conditions and management regime. The forest age distributions (as derived from inventory data) differed by ecozone with fewer old stands in the Coast Range and the East Cascades, and a relatively uniform distribution of ages from 0 to 815 in the Cascade Mountains. Age distributions also differed by land ownership, with fewer old stands on non-federal lands than on national forest lands. Estimated biomass increased rapidly in early stand development and tended to stabilize after about 200 years. Peak biomass in the semi-arid East Cascades was about one-third that of the other ecoregions (median biomass at asymptote similar to 9 and similar to 25 kg C m(-2), respectively). The timing and magnitude of maximum net primary production also varied by ecoregion, with the high productivity Coast Range forests reaching a maximum NPP before 30 years of age (median similar to 1 kg C m(-2) y(-1)), and the low productivity East Cascades reaching a maximum NPP between 80 and 100 years (median similar to 0.3 kg C m(-2) y(-1)). Productivity was generally lower in older stands with the exception of the East Cascades ecoregion where, contrary to the paradigm of age-related decline in forest growth, the oldest stands had the highest NPR The East Cascades also differed from the other ecoregions in that the proportion of NPP allocated below-round decreased rather than increased with stand age. This study demonstrates the value of combining data from intensive and extensive measurement sites for improved estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes as well as improved parameterization of process models used in scaling carbon flux over broad regions.

J	Fettweis, X; Gallee, H; Lefebre, F; van Ypersele, JP				Fettweis, X; Gallee, H; Lefebre, F; van Ypersele, JP			Greenland surface mass balance simulated by a regional climate model and comparison with satellite-derived data in 1990-1991	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The 1990 and 1991 ablation seasons over Greenland are simulated with a coupled atmosphere-snow regional climate model with a 25-km horizontal resolution. The simulated snow water content allows a direct comparison with the satellite-derived melt signal. The model is forced with 6-hourly ERA-40 reanalysis at its boundaries. An evaluation of the simulated precipitation and a comparison of the modelled melt zone and the surface albedo with remote sensing observations are presented. Both the distribution and quantity of the simulated precipitation agree with observations from coastal weather stations, estimates from other models and the ERA-40 reanalysis. There are overestimations along the steep eastern coast, which are most likely due to the "topographic barrier effect". The simulated extent and time evolution of the wet snow zone compare generally well with satellite-derived data, except during rainfall events on the ice sheet and because of a bias in the passive microwave retrieved melt signal. Although satellite-based surface albedo retrieval is only valid in the case of clear sky, the interpolation and the correction of these data enable us to validate the simulated albedo on the scale of the whole Greenland. These two comparisons highlight a large sensitivity of the remote sensing observations to weather conditions. Our high-resolution climate model was used to improve the retrieval algorithms by taking more fully into account the atmosphere variability. Finally, the good agreement of the simulated melting surface with the improved satellite signal allows a detailed estimation of the melting volume from the simulation.

J	Alphan, H; Yilmaz, KT				Alphan, H; Yilmaz, KT			Monitoring environmental changes in the Mediterranean coastal landscape: The case of Cukurova, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This paper describes a remote sensing approach used to monitor temporal land use/cover (LULC) changes in Cukurova, an extensive coastal plain in the southeast Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The area has varied terrain ranging from low-lying alluvial deposits to rocky hills and mountains characterized by limestone outcrops. The ecological and economic importance of the area can be attributed to the existence of important coastal ecosystems (e.g., wetlands and sand dunes) and a wide range of industries located along the eastern coast. Temporal charges in the coastal landscape between 1984 and 2000 were evaluated using digital interpretation of remotely sensed satellite data, Pairwise comparison methods were used to quantify changes from 1984 to 1993 and 1993 to 2000 using multitemporal Landsat TM and ETM+ images, acquired in 1984, 1993, and 2000, respectively. Total change area was 2448 ha from 1984 to 1993 and increased more than twofold, to 6072 ha from 1993 to 2000. Change trends were determined using the information provided from individual change detection outputs of different periods. The most prominent changes were estimated to have occurred in agriculture, urban, and natural vegetation cover. Agriculture has increasingly grown over marginal areas, whereas urban development occurred at the expense of prime croplands across both time steps.																	0364-152X					MAY	2005	35	5					607	619		10.1007/s00267-004-0222-7								WOS:000229970900007	15902445

The measurements were made from a pier at the South Department of the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology with microwave radiometers operating at wavelengths of 1.5, 0.8, 0.5, and 0.3 cm. The surface wave spectrum parameters were estimated from angular radiometric measurements using a novel approach. Microwave brightness contrasts at Ka-band (37 GHz) measured over wide range of incidence angles were used for a curvature spectrum of gravity-capillary waves and a mean-square slope of gravity waves retrieval. The evolution of spectrum parameters under variable wind (ranged from 0.5-7 m/s) was investigated. The delay of brightness variation relative to wind speed as large as 1-2 h was found. The performed spectral analysis permitted to relate the observed brightness delay to short gravity-capillary surface waves, whereas longer gravity waves followed the wind practically without any delay. It is concluded that the proposed technique of gravity-capillary wave spectrum retrieval provides a useful tool for investigation of air-sea interaction and surface wave dynamics.																	0196-2892					MAY	2005	43	5					983	989		10.1109/TGRS.2005.845036								WOS:000228672800007

Laser bathymetric survey tools have applicability in clear coastal (Case 11) waters down to -70 meters depth. Deployed along the southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties) coast, an advanced ALB system provided a continuous dataset for 160 kilometers of coast from onshore to 5 kilometers offshore. Digital terrain models developed from this high-density bathymetric data permitted recognition A numerous seafloor features and bathymetric patterns from different image formats. Bathymetric analysis of the 600-km(2) survey area on the narrow continental shelf shows inherited lithologic features that are partly covered by surficial sediments. Primary parabathic provinces include: (1) nearshore rocky zones dominated by the Anastasia Formation, (2) coral-algal reef systems (Florida Reef Tract [FRT]), and (3) marine terraces. Secondary sedimentary subprovinces include shoreface sands, inter-reefial sedimentary infills (coral rubble in basal sequences and near reef gaps), and finer-grained materials seaward of the FRT. Tertiary topographic features include: (1) longshore bar and trough systems, shoals, sand sheets, and diabathic channels; (2) reef crests and ledges, forereef spurs and grooves, sediment ramps in large reef gaps, and incised paleo-river channels; and (3) drowned karst topography. Hierarchical organization of these bathymetric features is now possible for the first time because of the increased accuracy and density of bathymetric data obtained by ALB systems.																	0749-0208					MAY	2005	21	3					501	514		10.2112/05-756A.1								WOS:000229408900011						
J	Pegler, KH; Coleman, DJ; Pelot, RP; Zhang, Y				Pegler, KH; Coleman, DJ; Pelot, RP; Zhang, Y			Comparison of maximum distance metrics for use in the remote sensing of small targets	JOURNAL OF SURVEYING ENGINEERING-ASCE												There are many applications for small target detection in engineering: topographic mapping, infrastructure inventories, and pre-engineering design. Near shore marine applications include: mapping breakwaters, piers, navigation structures, pilings, and vessel traffic patterns. The application driving this research is the development of a surveillance system for the Canadian Coast Guard. As a result, a new and innovative application of small target detection techniques is being developed at the Department of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering, UNB, Canada. This work is being done in support of the development of a strategic decision making toot to be used to predict where in Canadian waters marine incidents are most likely to occur. Previous research in the use of hyperspectral imaging for search and rescue, resulted in the development of fast, nonparametric "spatio-spectral" template subpixel object detection algorithm. The results of this work are being adapted and enhanced for use with the new, commercially available spaceborne high-resolution optical imagery. Research is being performed on the employment of a weighted Euclidean distance metric to enhance the "spatio-spectral" template by exploiting the variance/covariance information surrounding a potential target. The detection results using the new weighted Euclidean distance metric were excellent. The best results were had using a 3 X 3 kernel with all 16 targets being detected.

J	Etnoyer, P				Etnoyer, P			Seamount resolution in satellite-derived bathymetry	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												I compare satellite-derived global relief data on 13 seamounts in the northeast Pacific Ocean to echosounder-derived multibeam values from the Gulf of Alaska Seamount Expeditions and the West Coast Seamounts and Ridges Multibeam Surveys for peak height, latitude, longitude, and midsection area. I find Smith and Sandwell's (1997) global sea floor topography relatively accurate for peak geoposition but generally deeper than multibeam by 192 m (132 m). Cell size alone can explain 50-90% of peak height variation, suggesting higher-resolution geodetic altimetry could improve the accuracy of these estimates. Nevertheless, midsection areas overlap by 80 +/- 11%. The altimetric technique clearly resolves the presence and general form of numerous unnamed deep seamounts, though predicted seamount peak height estimates for small features may vary from their true depth by up to 50%. These findings support high-end estimates of global seamount abundance since small seamount features (similar to 1200 m relief) revealed by satellite may, in actuality, be quite substantial features (similar to 2500 m relief).

Six sea-breeze events are analyzed with a particular focus on 25 June 2001. Advection of cool and humid marine air over land has a profound influence on the daytime ABL characteristics. This impact decreases rapidly with the inland distance from the sea. Nearby the coast (3 km inland), the mixing height Zi rises up to 750 m and falls down after 15:00 (UT) when the breeze flow reaches its maximum intensity. A more classical evolution of the ABL is observed at only 11-km inland where Zi culminates in the morning and stabilizes in the afternoon at about 1000 m height. Fine inspection of the data revealed an oscillation of the sea-breeze with a period about 2 h 47 min. This feature, clearly discernable for 3 days at least, is present in several atmospheric variables such as wind, temperature, not only at the ground but also aloft in the ABL as observed by sodar/RASS and UHF wind profilers. In particular, the mixing height Zi deduced from UHF profilers observations is affected also by the same periodicity. This pulsated sea-breeze is observed principally above Marseille and, at the northern and eastern shores of the Berre pond. In summary, the periodic intrusion over land of cool marine air modifies the structure of the ABL in the vicinity of the coast from the point of view of stability, turbulent motions and pollutants concentration. An explanation of the source of this pulsated sea-breeze is suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This new approach seeks a manifold coordinate system that preserves geodesic distances in the high-dimensional hyperspectral data space. Algorithms for deriving manifold coordinates, such as isometric mapping (ISOMAP), have been developed for other applications. ISOMAP guarantees a globally optimal solution, but is computationally practical only for small datasets because of computational and memory requirements. Here, we develop a hybrid technique to circumvent ISOMAP's computational cost. We divide the scene into a set of smaller tiles. The manifolds derived from the individual tiles are then aligned and stitched together to recomplete the scene. Several alignment methods are discussed. This hybrid approach exploits the fact that ISOMAP guarantees a globally optimal solution for each tile and the presumed similarity of the manifold structures derived from different tiles. Using land-cover classification of hyperspectral imagery in the Virginia Coast Reserve as a test case, we show that the new manifold representation provides better separation of spectrally similar classes than one of the standard linear mixing models. Additionally, we demonstrate that this technique provides a natural data compression scheme, which dramatically reduces the number of components needed to model hyperspectral data when compared with traditional methods such as the minimum noise fraction transform.																	0196-2892					MAR	2005	43	3					441	454		10.1109/TGRS.2004.842292								WOS:000227130000005

It considers both the radiometric and the geometric characteristics of the areas being tested. In order to minimize the operator intervention, it adopts automatic selection criteria to extract the potentially polluted areas from the images. The method has an a priori percentage of correct classification higher than 90% on the training dataset; the performance is confirmed on a different dataset of verified slicks. Some analyses have been conducted using images with different radiometric and geometric resolutions to test its suitability with SAR images different from European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite ones. The system and its ability to detect and classify oil and non-oil surface features are described. Starting from a set of verified oil spills detected offshore and over the coastline, the ability of SAR to reveal oil spills is tested by analysing wind intensity, deduced from the image itself, and the distance from the coast.																	0143-1161					MAR	2005	26	6					1157	1174		10.1080/01431160512331326558								WOS:000228182500007						
J	Kunte, PD; Wagle, BG				Kunte, PD; Wagle, BG			The beach ridges of India: A review	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												An attempt has been made to assemble and synthesize research work conducted on beach ridges and associated geomorphic features around India. Information on location, morphology, origin, and age of beach ridges, has been gathered from the literature, and is presented in a consolidated form. Beach ridges of the east and west coast of India are grouped in thirteen-beach ridge complexes based on their association. Review indicates that the beach ridges of India are not older than the Holocene age; they are abundant along the east coast; and their presence indicates that the eastern coastal stretch has protruded approximately 30-35 km seawards since the beginning of the Holocene period. Based on their evolutionary trend, beach ridges complexes are distinguished into 4 genetic classes. Finally, the utilization of beach ridges in the reconstruction of sea level curve, palaeo-climate and sediment budget histories has been highlighted, and scope for future study is discussed.																	0749-0208					SPR	2005					42		174	183										WOS:000230629600020

It is shown for an extended summer period (May 15 till September 15, 2003) that sea surface temperature (SST) data in the strait are correlated with NCEP winds, each westward wind increase being followed by a clear surface temperature decrease. Local surface temperature of about 22degreesC at that time drops down to 15degreesC, value corresponding to the 80 - 120 m depth conditions. The analysis of subsequent images indicates that the cold upwelling plume typically moves first to the Atlantic during wind forcing, and then to the Mediterranean after the wind event. The presence of the northern coast of the strait is taken as responsible for a rise of a cross-strait sea level gradient and the enhancement of the associated westward geostrophic current that explains the first stage of the plume deployment. Sea level difference measured between Tarifa (European coast) and Ceuta (African coast), well described by a linear equation in term of the westward wind component, supports this idea as well as the subsequent remotely sensed SST distributions.

Some outbreaks in parts of the Dagang region, in the east coast of China, have caused drastic reductions in the yield of agricultural reeds and have created a severe threat to local and regional agriculture. Currently, the monitoring system for this species depends on field observations conducted by sparsely distributed observing stations established in the 1950s. This observation network was, in the past, successfully operated to identify major locust outbreaks. However, due to the expansion of infestation areas and the increase of locust density, spatial information technology was needed to establish a satellite sensor-based monitoring system for the East Asia migratory locust plagues. This Letter outlines the preliminary experimental work conducted in 2001 for a feasibility study in establishing a sensor-based locust monitoring system. In this experiment, sample statistics of biomass and leaf area index (LAI) from the affected and non-affected areas by locusts were calculated, and the spectra of field reed samples from both areas were also evaluated together with synchronous Landsat Enhanced. Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral data. The study showed that satellite sensors may be used operationally to monitor locust damage.

UBL/CLU focuses on the dynamics and thermodynamics of the urban boundary layer of Marseille, on the Mediterranean coast of France. The objective of UBL/CLU is to document the four-dimensional structure of the urban boundary layer and its relation to the heat and moisture exchanges between the urban canopy and the atmosphere during periods of low wind conditions, from June 4 to July 16, 2001. The project took advantage of the comprehensive observational set-up of the ESCOMPTE campaign over the Berre-Marseille area, especially the ground-based remote sensing, airborne measurements, and the intensive documentation of the regional meteorology. Additional instrumentation was installed as part of UBL/CLU. Analysis objectives focus on (i) validation of several energy balance computational schemes such as LUMPS, TEB and SM2-U, (ii) ground truth and urban canopy signatures suitable for the estimation of urban albedos and aerodynamic surface temperatures from satellite data, (iii) high resolution mapping of urban land cover, land-use and aerodynamic parameters used in UBL models, and (iv) testing the ability of high resolution atmospheric models to simulate the structure of the UBL during land and sea breezes, and the related transport and diffusion of pollutants over different districts of the city.

However, we show here that comparable volumes of silicic magmas have been erupted in the region. In particular, the virtually undocumented Nabro Volcanic Range, which runs NNE for more than 100 km from the margin of the Danakil Depression to the Red Sea coast, has a subaerial volume of the order of 550 km(3), comparable to the volume of the much better known Erta'Ale axial volcanic range. Nabro volcano itself forms part of an enigmatic double caldera structure with a neighbouring volcano, Mallahle. The twin caldera may have formed simultaneously with the eruption of between 20 and 100 km(3) of ignimbrite, which is readily identified in Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. This may have been the largest explosive eruption in north Afar, and is certain to have deposited a regionally distributed tephra layer which could in the future be located in distal sections as a stratigraphic marker. An integrated analysis of optical and synthetic aperture radar imagery, digital topographic data, field observations and limited geochemical measurements, permits here descriptions and first order inferences about the structure, stratigraphy and compositions of several major volcanoes of the Afar Triangle, and a reappraisal of their regional significance.

Eighty centimeter spatial resolution CASI imagery was acquired in eight spectral bands over Tofino Creek on the West coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. A spectral angle mapping algorithm was used to classify stream habitat including hydraulic habitat, substrate material, and woody debris. Subclasses were attempted in terms of streambed material and water depth, but results were not reliable. A classification of deep water, moderate depth water, shallow water, sand, gravel and cobble, and woody debris in sunlit conditions, however, proved accurate (80 percent on average). Individual logs and piles of woody debris were consistently detected. Silty substrate in a tidal flats zone was also classified, but results indicated that different substrate material beneath the water may require separate classes and can result in problematic water depth classification. Patterns of general classes were reasonably represented within shadowed areas cast by isolated trees or groups of trees. However, problems do arise within lengthy shadowed stretches. Some boundaries of stream features with surrounding forest and between some zones of sand, gravel, and cobble were also misclassified. High-resolution, multispectral imagery in four or more bands combined with good geometric correction, image mosaicking, and appropriate automatic classification techniques offer a viable tool for stream mapping to meet a variety of issues and applications. In the future, a powerful suite of stream information may be compiled from multispectral classification combined with high-resolution thermal and lidar data.																	0099-1112					FEB	2005	71	2					145	155		10.14358/PERS.71.2.145								WOS:000226764800003						
J	Kim, JH; Na, S; Newchurch, MJ; Martin, RV				Kim, JH; Na, S; Newchurch, MJ; Martin, RV			Tropical tropospheric ozone morphology and seasonality seen in satellite and in situ measurements and model calculations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] An important issue in satellite remote sensing techniques for retrieving tropical tropospheric ozone is understanding the cause of the disagreement between ozone derived from satellite residual- based methods and the precursor distributions seen in both the fire count distribution and the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere ( MOPITT) CO distribution over northern tropical Atlantic and Africa in boreal winter and spring. This discrepancy has been called the Northern Atlantic paradox; however, it actually extends eastward all the way to Indonesia. We define the disagreement as the northern tropical paradox. We employ the scan angle method ( SAM) to solve the paradox. This algorithm takes advantage of the difference in the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ( TOMS) retrieval information between nadir and high viewing angles. The averaging kernel for this difference exhibits a broad maximum centered at similar to5 km in the troposphere and thereby can be used to estimate tropospheric ozone information. The seasonal distribution of tropospheric ozone derived from the SAM algorithm shows remarkably good agreement with fire counts from Along Track Scanning Radiometer ( ATSR), CO from MOPITT, TOMS aerosol index, and ozone distribution from the GEOS- CHEM model in four seasons over the tropics. In meridional distribution, all of these products clearly reveal the seasonal oscillation between northern tropical Africa in boreal winter and over southern tropical Africa in boreal summer. The residual- based methods ( TOR, CCD, CCP, and modified residual), however, always show the ozone maximum over the southern Atlantic off the coast of southwest Africa. A further comparison with the in situ measurements from the Measurement of Ozone and Water Vapor by Airbus In- Service Aircraft ( MOZAIC) campaign at three locations over the northern tropics, Abidjan ( 5degreesN, 4degreesW), Madras ( 13degreesN, 80degreesE), and Bangkok ( 14degreesN, 101degreesE), supports our results. The seasonality of ozone from the SAM and the model, which shows the ozone maximum in boreal summer and the minimum in boreal winter, is in accordance with the MOZAIC measurements. However, the seasonality of the RBMs does not agree with the seasonality of in situ measurements. We conclude that the northern tropical paradox does not actually exist.

However, while the single-scattering albedo blc in the Oslo Fjord on an average is 62% and 78% at 425 and 525 nm, respectively, the corresponding numbers for the Gulf of Gdansk are 54% and 61%. Another characteristic difference is that particle absorption plays a much more significant role in the Gulf of Gdansk than in the Oslo Fjord. Thus some parts of the Baltic exhibit similarities with the Oslo Fjord while others display differences, and it cannot be assumed a priori that algorithms from one area will have a general validity in the other. Algorithms for chlorophyll-a and yellow substance as functions of colour indices, determined for the southern part of the Baltic Sea between the Pommerian Bight and the Gulf of Gdansk, are clearly not valid for the Oslo Fjord, but the result improves by changing their constants by a best-fit procedure. We conclude that statistical algorithms for remote sensing are not generally interchangeable between the Baltic and the Oslo Fjord, and that the constants of the algorithms have to be locally tuned.																	0143-1161					JAN 20	2005	26	2					371	386		10.1080/01431160410001720289								WOS:000226804800010						
J	Turner, J; Klaus, R				Turner, J; Klaus, R			Coral reefs of the Mascarenes, Western Indian Ocean	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The reefs of the Mascarenes differ in structure and stage of development. Mauritius is the oldest island, bound by a discontinuous fringing reef and small barrier reef, with large lagoon patch reefs. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon with deep channels and few patch reefs. Reunion, the youngest island, has short stretches of narrow fringing reefs along southwestern coasts. The islets of St Brandon are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef. Reef mapping of the Mascarenes using satellite imagery provides an estimate of 705 km 2 of shallow reef habitats. These areas have been modified over geological time by changes in sea level, ocean-atmosphere disturbances and biological and chemical forcing. Further modification has resulted from historical changes in land-use patterns. Recent economic development has placed many of these reefs at risk from anthropogenic impact. The reefs of the Mascarenes have escaped mass mortality from bleaching to date, which increases their conservation significance within the wider Indian Ocean. The reefs are poorly protected. A case study shows how a geographic information system incorporating reef-habitat maps can help formulate and demonstrate Marine protected Area boundaries.																	1364-503X					JAN 15	2005	363	1826					229	250		10.1098/rsta.2004.1489								WOS:000225970100021	15598634

Spatial patterns in mass balance of the Siple Coast and Amundsen Sea sectors, West Antarctica	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY, VOL 41 2005	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY				28th Symposium of the Scientific-Committee on Antarctic Research	JUL 28-29, 2004	Bremen, GERMANY	Sci Comm Antarct Res				Local rates of change in ice-sheet thickness were calculated at IS sites in West Antarctica using the submergence velocity technique. This method entails a comparison of the vertical velocity of the ice sheet, measured using repeat global positioning system surveys of markers, and local long-term rates of snow accumulation obtained using firn-core stratigraphy. Any significant difference between these two quantities represents a thickness change with time. Measurements were conducted at sites located similar to 100-200 km apart along US ITASE traverse routes, and at several isolated locations. All but one of the sites are distributed in the Siple Coast and the Amundsen Sea basin along contours of constant elevation, along flowlines, across ice divides and close to regions of enhanced flow. Calculated rates of thickness change are different from site to site. Most of the large rates of change in ice thickness (similar to 10 cm a(-1) or larger) are observed in or close to regions of rapid flow, and are probably related to ice-dynamics effects. Near-steady-state conditions are calculated mostly at sites in the slow-moving ice-sheet interior and near the main West Antarctic ice divide. These results are consistent with regional estimates of ice-sheet change derived from remote-sensing measurements at similar locations in West Antarctica.

The research was part of an African region initiative to demonstrate the practical application of geographic information for sustainable development. Remotely sensed images from close to 1990 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor and 2000 Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor and geographic information system (GIS) technologies are applied to discern changes in land cover and land use along the mainland Tanzania coast. Change detection results show that urban land area has increased dramatically. Mangrove forest area declined modestly, but field verification shows severe deterioration of their conditions near urban areas. While the area of dense woodland decreased, the area of open woodland and the area of woodland interspersed with agriculture increased. This study demonstrates how geospatial information science and technologies provide critical information and tools for coastal resource managers who work at the crossroads of resource use, land-cover change, poverty alleviation, and environmental management.																	0892-0753					JAN-MAR	2005	33	1					87	99		10.1080/08920750590883132								WOS:000226205800006

From the spatial extent of the plumes of TSM (160-120 km) during October of 1999 and 2000, off the mouth of the Himalayan rivers the Ganga and the Brahmaputra (G-B), it is deduced that fluvial flux does not diminish concurrently with the termination of the southwest (SW) monsoon, as suggested by time-series trap experiments in the northern bay. During the NE monsoon, the G-B plumes move north to south initially off the mouth, and thereafter advects SW alongshore in the form of coastal sediment plumes, reducing the salinity of the coastal waters along the entire northern bay during October-December. We have observed a strong relation between enhanced episodic discharges of the Ganga Brahmaputra, (G-B) and augmented coastal turbidity during weekly events. It is also observed that even during such short (weekly) events of very high pulse of TSM discharge by the G-B system, the fluvial fluxes do not advect offshore into the deeper regions of the northcentral bay, but are transported alongshore and distributed along the shelf. Our results, therefore, suggest that the reduced recovery of the fluxes in the sediments traps subsequent to the SW monsoon are not linearly related to the magnitude of fluvial flux of the G-B, but stems from the prevalent dispersal patterns.

The 2002 and other cruises generated a small database of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) profiles that enabled investigation of the performance of a variety of standard and regional bio-optical algorithms for remote sensing retrievals of chl-a in the region. The standard SeaWiFS OC4V4 and MODIS chlor_a2 algorithms overestimated chl-a as previously reported while a regional algorithm proposed by Bricaud et al. [2002. Algal biomass and sea surface temperature in the Mediterranean basin: intercomparison of data from various satellite sensors, and implications for primary production estimates. Remote Sensing Environment 81, 163-178] and the semi-analytical MODIS chlor_a3 gave improved retrievals. SeaWiFS mean chl-a maps are presented for the Eastern Mediterranean for each month between September 1997 and August 2004 and as multi-annual "climatological" images. The former showed that chl-a in the region decreased over the duration of the time series with reductions in the centre of the eddy, tracked using a quasi-Lagrangian approach, of approximately 33% between 1997 and 1998 and 2002 and 2003. This was not correlated with deep winter mixing represented as heat loss from the sea-surface or dust deposition represented as daily EP-TOMS aerosol index and annual aluminium deposition on the Israeli coast. It is hypothesised that the variations in chl-a are partly a function of the eddy dynamics. Daily SeaWiFS observations show that the 2002 phosphate release was conducted at a period of decreasing chl-a between the winter maximum and summer oligotrophic conditions; however, the rate of seasonal decrease was less than that observed in situ during the week following the phosphate release.

J	Civille, JC; Sayce, K; Smith, SD; Strong, DR				Civille, JC; Sayce, K; Smith, SD; Strong, DR			Reconstructing a century of Spartina alterniflora invasion with historical records and contemporary remote sensing	ECOSCIENCE												Remote sensing is becoming a vital tool for understanding the changing vegetation patterns that are associated with broad-scale plant invasions. The establishment of North American east coast native Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) in Willapa Bay, Washington is a specific example of broad-scale invasion following local introduction. In this study, we examined a 120-y historical record of aerial photographs, oral histories, museum records, and publications to reconstruct the spatial, temporal, and historical elements of this invasion. We conclude that the most likely means for S. alterniflora to have reached Willapa Bay was the transport and translocation of oysters from New York harbour. Our data and analysis suggest that multiple areas were colonized between 1894 and 1920 coincident with sustained import of oysters from the Atlantic seaboard. We have evidence that S. alterniflora had been long established and growing in multiple widely spread locations by 1945, which is in contrast to a widely reported single introduction. Multiple foci would not only explain the colonization patterns we have observed, but could also increase the heterogeneity of the founding populations, helping to overcome barriers to reproduction that may have initially slowed the colonization in isolated populations during the first 50-70 y.																	1195-6860						2005	12	3					330	338		10.2980/i1195-6860-12-3-330.1								WOS:000232582200005

The SeaSonde is a compact high-frequency (HF) radar system operated from the coast or offshore platform to produce current velocity maps and local estimates of the directional wave spectrum. Two methods are described to obtain wave information from the second-order radar spectrum: integral inversion and fitting with a model of the ocean wave spectrum. We describe results from both standard- and long-range systems and include comparisons with simultaneous measurements from an S4 current meter. Due to general properties of the radar spectrum common to all HF radar systems, existing interpretation methods fail when the waveheight exceeds a limiting value defined by the radar frequency. As a result, standard- and long-range SeaSondes provide wave information for different wave height conditions because of their differing radar frequencies. Standard-range SeaSondes are useful for low and moderate waveheights, whereas long-range systems with lower transmit frequencies provide information when the waves are high. We propose a low-cost low-power system, to be used exclusively for local wave measurements, which would be capable of switching transmit frequency when the waveheight exceeds the critical limit, thereby allowing observation of waves throughout the waveheight range.																	0364-9059					JAN	2005	30	1					221	231		10.1109/JOE.2004.839929								WOS:000229417400022

Two winter images of Landsat MSS and ETM+, acquired in 1972 and 2002, were clustered into "water" and "non-water" classes using the ISODATA algorithm prior to pixel-based comparison of land and water areas in two dates. The results of the study showed that significant changes occurred especially around river mouths, in the form of accretion and erosion. More than half of the total erosion along the sea coast, 153 of 347 ha, was detected to have occurred at the mouth of river Seyhan. The amount of accretion in Ceyhan delta was calculated as 203 ha. Importance of landscape-level characterization and monitoring that provide a basis for more detailed research and finer change detection was also highlighted.																	0957-4352						2005	23	1					92	102		10.1504/IJEP.2005.006398								WOS:000228547100007

Studies were carried out for the periods 1992-1994 and 1994-1997. Several ERS-1/2 satellite SAR images were acquired over the San Matias Gulf in the Patagonian coast during these two periods. SAR is a side-looking imaging radar that operates from either a satellite or an aircraft. The instrument emits a series microwave pulses toward the earth in a direction perpendicular to the flight path. Imagery is constructed from the strength and time delay of the returned signals, which depend primarily on the roughness and dielectric properties of the surface under observation and the distance from the radar. Ocean surface roughness wave-like patterns, imaged as a series of bright and dark linear features by SAR, are persistently observed over the San Matias Gulf mouth region. A total of thirty-three (33) ERS-1/2 SAR images (100 km X 100 km) from 15 different orbits from 1992 to 2000 were analyzed. This series of observations has allowed for a detailed examination of the location, persistence, and the conditions involved in the imaging of the observed wavelike patterns. Very strong tidal currents of the order of 2 m/s characterize the gulf region. The characteristics of recurrent surface patterns in the SAR images indicate that they are caused by the interaction of the tidal currents with bed forms in the bottom topography of the gulf. The location of these bed forms is poorly documented in the available bathymetric charts of the region. The SAR images show the significant potential that satellite radar observations have as a tool for detecting unmapped coastal ocean bottom features, particularly, where bathymetric mapping activities can be extremely difficult, dangerous, or costly.

The bordering countries derive a substantial share of their food from fishing in these coastal waters. Synoptic maps of water-column integrated primary production in May and September were derived using a primary production algorithm applied to ocean color satellite data from the Yellow Sea from 1998 to 2003. The middle of the Yellow Sea (MYS) had higher levels of primary production in May and September than the shallower (<50 m) areas off the coasts of Korea and China. Although the coastal areas had high phytoplankton biomass, lower levels of primary production were caused by high turbidity arising from strong tides and shallow depths. Lower turbidity in the central part of the Yellow Sea allows light necessary for primary production to penetrate deeper into the water column. The mean daily integrated primary production in the MYS was 947 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in May and 723 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in September. The mean values in Chinese and Korean coastal waters were 590 and 589 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in May, and 734 and 553 Mg C m(-2) d(-1) in September, respectively.

J	Lantuit, H; Pollard, WH				Lantuit, H; Pollard, WH			Temporal stereophotogrammetric analysis of retrogressive thaw slumps on Herschel Island, Yukon territory	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The western Canadian Arctic is identified as an area of potentially significant global warming. Thawing permafrost, sea level rise, changing sea ice conditions and increased wave activity will result in accelerated rates of coastal erosion and thermokarst activity in areas of ice-rich permafrost. The Yukon Coastal Plain is widely recognized as one of the most ice-rich and thaw-sensitive areas in the Canadian Arctic. In particular, Herschel Island displays extensive coastal thermokarst. Retrogressive thaw slumps are a common thermokarst landform along the Herschel Island coast that have been increasing in both frequency and extent have in recent years due to increased thawing of massive ground ice and coastal erosion. The volume of sediment and ground ice eroded by retrogressive slump activity and the potential release of climate change related materials like organic carbon, carbon dioxide and methane are largely unknown. The remote setting of Herschel Island, and the Arctic in general, make direct observation of this type of erosion and the analysis of potential climate feedbacks extremely problematic. Remote sensing provides possibly the best solution to this problem. This study looks at two retrogressive thaw slumps located on the western shore of Herschel Island and using stereophotogrammetric methods attempts to (1) develop the first three-dimensional geomorphic analysis of this type of landform, and (2) provide an estimation of the volume of sediment/ground ice eroded through back wasting thermokarst activity. Digital Elevation Models were extracted for the years 1952, 1970 and 2004 and validated using data collected in the field using Kinematic Differential Global Positioning System. Estimates of sediment volumes eroded from retrogressive thaw slumps were found to vary greatly. In one case the total volume of material lost for the 1.970-2004 period was approximately 1560000 m(3). The estimated volume of sediment alone was 360 000 m(3). The temporal analysis of the DEMs suggest that second generation retrogressive thaw slump activity within the floor of a large polycyclic retrogressive thaw slump is possible.

J	Karkas, E; Martma, T; Sonninen, E				Karkas, E; Martma, T; Sonninen, E			Physical properties and stratigraphy of surface snow in western Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica	POLAR RESEARCH												Information about the spatial variations of snow properties and of annual accumulation on ice sheets is important if we are to understand the results obtained from ice cores, satellite remote sensing data and changes in climate patterns. The layer structure and spatial variations of physical properties of surface snow in western Dronning Maud Land were analysed during the austral summers 1999/2000, 2000/01 and 2003/04 in five different snow zones. The measurements were performed in shallow (1-2 m) snow pits along a transect extending 350 km from the seaward edge of the ice shelf to the polar plateau. These pits covered at least the last annual accumulation and ranged in elevation from near sea level to 2500 m a.s.l. The delta O-18 values and accumulation rates had a good linear correlation with the distance from the coast. The mean accumulation on the ice shelf was 312 +/- 128 mm water equivalent (w.e.); in the coastal region it was 215 +/- 43 mm w.e. and on the polar plateau it was 92 +/- 25 mm w.e. The mean annual conductivity and grain size values decreased exponentially with increasing distance from the ice edge, by 48%/100 km and 18%/100 km respectively. The mean grain size varied between 1.5 and 1.8 mm. Depth hoar layers were a common phenomenon, especially under thin ice crusts, and were associated with low dielectric constant values.

The presence of these eddies is known to cause transient "inversions" of the shelf-slope current. By means of an exhaustive analysis of sea surface temperature images a group of anticyclonic structures were monitored in September 2001. One of these eddy-like features was tracked and intensely surveyed by means of conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) casts and repeated fast surveys with Nv-Shuttle (oscillating CTD) and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements during the ET2001 oceanographic cruise. A well developed anticyclonic eddy was surveyed over the Catalan continental shelf, 60 km north of Barcelona. In situ velocity data revealed that the anticyclonic motion was characterized by surface velocities of 50 cm/s and a diameter of about 45 km. The signal of the eddy was found down to 100 m depth, well below the seasonal thermocline. The passage of the eddy modified the local flow, involving advection and subduction of surrounding waters.

This region has a diversity of metasedimentary rocks, granitic intrusives, felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks, and continental and marine sedimentary deposits. The TM 742 band combination on a RGB false color composite was the most revealing for lithologic discrimination of the main Neogene volcanic, and Quaternary sedimentary units overlying the metamorphic and granitic basement. An enhanced contrast between lithologic units was produced by the selective principal component analysis using the second components for the TM band pairs 5-7, 4-7 and 2-7 on a RGB false color composite. Through the reassignment and generalization of a supervised classification, we obtained 26 lithologic classes; thirteen Cenozoic volcanic rocks and intrusives, three pre-Cretaceous metamorphic units, and ten Plio-Quaternary sedimentary classes. The latter differ among each other by the source rocks and relative age. The resulting lithologic map of the supervised classification was evaluated using the confusion matrix and Kappa index (kappa). The map obtained a 79% confidence level, and kappa = 0.733, indicating that this map meets the evaluation criteria, and allow to us to recommend this methodology for geologic studies in desert areas.

J	Gregg, WW; Casey, NW				Gregg, WW; Casey, NW			Global and regional evaluation of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll data set	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll data set was compared to comprehensive archives of in situ chlorophyll data from NASA and NOAA. The global comparison indicated a root mean square (RMS) log error of 31%, with a coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.76, using 4168 data points where in situ and SeaWiFS data were coincident and collocated. RMS log error for open ocean (defined as bottom depth>200 in) was 27.7% with r(2) = 0.72, compared to 33% RMS log error and r(2) = 0.60 on the coasts, indicating a deterioration of quality of the SeaWiFS data set in coastal regions. All of the Pacific oceanographic basins generally showed very good agreement with SeaWiFS, as did the South Atlantic basin. However, poorer agreement was found in the Mediterranean/Black Seas, Equatorial Atlantic, and the Antarctic. Optical complexity arising from riverine inputs, Saharan dust, and anomalous oceanic constituents contributed to the differences observed in the Atlantic, where an overestimation by SeaWiFS occurred. The Antarctic indicated a pronounced negative bias, indicating an underestimation, especially for chlorophyll concentrations greater than about 0.15 mg m(-3). The results provide a comprehensive global and geographic analysis of the SeaWiFS data set, which will assist data users and policy makers in assessing the uncertainty of estimates of global and regional ocean chlorophyll and primary production.

Measurements by the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) during January 2001 to December 2003 show pronounced seasonal influence, with maximum dust loading during the premonsoon season (April-May). The distribution of AOD is found to be large with a mean value of 0.6 at 500 nm wavelength. The frequency distribution of the Angstrom parameter a reveals two modes (alpha < 1 dominant dusty condition and alpha > 1 urban aerosols). Diurnal variations of AOD, water vapor content (WVC), and Angstrom parameter show strong seasonal influence. Maximum variation of AOD is found during the monsoon season (presence of mixed types of aerosols), maximum variation of WVC is observed during the winter season (frequent changes in humidity and air pressure), and a shows maximum variations during the premonsoon (dust dominating the atmospheric optical conditions) season. The aerosol volume size distributions show two distinct modes, fine (geometric mean radii of 0.17 mum and standard deviation of 0.03) and coarse (geometric mean radii of 3.37 mum and standard deviation of 0.1), but during May-August (period of dust loading), a third mode (around 1-2 mum) appears because of hygroscopic growth of finer aerosols. The single-scattering albedo (SSA) is found to increase with wavelength in the presence of dust and shows a reverse trend in dust-free conditions. Refractive indices show the presence of dust as the main component during the premonsoon season and dominance of anthropogenic urban-industrial aerosols during the winter season, when the optical state of the atmosphere is more absorbing. The aerosol parameters show distinct interannual variations, with increasing aerosol burden over the region. Aerosol loading over Kanpur is found to be controlled by the regional climatology.

J	Norton, DW; Gaylord, AG				Norton, DW; Gaylord, AG			Drift velocities of ice floes in Alaska's northern Chukchi sea flaw zone: Determinants of success by spring subsistence whalers in 2000 and 2001	ARCTIC												By March each year, coast-influenced sea ice in Alaska's northern Chukchi Sea consists of the shorefast ice itself plus ice floes moving in a zone that extends from immediately beyond the shorefast ice to coherent pack ice, some 100 km farther offshore. Because westward-drifting polar pack ice encounters fewer landmasses (and less resistance from them) once it passes Point Barrow, a semipermanent polynya or flaw zone dominates coastal ice in this region. Inupiat residents use open water in flaw leads to hunt migrating bowhead whales from mid-April to early June. Although Inupiat hunters grasp the nature and importance of ice in motion beyond their horizon, the flaw zone has received less scientific attention than either shorefast ice or polar pack ice farther offshore. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery is a form of remote sensing recently made available that allows us to address ice movement at a spatial scale familiar to traditional hunters. SAR-tracked ice movements differed between 2000 and 2001, illustrating contrasts between adverse and optimal conditions for spring whaling at Barrow. Case studies of ice-floe accelerafions in the two contrasting seasons suggest that many variables influence ice motion. These include weather, seafloor topography, currents, sea-level changes, and events that occurred earlier during an annual accretion of ice. Adequate prediction of threats to ice integrity in the northern Chukchi Sea will require adjustments of our current concepts, including 1) recognizing the pervasive influence of the flaw zone; 2) replacing a focus on vessel safety in ice-dominated waters with an emphasis on ice integrity in high-energy environments; and 3) chronicling ice motions through coordinated ground observation and remote sensing of March-June events in future field studies.																	0004-0843					DEC	2004	57	4					347	362										WOS:000225795300004						
J	Blott, SJ; Pye, K				Blott, SJ; Pye, K			Morphological and sedimentological changes on an artificially nourished beach, Lincolnshire, UK	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Beach nourishment is increasingly seen as an appropriate management solution in areas which are experiencing beach erosion. Such a scheme has been implemented along the Lincolnshire coast between Skegness and Mablethorpe, on the east coast of England, since 1994. Poorly sorted, gravelly sandy sediment has been placed on the beaches in a gently sloping seaward profile to raise beach levels and protect the hard defences from wave attack. Grain size analysis of beach sediments, topographic profiling and remote sensing have been used to monitor the beach response. After nourishment, wave reworking caused a rapid redistribution of sediment over the beach profile during the succeeding weeks. Coarse sediment has remained on the beach berm, while finer sediment has migrated to the lower beach and sub-tidal zone. The berm face has correspondingly become steeper, producing more wave reflectance, and further scour and erosion of lower beach sediment, although there appears to have been little alongshore sediment transport. The most severe sediment loss has occurred around promontories and on the central portion of the convex-shaped coast which experiences greatest wave exposure. While the nourishment scheme has improved the standard of defence, further sediment losses could be reduced by nourishing the beach with a more natural size grading, promoting a flatter beach profile and increasing the dissipation of wave energy. Unless stabilization of the beach profile can be achieved, further periodic renourishment will be required to maintain relatively high beach levels.

Although this frontal feature is located close to the Kuroshio front, it is demonstrated that it is not a sea surface manifestation of an oceanic front, but rather of an atmospheric front extending over 800 km from an area of the Pacific Ocean northeast of Taiwan to the southern coast of Korea. It is a cold front moving in the southeast direction with a speed of approximately 45-50 km/hour and associated with a 40-km-wide rainband trailing the front. The Radarsat image, which has a resolution of 50 m, reveals fine-scale structures of the atmospheric front, in particular small-scale convective rain cells embedded in the front. Conclusion is drawn that accurate interpretation of frontal features in SAR images requires use of additional meteorological and remote sensing data and information.

J	Del Vecchio, R; Subramaniam, A				Del Vecchio, R; Subramaniam, A			Influence of the Amazon River on the surface optical properties of the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[ 1] The distribution of chromophoric-dissolved-organic-matter ( CDOM) was investigated in the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean ( WTNA) during the low and high flow periods of the Amazon River. A strong correlation was observed between in situ CDOM absorption at 490 nm and in situ diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm ( K490) during the high flow period ( ratio of 0.7). SeaWiFS monthly composites of K490 showed ( 1) very low values over most of the WTNA, with higher values restricted to the continental shelf during the low flow season and ( 2) higher K490 over much of the WTNA extending offshore to > 1000 km from the river mouth during the high flow season. The relative contribution to light absorption by particulate ( phytoplankton and detritus) and dissolved ( CDOM) materials was investigated at selected wavelengths. At 440 nm during the high flow period ( 1) CDOM dominated ( -70%) total light absorption closer to the river mouth; ( 2) phytoplankton and detritus dominated ( -40% each) absorption farther offshore but still within the Amazon plume; and ( 3) CDOM contributed -20%, phytoplankton >60%, and detritus -10% outside the plume. In situ data suggests a terrestrial source for the CDOM off the coast of South America during the high flow period with possible offshore local sinks ( photodegradation) as well as sources ( in situ production). The Amazon River strongly influences the optical properties of the WTNA at distances over 1000 km from the river mouth. Retrievals of phytoplankton biomass based on satellite ocean color data can be largely overestimated in the WTNA, if the contribution to light absorption by CDOM and detritus is not taken into account.

They were conducted between September 25 and October 12, 2001, off the coast of southern France over the Atlantic Ocean and over the Mediterranean Sea, respectively. During the intensive Field Radiation Experiment on Natural Cirrus and High-level clouds (FRENCH/DIRAC 2001), natural ice clouds were sampled from in situ and remote sensing measurements. On October 5 and 7, 2001, cirrus cloud decks were described by a complete data set acquired by: (i) in situ microphysical instruments onboard the TBM-700 aircraft: PMS probe, and Polar Nephelometer (ii) and downward-looking radiative instruments onboard the Mystere 20 aircraft: an infrared radiometer, a lidar, a visible imager with polarisation capabilities, and a middle infrared radiometer. Moreover, classical thermodynamical measurements were carried out onboard the Mystere 20. Mean microphysical characteristics of cirrus deck are derived from interpretation of remote sensing measurements. These properties are compared with those derived from in situ microphysical measurements in order to evaluate the radiative impact of natural cirrus clouds. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Almost all drainage basins in east Antarctica had average dH/dt values within +/-3.0 cm/year, whereas drainage basins in west Antarctica had substantial spatial variability with average dH/dt values ranging between -11 to +12 cm/year. The east Antarctic ice sheet had a five-year trend of 1 +/- 0.6 cm/year, where 13 out of the 14 basins had either a positive trend or a trend that was not significantly different than zero. The west Antarctic ice sheet had a five-year trend of -3.6 +/- 1.0 cm/year due largely to strong negative trends of around 10 cm/year for basins in Marie Byrd Land along the Pacific sector of the Antarctic coast. The continent as a whole had a five-year dH/dt trend of 0.4 +/- 0.4 cm/year. Finally, time series constructed for the Pine Island, Thwaites, DeVicq, and Land glaciers in west Antarctic showed five-year dH/dt trends from - 26 to - 135 cm/year that were significantly more negative than the average dH/dt trends in their respective basins. The strongly negative dH/dt values for these coastal glacier outlets are consistent with recently reported results indicating increased basal melting at these glaciers' grounding lines caused by ocean thermal forcing.																	0196-2892					NOV	2004	42	11					2437	2445		10.1109/TGRS.2004.836789								WOS:000225171900008

Monitoring SOD occurrence and spread is an on-going necessity in the state, Remote sensing methods have proved to be successful in map-ping and monitoring forest health and distribution when a sufficiently small ground resolution is used. Supervised, unsupervised, and "hybrid" classification methods were evaluated for their accuracy in discriminating dead and dying tree crowns from barb areas and the Surrounding forest mosaic utilizing 1-m ADAR imagery covering both tanoak/redwood forest and mixed hardwood stands. In both study areas the hybrid classifier significantly outperformed the other methods, producing low omission and commission errors among information classes. The hybrid method was then further refined by varying three parameters of the algorithm (iteration number, homogeneity threshold, and number of classes) and accuracy was assessed. The results demonstrate that while the hybrid method outperformed the other classifiers, the parameters that yielded highest accuracy for the algorithm differed between the two study areas. The use of a randomly selected subsample of training pixels was compared to the use of polygonal training areas'. and we found that polygonal training data provided better classification accuracies in both cases.

For this polynya, a new thin ice thickness algorithm is described that uses the ratio of the vertically and horizontally polarized Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) 37-GHz channels to retrieve the distribution of thicknesses and heat fluxes at a 25-km resolution. Comparison with clear-sky advanced very high resolution radiometer data shows that the SSM/I thicknesses and heat fluxes are valid for ice thicknesses less than 10-20 cm, and comparison with several synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images shows that the 10-cm ice SSM/I ice thickness contour approximately follows the SAR polynya edge. For the twelve winters of 1990-2001, the ice thicknesses and heat fluxes within the polynya are estimated from daily SSM/I data, then compared with field data and with estimates from other investigations. The results show the following: First, our calculated heat losses are consistent with 2 years of over-winter salinity and temperature field data. Second, comparison with other numerical and satellite estimates of the ice production shows that although our ice production per unit area is smaller, our polynya areas are larger, so that our ice production estimates are of the same order. Because our salinity forcing occurs over a larger area than in the other models, the oceanic response associated with our forcing will be modified.

J	Zhang, CD; Pennington, J				Zhang, CD; Pennington, J			African dry air outbreaks	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[ 1] Dry air outbreaks from Africa into the tropical Atlantic region are documented using daily layered precipitable water (LPW) data of satellite remote sensing for 1993 - 1997. A dry air outbreak is defined as an abrupt decrease in middle-troposphere ( 700 - 500 hPa) LPW that is greater than 1 mm d(-1) and remains below normal for at least two consecutive days in a reference box off the west coast of Africa. Pathways of individual dry air outbreaks thus identified are tracked both forward and backward in time. Dry air outbreaks intruding into the tropical Atlantic may originate from different source regions: the northern Atlantic Ocean, northern Africa, Sahel, and equatorial Africa. Some of these outbreaks can keep their identities up to 2 weeks, propagate across the Atlantic Ocean, and reach South America and the Caribbean Sea. Boreal summer is the overall peak season, with the majority of the outbreaks occurring north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In spring more outbreaks occur south of the ITCZ. Precipitation in the ITCZ tends to decrease during periods of the outbreaks in both spring and summer. Observed large-scale patterns of African dry air outbreaks are compared to known characteristics of African dust outbreaks. The results from this study suggest that African dry air outbreaks should and can be treated as prominent phenomena independent of African dust outbreaks. This study calls for systematic investigations on the similarities and differences between African dust and dry air outbreaks for a better understanding of their effects on weather and climate in the tropical Atlantic region.																	2169-897X					OCT 19	2004	109	D20							D20108	10.1029/2003JD003978								WOS:000224876600001

At present the current coastline extraction operations made through high-resolution aerial images consist of the visual photo-interpretation. This performance, which mainly finds cartographic applications, is rather slow in comparison to the possibilities of remote sensing and image processing techniques. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and testing of an innovative algorithm able to extract semiautomatically the coastline by means of remote sensed images. The approach proposed is based on fuzzy connectivity concepts and takes into account the coherence measure extracted from an InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) couple. The method combines uniformity features and the averaged image that represents a simple way of facing textural characteristics. The results are then quantitatively evaluated through the comparison with optical aerial images. An automatic procedure is proposed for the evaluation of results, which makes use of distance measurements between the satellite and the aerial result, even thouah there is a considerable difference in space resolution.

The simulations suggest that annual net uptake (net ecosystem production (NEP)) for the whole forested region (8.2 million hectares) was 13.8 Tg C (168 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), with the highest mean uptake in the Coast Range ecoregion (226 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), and the lowest mean NEP in the East Cascades (EC) ecoregion (88 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Carbon stocks totaled 2765 Tg C (33 700 g C m(-2)), with wide variability among ecoregions in the mean stock and in the partitioning above- and belowground. The flux of carbon from the land to the atmosphere that is driven by wildfire was relatively low during the late 1990s (similar to0.1 Tg C yr(-1)), however, wildfires in 2002 generated a much larger C source (similar to4.1 Tg C). Annual harvest removals from the study area over the period 1995-2000 were similar to5.5 Tg C yr(-1). The removals were disproportionately from the Coast Range, which is heavily managed for timber production (approximately 50% of all of Oregon's forest land has been managed for timber in the past 5 years). The estimate for the annual increase in C stored in long-lived forest products and land fills was 1.4 Tg C yr(-1). Net biome production (NBP) on the land, the net effect of NEP, harvest removals, and wildfire emissions indicates that the study area was a sink (8.2 Tg C yr(-1)). NBP of the study area, which is the more heavily forested half of the state, compensated for similar to52% of Oregon's fossil carbon dioxide emissions of 15.6 Tg C yr(-1) in 2000. The Biscuit Fire in 2002 reduced NBP dramatically, exacerbating net emissions that year. The regional total reflects the strong east-west gradient in potential productivity associated with the climatic gradient, and a disturbance regime that has been dominated in recent decades by commercial forestry.

J	Howari, FM				Howari, FM			Investigation of hydrocarbon pollution in the vicinity of United Arab Emirates coasts using visible and near infrared remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Influx of hydrocarbon contaminants to the coasts of United Arab Emirates is a serious environmental problem that threaten marine habitat. This paper presented two datasets to extract information on hydrocarbon pollution in marine environment utilizing visible to near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The datasets used were Landsat ETM+ images for Dubai and Fujirah coasts, and experimental visible to near infrared spectra of petroleum hydrocarbon in water. The experimental spectra were measured using GER 3700 spectroradiometer. The study applied image analyses techniques and radiance ratios on corrected Landsat ETM+ images in order to detect oil spills from tankers. The reported results demonstrated proper bands or channels with techniques useful for oil spill detection using images of Landsat ETM+. The study found that radiances extracted from visible and near infrared images are useful to assess the thickness of hydrocarbon spills. The study also found that areas of thicker oil are slightly brighter because they suppress the signal from the underlying seawater. The spectra of GER 3700 provide potentials for identification of possible contaminants as well as classification within a particular hydrocarbon category (e.g. aromatics). The presented techniques hold promise for rapid analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine environment.																	0749-0208					FAL	2004	20	4					1089	1095		10.2112/03-0023R.1								WOS:000225276900012

A correspondence function is established between in situ optical data and SPMC measurements obtained from three coastal surveys on the Kaw River, the Mahury estuary, and the adjacent continental shelf, respectively. This function is applied to SPOT satellite images to estimate SPMC distributions near the sea surface on five dates between 1998 and 2001. Two typical situations have been observed: the mud suspensions are generally confined near the coast by a strong north-westward coastal current, while in one case (SPOT scene of 2 July 200 1) the turbid plumes, probably resulted from the wave action on the mud banks, are directed seaward. SPMC varies from more than 300 mg l(-1) adjacent to the intertidal zone to a few mg l(-1) offshore. Turbid plumes are observed downstream, with regard to the Guyana Current, of small islands along the coast. Mud undulations are observed on the emergent surface of the mudflats, parallel to the crest waves and characterized by a wavelength of 200-1000 m. These structures are interpreted to form by wave action on the soft mudflat surface. Mangrove colonization of the mudflat follows these primary topographic structures. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Allison, MA; Lee, MT				Allison, MA; Lee, MT			Sediment exchange between Amazon mudbanks and shore-fringing mangroves in French Guiana	MARINE GEOLOGY					Symposium on the Guiana Coast and Other Mangrove-fringed Shorelines held at the 8th French Sedimentological Congress	NOV, 2001	Orleans, FRANCE	Assoc French Sedimentologists				Time-series remote sensing data, sediment cores, and water column profiles of fluid properties and suspended sediment concentration were utilized to examine the mechanisms and volumes of sediment exchange between the mangrove fringe and the coastal zone in French Guiana. Remote sensing estimates of sediment yield from mangrove shoreline erosion by wave attack during the similar to 30-year periods when offshore Amazon mudbanks are not adjacent to a 30-40 km long section of the shoreline are 6-23 million tons year(-1). Be-7, Cs-137, and Pb-210 inventories in sediment cores from inner (< 5 m water depth) mudbank areas suggest the mangrove erosion occurs primarily during the January-April period of high wave energy, and is responsible for the bulk of sediment deposition on the leading edge of the mudbank. Remote sensing estimates of shoreline accretion associated with onshore flux of sediment from a mudbank are also large (8-26 million tons year(-1)). Radiotracer-generated strata age relationships indicate that the lower intertidal zone of the leading (depositional) edge of the mudbank is a relict surface, suggesting the offshore mudbank is decoupled from the shoreline. Water column profiles and radiochemical signatures point to fluid mud suspensions (10-400 g l(-1)) as the primary mechanism for delivering sediment across the relict intertidal zone to create the accretion at the shoreline. If the estimates of sediment volume involved in shoreline accretion and erosion in the studied area are extrapolated along the entire 1400-km-long Guianas coastline possessing offshore mudbanks, the annual exchange of sediment to and from the mangrove fringe is at least equivalent to the average input of new sediment from the Amazon.

A case study based on remote sensing data analyses and field surveys	MARINE GEOLOGY					Symposium on the Guiana Coast and Other Mangrove-fringed Shorelines held at the 8th French Sedimentological Congress	NOV, 2001	Orleans, FRANCE	Assoc French Sedimentologists				The mobile mud banks, several kilometres wide and about 30 km long, which form the sedimentary environment of the coast of the Guianas are a consequence of the huge particulate discharge of the Amazon. These mud banks shift towards the northwest, influenced by the combined action of accretion and erosion, a process also affected by periodic variability. Because of this movement, the coastline is unstable and continuously changing. Such changes determine the structure and composition of mangrove forests, the only type of vegetation adapted to this dynamic environment. The objectives of this study were to identify coastal changes that took place over the last 50 years, and to relate them to natural processes of turnover and replenishment of mangrove forests. These objectives have been achieved through a combination of remote sensing techniques (aerial photographs and SPOT satellite images) and field surveys in the area of the Sinnamary Estuary, French Guiana. Ground data were collected in representative mangrove forest stands, chosen as a function of their growth stages and their structural features, from pioneer and young stages to adult, mixed and declining formations. The coastline changes and the mangrove dynamics over the 1951-1999 period are analyzed through production of synthetic digital maps, showing an alternation of net accretion (1951-1966) and erosion periods (1966-1991), followed by the present accretion phase. Based on this structural, functional and historic, information, a global scenario of mangrove forest dynamics is proposed, including a model of forest development, forest gap processes and sedimentological dynamics. The results of this research are discussed within the context of regional (coastal Amazonian area) and global climate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A number of species were strongly associated with one cover type and negatively with others. The major variation was for preferences for covers in upland or lowland parts of the region. Other distinct preferences for some species were covers such as those at the coast whilst a number of common species showed no strong preference for any cover variable. The synthesis of ground beetle species distribution and satellite-derived cover data is discussed in relation to environmental assessment and change.																	0906-7590					AUG	2004	27	4					417	426		10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.03757.x								WOS:000221533100002						
J	Cushman, SA; McGarigal, K				Cushman, SA; McGarigal, K			Hierarchical analysis of forest bird species-environment relationships in the Oregon Coast Range	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Species in biological communities respond to environmental variation simultaneously across a range of organizational levels. Accordingly, it is important to quantify the effects of environmental factors at multiple levels on species distribution and abundance. Hierarchical methods that explicitly separate the independent and confounded influences of environmental variation across several levels of organization are powerful tools for this task. Our study used a hierarchical approach to partition explained variance in an Oregon Coast Range bird community among plot-, patch-, and landscape-level factors. We used a series of partial canonical ordinations to decompose species-environment relationships across these levels of organization to test four hypotheses about the importance of environmental control over community structure. We found that plot-level factors were better predictors of community structure than patch- or landscape-level factors. In addition, although landscape-level variables contributed substantial independent explanatory power, there was little evidence that patch-level environmental variability provided additional explanation of community structure beyond that provided by plot- and landscape-level factors. At higher levels of the hierarchical analysis, we found that, among plot-level factors, vegetation cover type was as powerful a predictor of community structure as detailed floristics, and more powerful than vegetation structure. At the landscape level, we found that landscape composition and configuration both provided substantial independent explanatory power, with landscape composition being the better overall predictor. Our results have a number of implications for sampling, analysis, and conservation. For example, misleading results could be obtained by studies conducted at a single organizational level. Also, the high degree of confounding among several levels of our analysis suggests that there is a lack of independence between the influences of environmental structure at different organizational levels. Due to this confounding, our results suggest that patch-based studies of forest-bird ecological relationships in the Oregon Coast Range may be equivocal. In addition, the power of mapped cover class as a plot-level predictor variable suggests that coarse-filter, multiscale approaches utilizing remote sensing and GIS may be nearly as effective at predicting local patterns as expensive field surveys of habitat conditions at the plot level, and more effective at predicting patterns continuously across large regions.																	1051-0761					AUG	2004	14	4					1090	1105		10.1890/03-5131								WOS:000223156600012

Based on the satellite data, we observed that the three small meanders are formed by different processes: the triggering and growth of these meanders are caused by a cyclonic eddy propagating from the Kuroshio recirculation region or Kuroshio front meanders traveling from the East China Sea. Investigation of the two small meanders in 1994 and 1995 spring that are captured by the WHP observation showed quite consistent hydrographic features. On the nearshore side of the meandering Kuroshio, a countercurrent appears, associated with vertically uniform upward lifts of the isopycnals from sea surface to bottom at the boundary between the countercurrent and the Kuroshio. In the countercurrent region, the waters in the density ranges of the North Pacific subtropical mode water (NPSTMW) and the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) are more saline and less saline than typical waters that the Kuroshio carries in a non-small meander state, respectively. There are indications that high-salinity NPSTMW and low-salinity NPIW distributed off the Kuroshio was supplied to the countercurrent region. In the meandering Kuroshio flow, while there is no notable change in properties around the NPSTMW density range, salinity of the NPIW is significantly higher than that carried by the Kuroshio in a non-small meander state, but not higher than that in the Kuroshio at the Tokara Strait, which suggests that saline NPIW from the Tokara Strait, less mixed with low-salinity NPIW off the Kuroshio, may be carried by the meandering Kuroshio.

J	Misra, KS; Bhutani, R; Sonp, R				Misra, KS; Bhutani, R; Sonp, R			Seismogeology of the Kutch and adjoining region, with special reference to 26th January 2001 earthquake in the vicinity of Bachau, Gujarat	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Seismogeological features in Kutch and adjoining region are mapped by using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) images. These features included major faults with neotectonic movements, lithological units, statistical data of past seismic events and aftershock study to prepare various thematic maps. Studies suggest that faults identified as lineament zones are parallel to major geological structures such as Kutch rift, Cambay structure, Narmada-Tapti tectonic zone and Kukdi-Ghod lineament zone. Drilling data indicates that subsidence along the vertical boundary faults is continuing since Mesozoic Era. Geomorphological evidences such as relief changes along straight lines, inundation patterns, extent of salt pans and dune fields etc. suggest that the subsidence is also continuing presently. Regional studies in western India have indicated that these faults outline different crustal blocks which are moving either in vertical or strike-slip direction in relation to each other. Higher seismicity is recorded in areas where lineament zones are intersecting each other. The study has revealed that obstruction of horizontally moving block by vertically moving block causes nucleation of stresses and sudden release of these stresses generally results in an earthquake. Epicentral plots have also indicated that seismicity is conspicuously confined along faults related to major geological structures. The epicenters of all five major devastating earthquakes including the 26(th) January 2001 earthquake are located very close to the intersection of Kutch Mainland fault, and NW-SE trending faults parallel to Cambay structure. An interesting relationship has also emerged between the isoseismal lines due to the 26(th) January 2001 earthquake and fabric of mapped faults. These lines show remarkable parallelism with the faults, related either to the Cambay structure or Kutch rift of the region. Preferential activation of faults parallel to Cambay structure seems to have caused damage along the linear zone passing through Ahmedabad and along the coast in the vicinity of Bharuch, Surat, Navasari and Billimora. The epicenters of aftershock following 26(th) January earthquake are also plotted on a map,depicting the faults. It has been found from that all the aftershocks of magnitude > 5 and 70 % of those ranging between magnitude 3 to 5 are confined in an area resembling a horseshoe pattern with a pointed end towards NE. Other 20% of aftershocks of magnitude 3 to 5 are enclosed within almost parallel boundary. Only 10% are found beyond this limiting line. Furthermore, 50% of recorded aftershocks have taken place within first week of the main event and this study has revealed that the characteristic pattern of aftershock activity could emerge with only one week data. A funnel shaped seismogeological model is proposed after the detailed study of major faults and seismic events in western India mainly covered by the Deccan volcanics. The widest area forming the rim is characterized by subterranean sounds and ground shaking at shallower depths. This is followed by a zone of periodic swarm type of seismic activity, marked by low magnitude (2-4) earthquakes. Less common, medium magnitude (4.1-6) earthquakes occur at depth range of 4 to 9 km. High magnitude (> 6) earthquakes are rare and generally occur at focal depth of 9 to 35 km and occupy the central part of the area.																	0016-7622					AUG	2004	64	2					153	164										WOS:000223160900005						
J	Melville, WK; Felizardo, FC; Matusov, P				Melville, WK; Felizardo, FC; Matusov, P			Wave slope and wave age effects in measurements of electromagnetic	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We present measurements of Ku band electromagnetic ( EM) bias made for 2 months from a platform in Bass Strait off the southeast coast of Australia during the austral winter of 1992. EM bias, epsilon, the difference between the electromagnetic and true mean sea levels, was measured using Doppler scatterometers. Linear wave theory was used to relate the Doppler signal to the surface displacement, giving simultaneous coincident backscatter and wave measurements, including significant wave height, H-s. On the basis of dimensional reasoning, we suggest that the usual inhomogeneous correlations of the normalized bias beta = epsilon/H-s with the 10 m wind speed, U-10, and H-s may be improved by correlating the data with nondimensional variables, including a characteristic wave slope, s, and wave age, c/U-10, where c is a characteristic phase speed of the surface waves. Using both polynomial correlations and optimal estimation techniques to fit the data, we find that the standard error of the fit is reduced by similar to50% when the dimensionless variables are used. We find that the dependence of the EM bias on the wave slope is consistent with earlier tower-based measurements and the theory of short-wave modulation by longer waves. We discuss the implications of these results for operational implementation of EM bias algorithms based on wave slope and wave age.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL 27	2004	109	C7							C07018	10.1029/2002JC001708								WOS:000223190900001

Cleveland, Alaska	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union	DEC 10-14, 2001	SAN FRANCISCO, CA	Amer Geophys Union				Satellite data were the primary source of information for the eruption of Mt. Cleveland, Alaska on 19 February, and 11 and 19 March 2001. Multiple data sets were used pre-, syn- and post-eruption to mitigate the hazard and determine an eruption chronology. The 19 February eruption was the largest of the three, resulting in a volcanic cloud that formed an arc over 1000 km long, moved to the NE across Alaska and was tracked using satellite data over more than a 50-h period. The volcanic cloud was "concurrently" detected on the GOES, AVHRR and MODIS data at various times and their respective signals compared. All three sensors detected a cloud that had a very similar shape and position but there were differences in their areal extent and internal structural detail. GOES data showed the largest volcanic cloud in terms of area, probably due to its oblique geometry. MODIS bands 31 and 32, which are comparable to GOES and AVHRR thermal infrared wavelengths, were the least effective single channels at detecting the volcanic cloud of those investigated (MODIS bands 28, 29, 31 and 32). MODIS bands 28 and 29 detected the largest volcanic clouds that could easily be distinguished from weather clouds. Of the split-window data, MODIS bands 29 minus band 32 detected the largest cloud, but the band 31 minus band 32 data showed the volcanic cloud with the most internal structural detail. The Puff tracking model accurately tracked the movement, and predicted the extent and shape of this complex cloud even into areas beyond satellite detection. Numerous thermal anomalies were also observed during the eruption on the twice-daily AVHRR data and the high spatial-resolution Landsat data. The high-resolution Radarsat data showed that the AVHRR thermal anomalies were due to lava and debris flow features and a newly formed fan along the west coast of the island. Field observations and images from a hand-held Forward Looking Infrared Radiometer (FLIR) showed that the flow features were a a lava, debris flows and a warm debris fan along the west coast. Real-time satellite data were the primary tool used to monitor the eruption, track changes and to mitigate hazards. High-resolution data, even though coverage is infrequent, were critical in helping to identify volcanic processes and to compile an eruption chronology. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Approximately 70% of China's energy consumption is covered by coal. At the same time, it is estimated that about 20 Mt of coal are being burnt in uncontrolled coal fires in China each year. Because these coal fires are spread out over the whole northern part of the country, stretching from Xinjiang province in the West to the Pacific coast in the East, it is extremely difficult to keep an overview of the development of known fires as well as of newly developing ones. Satellite remote sensing offers a powerful tool to observe and monitor such large regions; however, special methods and techniques have to be derived to accurately detect and monitor near surface coal seam fires. In this paper, an integrated satellite remote sensing approach is described allowing detection and monitoring of near surface coal seam fires by observing subtle land surface changes induced by the fires. These changes include thermal surface anomalies, changes in spectral surface characteristics as well as land subsidence caused by the fires. The methods comprise the radar interferometric, generation of digital elevation models (DEMs) for geometric referencing and orthorectification of satellite imagery, dedicated analysis of thermal satellite data (daytime and nighttime), and multispectral analysis of land surface properties as well as the mapping of small-scale land subsidence by means of differential radar interferometry. It is shown how different satellite remote sensing methods can be synergistically combined to detect, analyze, and monitor near surface coal seam fires in and or semiarid areas of North China. First results show the successful application of the methods and, furthermore, a comparison with ground measurements is given. While thermal and optical analysis of the fires can be considered robust methods, the assessment of coal seam fires using differential radar interferometry still has to be further developed in order to serve as a reliable analysis and monitoring tool. Within this work, a special focus is given to aspects of automation of the coal fire detection and analysis by means of satellite remote sensing in order to allow fire mapping in large areas with only minimal operator interaction.

Mangroves colonized the area around 6820 BP, as sea level rose following the last glacial maximum and a variable thickness of Holocene sands, muds and peats (generally similar to1 to >3.8 m thick) were deposited over the pre-transgression land surface. An analysis of a time series of photographs covering the period from 1946 to 2001 has revealed major changes in the distribution of mangroves in the area resulting from development-induced changes in the local hydrodynamic regime and clearance for aquaculture. Mangroves covered 117.3 ha in the study area in 1946 and were actively advancing over the coastal mudflats until 1980. Despite the addition of 6.24 ha from mangrove colonization, the total area covered by mangroves was reduced by similar to50% by 1980 due to clearance for aquaculture. Following 1980, a reduction in sediment supply possibly due to the construction of the Kranji Dam, immediately cast of the study area, led to the initiation of erosion along much of the coastline, with the mangrove fringe having retreated by up to 50 m in 2001. Establishment of the wetland reserve in 1992 enabled the partial regeneration of mangroves in the area to 86.8 ha, 25% less than in 1946. Three areas of undisturbed old growth mangroves >55 years in age have been identified and are considered to be of high conservation value. Two of these areas are within the current boundaries of the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, but are located along coastal areas that are undergoing severe erosion. The third area is located in the south of the study area, protected from coastal erosion, but outside the current nature reserve boundary and hence is susceptible to loss as a result of future development. This third area is possibly the oldest undisturbed fragment of mangrove forest on mainland Singapore. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The correlation statistics can be significantly improved by employing the Size Weighted Aerosol Index (SWAI) defined as the product of the AOD times the Angstrom exponent, showing a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.68 with RMSE = 0.072 for single pixels and R = 0.75 with RMSE = 0.065 for the 3 x 3 windows. We have checked the reliability of the POLDER inversion scheme by comparing the aerosol polarized radiance (i.e., corrected for ground and molecular contributions) with AOD sunphotometer measurements at 670 nm for five different sites (R = 0.36). The MODIS capability for monitoring seasonal and long-term aerosol dynamics is assessed by analyzing the 8-day MODIS AOD product at 550 nm (Level-3 product). The retrieved AOD accuracy is variable depending on sites and observed AOD dynamic range; for the overall database (N = 1200 points), R = 0.37, RMSE=0.17 and Bias = +0.088. We illustrate how satellite-derived AOD images can be used to monitor spatial and temporal aerosol dynamics at the regional scale (anthropogenic pollution events over the North-Eastern American coast) and at the continental scale (dust storm events and mean seasonal background atmospheric aerosol loading). It appears that aerosol mapping from satellite images is still difficult over North America; particularly at high latitudes where AOD variations are generally relatively small. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ryu, JH; Na, YH; Won, JS; Doerffer, R				Ryu, JH; Na, YH; Won, JS; Doerffer, R			A critical grain size for Landsat ETM+ investigations into intertidal sediments: a case study of the Gomso tidal flats, Korea	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing combined with a field survey is an effective method of monitoring intertidal sediments. The 0.0625 mm grain size has long been used as a critical one, and the percentage of grains larger than the critical grain size has been widely used to classify tidal flat deposits. The remote sensing community has applied this principle to interpret optical remote sensing images without a detailed understanding of the correlation between grain size and the remotely sensed data. This paper aims to establish a new critical grain size effective for Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM +) data. The influence of water content and topography on the spectral reflectance is also investigated. Tests were undertaken in the Gomso Bay tidal flats, Korea. Critical grain size tests were conducted for particles measuring 0.0625 mm, 0.125 mm, and 0.25 mm, which revealed that a critical grain size of 0.25 mm rather than 0.0625 mm was a more effective standard. Surface water and interstitial water content were considered for their influence on optical reflectance, as Landsat ETM + imaging is more responsive of the former. The 5, 7, and 4 ETM + bands responded to surface water cover with a correlation coefficient of 0.90, 0.82, and 0.63, respectively. The interstitial water content related well to grain size with correlation coefficients of -0.59 for 0.0625 mm, -0.62 for 0.125 mm, and -0.81 for 0.25 mm. A linear model was derived for the ETM + band 4 data based on a 0.25 mm critical grain size whist employing the principal component analysis method. The R-2 value obtained was 0.85. Sediments with grain sizes less than 20% of 0.25 mm, or larger grains, did not fit the model. Anomalies were interpreted as the effect of local topographic features. Employing Landsat data for intertidal sediment studies is indicated using the ETM + band 4 and a target critical grain size of 0.25 mm. Surface sediment classification based on remotely sensed data must circumspectly consider an effective critical grain size, water content, local topography, and intertidal structures.

With the availability of remotely sensed ocean color imagery from SeaWiFS, a regional algorithm that compensates for the scattering of sediments in coastal waters can be applied to accurately estimate chlorophyll concentrations in coastal areas of Florida. Chlorophyll anomalies of 1 mug l-(1) based on a 60-day running mean are currently used along the Panhandle and west Florida coast, to detect K. brevis blooms exceeding 100,000 cells l(-1). This is the first step in an early warning system to forecast K. brevis blooms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A retrospective analysis was performed on imagery acquired from 1999, 2000 and 2001 to determine the accuracy of this technique in detecting K. brevis blooms in this region. During the K. brevis bloom season from August through April, chlorophyll anomalies accurately identified K. brevis blooms along the Florida Panhandle, from Tampa Bay to Cape Romano and Key West >83% of the time. Frequent chlorophyll anomalies were falsely observed in the spring and early summer, prior to the beginning of the K. brevis bloom season. Areas rich in colored dissolved and particulate matter were prone to anomalies that falsely identify K. brevis blooms; however, blooms rarely originate in these areas.

J	Sarangi, RK; Chauhan, P; Nayak, SR				Sarangi, RK; Chauhan, P; Nayak, SR			Detection and monitoring of Trichodesmium blooms in the coastal waters off Saurashtra coast, India using IRS-P4 OCM data	CURRENT SCIENCE												Trichodesmium blooms have been observed in the coastal waters off Saurashtra coast, Gujarat, India using Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-P4 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data. Bloom-forming features were identified using false colour composites of channels 8, 6 and 5 (865, 670, 555 nm). Several bloom features of Trichodesmium like spiral eddies, stripes, slicks and parallel bands were detected in satellite images during 29 April to 7 May 2002. A strong backscattering signal was observed in the near-infrared band of OCM data, indicating the surface manifestation of Trichodesmium bloom. The chlorophyll images have been analysed during the bloom period; overestimation of pigments has been observed and the bloom patches appear darker. Subramaniam's protocol for Trichodesmium bloom study has been evaluated utilizing IRS-P4 OCM data for the waters off Saurashtra coast, and appeared to be relevant in detection by ocean colour remote sensing. The in situ information confirmed the presence of the bloom as coastal waters turned dark brown in colour with an appearance of sawdust spray.																	0011-3891					JUN 25	2004	86	12					1636	1641										WOS:000222454500020						
J	Yankovsky, AE; Lemeshko, EM; Ilyin, YP				Yankovsky, AE; Lemeshko, EM; Ilyin, YP			The influence of shelfbreak forcing on the alongshelf penetration of the Danube buoyant water, Black sea	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The buoyancy-driven coastal current propagating along the western coast in the Black Sea is forced by the discharge of several major European rivers including the Danube, Dnepr and South Bug. In this study, we present observational evidence that the buoyant water alongshelf penetration is strongly affected by shelfbreak mesoscale features associated with the Rim Current dynamics. The Rim Current is a major element of the Black Sea general circulation, typically following isobaths over the upper-to-middle slope. Two hydrographic surveys conducted in 1992 and 1994 have been chosen among available archive data for the detailed analysis. In both years, though Danube buoyant discharge was similar prior to the beginning of shipboard observations (varying around 7000 m(3) s(-1)), the buoyant water exhibited very different downstream (that is, in the direction of Kelvin wave) penetration. In 1992, it spread all the way around the southwestern corner of the Black Sea basin and then further eastward past the Bosporus Strait. In contrast, its downstream penetration was blocked in 1994 and buoyant water did not even reach Cape Kaliakra on the Bulgarian coast. This difference was related to the sheltbreak processes. In 1992, the cyclonic meander of the Rim Current merged with the coastal buoyant water thus promoting its advection from Cape Kaliakra downstream. In 1994, a strong anticyclone in the southwestern corner of the Black Sea completely blocked the propagation of a buoyancy-driven current past Cape Kaliakra. In addition, another anticyclone in the northwestern part of the sea advected buoyant water offshore to the central area of the northwestern shelf. The positions of anticyclonic eddies during a period of observations was confirmed by remote sensing data. As these and other examples indicate, coastal buoyancy driven currents can be effectively blocked and dispersed offshore by the shelfbreak anticyclones if the shelf width allows their interaction with buoyant water. Previous observational studies suggested an upwelling-favorable wind as the principal forcing agent that arrested downstream penetration of buoyancy-driven coastal currents. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Erkkila, A; Kalliola, R				Erkkila, A; Kalliola, R			Patterns and dynamics of coastal waters in multi-temporal satellite images: support to water quality monitoring in the Archipelago Sea, Finland	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The Archipelago Sea in the northern Baltic is a coastal region with A highly dynamic water flow regime, where the need for a methodology to monitor water quality accurately is encountered. In order to contribute to the development of an appropriate strategy to meet this need, the dynamics of the surface waters in the region were analysed using data from six Landsat TM/ETM + images from the late 1990s. Single images were enhanced by principal component transformation and multi-temporal image combination was based on unsupervised classification. The visual patterns discernible in the single images as well as the classification result of the multi-temporal data were compared with the reference data from long-term water quality analyses (Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll-a). The satellite images confirmed dynamic surface flow patterns in the region, indicating gradual and abrupt gradients in water quality, flow directions and forms. These patterns suggest short-term variability in the surface water quality within the region, presenting a challenge for water monitoring. The average Secchi depths increased gradually from the mainland coast until ca. 3-5 in near the open sea. The spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a was found to be more homogeneous, ca. 2-4 mug l(-1). The importance of evaluating the location of an in situ sampling site in relation to the surrounding hydrographic realm is pronounced in regions where field sampling and other monitoring methods remain insufficient in their ability to reflect water quality patterns credibly. In such areas, accurate and cost-effective water quality monitoring and forecasting require an integrated monitoring system, consisting of space and airborne surveillance, field surveys and hydrodynamic modelling.

J	Worden, JR; Bowman, KW; Jones, DB				Worden, JR; Bowman, KW; Jones, DB			Two-dimensional characterization of atmospheric profile retrievals from limb sounding observations	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												Limb sounders measure atmospheric radiation that is dependent on atmospheric temperature and constituents that have a radial and angular distribution in Earth-centered coordinates. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of a limb retrieval to radial and angular distributions of trace gas concentrations, we perform and characterize one-dimensional (vertical) and two-dimensional (radial and angular) atmospheric profile retrievals. Our simulated atmosphere for these retrievals is a distribution of carbon monoxide (CO), which represents a plume off the coast of south-cast Asia. Both the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) limb retrievals are characterized by evaluating their averaging kernels and error covariances on a radial and angular grid that spans the plume. We apply this 2D characterization of a limb retrieval to a comparison of the 2D retrieval with the 1D (vertical) retrieval. By characterizing a limb retrieval in two dimensions the location of the air mass where the retrievals are most sensitive can be determined. For this test case the retrievals are most sensitive to the CO concentrations about 2degrees latitude in front of the tangent point locations. We find the information content for the 2D retrieval is an order of magnitude larger and the degrees of freedom is about a factor of two lareer than that of the 1D retrieval primarily because the 2D retrieval can estimate angular distributions of CO concentrations. This 2D characterization allows the radial and angular resolution as well as the degrees of freedom and information content to be computed for these limb retrievals. We also use the 2D averaging kernel to develop a strategy for validation of a limb retrieval with an in situ measurement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Marghany, M				Marghany, Maged			VELOCITY BUNCHING MODEL FOR MODELLING WAVE SPECTRA ALONG EAST COAST OF MALAYSIA	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper presents the application of the velocity bunching model to detect the wave spectra pattern. We have developed the azimuth cut-off model which is estimated from the velocity bunching theory to model out the significant wave height. The velocity bunching model utilized two ERS-1 images (First European Remote Sensing Satellite). These two ERS-1 images have been acquired with the different monsoon periods. Several steps have been used to simulate the significant wave height from the velocity bunching model, these were: the real ocean wave spectra simulated from the in situ wave data, and the SAR wave spectra, extracted by applying two-dimensional Fourier transform (2-DFFT). Finally, the significant wave height was estimated based on the azimuth cut-off arising from the velocity bunching model. Two hypotheses were established in modelling the wave spectra from the SAR images: (i) azimuth cut-off was based on velocity bunching, which has been used to model the significant wave height with high accuracy, and (ii) velocity bunching model has been used to map the SAR wave spectra into ocean wave spectra. In the present study, a specific ERS-1 images of the South China Sea has been considered. No significant differences were found between the velocity-bunching model and ocean wave spectra model where ERS-1 wave spectra has been found to be dominated by the azimuth fall-off effects. Furthermore, the velocity bunching model produced wave spectra pattern approximately closed to the real ocean wave compared to the SAR wave spectra. The highest rate of r(2) (0.69) occurred when the significant wave height increased. It has been concluded that the velocity bunching model could be used as the best fit model for estimating the significant wave height traveled along the azimuth direction.																	0255-660X					JUN	2004	32	2					185	198		10.1007/BF03030875								WOS:000208265500007

Satellite remote sensing can provide spatially explicit information on land cover, standage class, and harvesting. Carbon-cycle process models coupled to regional climate databases can provide information on potential rates of production and related rates of decomposition. The integration of remote sensing and modeling thus produces spatially explicit information on carbon storage and flux. This integrated approach was employed to compare carbon flux for the period 1992-1997 over two 165-km(2) areas in western Oregon. The Coast Range study area was predominately private land managed for timber production, whereas the West Cascades study area was predominantly public land that was less productive but experienced little harvesting in the 1990s. In the Coast Range area, 17% of the land base was harvested between 1991 and 2000. Much of the area was in relatively young, productive-age classes that simulations indicate are a carbon sink. Mean annual harvest removals from the Coast Range were greater than mean annual net ecosystem production. On the West Cascades study area, a relatively small proportion (< 1%) of the land was harvested and the area as a whole was accumulating carbon. The spatially and temporally explicit nature of this approach permits identification of mechanisms underlying land base carbon flux.

J	Johnson, LF; Pierce, LL				Johnson, LF; Pierce, LL			Indirect measurement of leaf area index in California North Coast vineyards	HORTSCIENCE												The performance of the LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA) for indirect measurement of leaf area index (LAI) was evaluated in vineyards of California's North Coast region. Twelve plots were established, representing vineyards of differing trellis, cultivar, and planting density. Mean LAI ranged from 0.5- to 2.25-m(2) leaf area per m(2) ground area by direct measurement (defoliation). Indirect LAI derived by a standard two-azimuth, diagonal-transect measurement protocol was significantly related to direct LAI (r(2) = 0.78, P less than or equal to 0.001). However, the PCA underestimated direct LAI by about a factor of two. Narrowing the instrument's conical field of view from 148degrees to 56degrees increased indirect LAI by 13% to 60% in vertically trained plots, but still resulted in substantial underestimation of direct values. Use of this PCA protocol in vineyards should therefore be accompanied by direct measurement for calibration purposes.																	0018-5345					APR	2004	39	2					236	238										WOS:000220973800005

The dynamic processes forming these patterns are driven by the local wind. Distinct wind directions induce typical features in several regions of the M-V coast. The processes considered are the distribution of Oder river water in the Pomeranian Bight, the upwelling off Hiddensee and off the coast of the Mecklenburg Bight including the Warnow river outflow, and the special dynamic regime in Lubeck Bay. In the Pomeranian Bight, a strong relation was found between the wind and transport direction of river water which was also applied to interpret the distribution of inorganic and organic pollutants. During easterly winds, different upwelling cells arise with the highest intensity in the Hiddensee area. The cells merge by increasing wind velocity. Lubeck Bay is mainly excluded from water exchange during the dominant wind directions. The first results of this systematic remote sensing study along the entire coast of M-V are summarized and will be continued to support the coastal monitoring programme of regional authorities.

It consists of three different spectrometers in the visible/near-infrared spectral region with 18 channels. The IRS-P3 mission is focused on the remote sensing of case 2 water, particularly the derivation of different water constituents in coastal waters. Due to the more complex spectral behaviour of case 2 water, a new methodological approach was developed which works directly with satellite measured top-of-atmosphere radiance and accounts for the correlation of the different water constituents as well as for the spectral shape. This paper gives an overview of the mission, the scientific goals and the development and improvement of the retrieval algorithms. The potential of the algorithm is demonstrated and examples of selected European coasts are shown. Derived maps of water constituents are presented.																	0143-1161					APR	2004	25	7-8					1415	1421		10.1080/01431160310001592382								WOS:000189343600025

The data were used to quantify the impact of coastal upwelling on near-shore bulk apparent (AOP) and inherent (IOP) optical properties. There was good qualitative agreement between the AOPs and IOPs in space and time. The measured IOPs were used as inputs to the Hydrolight radiative transfer model (RTE). Estimated spectral AOPs from the RTE were strongly correlated (generally R-2>0.80) to measured AOPs. If optical closure between in-water measurements was achieved then the RTE was used to construct the spectral remote sensing reflectance. The modelled remote sensing reflectances were compared to satellite-derived reflectance estimates from four different algorithms. Quantitative agreement between the satellite-measured and in-water modelled remote sensing reflectance was good but results were variable between the different models. The strength of the correlation and spectral consistency was variable with space and time. Correlations were strongest in clear offshore waters and lowest in the near-shore turbid waters. In the near-shore waters, the correlation was strongest for blue wavelengths (400-555 nm) but lower for the red wavelengths of light.

To this end a dedicated field experiment was carried out off the French Mediterranean coast. In parallel with the HF radar probing, the independent simultaneous measurements of the subsurface shear profile were obtained by means of acoustic Doppler current profiler mounted on a floating platform, whose position was monitored by GPS. The comparison shows a fairly good agreement of the results ( the discrepancy does not exceed 15%) and suggests a higher accuracy of the HF probing.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 1	2004	109	C4							C04003	10.1029/2003JC002025								WOS:000220745100003

However, evidence for this increase from ground observations is very limited. In the current study, we used a time series data set for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the growing season (April to October) from 1982 to 1999, along with historical climate data, to analyse year to year variations in vegetation activity and to explore the relationship between the growing season NDVI and climatic variables in China. Vegetation activity, as measured by NDVI, increased in 81% of the study area, with significant gains in 27% of the region. The magnitude of the mean growing season NDVI for the 1980s and the 1990s was not significantly different. The increase in NDVI corresponded to an increase in temperature on the national scale, while regional variations in NDVI appeared to be related to precipitation. The NDVI trend showed a large spatial heterogeneity, possibly associated with changes in regional climate, land use and vegetation type. Our study suggests that agricultural practices caused an increase in NDVI in some regions, and rapid urbanization on the east coast resulted in a sharp decrease in NDVI since the 1980s.

J	Levin, N; Ben-Dor, E; Karnieli, A				Levin, N; Ben-Dor, E; Karnieli, A			Topographic information of sand dunes as extracted from shading effects using Landsat images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Topographic variations affect the reflectance properties of the Earth's surface and are often removed in remote sensing studies, especially when significant terrain variations exist. In this study, however, we show that shading effects assessed by Landsat can be treated as a signal that stores important topographic information, especially when the spectral characteristics of a surface are homogenous. The coastal transverse dunes of the Ashdod area, and the desert linear dunes of Nizzana. (both located in Israel), were selected to investigate the abovementioned idea. The dune heights in these areas are 10 m on average (relative to their surroundings) and have maximum slopes of 33degrees. An innovative method for extracting slope, aspect, and height data for sand dunes using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images was developed, based on the regularity and periodicity of dunes' landscapes. Using two Landsat images representing different sun zenith and azimuth angles, reflectance values of each image were converted to cos(i) values (i=incident angle between the surface normal and the solar beam radiation), applying histogram matching methods. The slope and aspect of each pixel were determined as those that give the best prediction of the observed value of cos(i). Height profiles were then extracted, using simple trigonometric relationships. The accuracies of heights and slopes along selected profile lines were to the order of 1 m and 3degrees, respectively (at a spatial resolution of 15 in). Best results were obtained when the images included one from the summer and the other from the winter, corresponding to maximum difference in solar zenith and azimuth angles. Errors in heights were attributed to surface heterogeneity (e.g., presence of biogenic soil crusts in the rainy season), geometric correction errors, cast shadows, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effects. Comparison to Advanced Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 3D information showed that the proposed method is better in representing the topographic variation of the area than the digital elevation model (DEM) produced by ASTER.

The HAB had high chlorophyll a ( Chl a) concentrations ( up to 4.5 mg m-3) occurring -200 km off the coast and -200 km northeast of the Mekong River mouth for a period of -6 weeks. The bloom was dominated by the harmful algae haptophyte Phaeocystis cf. globosa and caused a very significant mortality of aquacultured fish and other marine life. In the same period, sea surface temperature (SST) imagery showed a cold water plume extending from the coast to the open sea, and QuikScat data showed strong southwesterly winds blowing parallel to the coastline. This study indicated that the HAB was induced and supported by offshore upwelling that brings nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface and from coastal water to offshore water and that the upwelling was driven by strong wind through Ekman transport when winds were parallel to the coastline. This study demonstrated the possibility of utilizing a combination of satellite data of Chl a, SST, and wind velocity together with coastal bathymetric information and in situ observations to give a better understanding of the biological oceanography of HABs.

J	Mallet, M; Roger, JC; Despiau, S; Putaud, JP; Dubovik, O				Mallet, M; Roger, JC; Despiau, S; Putaud, JP; Dubovik, O			A study of the mixing state of black carbon in urban zone	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The knowledge of the mixing state of black carbon particle with other aerosol species is critical for adequate simulations of the direct radiative effect of black carbon particles and its effect on climate. This paper reports the investigation of the mixing state of black carbon aerosol in the urban zone. The study uses a combination of in situ and ground-based remote sensing observations conducted during the ESCOMPTE experiment, which took place in industrialized region in France in summer of 2001. The criteria we used for identifying mixing state relies on the known enhancement of absorption for aerosol composed by internal versus external mixtures of black carbon with weakly absorbing aerosol components. First, using in situ aerosol data, we performed Mie computations and reconstructed the single scattering albedo of aerosol for the two different mixing assumptions: black carbon mixed externally or internally with other aerosol species. Then, we compared the obtained values omega(o,int) and omega(o,ext) with the retrievals of omega(o) from independent AERONET Sun-photometric measurements. The aerosol single scattering albedo (omega(o,aer.)) derived from the AERONET photometer observations (with the mean value equal to 0.84 +/- 0.04) was found to be close to omega(o,ext) reconstructed from in situ observation under assumptions of external mixture. This similarity between AERONET values and external mixture simulations was observed during all the days studied. Our conclusion on external mixture of black carbon aerosol with other particles in urban zone during ESCOMPTE (close to the pollution source) is coherent with observations made during other independent studies reported in a number of recent publications.

We present the outcome of a project to map the concentrations fields of total suspended matter in the North Sea, based on data from the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) instrument. Next to a good infrastructure and standard automatic processing, a reliable atmospheric correction proved to be essential. A single-band algorithm, based on a representative set of inherent optical properties, is presented. The satellite data and data from a standard in situ monitoring program near the Dutch coast are compared. For the year 2000, a total of 129 images could be used to present actual information and to derive monthly mean patterns and trends in the dynamic North Sea system. The results show the capacity of satellite data to provide excellent temporal coverage. Spatial variations of suspended sediment, often caused by input from rivers plus wind- and wave-induced resuspension over shallow areas, are covered.				van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013	van der Woerd, Hans/0000-0002-8901-7567												0703-8992					FEB	2004	30	1					44	53		10.5589/m03-051								WOS:000189216800007						
J	Zviely, D; Klein, M				Zviely, D; Klein, M			Coastal cliff retreat rates at Beit-Yannay, Israel, in the 20th century	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Research indicates that the aeolianite (Kurkar) cliffs, along the Israeli Mediterranean coastline have continuously retreated eastward during the last few decades. There seems to be no dispute among Earth scientists regarding the general trend of cliff retreat. However the majority of papers displaying cliff retreat rates are based upon comparison of aerial photographs. Their lack of advanced geometric measurement methods causes a high margin of error. Public attention is focused upon the Beit-Yannay coastal cliff since private homes are located along the southern section of the cliff crest. The current research compares the historic location of the cliff crest edge at Beit-Yannay as observed in a series of aerial photographs taken during the period 1918-2000. Quantitative measurement methods included applications of satellite geodesy and digital photogrammetry and mapping. Research results offer quantitative, consecutive and highly accurate data regarding retreat rates over a relatively long period of 82 years. It is concluded that: 1. Annual average cliff retreat rates of the cliff crest is 20 cm/year. 2. Categorization of the study time span reveals periods displaying varying retreat rates such as 27 cm/year during 1918-1946, 21 cm/year during 1946-1973 and 10 cm/year during 1973-2000. 3. Maximum retreat distances of the cliff crest, over the study period were found to be approximately 25 m along the northern, lowest section of the cliff. Minimum distances of 11 m were identified at the highest, southern section of the cliff. 4. The aeolianite (Kurkar) cliffs along the Israeli Mediterranean coast throughout the 20th century have been an important source of sediment, contributing approximately 24 x 10(6) m(3) of sediments to the sediment balance of Israeli beaches.

Physical processes that can lead to the phytoplankton bloom are investigated using upper ocean temperature profiles and satellite derived winds, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level anomalies (SLA). There is a chl a bloom attached to the southern coast of Sri Lanka accompanied by cool SST, low SLA and upsloping of isotherms towards the coast. Coastal upwelling driven by monsoon winds is identified as the physical mechanism causing nutrient enrichment in the surface layer. The Southwest Monsoon Current (SMC) which flows eastward south of Sri Lanka and then into the Bay of Bengal advects the upwelled water eastward along its path. The chl a rich waters from the Indian coast also advects along with the SMC towards Sri Lanka. East of Sri Lanka the open ocean upwelling associated with the Sri Lanka Dome is also found to be an important process that upwell nutrients.

J	Gomez-Enri, J; Villares, P; Bruno, M; Catalan, M				Gomez-Enri, J; Villares, P; Bruno, M; Catalan, M			Evidence of different ocean responses to atmospheric pressure variations in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Basins as deduced from ERS-2 altimetric data	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The exponential increase in the use of altimeter data in oceanographic studies in the past two decades has improved the knowledge of the processes that govern the interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere. One of these processes is the response of the ocean to atmospheric pressure variations, which has been deeply analysed in the past. That response is based on the isostatic assumption used to establish a standard correction for altimetric purposes, the Inverse Barometer Correction (IBC). As a general rule, the ocean goes up/down 1 cm when the atmospheric pressure goes down/up 1 mbar. However, in light of recent works in some oceanic regions, discrepancies arise when the real response is compared to the hypothetical one. It is important to quantify this discrepancy, in order to improve the accuracy of the correction. which is one of the most significant geophysical corrections applied to altimeter records. Some aspects of this response remain unclear, such as the real space-temporal scales where IBC can be applied, the influence of wind, nonisostatic atmospheric pressure-driven signals, and the effect of aliasing from high frequency signals. This paper is an attempt to gain insight into this phenomenon. The data used are the residuals obtained between sea surface heights from the ERS-2 altimeter and the outputs of a global barotropic ocean model. Significant departures from the hypothetical isostatic response in all data series (spatial and temporal domain) have been found, especially in the case of altimeter records. By applying the collinear track method, we observe that the estimated Atlantic Ocean response is quite similar to the one deduced from the isostatic assumption at all latitudinal bands. Nonetheless, the Indian and Pacific Oceans show important departures from the hypothetical value at low latitudes. Results obtained with the crossover track method show important deviations at low latitudes in the three basins. In order to understand why the Atlantic Ocean response is different from the one obtained in the other two, we can infer some explanations based on the interaction of seasonal and intraseasonal signals with the isostatic one.

This paper presents results from geodetic surveys of ice velocities (absolute and relative) at Dome C and along a transect to Terra Nova Bay. The purpose of the surveys was to provide accurate data for the study of ice dynamics, particularly a strain network comprising 37 poles surveyed in 1995 and again in 1999. Data indicate that the ice surface at the poles closest to the topographic summit moves horizontally by up to a few mm a(-1) in a direction consistent with downslope motion of the ice sheet, while 25 km from the summit it moves up to 211 mm a(-1). The EPICA drilling site yields an interpolated velocity of about 15 +/- 10 mm a(-1) in a north-northwesterly direction. Analysis of the velocity field and surface topography reveals that the surface flow centre is nearly co-located with the dome summit, and that both are in a steady-state condition. The measured horizontal velocities are consistent with the remote-sensing result and provide accurate ground-truth control for flow mapping. Seven snow-firn cores, up to 53 m deep, were drilled during the Terra Nova Bay-Dome C traverse. Submerged velocity systems were installed at the borehole and measured using the global positioning system (GPS). First results show a steady-state condition. Measured (horizontal) ice velocities increase from the summit of the ice sheet to the coast, reaching about 28 m a(-1) at site GPS2A.				gandolfi, stefano/A-4892-2016; Mancini, Francesco/L-2937-2015; Capra, Alessandro/L-9743-2015	gandolfi, stefano/0000-0003-2096-5670; Mancini, Francesco/0000-0002-8553-345X; Capra, Alessandro/0000-0001-6660-3291; FREZZOTTI, Massimo/0000-0002-2461-2883; Vittuari, Luca/0000-0002-9815-1004; Bitelli, Gabriele/0000-0002-6118-6000												0260-3055		0-946417-34-2				2004	39						402	408		10.3189/172756404781814627								WOS:000232368400061

The land-water interface comprising of coastal zone is modified all the time by oceanic currents, waves and tidal oscillations. The sediments are brought into the creeks from the erosion prone open coast beaches as well as through small rivers and inlets, and dispersed and deposited along the coast. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) due to its repetitive, multi-spectral and synoptic nature provides a unique view to recognize various features on land and sea. SRS techniques can be of great help in collection of continuous wave currents, wind, tides, suspended matter, shallow water area, wetlands, mangroves, mudflats and other coastal features and coastal changes, like land accretion or erosion. Therefore, a study has been undertaken to monitor geomorphological changes along the coast of Karachi using multi-temporal Landsat MSS and TM data from 1978 to 1998. SRS data were processed using interactive digital image processing/enhancement techniques like colour enhancement, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and by Colour draping techniques and different enhanced products of the area have been prepared. The multi-temporal PC analysis results were integrated with each other and with navigational map of the area by GIS technique. The geomorphological changes occurring at the middle part of the coast of Karachi along Bundal and Buddo Islands and in Korangi-Phitti Creek area were delineated. The integrated techniques applied on multi-temporal SRS data in this study were found very useful for monitoring and mapping the land accretion and erosion processes. The analyses provided the old as well as the most recent data base of coastal environmental conditions of the study area, which may led for better understanding of coastal processes and help for planning reclamation work in this area.

Using acoustic and satellite remote sensing, we have continuously monitored the acoustic activity and habitat of blue whales during 1994-2000. Calling blue whales primarily aggregate off the coast of southern and central California in the late summer, coinciding with the timing of the peak euphausiid biomass, their preferred prey. The northward bloom of primary production along the coast and subsequent northbound movements of the blue whales are apparent in the satellite and acoustic records, respectively, with the calling blue whales moving north along the Oregon and Washington coasts to a secondary foraging area with high primary productivity off Vancouver Island in the late fall. El Nino conditions, indicated by elevated sea-surface temperature and depressed regional chlorophyll-a concentrations, are apparent in the satellite records, particularly in the Southern California Bight during 1997/1998. These conditions disrupt biological production and alter the presence of calling blue whales in primary feeding locations. Remote sensing using acoustics is well suited to characterizing the seasonal movements and relative abundance of the northeast Pacific blue whales, and remote sensing using satellites allows for monitoring their habitat. These technologies are invaluable because of their ability to provide continuous large-scale spatial and temporal coverage of the blue whale migration. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the monthly variation of phytoplankton pigment concentrations ( PC) from 1978 to 1986, and analyzes seasonal winds with sea surface temperatures (SST) among the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the northern South China Sea. Nimbus satellite Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS)-derived PC images were averaged into monthly fields for the entire area; we then emphasize the period of one year from November 1979 to October 1980, when CZCS data availability was relatively good. Monthly variability of PC has been compared among three regions ( the outlets of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River). The results revealed well-defined seasonality of PC, wind and SST from north to south in China's marginal seas. In the northern area ( Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea), variability in SST (0 - 28degreesC) and PC (0.5 - 3.5 mg m(-3)) was high with two peaks of PC appeared in spring - summer and in fall - winter in each year. In the East China Sea, two peaks of PC (1.2 mg m(-3) in March and 1.3 mg m(-3) in November) were in evidence, where SST variations were ranged 7 - 28degreesC in one year. However, in the southern area ( northern South China Sea), variation in SST (15 - 29degreesC) and PC (0.1 - 0.4 mg m(-3)) was relatively low; the monthly variation of PC was not so high compared with north area. OCTS derived ocean color data obtained from April 1997 conformed the spatial pattern of Chl-a and colored dissolved organicmatter (CDOM), and showed high CDOM and total suspendedmaterial (TSS) in the coast waters in the north part of China's marginal seas. Seasonal variation of PC may be related to the reversed monsoon; and spatial variation of PC may be influenced by river discharge, upwelling and coastal currents. High PC areas match good fishing grounds in terms of season and location in the study waters.																	0018-8158					JAN	2004	511	1					1	15		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000014001.43554.6f								WOS:000188667300001						
J	Kraut, S; Anderson, RH; Krolik, JL				Kraut, S; Anderson, RH; Krolik, JL			A generalized Karhunen-Loeve basis for efficient estimation of tropospheric refractivity using radar clutter	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING												In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining a reduced-dimension parameterization of a propagation medium for the purpose of estimating the medium from transmission data. The application addressed is microwave remote sensing of tropospheric index-of-refraction profiles over the sea surface, using radar clutter returns. The proposed parameterization balances the desire to represent features prominent in the a priori statistics of the profiles versus the need to capture elements of the profile that significantly affect the observed clutter data. In linear estimation problems, basis vectors for the unknown parameter vector that optimizes this tradeoff have been derived as the reduced-rank Wiener filter or, equivalently, the generalized Karhunen-Loeve transform (GKLT). In this paper, we reinterpret the linear result, producing an extension to the nonlinear refractivity estimation problem. The resulting procedure produces basis vectors for tropospheric refractivity that are less dependent on features that have little effect on the clutter measurements. This results in a more efficient parameterization and reduces mean-square estimation error relative to an approach driven purely by the statistical prior. Application of the generalized KL technique to finding efficient basis vectors for refractivity profiles taken off the southern California coast is presented.																	1053-587X					JAN	2004	52	1					48	60		10.1109/TSP.2003.820297								WOS:000187434500005

The velocity map covers 175 500 km 2 from the Amundsen Coast to the southern turning point of the satellite orbit and comprises >80% of the Thwaites catchment. Relative velocity errors are <10% except for rare regions (about 5% of the total area) of unfavorable look geometry. Six individual tributaries were identified; their center-line velocities increase from 0 at the catchment boundary to similar to0.3 km a(-1) when they join the main glacier trunk. On the main trunk, velocity increases to similar to1.8 km a(-1) at the grounding line and 3.6 km a(-1) on the floating tongue. As at neighboring Pine Island Glacier, no strong longitudinal velocity gradients are found except near the grounding line. Within expected error bounds, the flow pattern appears temporally stationary, i.e. flowlines agree with the delineation of flow suggested by the pattern of velocity magnitude. A potential temporal shift of tributary boundaries must consequently be <4.4 m a(-1).																	0022-1430						2004	50	168					46	56		10.3189/172756504781830268								WOS:000226409900005

Start timing of the spring bloom was different spatially. The spring bloom started at the subpolar front and southward of it in March, northward of subpolar front, along the Primorye coast and off Hokkaido in April and in the middle of the Japan Basin in May. The start of the spring bloom showed interannual variability that corresponded with the wind speed in the area. The spring bloom in 1998 and 2002 appeared about four weeks earlier than in 1997, 1999 and 2001, and it corresponded with weak winds that can lead to an early development of the thermocline. The bloom was late in 1999 and 2001 in the Japan Basin and along the Primorye coast, and in the southern area in 2000. It corresponded with stronger wind stress that delayed seasonal thermocline formation. The bloom along the Primorye coast appeared later in 1999, and it corresponded with stronger wind stress, and at the same time, it seemed to be related with the delay of melting of sea ice in Mamiya Strait. The fall bloom appeared from early October to early December, and it did not have a clear temporal transition. The area where chlorophyll a concentration exceeded 0.8 mug l(-1) was wider in the western area than in the eastern area every year. The magnitude of the fall bloom was different between years, but it did not show a correlation with average wind speed in fall. Those results indicated that the timing of the seasonal bloom in the JES is largely affected by the variability of global climate such as ENSO events. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tree-level models were constructed to estimate biomass of the different plant components of A. cyclops and A. saligna from stem diameter at knee height. An existing volume regression equation for A. mearnsii was adapted and the estimated volumes, based on diameter at breast height, and tree height, were converted to mass. Sample plots were used to estimate mass per unit area by tree component, species and region. Satellite remote sensing conservatively estimated the densely (>50% cover) infested areas at >100 000 ha. The total green (wet) woody biomass with a minimum diameter of 2.5 cm was estimated to be almost 10 Mt or 12 million m(3). This is equivalent to the annual intake of roundwood by South African pulp, paper and board mills. A substantial quantity of raw material is therefore available for charcoal, wood composites and paper. Other products could possibly be developed from bark and foliage. Large-scale utilization of biomass will be a demanding task, with potential risks. Risks include environmental damage, and the creation of a dependency, and these will need to be managed carefully.																	0038-2353					JAN-FEB	2004	100	1					123	125										WOS:000221120300025

This segment, known as the Magallanes-Fagnano fault system, is a continental transform margin arranged in an en echelon geometry, along which prominent asymmetric basins were developed. Data acquired off the Atlantic coast of Isla Grande (the main island of Tierra del Fuego), in its central and eastern part, and in the central and western Magallanes Strait image the surface and subsurface structure of the transform fault and its associated basins. The Magallanes-Fagnano fault system is composed of distinct tectonic lineaments that are segments of the transform system and are represented by mostly near-vertical faults. In the Atlantic sector, the fault system trends broadly N70degreesE and seems to be composed by a single master fault, along which a highly asymmetric basin has formed. At around 63degreesW, the fault terminates by splaying into secondary normal faults that dissipate the horizontal displacement along the system. In the central eastern part of Isla Grande, the fault segments have been principally identified from analyses of remote sensing images on the basis of their morphological expression. These segments are located within river valleys and are generally associated with localized gravity minima. Lago Fagnano, a 105-km-long, E-W trending depression, is a large, mostly asymmetric pull-apart basin developed within the principal displacement zone of the Magallanes-Fagnano fault system. Restraining bends and overlapping step-over geometry characterize the central part of the Magallanes Strait. Along the western part of the fault system, in the vicinity of the Pacific entrance of the Magallanes Strait, asymmetric sedimentary basins have also developed. The sedimentary architecture of the basins formed within the principal displacement zone of the fault, in which the thick end of the depositional wedge abuts the transform segment, suggest simultaneous strike-slip motion and transform-normal extension, a common feature found in other continental transtensional environments. Strike-slip faulting in the Tierra del Fuego region is also documented along other prominent lineaments which parallel the Magallanes-Fagnano fault system. Along at least two of these lineaments, characterized by a remarkable morphological expression, widespread Quaternary activity occurs. The present-day motion between the South America and Scotia plates is slow (< 5 mm/yr). Also the modern seismicity monitored in the Tierra del Fuego region is low ( individual events <3.5 in magnitude). The low seismicity may be explained by the slow relative motion between plates and may be further affected by slip partitioning along the different segments which make up the Magallanes-Fagnano fault array, and along the subsidiary wrench lineaments that traverse the region.

The regional K(490) algorithm has been applied on to the IRS-P4 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) satellite data and a limited validation of the algorithm has been performed for case I and case II waters off Gujarat coast in the Arabian Sea. The results of the satellite validation experiment conducted in the Arabian Sea for K(490) algorithm show that the algorithm captures very well the in situ K(490) values (RMS=0.011 m(-1)). The algorithm has also been validated for an independent in situ data set collected during SK-186 data collection campaign in the Arabian Sea; a good correlation was obtained for this data (r(2) =0.80, N=41).																	0379-5136					DEC	2003	32	4					279	284										WOS:000187733900002						
J	Harris, R				Harris, R			Remote sensing of agriculture change in Oman	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper uses Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data from 1978 and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data from 2000 to assess agriculture change in two test areas of the Batinah coast of Oman. Field work was carried out in 1979 and 2001 in the Khaburah and Sohar regions to support the analysis of the Earth observation data. Unsupervised and supervised classifications are explored to produce maps of environmental change, and from these maps estimates of agriculture area are produced. While there has been substantial and clear agriculture change in the test areas, stimulated by Oman's rapid economic change since 1970, the measurement of these changes presents challenges that are common to many remote sensing investigations of arid and semi-arid regions. The paper identifies the main areas and types of agriculture change in the two test regions.

Elevation estimates, acquired with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), were compared to elevations measured with three types of ground-based measurements-1) differential GPS equipped all-terrain vehicle (ATV) that surveyed a 3-km reach of beach from the shoreline to the dune, 2) GPS antenna mounted on a stadia rod used to intensely survey a different 100 m reach of beach, and 3) a second GPS-equipped ATV that surveyed a 70-km-long transect along the coast. Over 40,000 individual intercomparisons between ATM and ground surveys were calculated. RMS vertical differences associated with the ATM when compared to ground measurements ranged from 13 to 19 em. Considering all of the intercomparisons together, RMS similar or equal to15 cm. This RMS error represents a total error for individual elevation estimates including uncertainties associated with random and mean errors. The latter was the largest source of error and was attributed to drift in differential GPS. The 15 cm vertical accuracy of the ATM is adequate to resolve beach-change signals typical of the impact of storms. For example, ATM surveys of Assateague Island (spanning the border of MD and VA) prior to and immediately following a severe northeaster showed vertical beach changes in places greater than 2 m, much greater than expected errors associated with the ATM. A major asset of airborne lidar is the high spatial data density. Measurements of elevation are acquired every few m(2) over regional scales of hundreds of kilometers. Hence, many scales of beach morphology and change can be resolved, from beach cusps tens of meters in wavelength to entire coastal cells comprising tens to hundreds of kilometers of coast. Topographic lidars similar to the ATM are becoming increasingly available from commercial vendors and should, in the future, be widely used in beach surveying.

For each input sample,, the new method uses a smoothed estimated reliability measure (SERM) in the output domain of the classifiers. SERM requires no additional training beyond that needed to optimize the constituent classifiers in the pool, and its generalization (test) accuracy exceeds that of a number of other extant methods for classifier fusion. Hyperspectral imagery from HyMAP and PROBE2 acquired at three points in the growing season over Smith Island, VA, a barrier island in the Nature Conservancy's Virginia Coast Reserve, serves as the basis for comparing SERM with other approaches.																	0196-2892					NOV	2003	41	11	1				2488	2499		10.1109/TGRS.2003.818537								WOS:000186572100008

This study is supplemented by a synoptic analysis and simulations of the three-dimensional stratospheric chemical transport model ROSE. Arctic air masses moved rapidly from Scandinavia to the Iberian peninsula and were mixed with subtropical air over the still warm Mediterranean Sea. This caused severe thunderstorms and extreme rainfall along the coasts of Morocco and Algeria and later on the Balearic Islands. Associated with the meridional transport an intrusion of stratospheric air below 3 km above sea level was observed. The maximum potential vorticity (PV) derived from UK Meteorological Office analysis data was about 9.3 potential vorticity units (pvu) at 330 K at the equatorward position of 35degreesN. These very high values went along with remarkably enhanced total ozone levels obtained from GOME backscatter measurements of collocated GOME/ERS-2 overpasses. Further investigation of COME data showed unusually high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) above the western Mediterranean. We present a new method to derive the tropospheric content of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from a combination of satellite measurements and results of a chemical transport model. We show that about two-third of the total atmospheric content of nitrogen dioxide in the observed plume is found in the troposphere. due to lightning activity, advection and vertical transport in the thunderstorms from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to atmospheric levels above clouds.																	0280-6509	1600-0889				NOV	2003	55	5					993	1006		10.1034/j.1600-0889.2003.00078.x								WOS:000186324200004

During a few days, Europe's highest and most active volcano hurled lava and spewed significant amounts of ash and trace gases into the atmosphere. The smoke and ash plume originating from the volcano stretched from the Sicily to the north African coast. The plume from the volcano has been identified and tracked using half-hourly Meteosat-7 visible, infrared, and water vapor imagery in order to estimate the radiative forcing produced by the introduction of the volcanic cloud in a previously clear sky. Our results indicate that, while the volcanic cloud has introduced a well-discernable radiative perturbation, the magnitude of the shortwave volcanic forcing appears in the range of the one introduced by large clouds above the Mediterranean Sea. By contrast, the perturbation generated in the longwave spectrum at the top of the atmosphere is larger than the one introduced by large meteorological clouds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

A selected case during summer 2001 is presented, when very high aerosol optical depth values were observed, benefiting from the synergy of various remote sensing instruments. The data that were collected allow the characterization of the optical properties of the aerosols in this region, where only little information has so far been available. Four-day back trajectories indicated that air masses were advected from Bulgaria and the northern coast of the Black Sea, where strong forest fires occurred in early August 2001. In order to investigate the optical properties of biomass burning aerosols, we used a two-wavelength lidar system that combines Raman and elastic-backscatter observations, in addition to a Brewer spectrophotometer, a nephelometer and a multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer. The lidar measurements on 9 August 2001 recorded an integrated aerosol optical depth at 355 nm of the order of 1.35 during cloud-free conditions. The estimated mean extinction-to-backscatter ratios from the Raman lidar were 60 sr for 355 nm and 50 sr for 532 run. Estimated values of the single scattering albedo, using spectral UV measurements and modeling were of the order of 0.90, consistent with previous findings, indicating a weak contribution of absorption to the total extinction. The Angstrom exponent, calculated from the multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer exhibited also high values around 1.78, indicating the presence of rather small particles.

J	Clarke, AD; Kapustin, VN				Clarke, AD; Kapustin, VN			The Shoreline Environment Aerosol Study (SEAS): A context for marine aerosol measurements influenced by a coastal environment and long-range transport	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The Shoreline Environment Aerosol Study ( SEAS) was carried out in Hawaii on the southeast coast of Oahu in an area exposed to relatively steady onshore flow. This location provided favorable opportunities to test and evaluate new instrumentation designed to improve measurements of marine aerosol and its physical, chemical, and optical properties, including the remote sensing (lidar) of coastal aerosol fields. Data acquired from the diverse instruments deployed before and during SEAS demonstrate that environmental and meteorological features actively influence aerosol measurements at this location. Both a ceilometer and a visibility sensor were operated continuously and found to be effective autonomous tools for characterizing mixed-layer aerosol conditions. These instruments also helped demonstrate that changes in physical and optical properties measured during SEAS were also linked to volcanic aerosol transported across the Pacific in the free troposphere from Japan and later entrained into the marine boundary layer. This and various local effects of wind direction, wind speed, tides, and sampling altitude were superimposed on the variations in offshore marine aerosol. Characterization of these site-specific effects provides a context and guidance for the interpretation of coastal aerosol data and evaluation of SEAS data.																	0739-0572					OCT	2003	20	10					1351	1361		10.1175/1520-0426(2003)020<1351:TSEASS>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000185679300002

The dense California GPS networks allowed us to map the ionospheric perturbations and to compute the group velocity with a high spatial resolution above the Pacific coasts. Due to a low sampling rate, a large error in the velocity determination remains. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that bi-static remote sensing measurements of seismic waves with GPS networks can be performed. Monostatic measurements with a dedicated satellite could possibly be used to record in the ionosphere surface waves originating from large earthquakes. Such a space-based remote sensing of the local group velocity of Rayleigh surface waves would effectively complement the seismic networks for high-resolution global tomography of the Earth's lithosphere.

Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P4) Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) derived chlorophyll concentration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived sea surface temperature (SST) images were integrated to generate a fishery forecast. The matching chlorophyll and SST features were selected to suggest potential fishing zones (PFZs). Actual fishing using trawlers in the suggested PFZs was carried out to validate the fishery forecast. The feedback in terms of CPUE (catch per unit effort) was analysed to evaluate the technique. The CPUEs were categorized based on mean ( mu ) and standard deviation (SD). The categorized catch points were plotted on images. High fish catch points were found in the vicinity of matching features. About 80 per cent of observations in 50-100 m depth zone and 68 per cent of observations in 30-50 m depth zone were found positive. At some locations an abrupt increase in CPUE in PFZs was observed.																	0143-1161					SEP 20	2003	24	18					3691	3699		10.1080/0143116031000117029								WOS:000185187200012

In this investigation, a RADARSAT1-1 C-HH SAR image acquired in 1998 was used for coastal mapping and land-cover assessment in the Braganca area, in the northern Brazil. The airborne GEMS 1000 X-HH radar image acquired in 1972 during the RADAM Project was also used for evaluating coastal changes occurring over the last three decades. The research has confirmed the usefulness of RADARSAT-1 image for geomorphological mapping and land-cover assessment, particularly in macrotidal man-rove coasts. It was possible to map mangroves, salt marshes, chenier sand ridges, dunes, barrier-beach ridges, shallow water morphologies and different forms of land-use. Furthermore, a new method to estimate shoreline changes based on the superimposition of vectors extracted from both sources of SAR data has indicated that the shoreline has been subjected to severe coastal erosion responsible for retreat of 32 km(2) and accretion of 20 km(2) resulting in a mangrove land loss of almost 12 km(2). In an application perspective, orbital and airborne SAR data proved to be a fundamental source of information for both geomorphological mapping and monitoring coastal changes in moist tropical environments.

Due in large part to their inaccessibility, relatively little is known about the landscapes of this biodiverse region, which also supports some of the highest population densities in the world. A broad-scale NDVI-based IRS 1B satellite image classification is used to analyze north-south and east-west trends across the entire Western Ghats and western coast of India, an area over 170 000 km(2). Northern and eastern landscapes are more fragmented compared to the southern and western slopes. Western slopes also have greater landscape diversity with land cover types more interspersed compared to the eastern slopes. These differences can be related to north-south and east-west variations in rainfall and plant distribution. Data from thirteen landscapes 10-50 km(2) in area, are further utilized to analyze trends in landscape pattern, and describe the geographical distribution of major natural and managed ecotope types. At this scale, very high levels of intra-ecotope type variability in landscape pattern are encountered for all land cover types. Results at these two scales are integrated to suggest a hierarchical stratified approach for monitoring land cover and biodiversity in the region.

For Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 images acquired for leaf-off and leaf-on conditions for 1991 and 2000, exploratory spectral analyses and field studies were conducted to detect and analyze patterns of spectral variability in land cover observed in the multitemporal image data. Patterns were identified of seasonal spectral data changes associated with seasonal vegetation changes for known land cover and land use types, thus characterizing patterns of seasonal LULC thematic change for the area. Detected seasonal variability for known land use and land cover types were used to develop formal classification rules based upon a thematic-change logic table. An image subset area based on United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1 : 24,000 quadrangles was used to develop a class-learning area within which unsupervised classification results were grouped into thematic classes. Signature riles from the unsupervised classification results were applied to classify the balance of the study area. Individual images were classified for leaf-off and leaf-on conditions and thematic-change analyses were conducted. The formal class rules based on thematic-change logic were applied resulting in a classification that provided a level one accuracy exceeding 90 % and a level two accuracy exceeding 85 %.

However, many of these approaches have large storage requirements or unnecessarily large computational burdens and, therefore, have been impractical for the large-scale databases typically found in remote sensing, especially hyperspectral applications. In this paper, we develop a practical on-line approach with only modest storage requirements.

Since that time more than 13,000 shoreline survey maps of the United States and its possessions have been produced. The horizontal position of a given natural shoreline will vary depending on the selected vertical reference datum. NOS uses an interpreted mean high-water line for its definition of shoreline. The mean high-water line is not a morphological reference feature but may be interpreted using beach morphological reference features such as berm or wet/dry line as well as contouring. Collection methods have changed over the years from on-site mapping using a planetable to photogrammetric survey mapping, which has been the primary collection method since the 1930s, to the investigation and production integration of commercial satellite imagery, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, and LIght Detection And Ranging technologies. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shoreline products are becoming more readily available due to ongoing cooperative data rescue efforts that convert original products into an accessible digital form. The list of available products include: raster and hard copies of shoreline manuscripts; vector shoreline from shoreline manuscripts; vector state composites; contemporary vector shoreline data; descriptive records (Descriptive Report or Project Completion Report); and photographs. Digital products are being made available through a web-based application, known as the NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer (NSDE). NOS is in the process of reattributing and formatting historical vector shoreline digitized from shoreline manuscripts into a consistent schema of attributes and data fields. The NSDE is a customized Internet mapping interface application coupled with database capabilities that allow users to view available NOS vector shoreline project boundaries; view selected vector shoreline data from one or more project surveys; view and download dynamically generated Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) metadata which includes a link to descriptive records; make printable maps; and download vector shapefiles with user selected classes (themes) and geographic extent. Ongoing efforts will make raster shoreline indices and manuscripts available through the NSDE. Thus, the NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer is available, as a tool, to spatially view and access contemporary and some historic digital shoreline prodnets.																	0749-0208					FAL	2003					38		14	32										WOS:000188120700003						
J	Yankovsky, AE				Yankovsky, AE			The cold-water pathway during an upwelling event on the New Jersey shelf	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												A comprehensive dataset obtained in summer of 1996 on the New Jersey shelf off Atlantic City is analyzed to determine the pathway for cold water during a period of sustained upwelling. The data include shipboard CTD/ADCP surveys, time series from three across-shelf lines of moorings, and remote sensing. An upwelling event that occurred from 30 June through 10 July 1996 is studied. The event comprised three stages: first, the cold water was upwelled through the bottom layer; second, the onshore flow concentrated in the pycnocline; and third, mesoscale eddylike features developed. During the first upwelling-favorable wind pulse, which lasted approximately 2 days, a northward alongshelf current was generated and the pycnocline outcropped at the surface approximately 5 km off the coast. The northward current occupied the whole water column, and cold water was brought to the coast through the near-bottom layer, in the manner of Ekman dynamics. After that, an alongshelf pressure gradient was set, which was associated with the bending coastline approximately 100 km to the north at the corner formed by the intersection of the New Jersey coast and the southern coast of Long Island. The onshore flow was now maintained through the pycnocline, with maximum velocities at 10-12-m depth. At the same time, the temperature anomaly transport (pathway for colder water) was centered at 14-17-m depth, corresponding to the lower part of the pycnocline. This onshore transport was primarily balanced by alongshelf pressure gradient; the acceleration of alongshelf current was less important. Approximately 6 days after the onset of upwelling, mesoscale currents began to dominate the study area, establishing a three-dimensional flow field with spatially localized (in the alongshelf direction) onshore currents.

Remotely acquired data, used extensively in many locations, have not been widely used to monitor restored wetlands. We compared three different vegetation sampling techniques to determine the accuracy associated with each method when used to determine species composition and cover in restored Pacific coast wetlands dominated by Salicornia virginica (perennial pickleweed). Two ground-based techniques, using quadrat and line intercept sampling, and a remote sensing technique, using low altitude, high resolution, color and color infrared photographs, were applied to estimate cover in three small restoration sites. The remote technique provided an accurate and efficient means of sampling vegetation cover, but individual species could not be identified, precluding estimates of species density and distribution. Aerial photography was determined to be an effective tool for vegetation monitoring of simple (i.e., single-species) habitat types or when species identities are not important (e.g., when vegetation is developing on a new restoration site). The efficiency associated with these vegetation sampling techniques was dependent on the scale of the assessment, with aerial photography more efficient than ground-based sampling methods for assessing large areas. However, the inability of aerial photography to identify individual species, especially mixed-species stands common in southern California salt marshes, limits its usefulness for monitoring restoration success. A combination of aerial photography and ground-based methods may be the most effective means of monitoring the success of large wetland restoration projects.

J	Hardman-Mountford, NJ; McGlade, JM				Hardman-Mountford, NJ; McGlade, JM			Seasonal and interannual variability of oceanographic processes in the Gulf of Guinea: an investigation using AVHRR sea surface temperature data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Gulf of Guinea is situated in a critical position for understanding Atlantic equatorial dynamics. This study investigates seasonal and interannual variability in sea surface temperature (SST) throughout this region, focusing on dynamical ocean processes. A 10.5-year time series of remotely sensed SST data with 4 km spatial resolution from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used for this investigation, as they are sufficient to resolve shelf processes. Firstly, patterns of cloud cover were assessed, then spatio-temporal variability in SST patterns was investigated. Features identified in climatological SST images were the Senegalese upwelling influence, coastal upwelling, tropical surface water, river run-off and fronts. Of particular interest is a shelf-edge cooling along the coast of Liberia and Sierra Leone in February. Interannual variability, assessed using annual mean images, time series decomposition and spectral analysis, showed a quasi-cyclic pattern of warm and cool years, perhaps related to El Nino-type forcing. The results of this study show the usefulness of infrared remote sensing for tropical oceanography, despite high levels of cloud cover and atmospheric water vapour contamination, and they provide evidence for theories of westward movement of the upwelling against the Guinea current and remote forcing of the upwelling.

CALIPSO will fly in formation with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite. Here we present inversions of combined aircraft lidar and MODIS data to study the properties of smoke off the southwest coast of Southern Africa. The inversion derives profiles of the aerosol extinction due to fine and coarse particles. Comparisons with three sets of airborne in situ measurements show excellent agreement of the aerosol extinction profiles; however the inversion derives smaller spectral dependence of the extinction than the in situ measurements. The inversion is sensitive to the aerosol backscattering-to-extinction ratio (BER). Due to nonsphericity of the coarse aerosols, the range of BERs of the smoke aerosol is 0.014 to 0.021 sr(-1) for the fine and coarse particles at 0.53 and 1.06 mum wavelengths, which do not differ much from the value for dust (0.016 sr(-1)) at these wavelengths.																	0094-8276					AUG 16	2003	30	16							1831	10.1029/2003GL017068								WOS:000184867700001						
J	Kelly, REJ; Davie, TJA; Atkinson, PM				Kelly, REJ; Davie, TJA; Atkinson, PM			Explaining temporal and spatial variation in soil moisture in a bare field using SAR imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Previous studies to determine the utility of satellite remote sensing for soil moisture monitoring have concentrated on field scale assessment. The European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments have a spatial resolution of less than 30 m in azimuth and 26 m in range, and potentially offer a considerably finer scale of soil moisture assessment. A series of soil moisture measurements were taken within a 15 ha bare field on the Essex (UK) coast at times to coincide with ERS-1 overpasses in the autumn and winter of 1995-96. This dataset has been used to investigate the ability of ERS-1 SAR backscatter response to detect spatial variation in soil moisture within the field. Analysis of variograms of SAR backscatter show that spatial variations in the ERS SAR data can be detected within the field and that spatial dependency increases when the soil is wet. Field measurements of soil moisture do not reflect these findings in quite the same way; during periods of low soil moisture content, the spatial variation of soil moisture cannot be easily characterized by the variograms. When the field is wet, spatial autocorrelation is more evident in the variograms. Regression analysis of paired observations of measured soil moisture and ERS SAR backscatter demonstrated that no significant relationship could be obtained for each day. However, when paired data for different dates-were combined, a significant relationship between SAR backscatter and soil moisture could be obtained. The results suggest, therefore, that for this case study, soil moisture can be predicted at the field scale but not at the within-field/pixel scale.

S. Navy, NASA, and university scientists conducted the Puerto Rico Dust Experiment (PRIDE). In this paper we give a brief overview of mean meteorological conditions during the study. We focus on our findings on African dust transported into the Caribbean utilizing a Navajo aircraft and AERONET Sun photometer data. During the study midvisible aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in Puerto Rico averaged 0.25, with a maximum >0.5 and with clean marine periods of similar to0.08. Dust AOTs near the coast of Africa (Cape Verde Islands and Dakar) averaged similar to0.4, 30% less than previous years. By analyzing dust vertical profiles in addition to supplemental meteorology and MPLNET lidar data we found that dust transport cannot be easily categorized into any particular conceptual model. Toward the end of the study period, the vertical distribution of dust was similar to the commonly assumed Saharan Air Layer (SAL) transport. During the early periods of the study, dust had the highest concentrations in the marine and convective boundary layers with only a weak dust layer in the SAL being present, a state usually associated with wintertime transport patterns. We corroborate the findings of Maring et al. [2003] that in most cases, there was an unexpected lack of vertical stratification of dust particle size. We systematically analyze processes that may impact dust vertical distribution and speculate that dust vertical distribution predominately influenced by flow patterns over Africa and differential advection coupled with fair weather cloud entrainment, mixing by easterly waves, and regional subsidence.

The measurements are sensitive to the vertical distribution of aerosols. However, the information is insufficient to be mapped into unique aerosol physical properties and vertical distribution. Spectral radiances measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Aqua spacecraft, acquired simultaneously with the CALIPSO observations, can constrain the solutions. The combination of the MODIS and CALIPSO data can be used to derive extinction profiles of the fine and coarse modes of the aerosol size distribution for aerosol optical thickness of 0.1 and larger. Here we describe a new inversion method developed to invert simultaneously MODIS and CALIPSO data over glint-free ocean. The method is applied to aircraft lidar and MODIS data collected over a dust storm off the coast of West Africa during the Saharan Dust Experiment (SHADE). The backscattering-to-extinction ratio (BER) (BER = omega(o)P(180)/4pi) can be retrieved from the synergism between measurements avoiding a priori hypotheses required for inverting lidar measurements alone. For dust, the resultant value of BER = 0.016 sr(-1) is over 50% smaller than what is expected using Mie theory, but in good agreement with recent results obtained from Raman lidar observations of dust episodes. The inversion is robust in the presence of 10% and 20% noise in the lidar signal at 0.53 and 1.06 pm, respectively. Calibration errors of the lidar of 5% to 10% can cause an error in optical thickness of 20% to 40%, respectively, in the tested cases.																	0196-2892					AUG	2003	41	8					1743	1754		10.1109/TGRS.2003.814138								WOS:000184861700001						
J	Zaytsev, O; Cervantes-Duarte, R; Montante, O; Gallegos-Garcia, A				Zaytsev, O; Cervantes-Duarte, R; Montante, O; Gallegos-Garcia, A			Coastal upwelling activity on the pacific shelf of the Baja California Peninsula	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												High primary productivity on the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula is usually related to coastal upwelling activity that injects nutrients into the euphotic zone in response to prevailing longshore winds (from the northwest to north). The upwelling process has maximum intensity from April to June, with the coastal upwelling index varying from 50 to 300 m(3)/s per 100 m of coastline. Along the entire coast of the peninsula, the upwelling intensity changes in accordance with local wind conditions and bottom topography. Spatial variability can also be modulated by the influence of mesoscale meanders of the California Current. We have identified the seasonal and synoptic variability of upwelling signatures on the Baja California shelf, using averaged monthly and weekly sea surface temperature (SST) distributions obtained from remote sensing imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer in the period from 1996 to 2001. Analysis of SST distribution and direct experimental data on temperature and nutrient concentration shows that the areas with the coldest SST anomalies were closely related to the bottom slope, shelf width, and coastline orientation relating to wind direction. We also assume that the nutrient transport into the coastal lagoons may be forced by the coupling of coastal upwelling and tidal pumping of surface waters into the lagoon system.																	0916-8370					AUG	2003	59	4					489	502		10.1023/A:1025544700632								WOS:000183866500009

Two hyperspectral sensors, namely, the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer and the Visible Infrared Scanner-200, which provide spectral coverage from the visible to the thermal infrared, were flown over the Tuscany coast (Italy) on board a Casa 212 airplane. The acquired images were processed to produce radiometrically calibrated data, which were then analyzed and compared with ground-based spectral measurements. Calibrated data acquired at high spectral resolution (similar to2.5 nm) showed a maximum scene brightness almost of the same order of magnitude as that observed during similar daytime measurements, whereas their average luminosity was 3 orders of magnitude lower. The measurement analysis confirmed that artificial illumination hinders astronomical observations and produces noticeable effects even at great distances from the sources of the illumination.

This paper presents a thematic analysis and integration of the Journal of Geophysical Research SAFARI 2000 Special Issue, presenting key findings of an intensive field campaign over southern Africa in August and September of 2000. The integrating themes deal with surface emissions characterization; airborne characterizations of aerosols and trace gases; regional haze and trace gas characterization; and radiant measurements by surface, aircraft, and remote sensing platforms. Enhanced regional fuel loads associated with the moist La Nina phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle produced above average biomass burning emissions, which consequently dominated all other aerosol and trace gas emissions during the dry season. Southward transport of a broad plume of smoke originating in equatorial Africa and exiting off the east coast toward the Indian Ocean (the river of smoke) is attributed to unusual synoptic airflows associated the ENSO phase. New and revised biogenic and pyrogenic emission factors are reported, including a number of previously unreported oxygenated organic compounds and inorganic compounds from biomass combustion. Emission factors are scaled up to regional emission surfaces for biogenic species utilizing species specific and light-dependent emission factors. Fire scar estimates reveal contradictory information on the timing of the peak and extent of the biomass-burning season. Integrated tall stack coordinated measurements (between ground, airborne and remotely sensing platforms) of upwelling and downwelling radiation in massive thick aerosol layers covering much of southern Africa yield consistent estimates of large negative forcing for both surface and top of atmosphere radiative forcing. Radiation calculations are supported by novel information on chemical speciation and internal aerosol particle structure. The overall conclusion is that SAFARI 2000, as an integrating theme, has been able to give significant new insights into the regional scale biogeochemical cycling of southern Africa and contributed in important ways to the validation of remote sensing instruments on board the NASA Terra spacecraft.

Therefore, mapping seagrass beds is indispensable in the management and conservation of sound littoral ecosystems, and in the development of sustainable fisheries in coastal waters. Multi-beam sonar is often used to map bottom topography. We developed a mapping method to quantify the volume of seagrass using a multi-beam sonar. Seagrass beds were scanned with the multi-beam sonar and quadrat sampled to verify the distribution of seagrasses. We used software to discriminate seagrass signals from echoes to obtain a topographic profile of the bottom without seagrass this was then subtracted from the topography including the seagrass. We then mapped seagrass distribution, calculated seagrass volume, and estimated biomass using volume and quadrat samples. We applied these methods to map a seagrass bed of Zostera caulescens in Otsuchi Bay, on the Sanriku Coast of Japan, during the growing season of 2001. A transducer was attached to a boat (one gross ton) equipped with a differential-GPS, a motion sensor, and a gyrocompass. The vessel completed a grid survey scanning whole seagrass bed with an area of 115 m x 156 m at bottom depths between 2 and 8 in within about 40 min when traveling at a speed of 1.5 m s(-1) (3 knots). The multi-beam sonar was able to visualize three-dimensional seagrass distribution without interpolation and easily to estimate area and volume occupied by the seagrass using hydrography software. The results indicated that Z. caulescens was distributed at bottom depths of 6-7 m with a surface area of 3 628 m(2) and a volume of 1 368 m(3). The mean biomass of above- and below-ground parts of seagrass were estimated to be 28.6 gDW m(-2) (range 26.6-30.9) and 15.9 gDW m(-2) (range 14.1-17.7). Our study demonstrated that multi-beam sonar is effective for mapping and quantifying the spatial distribution of seagrass beds, and for visualizing the landscape of the seagrass canopy.

In 1997 and 1999, during the northwest monsoon the eastward South Java Current (SJC) along the Sunda Islands restrained the flows from the straits along the Sunda Islands and ceased blooming. During the southeast monsoon the westward South Equatorial Current ( SEC) and the southeasterly wind generated cyclonic eddies along the Sunda Islands. The blooming was observed over those cyclonic eddies, where nutrients were entrained to the surface. In 1998, through the northwest to the southeast monsoon the eastward currents were flowing away from the coast. During the southeast monsoon the SEC was not observed. Through 1998, cyclonic eddies were observed along the Sunda Islands in consequence of these anomalies. The distribution of currents is defined for the monsoon anomaly in 1998. (1) The eastward SJC flowed away from the coast in the northwest monsoon. (2) No westward SEC was observed in the southeast monsoon. (3) The eastward SJC restrained the flow from the straits in the southeast monsoon. (4) Chlorophyll a similar to1 mg m(-3) were observed along the Sunda Islands through the year. This monsoon anomaly is hypothesized as a result of anomalies in the distribution of pressure systems between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean following to the El Nino.																	0148-0227					JUN 27	2003	108	C6							3202	10.1029/1999JC000139								WOS:000184590700001						
J	Shepherd, A; Peacock, NR				Shepherd, A; Peacock, NR			Ice shelf tidal motion derived from ERS altimetry	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Ocean tides beneath floating ice shelves can affect heat and water circulations within the subshelf cavity, which may influence patterns of basal melting. Accurate tidal predictions are essential to eliminate vertical tide motions when mapping the flow speeds and thickness changes of floating ice. Global ocean tide solutions are typically accurate to 2 - 3 cm in amplitude. However, their coarse resolution limits their utility in coastal regions. Moreover, the absence of satellite and extensive gauge station data in the polar regions has resulted in significant differences between recent tide model solutions around the Antarctic continent. We use 9 years of high-resolution European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite radar altimeter range measurements and a modified form of the orthotide method to generate tidal solutions for a series of ice shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula. We compare our tidal solution at George VI Ice Shelf on the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula to direct measurements from British Antarctic Survey tide gauge records and contrast the results with solutions from the FES99 and Kantha2.0 ( global) and the CATS01.02 ( Antarctic) ocean tide models. The average root mean square vector difference between the tide gauge and tide model predictions of amplitude and phase was 10.9, 17.1, 4.2, and 15.4 cm for the ERS ice shelf, Kantha2.0, CATS01.02, and FES99 models, respectively. Tidal predictions derived from the ERS ice shelf model are closer to the tide gauge recordings than those of the global models, and the inclusion of ERS altimeter data may lead to improved global model performance.																	0148-0227					JUN 20	2003	108	C6							3198	10.1029/2001JC001152								WOS:000183750500001

Features of the profiles include haze layers, clean air slots, and marked decreases in light scattering in passing from the boundary layer into the free troposphere. Frequency distributions of omega(0) reflect the strong influence of smoke from biomass burning. For example, during a period when heavy smoke was advected into the region from the north, the mean value of omega(0) in the boundary layer was 0.81 +/- 0.02 compared to 0.89 +/- 0.03 prior to this intrusion. Comparisons of layer aerosol optical depths derived from the in situ measurements with those measured by a Sun photometer aboard the aircraft show excellent agreement.

To provide global coverage data of soil moisture and ocean salinity with three-day revisit time, the Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) was selected by ESA (European Space Agency) in May 1999. SMOS' single payload is a Y-shaped 2-D aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer called MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis). SMOS presents some particular imaging peculiarities: variation of incidence and azimuth angles, different radiometric sensitivity and accuracy at each direction (pixels), and geometric polarization mixing. Therefore, the accuracy of the geophysical parameter retrieval depends on the knowledge of the angular dependence of the emissivity over a wide range of incidence and azimuth angles. The accuracy of the sea surface salinity retrievals depends on our capability to correct the wind-induced variation of the brightness temperatures. To better understand wind effects, ESA sponsored the WInd and Salinity Experiment 2000 (WISE-2000) from November 15, 2000, to January 16, 2001, in the Casablanca oil rig, at 40 km off the coast of Tarragona (Spain). This paper is divided into two parts. First, it presents the derived sensitivities of the brightness temperatures at vertical and horizontal polarizations with wind speed, and compares to Hollinger's measurements and numerical simulations. Second, these results are applied to the SMOS sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieval problem for different tracks within the swath. It is shown that, except for low SSS and sea surface temperature (SST), the retrieved SSS has a RMS error of approximately 1 psu in one satellite pass.

The challenges of meeting air quality standards established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) are impacted by the transport of pollution into Texas that originates from outside our borders and are cumulative with those generated by local,sources. In an attempt to quantify the concentrations of all pollution sources, MOD has installed ground-based monitoring stations in rural regions along the Texas geographic boundaries including the Gulf coast, as well as urban regions that are the predominant sources of domestic pollution. However, analysis of time-lapse GOES satellite imagery at MOD, clearly demonstrates the shortcomings of using only ground-based observations for monitoring air quality across Texas. These shortcomings include the vastness of State borders, that can only be monitored with a large number of ground-based. sensors, and gradients in pollution concentration that depend upon the location of the point source, the meteorology governing its transport to Texas, and its diffusion across the region. With the launch of NASA's MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the transport of aerosol-borne pollutants can now be monitored over land and ocean surfaces. Thus, CSR and MOD personnel have applied MODIS data to several classes of pollution that routinely impact Texas air quality. Results demonstrate MODIS data and products can detect and track the migration of pollutants. This paper presents one case study in which continental haze from the northeast moved into the region and subsequently required health advisories to be issued for 150 counties in Texas. It is concluded that MODIS provides the basis for developing advanced data products that will, when used in conjunction with ground-based observations, create a cost-effective and accurate pollution monitoring system for the entire state of Texas.

Beginning in 1999, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued the Gulf of Mexico HAB Bulletins to support state monitoring and management efforts. These bulletins involve analysis of satellite imagery with field and meteorological station data. The effort involves several components or models: (a) monitoring the movement of an algal bloom that has previously been identified as a HAB (type 1 forecast); (b) detecting new blooms as HAB or non-HAB (type 2); (c) predicting the movement of an identified HAB (type 3); (d) predicting conditions favorable for a HAB to occur where blooms have not yet been observed (type 4). The types 1 and 2 involve methods of bloom detection requiring routine remote sensing, especially satellite ocean color imagery and in situ data. Prediction (types 3 and 4) builds on the monitoring capability by using interpretative and numerical modeling. Successful forecasts cover more than 1000 km of coast and require routine input of remotely sensed and in situ data. The data sources used in this effort include ocean colorimagery from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor/OrbView-2 satellite and processed using coastal-specific algorithms, wind data from coastal and offshore buoys, field observations of bloom location and intensity provided by state agencies, and forecasts from the National Weather Service. The HAB Bulletins began in coordination with the state of Florida in autumn of 1999 and included K. brevis bloom monitoring (type 1), with limited advisories on transport (type 3) and the detection of blooms in new areas (type 2). In autumn 2000, we improved both the transport forecasts and detection capabilities and began prediction of conditions favorable for bloom development (type 4). The HAB Bulletins have had several successes. The state of Florida was advised of the potential for a bloom to occur at the end of September 2000 (type 4), and the state was alerted to the position of blooms in January 2000 and October 2001 in areas that had not been previously sampled (type 3). These successful communications of HAB activity allowed Florida agencies responsible for shellfish management and public health to respond to a rapidly developing event in a timely, efficient manner.

J	Xie, N; Leung, H; Chan, H				Xie, N; Leung, H; Chan, H			A multiple-model prediction approach for sea clutter modeling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Accurate modeling of sea clutter is an important problem in remote sensing and radar signal processing applications. Due to a recent discovery that sea clutter, the electromagnetic wave backscatter from a sea surface, is chaotic rather than purely random, computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks have been applied to develop new models for sea clutter. In this paper, we propose using the multiple neural network model approach to construct a predictive model for sea clutter. The motivation comes from the observation that the sea usually has some unpredictable motions that result in impulsive events such as sea spikes. Although a single nonlinear model could describe the Bragg scattering reasonably as shown in the literature, it is usually incapable of capturing sea spikes motions. Therefore, target detection performance might be degraded when such a clutter model is employed. Using a multiple radial basis function (RBF) net predictor, we found that a sea clutter signal with different underlying dynamics from sea spikes to normal motions can be modeled accurately. The multiple model (MM) approach automatically assigns different RBF predictors to model sea spikes and other mechanisms like Bragg scattering. The proposed multiple RBF neural network uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and multistep prediction for training, and hence it is suitable for real-time signal processing. Using real-life radar clutter data collected at the east coast of Canada, the proposed MM approach is shown to be effective in isolating and characterizing various components of sea clutter and, therefore, provides a promising model for clutter suppression in radar detection.																	0196-2892					JUN	2003	41	6	1				1491	1502		10.1109/TGRS.2003.811690								WOS:000184768700038						
J	Tobler, MW; Cochard, R; Edwards, PJ				Tobler, MW; Cochard, R; Edwards, PJ			The impact of cattle ranching on large-scale vegetation patterns in a coastal savanna in Tanzania	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The success of large-scale cattle ranching in African savanna vegetation has often been limited by problems of bush encroachment and disease (in particular trypanosomiasis spread by tsetse flies). Mkwaja Ranch, occupying an area of 462 km(2) on the coast of Tanzania, is a recent example of a large ranching enterprise that failed within the savanna environment. It was closed in 2000 after 48 years of operation. In this paper we describe the main vegetation types of the area (excluding closed forest vegetation) and relate their patterns of distribution to the former use of the ranch for cattle. 2. The study area comprised the former ranch and parts of the adjacent Saadani Game Reserve, which had not been grazed by cattle for many years and had never been used for large-scale ranching. Following field surveys, 15 distinct types of grassland and bush vegetation were defined and a vegetation map was created using a Landsat TM satellite image. A multispectral classification using the maximum likelihood algorithm gave good results and enabled all 15 vegetation types to be distinguished on the map. 3. Two main spatial trends were detected in the vegetation. One was a large-scale decrease in the cover of bushland from the most intensively used parts of the ranch through more extensively used areas to the game reserve; this trend was attributed to differences in management history as well as to climatic and topographic factors. A second trend was a radial vegetation pattern associated with the enclosures where cattle were herded at night. High amounts of three bushland types [dominated by (i) Acacia zanzibarica , (ii) Dichrostachys cinerea , Acacia nilotica or Acacia mellifera and (iii) Terminalia spinosa ] occurred in a zone between 300 and 2500 m from the paddocks, with a peak in bush density at about 900 m (mean value for 18 paddocks). In contrast, bushland dominated by Hyphaene compressa was scarce close to the paddocks and became more abundant with distance. There was also a radial trend in the grassland communities: close to the paddocks there was short grass vegetation containing many ruderals and invasive weedy species, while the tall grassland types with species such as Hyperthelia dissoluta and Cymbopogon caesius occurred further away in the areas less affected by cattle. 4. Synthesis and applications. The intensive modern livestock ranching as practised on Mkwaja Ranch proved to be unsustainable both economically and ecologically. In the end, the biggest problem faced by the ranch managers was not controlling disease, as had originally been feared, but preventing the spread of bush on pasture land. The results of our study demonstrate just how severe the problem of bush encroachment was, especially in areas close to paddocks. An important lesson for management is that grazing patterns need to be taken into consideration when determining the sustainable stocking rate for an area. To reduce the risk of bush encroachment in grazing systems with focal points such as paddocks or watering points, stocking rates need to be lower than in systems with a more uniform grazing distribution.																	0021-8901					JUN	2003	40	3					430	444		10.1046/j.1365-2664.2003.00816.x								WOS:000183283400002						
J	Meier, WN; Maslanik, JA				Meier, WN; Maslanik, JA			Effect of environmental conditions on observed, modeled, and assimilated sea ice motion errors	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Previous evaluations of ice motion have primarily consisted of comparisons with in situ observations and general sensitivity studies with wind speed and direction. An assimilation framework allows the quality of ice motions to be studied as an explicit function of model and model forcing parameters. Here we investigate the effects of local conditions on remotely sensed, modeled, and assimilated motions. We use local conditions, as given by the ice model, to examine ice motion errors based on (1) proximity to the coast, (2) ice thickness, and (3) wind-forcing. In comparison with buoy observations, both modeled and remotely sensed ice motions have lowest errors in moderately thick ice, in low winds, and away from coastal regions. Wind speed plays the largest role in the errors, and higher winds speeds lead to substantially higher motion error standard deviation. However, higher wind speeds also increase the correlation of modeled and remotely sensed motions with buoy observations. An optimal interpolation assimilation methodology, which led to substantial improvements in ice motion quality on a regional and seasonal basis, was employed in this study. Assimilation improved the quality of the ice motions (lower error, higher correlation) throughout most ranges of wind speed and ice thickness and both near the coast and in the central ice pack. This study suggests that adjusting assimilation weights based on local model conditions could efficiently yield even higher quality assimilated motion fields.																	0148-0227					MAY 21	2003	108	C5							3152	10.1029/2002JC001333								WOS:000183179100003

DNPS discharges 29 10 x 10(5) m(3) year(-1) of warm water from its cooling system into Daya Bay, which could have ecological consequences. This study examines satellite sea surface temperature data and shipboard water column measurements from Daya Bay. Field observations of water temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a data were conducted four times per year at 12 sampling stations in Daya Bay during January 1997 to January 1999. Sea surface temperatures were derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting satellites during November 1997 to February 1999. A total of 2905 images with 1.1 x 1.1 km resolution were examined; among those images, 342 have sufficient quality for quantitative analysis. The results show a seasonal pattern of thermal plumes in Daya Bay. During the winter months (December to March), the thermal plume is localized to an area within a few km of the power plant, and the temperature difference between the plume and non-plume areas is about 1.5 degreesC. During the summer and fall months (May to November), there is a larger thermal plume extending 8-10 kin south along the coast from DNPS, and the temperature change is about 1.0 degreesC. Monthly variation of SST in the thermal plume is analyzed. AVHRR SST is higher in daytime than in nighttime in the bay during the whole year. The strong seasonal difference in the thermal plume is related to vertical mixing of the water column in winter and to stratification in summer. Further investigations are needed to determine any other ecological effects of the Daya Bay thermal plume.

J	Aslan, A; White, WA; Warne, AG; Guevara, EH				Aslan, A; White, WA; Warne, AG; Guevara, EH			Holocene evolution of the western Orinoco Delta, Venezuela	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The pristine nature of the Orinoco Delta of eastern Venezuela provides unique opportunities to study the geologic processes and environments of a major tropical delta. Remote-sensing images, shallow cores, and radiocarbon-dating of organic remains form the basis for describing deltaic environments and interpreting the Holocene history of the delta. The Orinoco Delta can be subdivided into two major sectors. The southeast sector is dominated by the Rio Grande-the principal distributary-and complex networks of anastomosing fluvial and tidal channels. The abundance of siliciclastic deposits suggests that fluvial processes such as overbank flooding strongly influence this part of the delta. In contrast, the northwest sector is represented by few major distributaries, and overbank sedimentation is less widespread relative to the southeast sector. Peat is abundant and occurs in herbaceous and forested swamps that are individually up to 200 km(2) in area. Northwest-directed littoral currents transport large volumes of suspended sediment and produce prominent mudcapes along the northwest coast. Mapping of surface sediments, vegetation, and major landforms identified four principal geomorphic systems within the western delta plain: (1) distributary channels, (2) interdistributary flood basins, (3) fluvial-marine transitional environments, and (4) marine-influenced coastal environments. Coring and radiocarbon dating of deltaic deposits show that the northern delta shoreline has prograded 20-30 km during the late Holocene sea-level highstand. Progradation has been accomplished by a combination of distributary avulsion and mudcape progradation. This style of deltaic progradation differs markedly from other deltas such as the Mississippi where distributary avulsion leads to coastal land loss, rather than shoreline progradation. The key difference is that the Orinoco Delta coastal zone receives prodigious amounts of sediment from northwest-moving littoral currents that transport sediment from as far away as the Amazon system (similar to1600 km). Late Holocene progradation of the delta has decreased delta-plain gradients, increased water levels, and minimized overbank flooding and siliciclastic sedimentation in the northwest sector. These conditions, coupled with large amounts of direct precipitation, have led to widespread peat accumulation in interdistributary basins. Because peat-forming environments cover up to 5000 km(2) of the delta plain, the Orinoco may be an excellent analogue for interpreting ancient deltaic peat deposits.																	0016-7606					APR	2003	115	4					479	498		10.1130/0016-7606(2003)115<0479:HEOTWO>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000181928300007

The anvil cirrus blowoff from the final surge of tropical convection became embedded in subtropical flow that advected the cirrus across the western United States, where it was studied from the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (FARS) in Salt Lake City, Utah, on 25 September. A day later, the cirrus shield remnants were redirected southward by midlatitude circulations into the southern Great Plains, providing a case study opportunity for the research aircraft and ground-based remote sensors assembled at the Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) site in northern Oklahoma. Using these comprehensive resources and new remote sensing cloud retrieval algorithms, the microphysical and radiative cloud properties of this unusual cirrus event are uniquely characterized. Importantly, at both the FARS and CART sites the cirrus generated spectacular halos and arcs, which acted as a tracer for the hurricane cirrus, despite the limited lifetimes of individual ice crystals. Lidar depolarization data indicate widespread regions of uniform ice plate orientations, and in situ particle replicator data show a preponderance of pristine, solid hexagonal plates and columns. It is suggested that these unusual aspects are the result of the mode of cirrus particle nucleation, presumably involving the lofting of sea salt nuclei in strong thunderstorm updrafts into the upper troposphere. This created a reservoir of haze particles that continued to produce halide-salt-contaminated ice crystals during the extended period of cirrus cloud maintenance. The inference that marine microbiota are embedded in the replicas of some ice crystals collected over the CART site points to the longevity of marine effects. Various nucleation scenarios proposed for cirrus clouds based on this and other studies, and the implications for understanding cirrus radiative properties on a global scale, are discussed.

J	Kadygrov, EN; Shur, GN; Viazankin, AS				Kadygrov, EN; Shur, GN; Viazankin, AS			Investigation of atmospheric boundary layer temperature, turbulence, and wind parameters on the basis of passive microwave remote sensing	RADIO SCIENCE												[1] The MTP-5, a microwave temperature profiler, has been widely used since 1991 for investigation of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The MTP-5 is an angular scanning single-channel instrument with a central frequency of about 60 GHz, designed to provide continuous, unattended observations. It can measure the thermal emission of the atmosphere with high sensitivity (0.03 Kat 1 s integration time) from different zenith angles. On the basis of this measurement, it is possible to retrieve temperature profiles at the altitude range up to 600 m, to calculate wind speed and wind direction at the lowest 250 m, and to get information about some parameters of atmospheric turbulence. This report presents some applications of the MTP-5 instrument data collected in 1998-2001 within a number of international field projects: the dynamics of ABL temperature inversion in a mountain valley (Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP)), as well as along an island coast (north part of Sakhalin Island, Russia-Japan Project); continuous measurements of the ABL temperature profile provided from a special scientific train that crossed the territory of Russia (the Transcontinental Observations of the Chemistry of the Atmosphere Project (TROICA)); and simultaneous measurements of the ABL temperature profile provided over the central and northern part of Moscow in a continuous mode (the Global Urban Research Meteorology and Environment Project (GURME)). In 1999, two MTP-5 instruments were installed on a platform that was rotating in the azimuth direction at the 310 m Obninsk Meteorological Research Tower (Meteo Tower) to validate the method and microwave equipment for measurement of wind speed and wind direction and investigation of atmospheric turbulence. Spectral analyses of the integrated signal provided an opportunity to estimate the inertial subrange low-frequency limit and its height dependence for thermal turbulence at the lowest 200 m layer. Wavelet analysis of the signal made it possible to determine the convective thermic and other coherent structures; also to estimate energy and to provide visualization of the transformation processes of those structures during changing ABL stability. For a wide spectrum of ABL models the integrated character of radiometric data is more representative than in situ data. The measurement cycle for main wind is about 45 min, with an accuracy of about 1-2 m/s for wind speed and 10-20degrees for wind direction. Measurements at different levels of the Meteo Tower of vertical wind speed were in good agreement with in situ data. The possibility of manufacturing the microwave instrument for simultaneous measurements of the temperature profile and wind parameters in the ABL will be also discussed in this report.																	0048-6604					MAR 12	2003	38	3							8048	10.1029/2002RS002647								WOS:000182212700001

Two experiments to test and to demonstrate the system took place: one on the coast of Norway, north of Bergen in March 2000 and the second on the north coast of Spain at Gijon in October-November 2000. Qualitative and quantitative intercomparisons of the wave measurements and wave model products from these experiments are presented. These include measurements using the Wellen Radar (WERA) high-frequency (HF) radar, the WaMoS (Wave Monitoring System) X-band radar, a directional Waverider and output from the WAM wave model. Comparisons are made of the full directional spectra and of various derived parameters. This is the first-ever intercomparison between HF and X-band radar wave measurements and between either of these and WAM. It has provided a data set covering a much wider range of storm and swell conditions than had been available previously for radar wave-measurement validation purposes and has clarified a number of limitations of the radars as well as providing a lot of very useful radar wave data for future model-validation applications. The intercomparison has led to improvements in the data quality control procedures of both WaMoS and WERA. The two radar sytems measured significant wave height with mean biases of 3% and 6%, respectively, and mean direction differences of less than 2degrees in both cases. Limitations in the WAM model implementation are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) launched on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra and Aqua spacecrafts is equipped with narrow channels located within a wider wavelength range between 0.4-2.5 mum for a variety of remote sensing applications. The wide spectral range can provide improved capabilities for remote sensing of the more complex and turbid coastal waters (Case 2 water) and for improved atmospheric corrections for ocean scenes. In this paper, we describe an empirical algorithm that uses this wide spectral range to identify areas with suspended sediments in turbid waters and shallow waters with bottom reflections. The algorithm takes advantage of the strong water absorption at wavelengths longer than 1 mum that does not allow illumination of sediments in the water or a shallow ocean floor. MODIS data acquired over the east coast of China, west coast of Africa, Arabian Sea, Mississippi Delta, and west coast of Florida are used in this study.																	0196-2892					MAR	2003	41	3					559	566		10.1109/TGRS.2003.810227								WOS:000182871300006						
J	Haus, BK; Graber, HC; Shay, LK; Cook, TM				Haus, BK; Graber, HC; Shay, LK; Cook, TM			Alongshelf variability of a coastal buoyancy current during the relaxation of downwelling favorable winds	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												High-Frequency Doppler radars synoptically mapped surface currents over the inner-shelf off the North Carolina Outer Banks during the Duck94 experiment. The radar system sampled for the month of October, 1994 over a region 45 to 66 km southeast of the Chesapeake Bay mouth up to 34 km offshore. Concurrently, salinity and temperature were measured at locations 0.5, 1.6, 5.3 and 16.6 km offshore along a cross-shelf transect. Salinities over the shelf ranged from 26.6 to 32.7, with the lower salinities resulting from the intermittent presence of the coastal buoyancy current from the Chesapeake Bay. Three events were observed in which downwelling favorable winds persisted for at least three days, relaxed and then rotated to upwelling favorable. Downwelling favorable winds produced coastal sea level set-up. When the buoyancy current was present, cross-shelf salinity gradients were established between fresher water near the coast and the more saline water offshore. The response of the buoyancy current was sensitive to the temporal evolution of the wind field from downwelling to upwelling favorable. Following downwelling favorable winds the wind typically shifted to an onshore direction and decreased in magnitude. When the alongshelf velocities decreased, the onshore Coriolis force also decreased and the buoyancy current exhibited significant alongshelf variability over scales less than 10 km. Offshore flowing jets and undulations in the flow developed that formed vortices with diameters of 5-10 km following two of the downwelling events. Offshore surface layer velocities were observed between 4 and 16 hours before the wind switched to upwelling favorable. Formation of the vortices was likely triggered by an imbalance in the cross-shelf momentum due to nearshore water level set-up and the decreased onshore Coriolis component.																	0749-0208					SPR	2003	19	2					409	420										WOS:000182896000017						
J	Finkl, CW; Krupa, SL				Finkl, Charles W.; Krupa, Steve L.			Environmental impacts of coastal-plain activities on sandy beach systems: Hazards, perception and mitigation	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Managed sandy beach environments along developed shores often appear safe and healthy because obvious hazards such as beach erosion and flooding are considered within the purview of various mitigation programs. A range of insidious and generally unseen hazards, mostly related to pollution, often pose greater threats to the wellbeing of beach systems than do the highly visible, well publicized shoreline retreat and inundation events. Some unseen hazards, such as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) laden with nutrients from. agro-urban activities on adjacent coastal plains,,are pervasive, processes of environmental degradation that occur so gradually that sequential impacts escape public attention. The contribution of SGDs to the coastal hydrologic regime is occasionally recognized in association with crescendo events associated with marine algal blooms that degrade water quality, bottom habitats, and coral reef ecology. Because the real dangers of SGD are probably unknown at this time, it is essential to initiate seepage meter studies of the already known high levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that are discharged to beach and nearshore environments. Locations of some of the larger submarine freshwater springs along the southeast Florida inner continental shelf are generally known, although volumes of flow have historically been reduced by reduction of head on the coastal plain. Submarine. groundwater provides, on a continual basis, the most direct nutrient linkage to nearshore environments. The insidious nature of the problem requires specialized detection techniques that incorporate site inspection of rock outcrop and reef morphology (for submarine springs and seeps), satellite and airborne remote sensing (coastal morphology, turbidity plumes), physical seepage measurement in situ, monitoring wells, and mini-piezometers to measure hydraulic flow. Discharges of surface water into estuaries exacerbate SGD-related pollution, as do sewage spills and outfall. pipes that discharge in the open ocean fronting beaches. Groundwater discharges for Palm Beach County are, for example, estimated at 1,659 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1). Total N in groundwater below the coastal plain adjacent to remnant Everglades averages about 1.3 mg l(-1). Groundwater nutrient fluxes to the coast are 5727 and 414 metric tons per year for N and P, respectively. Surface water contributions for N and P are respectively 2,473 and 197 metric tons per year. Nutrient delivery to beach and nearshore environments is a serious problem that threatens coastal water quality which in turn will impact beach-related activities. The full impact of the problem has yet to surface because it takes about 5 to 8 decades for groundwater from the interior parts of the coastal plain to reach the nearshore zone. Pollution of groundwaters has increased over the past five decades due to higher doses of fertilizers on croplands and runoff from expanding urban areas. The environmental quality of beach systems along this developed shore is clearly at risk from continuous pollution via nutrient-laden SGD.																	0749-0208					SPR	2003					35		132	150										WOS:000202961200014

The coastal zone evolution is related to a submerging coast, coupled with falling relative sea level from 5,100 years B.P. and muddy flat progradation from riverine sediment supply. The Ajuruteua Beach has a flat, linear and elongated form and is bounded by ebb-tidal deltas. Based on relative tidal level, the barrier-beach ridge Was subdivided in three zones: supratidal zone, where are found dunes and berm, intertidal zone (high, mean and low intertidal zone) and subtidal zone. The Ajuruteua shoreline is subject to two distinct coastal processes and can be subdivided in two sectors: (1) Northwestern (NW) Sector, very vulnerable to shoreline recession with rates. of 2.21 m/month; and (2) Southeastern (SE) Sector, which remains stable or with shoreline accretion with rates of +1.46 m/month. The present beach use is marked by building displacement from shoreline to coastal dunes due owing severe coastal erosion in, the NW Sector. The risks of coastal hazards are related to shoreline change rating and the NW Sector is considered as a high risk area, while the SE Sector is considered as a moderate risk area. The coastal land use has not been regulated, and is occurring an unsustainable exploitation of the, natural landscape. In response to this beach settlement, the natural process of shoreline retreating has been an emergent coastal problem.

J	Nezlin, NP; Li, BL				Nezlin, NP; Li, BL			Time-series analysis of remote-sensed chlorophyll and environmental factors in the Santa Monica-San Pedro Basin off Southern California	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The time-series of remote-sensed surface chlorophyll concentration measured by SeaWiFS radiometer from September 1997 to December 2001 and the relevant hydrological and meteorological factors (remote-sensed sea surface temperature, atmospheric precipitation, air temperature and wind stress) in Santa Monica Bay and adjacent waters off southern California were analyzed using wavelet and cross-correlation statistical methods. All parameters exhibited evident seasonal patterns of variation. Wavelet analysis revealed salient long-term variations most evident in air temperature during El Nino 1997-1998 and in wind stress during La Nina 1998-1999. Short-period (<100 days) variations of remote-sensed chlorophyll biomass were mostly typical to spring seasons. Chlorophyll biomass was significantly correlated with air temperature and wind stress: an increase of chlorophyll biomass followed with 5-6-day time lag an increase of wind stress accompanied by a simultaneous decrease of air temperature. The mechanism of these variations was an intensification of phytoplankton growth resulting from the mixing of water column by wind stress and entrainment of nutrients into the euphotic layer.

The resulting habitat loss highlighted the need for a comprehensive assessment of the extent, characteristics and use of the country's remaining mangrove. This paper reports on the resulting study, and confirms the presence of three true mangroves-Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa, plus one mangrove associate-Conocarpus erectus. Twenty different sub-communities are distinguished on the basis of physiographic setting, vegetation structure and species composition. Of these, Rhizophora scrub is the most widespread, accounting for over 60% of the country's mangrove habitats. True forest sub-communities account for only 10%, the remainder comprises thickets or hypersaline supra-tidal savannas. GIs analysis of 1990 remote sensing data reveals that Belize's mangroves covers 78,511 ha, equivalent to 3.4% of the country's land area and approximately 2% of the mangrove remaining in the Americas. Through the examination of early aerial photos, historical records and ground conditions, it is estimated that about 98% of Belize's original mangrove cover (80,016 ha) remained at this time. However, more recent mapping for the Belize City area, using 1992 aerial photos, reveals that a further 519 ha has been cleared, a 0.7% reduction in the national total in just two years. The main geographical factors controlling the distribution of mangroves in Belize are the presence of the barrier reef, the coastline's shallow gradient and the narrow tidal range. Mangrove distribution is further influenced by local subsidence, geomorphology, drainage, hinterland soils and past hurricane tracks. How much mangrove cover Belize may support in the future is thought to largely depend on two factors-hurricane activity and human influence. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The acoustic seabed classification system QTC VIEW(TM) was used to map the acoustic diversity between 5 and 40 in water depth on the shelf off "Ria de Aveiro", Western coast of Portugal. Ground-truth was undertaken using an analysis of superficial sediments grain-size, and compared to the species composition and distribution of macrofaunal communities. Sedimentary and biological data were submitted to ordination analysis, and the acoustic data to both ordination and cluster analysis. The acoustic classes identified were mapped using a geographical information system. The acoustic results showed a very clear. geographic pattern, with the acoustic classification being coincident where survey lines crossed, confirming the stability of the classification procedure. At the optimal splitting level, three acoustic classes were obtained. These classes were correlated to differences in coarse, fine and very fine sands. Additional real bottom differences in the grain-size of the coarser sand classes were not detected by the acoustic method, possibly due to the fact that they showed a similar degree of compactness., The benthic ecological data suggests only two main communities, which correspond to the outcomes of a two-class acoustic split. Therefore, a mismatch was noticed between the optimal acoustic split and the number of major biological communities present. However, by dropping the acoustic solution down to two classes, an optimal relationship to benthic communities is achieved. Overall, results suggest that the acoustic system provides very valuable and important data for mapping soft sediment biotopes, even in areas of relative bottom monotony such as the one analysed, but careful ground-truth is required to ensure that the acoustic class splits are biologically relevant.

J	Hara, T; Hanson, KA; Bock, EJ; Uz, BM				Hara, T; Hanson, KA; Bock, EJ; Uz, BM			Observation of hydrodynamic modulation of gravity-capillary waves by dominant gravity waves	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Accurate evaluation of the hydrodynamic modulation of short wind waves by dominant gravity waves is needed for various applications of microwave radar remote sensing of the ocean surface. Such knowledge is also essential for the studies of wind wave coupling and air-sea momentum/energy transfer. Here, we present direct field observations of the hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) during two field programs (High-Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment (High-Res) off Cape Hatteras, June 1993, and Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) experiment off the California coast, April and May 1995). Gravity-capillary wave spectra were obtained using a scanning laser slope gauge (SLSG) for wave numbers between 25 and 800 rad m(-1). An array of capacitive wave wires and a motion detection package were used for the measurement of surface gravity waves. These instruments were mounted on a research catamaran, which was towed to the side of a research vessel. The observations were mostly made under low wind conditions. The observed coherence is mostly below 0.1, suggesting that the modulation of short wind waves is not strongly correlated with dominant gravity waves. The coherence is slightly higher for wave numbers 50-100 rad m(-1) than for wave numbers above 200 rad m(-1). When wind and dominant waves are aligned and the water surface is clean, the magnitude of the hydrodynamic MTF is around 2-4 and its phase is close to 0. When surfactants are present and short wind wave spectra are reduced, the MTF magnitudes become significantly larger for wave numbers above 200 rad m(-1). When wind and dominant waves are not aligned, the coherence becomes lower as expected. The results from the two field experiments are roughly consistent with each other. The existing relaxation model may predict the hydrodynamic MTF values that are roughly consistent with the observations if the effect of modulated wind stress over gravity waves is included.

Factors that contribute to uncertainty in scatterometer winds are isolated and examined as functions of wind speed. For SeaWinds on QuikSCAT, ambiguity selection is found to be near perfect for surface wind speed (w) > 8 m s(-1); however, ambiguity selection errors cause directional uncertainty to exceed 20 for w < &SIM;5 m s(-1). These average uncertainties for wind speed and direction are found to be 0.45 m s(-1) and 5&DEG; for the QSCAT-1 model function and 0.3 m s(-1) and 3&DEG; for the Ku-2000 model function. The QuikSCAT winds are examined as vectors through two new approaches. The first is a method for determining vector correlations that considers uncertainty in the comparison data set. The second approach is a wind speed-dependent model for the uncertainty in the magnitude of vector errors. For the QSCAT-1 (Ku-2000) model function this approach shows ambiguity selection dominates uncertainty for 2.5 < w < 5.5 m s(-1) (0.6 < w < 5.5 m s(-1)), uncertainty in wind speed dominates for w < 2.5 m s(-1) and 5.5 < w < 7.5 m s(-1) (w < 0.6 m s(-1) and 5.5 < w < 18 m s(-1)), and uncertainty in wind direction (for correctly selected ambiguities) dominates for w > 7.5 m s(-1) (w > 18 m s(-1)). This approach also shows that spatial variability in the wind direction, related to inexact spatial co-location, is likely to dominate rms differences between scatterometer wind vectors and in situ comparison measurements for w > 4.5 m s(-1). The techniques used herein are applicable to any validation effort with uncertainty in the comparison data set or with inexact co-location.

The experiments were carried out over two seasons, both before the peak of the phytoplankton growth period, and during the bloom events. The first study was made when the concentration of chlorophyll (phytoplankton pigment) was similar in both waters and in the range of 0.6-3.23 mg m(-3). The second study was made when concentrations of chlorophyll were very high, reaching 14 mg m(-3) in the west coast of Ireland and 70 mg m(-3) in Southern Baltic. Optical measurements of surface reflectance were made with a prdfiling spectroradiometer. The spectral shapes of the particulate absorption spectra and the diffuse attenuation coefficient in both regions and seasons are compared. The contribution of detritus and coloured dissolved organic matter absorption to the apparent optical properties of water have impact on the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval algorithm for chlorophyll a. Differences have been found between algorithms based on conventional spectral bands (e.g. SeaWiFS) and proposed new spectral channels. The most accurate ratio for chlorophyll retrieval (490/550) was for the western Irish shelf (R-2=76%, and the standard error of the estimate ranged from 30% to 37%), with poor results for this ratio in the Baltic. The R-rs (550/590) ratio gave better results for the Baltic (R-2=75%, and the standard error of the estimate ranged from 20% to 55%), with poor results for the Irish shelf. The results show that a unique combination of spectral bands needs to be applied in Baltic waters to achieve an acceptable accuracy of the in-water remote sensing algorithm whereas the more commonly accepted band ratios were acceptable for the Irish Shelf. This suggests that for accurate determination of chlorophyll from satellite-borne sensors in different coastal waters a wider choice of spectral bands is needed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

After achieving final orbit, MODIS began earth observations in late February 2000 and has been acquiring data since that time. The instrument is also being flown on the Aqua spacecraft, launched in May 2002. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud detection and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties have been developed by members of the MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, as well as fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. We will describe the various algorithms being used for the remote sensing of cloud properties from MODIS data with an emphasis on the pixel-level retrievals (referred to as Level-2 products), with 1-km or 5-km spatial resolution at nadir. An example of each Level-2 cloud product from a common data granule (5 min of data) off the coast of South America will be discussed. Future efforts will also be mentioned. Relevant points related to the global gridded statistics products (Level-3) are highlighted though additional details are given in an accompanying paper in this issue.

Model characteristics such as polarization and azimuthal dependence are illustrated through numerical calculations. Predictions of the model are compared with rare field measurements made in a crosswind environment. Measurements were obtained at a 2degrees grazing angle. These data, collected by X- and Ka-band (9.3 and 34.6 GHz) radars under crosswind during the 1995 Coastal Ocean Probing Experiment (COPE) off the Oregon Coast, indicate that the backscatter intensity of local "sea-spikes'' measured with horizontal transmit-and-receive polarization (HH) reaches or exceeds that measured with the vertical transmit-and-receive polarization (VV). We suggest that for low grazing angles and in a crosswind environment, a radar geometrical condition can occur where some HH-spikes can be dominated by vertically polarized scattered radiation due to cross tilt of a long wave, when its local slope becomes greater than 45degrees.																	0048-6604					JAN 30	2003	38	2							8037	10.1029/2002RS002672								WOS:000182909800001

The study focuses on the 24 March 1998 Tramontane/Mistral event, which occurred over the Gulf of Lion (GoL) (western Mediterranean) in the framework of the flux, etat de mer et teledetection en condition de fetch variable (FETCH) experiment. Comparisons of SSM/I and ALADIN IWVCs with collocated shipborne microwave radiometry, at distances from the coast between 50 and 100 km, were carried out on a full diurnal cycle. In the morning, when moister conditions prevailed, the agreement between SSM/I (one passage) and DRAKKAR was good while the bias observed in the afternoon (three passages) was larger (i.e., 2 kg m(2)). Reasons for this are investigated. We show that this is due to the fact that the sensitivity limit of the algorithm has been reached during very dry Mistral conditions. This bias is not explained by effects of land contamination, which is shown to remain below 0.2 kg m(-2). No systematic bias was observed between ALADIN and DRAKKAR. Nevertheless, the trend observed on the DRAKKAR data between 1430 and 2030 UT was best captured by SSM/I despite the sensitivity issue. SSM/I and ALADIN IWVC estimates were also found to be in good agreement with collocated airborne lidar measurements, thereby reproducing the spatial evolution of the IWVC with the distance to the coast.				tournadre, jean/F-8402-2010	tournadre, jean/0000-0003-1159-4388												2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN 11	2003	108	C3							8056	10.1029/2001JC001068								WOS:000181568200001

Airborne measurements of both the coarse and fine mode aerosol during these campaigns provided assessment of the spatial variability in aerosol parameters (including optical properties and degree of internal versus external mixing) in continental plumes encountered over the Pacific Ocean. Large perturbations to the "pristine'' marine atmosphere were observed. Most plumes were encountered in the Southern Hemisphere during PEMT A, while the opposite was observed during PEMT B. A variety of anthropogenic and natural sources for these continental plumes are suggested by the data, including biomass burning, urban/industrial emissions, and in the case of Asian outflow, dust storms. Aerosol size distributions (particularly for the refractory component) varied from one plume to another and most combustion-derived aerosol appeared to be an internal mix of a refractory soot-like constituent in a volatile matrix. Within the sampled plumes, size-resolved volatility suggested that this volatile matrix was relatively well neutralized, implying the presence of ammonia in the particle phase. The radiatively important single scatter albedo () obtained from measured "dry'' scattering and absorption coefficients ranged from approximately 0.88 (pollution with no coarse particles) to 0.94 (pollution and dust) in the free troposphere (FT) to 0.98 (pollution and sea salt) within the marine boundary layer (MBL). Vertical profiles often revealed more concentrated plumes aloft, typically situated in dry air with ambient relative humidity (RH) <40%, and much lower values of omega than in the underlying MBL.																	2169-897X					JAN 3	2003	108	D2							8236	10.1029/2001JD001451								WOS:000181499400001

As is frequently the case in agriculture, available ground-based leaf area measurements employed by growers are not well suited to larger area mapping. In this study, IKONOS high spatial resolution, multispectral satellite imagery was used to map leaf area throughout two commercial wine grape vineyards (approximately 800 ha) in California's North Coast growing region. The imagery was collected near harvest during the 2000 growing season, converted to at-sensor radiance, geo-referenced and transformed to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on a per pixel basis. Measurements at 24 ground calibration sites were used to convert NDVI maps to leaf area index (LAI: m(2) leaf area m(-2) ground area); planting density was then used to express leaf area on a per vine basis (LA(v)). Image-based LA(v) was significantly correlated with ground-based LA, estimates developed at 23 validation sites (r(2) = 0.72; P < 0.001). Despite challenges posed by the discontinuous nature of vineyard canopies and architectural differences imposed by shoot positioning trellis systems, remote sensing appears to offer a basis for mapping vineyard leaf area in low LAI vineyards. Such maps can potentially be used to parameterize plant growth models or provide decision support for irrigation and canopy management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Past morphological and hydrodynamic structures were obtained by means of Remote Sensing technique and obtained data have been transferred to GIS. Results extracted from these measurements were compared with the bathymetric map and visualized by means of GIS. Our proposal is to use remotely sensed data combined with GIS in the cases where the data obtained via ground measurements have been inadequate. It has been shown that the integrated approach can be used satisfactorily in order to predict the possible effects of a river induced parameters such as turbidity on the coasts, because the suspended material in the water can be used as the tracer material in interpretation of remotely sensed data.																	1093-4529						2003	38	8					1669	1679		10.1081/ESE-120021488								WOS:000184522700023	12929816					
J	Cooley, PM; Barber, DG				Cooley, PM; Barber, DG			Remote sensing of the coastal zone of tropical lakes using synthetic aperture radar and optical data	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The coastal zone of Lake Malawi contains the greatest diversity of freshwater ichthyofauna in the world. The distribution of habitats along the coast has played an important role in the speciation of fishes but has not been mapped using remote sensing due to cloud cover. The discrimination of rock, sand, and vegetated coasts of tropical Lake Malawi are investigated using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data. The effects of coherent fading, look direction, and incident angle on SAR backscatter are investigated using eight fine-beam RADARSAT SGX images covering 31 km of coast. Adaptive filter trials demonstrate pixels with relatively low backscatter values are identified as image noise most frequently. For each class most of the SAR backscatter averages derived from high and low incident angles within each look direction are similar or within sensor calibration limits. Average rock, sand, and vegetated image tones derived from shoreline segments 150 m in length are statistically separable. Linear discriminant Analyses (LDA) of the RADARSAT and SPOT data are used to attain maximal separation for 33% of rock, sand, and vegetated coastal data and to predict class membership for the 67% of coast for which class membership is known. The RADARSAT and SPOT are treated independently and then combined to use the complementary information available in multi-sensor data sets. LDA of a single extra fine beam RADARSAT image can separate rock, sand, and vegetation using SAR backscatter, coastal slope, and the angle of the shoreline relative to the satellite. Overall classification agreement is 98.5%. LDA of the four multispectral SPOT bands provided classification agreement of 79.3%. Coastal class discrimination is improved with the addition of one or more SAR images to the SPOT data. Classification is not improved above 98.9% when more than one SAR image is added to the data from SPOT. SAR data can be used to map rock, sand, and vegetated coastal Zones in areas of persistent cloud cover.																	0380-1330						2003	29			2			62	75		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70539-5								WOS:000221126800006						
J	Hinkler, J; Orbaek, JB; Hansen, BU				Hinkler, J; Orbaek, JB; Hansen, BU			Detection of spatial, temporal, and spectral surface changes in the Ny-Alesund area 79 degrees N, Svalbard, using a low cost multispectral camera in combination with spectroradiometer measurements	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					6th International Scientific Seminar on Changing Physical Environment	OCT 08-10, 2002	TROMSO, NORWAY					Changes in surface reflection at the arctic tundra at Ny-(A) over circle lesund, Svalbard (79degrees N) were monitored during the melting season 2002 using a low cost multispectral digital camera with spectral channels similar to channels 2, 3, and 4 of the Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite sensor. The camera was placed 474 m above sea level at the Zeppelin Mountain Research Station and was programmed to take an image automatically every day at solar noon. To achieve areal consistency in the images (which is necessary for mapping purposes) the images were geometrically rectified into multispectral digital orthophotos. In contrast to satellite images with high spatial resolution the orthophotos provide data with high spatial and high temporal resolution at low cost. The study area covers approximately 2 kin 2 and when free of snow, it mainly consists of typical high arctic tundra with patchy vegetation and bare-soil in between. The spectral information in the images was used to divide the rectified images into maps representing different surface classes (including three subclasses of snow). By combining classified image data and ground measurements of spectral surface reflectance, a methodology to produce daily maps of surface albedo was developed. The method takes into account the effect of decreasing snow-albedo with ageing snow pack, and the very rapid decrease of albedo when the snow pack is shallow (<10 cm) which is due to influence from the underlying ground. The time series of modelled albedo-maps shows that the snow melt period (when the albedo decreases from 80% to 20%) varies from less than 10 days in areas near the coast or in the Ny-(A) over circle lesund settlement till more than 70 days in areas with large snow or ice accumulations. For the entire study area the mean length of the 2002 melting period was 28.3 days with a standard deviation of 15.1 days. Finally, the duration of the snowmelt season at a location where it has been measured routinely since 1980, was calculated to 23 days, which is very close to what is the average for the last two decades.

Most of the research has been performed during the 1990s and includes investigations of snow distribution, snowmelt, snow pack characteristics, remote sensing of snow and biological studies where snow conditions play an important role. For example, studies have shown regional trends with about 50% higher amounts of snow accumulation at the east coast of Spitsbergen compared to the west coast. Further, the accumulation rates are about twice as high in the south compared to the north. On average, the increase in accumulation with elevation is 97 mm water equivalents per 100 m increase in elevation. Several researchers reported melt rates, which are primarily driven by incoming short-wave radiation, in the range of 10 - 20 mm/day during spring. Maximum melt rates close to 70 mm/day have been measured. In addition to presenting an overview of research activities, we discuss new, unpublished results in areas where considerable progress is being made. These are i) modelling of snow distribution, ii) modelling of snowmelt runoff and iii) monitoring of snow coverage by satellite imagery. We also identify some weaknesses in current research activities. They are lacks of i) integration between various studies, ii) comparative studies with other Arctic regions, iii) applying local field studies in models that can be used to study larger areas of Svalbard and, finally, iv) using satellite remote sensing data for operational monitoring purposes.																	0800-0395						2003	22	2					125	144		10.1111/j.1751-8369.2003.tb00103.x								WOS:000187618900002						
J	Agenbag, JJ; Richardson, AJ; Demarcq, H; Freon, P; Weeks, S; Shillington, FA				Agenbag, JJ; Richardson, AJ; Demarcq, H; Freon, P; Weeks, S; Shillington, FA			Estimating environmental preferences of South African pelagic fish species using catch size- and remote sensing data	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We have studied the relationship between the variations in density of South African anchovy (Engraulisi capensis), sardine (Sardinops sagax) and round herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) from commercial catch records (1987-1997) and a suite of variables describing the environment. The indicator of density (local fish abundance) used was Catch-perset, obtained from the more than 130 000 catches made during the 11-year study period. The set of environmental parameters included: temporal (Year, Month, time of day or Hour), spatial (Latitude, Longitude and water Depth), lunar (Moon phase and Moon elevation), and thermal conditions of the environment (sea surface temperature together with indices of thermal frontal intensity and temporal change). Boat length was used to account for fishing gear effects. Previous investigations of this nature have tended to use simple bivariate correlation approaches, which suffer from the problem of covariance between the predictive variable and other environmental- or fisheries related variables not included in the analysis. We have, therefore, adopted a multivariate modelling approach, which identifies relationships between Catch-per-set and each environmental variable, accounting for covariation amongst predictors. Model building consisted of first constructing generalised additive models (GAM) as an exploratory tool to identify the shapes of the relationships, followed by parameterising these relationships using general linear models (GLM) to provide a robust predictive tool. Using this modelling approach, the suite of environmental variables explained 19.6% of the variation in Catch-per-set of anchovy, 33.9% of sardine, and 54.3% of round herring in the final GLM models. Temporal variables (Year, Month, Hour), accounted for the major part of the variability in Catch-per-set but variables derived from SST and the lunar cycle provide insight into the effects of environmental factors on fish behaviour. For instance, it appears that schooling behaviour of anchovy and round herring is affected by the level of solar and lunar illumination but that sardine is not affected. Model results further indicate that anchovies prefer water cooler than about 15 degreesC, demonstrates a weak tendency to concentrate near thermal fronts and avoids recently upwelled water. The sardine's preferences seem to be more or less the opposite to anchovy, i.e. it occur further from the coast and tends to concentrate in upwelled water which have been warmed to 14-19 degreesC; it shows no discernible tendency for aggregation near fronts. Round herring Catch-per-set strongly increases with water depth and reach a maximum near the shelf edge; it also demonstrates a notable tendency to concentrate near thermal fronts. SST seems to have no influence on round herring which is most often caught in the 15-18 degreesC range, typical of SSTs found in the vicinity of the oceanic front. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a newly developed non-linear and non-stationary time series data processing method, was also employed in the analysis. A combination of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) - 1/2 scatterometer, NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) and NASA's Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) winds covering the period from January 1992 to April 2000 and the area of 0-50degreesN, 100-148degreesE constitutes the baseline for this study. The results indicate that annual cycles dominate the two leading VEOF modes. The first VEOF shows the East Asian monsoon features and the second represents a spring-autumn oscillation. We removed the annual signal from the data set and calculated the interannual VEOFs. The first interannual VEOF represents the interannual variability existing in the spring-autumn oscillation. The temporal mode is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (Sol), but has a half-year lag with respect to the SOI. The spatial mode of the first interannual VEOF reflects the response of the tropical and extratropical winds to ENSO events. The second interannual VEOF is another ENSO related mode, and the temporal VEOF mode is correlated with the SOI with a correlation coefficient of 0.78, revealing the wind variability over mid-latitudes, which is associated with ENSO events. Further analysis indicated that the wind variability over the coast of East Asia represents anomalies of a Hadley cell. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) was found in the temporal mode, indicating and verifying that the QBO in the wind fields is related to ENSO events. The third VEOF shows the interannaul variability in the winter-summer mode and displays the interannual variability of the East Asian monsoon. The three leading interannual VEOFs are statistically meaningful as confirmed by a significance test. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The Riva is the largest river in this region, which flows into the Black Sea and also gives its' name to the area. The river carries some amount of sediments to the Black Sea. These particles cause considerable changes not only in the bed bathymetry and coastal boundaries of the river but also along the coastline of the Black Sea. The aim of this study is to determine these variations by means of satellite data and GIS. In the study, satellite images dated 1975, 1984, 1992 and 2001 have been used. At the end of the study, the possibility of observing bathymetric changes in front of the coastline by means of satellite data has been investigated and results were evaluated and visualised by means of GIS.																	0273-1223						2003	48	10					135	142										WOS:000188262600019	15137163					
J	Harvey, KR; Hill, GJE				Harvey, KR; Hill, GJE			Mapping the nesting habitats of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, Northern Territory: an approach using remote sensing and GIS	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												The utility of integrating remotely sensed data and other spatial information in a geographical information system (GIS) to model habitat suitability for nesting by saltwater crocodiles ( Crocodylus porosus) was investigated in this study. The study areas, Melacca Swamp and the Adelaide River wetlands, are located 50 km east of Darwin, Northern Territory, and encompass areas of suitable nesting habitat for C. porosus. Melacca Swamp is a highly productive nesting area and is managed as a conservation reserve to protect its nesting habitat. Landsat TM, SPOT satellite imagery and large-scale colour aerial photography were evaluated for their utility in mapping habitats preferred for nesting by C. porosus within Melacca Swamp. Satellite imagery was capable of identifying generalised habitat classes used for nesting ( e. g. open swamp with emergent trees). However, it was only with aerial photography that habitats could be discerned ( e. g. sedges with scattered Melaleuca trees). Spatial information derived from satellite imagery and other sources was integrated in a GIS to model potentially suitable nesting habitat along the Adelaide River. This methodology effectively identified known preferred nesting areas of C. porosus on the basis of the analysis of environmental parameters (i.e. distance to water, vegetation type) that have an influence on selection of nesting habitat. The findings of this research demonstrate the utility of remote sensing and GIS for mapping nesting habitat of C. porosus at a range of scales and provide guidelines for application of the approaches used at the regional or State level.																	1035-3712						2003	30	4					365	375		10.1071/WR00008								WOS:000185267400007

Following a period of cold SST and low sea levels in 1996, both were anomalously high between March 1997 and May 1998. The anomalies were greatest between 5degreesS and 15degreesS, although they extended beyond 40degreesS. Two distinct peaks in sea level and SST occurred in June-July 1997 and December 1997 to January 1998, separated by a relaxation period (August-November) of weaker anomalies. Satellite winds were upwelling favorable throughout the time period for most of the region and in fact increased between November 1997 and March 1998 between 5degreesS and 25degreesS. Satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations are available for November 1996 to June 1997 (Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS)) and then from October 1997 to present (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS)). Near-surface chlorophyll concentrations fell from May to June 1997 and from December 1997 to March 1998. The decrease was more pronounced in northern Chile than off the coast of Peru or central Chile and was stronger for larger cross-shelf averaging bins since nearshore concentrations remained relatively high.																	0148-0227					DEC 31	2002	107	C12							3236	10.1029/2001JC001183								WOS:000181233700005						
J	Bingham, FM; Howden, SD; Koblinsky, CJ				Bingham, FM; Howden, SD; Koblinsky, CJ			Sea surface salinity measurements in the historical database	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We have examined historical distributions of sea surface salinity (SSS) observations in a data set consisting of a combination of the World Ocean Database 1998 (WOD98) and a thermosalinograph and bucket salinity database collected from volunteer observing ships. It is well known that SSS in much of the world's ocean is measured infrequently or not at all. We find that 27% of one-degree squares in the world ocean (open and coastal, excluding the Arctic Ocean) had no observations of SSS in the historical database, and 70% had 10 or fewer. Systematic sampling of SSS (more than 10,000 observations per year globally) did not start until after 1960. Most SSS observations in the WOD98 are concentrated in the North Sea and coast of northern Europe, the east and west coasts of North America, and around Japan. About 28% of SSS measurements are in coastal waters. We plotted frequency histograms of SSS for some selected well-sampled one-degree squares in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific. We found most frequency histograms to be non-Gaussian. The main departure from normal distribution is due to anomalous low-salinity measurements creating a negative skewness. This conclusion is verified as a global phenomenon by examining statistics of mean-median SSS difference within one-degree squares. This quantity is found to be predominantly negative over the global ocean. These anomalous low-salinity values may be due to rainfall events, but there are other plausible physical mechanisms, like frontal movement and eddy activity. There were also areas where the distributions were bimodal due to the presence of meandering fronts with little cross-frontal mixing. Examples are shown where the non-Gaussian nature of the distributions in the areas examined is both a short-term and a long-term phenomenon. That is, the distributions are skewed on a nearly instantaneous (similar to1 month) basis and averaged over long time periods (1+years). This has important implications for climatologies because the differences between mean and modal SSS, for the analyzed one-degree squares, is of order 0.1. Furthermore, the implication for validation studies for remote sensing missions is that the studies must make enough measurements of SSS to determine the extent to which the probability density is not Gaussian.

A submarine outfall releases wastewater into the ocean c. 3 km directly offshore (at similar to16 m water depth) from S. Jacinto, 5 km to the north of the inlet to the estuarine coastal lagoon system of the Ria de Aveiro. The buoyant plume has a distinctive reddish brown colour and is clearly visible at the water surface. The transport and dispersion of the plume was monitored by airborne photography and by in situ water sampling. Results revealed the surface currents present and water mass fronts in the nearshore zone of the Aveiro coast. During the spring and summer, the plume was not transported offshore in the manner expected by the upwelling shelf circulation. Instead, it was commonly observed to be transported alongshore with the prevailing southerly circulation or with an onshore component. The transport to the south caused the outfall plume to interact with the circulation associated with the tidal currents generated in the inlet channel to the Ria de Aveiro. The observations suggest that the trophic status of the Ria de Aveiro is unlikely to change because of the operation of the submarine outfall. Furthermore, this study demonstrates how simple observations of wastewater discharge from a submarine outfall can be used to improve understanding of nearshore circulation.

Rijkswaterstaat sets up a production chain for such maps using a hyperspectral imaging scanner installed in the Dutch coast guard aircraft. Water quality parameters are retrieved from remote-sensed images using successively: (1) a module calculating the subsurface reflectance spectra and (2) a module calculating the concentrations using specific inherent optical properties (SIOP) of the water constituents and the Gordon reflectance model implemented in a matrix inversion technique. The accuracy of several numerical methods for retrieval of concentrations from reflectance spectra was assessed. Effects of instrumental noise, errors in the atmospheric correction and errors in the specific inherent optical properties on the derived concentrations were also estimated. A benchmark data set was collected for Lake Veluwe in the Netherlands. For ideal circumstances, two of the tested numerical methods were able to retrieve both total suspended matter as well as chlorophyll concentration. For less favourable circumstances, total suspended matter could still be retrieved, but chlorophyll became less accurate. Dissolved organic matter concentrations could not be retrieved for any case. Application of the matrix inversion technique tested on an airborne image from Lake Veluwe showed promising results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This form of remote sensing, also known as "topographic lidar", has undergone extremely rapid development during the last two decades, and has the potential to contribute within a wide range of coastal scientific investigations. Various airborne laser surveying (ALS) applications that are relevant to coastal studies are being pursued by researchers in a range of Earth science disciplines. Examples include the mapping of "bald earth" land surfaces below even moderately dense vegetation in studies of geologic framework and hydrology, and determination of the vegetation canopy structure, a key variable in mapping wildlife habitats. ALS has also proven to be an excellent method for the regional mapping of geomorphic change along barrier island beaches and other sandy coasts due to storms or long-term sedimentary processes. Coastal scientists are adopting ALS as a basic method in the study of an array of additional coastal topics. ALS can provide useful information in the analysis of shoreline change, the prediction and assessment of landslides along seacliffs and headlands, examination of subsidence causing coastal land loss, and in predicting storm surge and tsunami inundation.																	0749-0208					WIN	2002	18	1					1	13										WOS:000174006900001

However, its application to the study of tidal flats has not been investigated in detail. The waterline in a tidal flat in Gomso Bay, Korea is characterized and evaluated using 27 sets of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and Earth Observing System-Terra (EOS-Terra) Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Radiometer (ASTER) data. Ground truth data including grain size, soil moisture content, ground levelling, and waterline tracking have been obtained. The choice of spectral bands in terms of tidal conditions turned out to play a key role in locating the waterline. While the waterlines extracted from near-infrared (NIR), short-wavelength infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) data are commonly reliable on the flood tide, the discrepancies between different bands become large on the ebb tide. The bands TIR, NIR, and SWIR are, in that order, decreasingly effective in extracting the waterline while ebb tides are in progress. The effect of turbid water on NIR can be reduced by a ratioing of NIR and the visible band. The location of the waterline is also an important factor to consider; the discrepancy is largest on the middle tidal flat. Selection of the proper band for waterline extraction under various conditions is suggested. However, no single band can accommodate all aspects of the tidal flat environment. A schematic model associated with the spectral reflectance of the tidal flat is proposed in which the remnant water scattered on the surface after exposure is emphasized as an additional factor.

The concentration of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a primary factor affecting the absorption of incident sunlight in coastal and estuarine waters. In estuaries, CDOM concentrations vary due to changes in salinity gradients, inflows of industrial and domestic effluents, and the production of new dissolved organic matter from marine biologic activity. CDOM absorption data have been collected from a variety of waters. However, there are a limited number of measurements along the US east coast and a general lack of data from New England waters. This study characterized the temporal and spatial variability of CDOM absorption over an annual cycle in Narragansett Bay and Block Island Sound (Rhode Island). Results suggested that, in Narragansett Bay, the magnitude of CDOM absorption is related to the seasonal variability of freshwater input from surrounding watersheds and new CDOM production from in situ biologic activity. The data show that the average CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm was 0.45 m(-1) and the average spectral slope was 0.020 nm(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, with a population density exceeding 800/km(2) and a rugged steep sloping land, problems abound in the country calling for holistic-approach studies. Only remote sensing, whose use is new in Lebanon can secure such needed studies within a scientific and pragmatic framework. The paper demonstrates for the concerned themes, the innovative use of remote sensing in such a difficult terrain, giving three examples of major environmental problems in the coastal mountains. Only few studies have so far focused on those mountains, notably application of remote sensing. The rugged mountainous terrain receives considerable rain, but the water is quickly lost running on the steep slopes, or infiltrating through fractures and the karstic conduits into the subsurface. Field investigations are difficult to achieve, therefore, remote sensing helps reveal various surface land features important in reflecting water feeding into the subsurface. Optical, radar and thermal infrared remotely sensed data cover a wide spectrum serving that purpose. A map of preferential groundwater accumulation potential is produced. It can serve for better water exploitation as well as protection. Because the terrain is karstic and rugged, the subsurface water flow is difficult to discern. Any pollution at a certain spot would certainly spread around. This constitutes the second example of environmental problems facing the mountainous areas in Lebanon. An integrated approach using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) gives good results in finding out the likelihood of how pollution, or contaminants, can selectively move in the subsurface. A diagnostic analysis with a GIS-type software acts as a guide producing indicative maps for the above purpose. The third example given deals with the problem of losing soil, which is a very vital source in such mountainous land. With steep slopes, torrential rain and improper human interference, run-off is high and water-soil erosion is continuously deteriorating the land cover. Remote sensing can facilitate studying the factors enhancing the process, such as soil type, slope gradient, drainage, geology and land cover. Digital elevation models created from SAR imagery contribute significantly to assessing vulnerability of hydric-soil erosion over such a difficult terrain. GIS layers of the above factors are integrated with erosional criteria to produce a risk map of soil erosion. Results indicate that 36% of the Lebanese terrain is under threat of high-level erosion, and 52% of that is concentrated in the rugged mountainous regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Bowers, DG; Gaffney, S; White, M; Bowyer, P				Bowers, DG; Gaffney, S; White, M; Bowyer, P			Turbidity in the southern Irish Sea	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												This paper presents new in situ optical and associated measurements from 85 stations in the central and southern Irish Sea. There is a strong linear relationship between the irradiance reflectance R-A in the orange-red part of the spectrum (580-680 nm) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K, for white light: K = 0.05 + 0.26 R-A, where K is in m(-1) and R-A has been corrected to just above-surface reflectance and expressed as a percentage. The significance of this result is that this particular reflectance can be measured by the advanced very high resolution radiometer on board the NOAA series of satellites. In principle, therefore, cloud cover permitting, the transparency of the Irish Sea to sunlight, can be mapped from space. This result is shown to be consistent with a simple optical model in which light scattering is principally by mineral suspended solids, and light absorption is by water, mineral suspended solids and chlorophyll. Best fit between model and observations is achieved with a specific scattering coefficient of 0.5 m(2) g(-1). The measurements were made during four cruises, at different times of year and across the range of turbidity found in the Irish Sea. The geographical distribution of suspended sediments confirms the presence, previously inferred from satellite imagery, of two separate turbidity maxima, one off Wicklow Head, the other off Anglesey. These correspond to the areas of strongest tidal currents. Yellow substance was found in highest concentration in a band along the Irish coast. Chlorophyll concentrations were generally low during these cruises. A residual problem is that a direct comparison of in situ reflectance and satellite measured reflectance possible on one of the cruises shows a serious discrepancy, although on average there appears to be a good agreement between satellite and in situ reflectance.

J	Hojerslev, NK; Aarup, T				Hojerslev, NK; Aarup, T			Optical measurements on the Louisiana Shelf off the Mississippi River	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Optical measurements (UV-B downward irradiance (E-d(310)), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), light scattering b(655), beam attenuation c(631), ratios of nadir upward radiances (i.e. colour-index), Secchi disc depth and chlorophyll a fluorescence) and CTD measurements were gathered along a cross shelf transect at approximately 92degreesW on the Louisiana Shelf during one cruise in April 1987 and two cruises in February and July 1988. Large cross shelf variability in the optical properties was found over a relatively small spatial scale of about 150 km. In terms of optical water mass classification, Jerlov coastal water type 7 was found near the coast while Jerlov oceanic water type IB was predominant at the shelf edge. The UV-B irradiance measurements showed a negative correlation with salinity which points to the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers as a major source of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the region. Very clear water was found on the shelf edge in July 1988 and extremely high UV-B irradiance transmission was measured. The 1%-depth for UV-B downward irradiance was 65.2 m, corresponding to a K-d(310)-value of 0.0706 m(-1). This value is approximately 50% lower than the pure water value, K-w(310) of 0.116 m(-1) as given by Smith and Baker (Applied Optics, 20, 177-184) and often used in inverse methods. This result suggests that absorption in the UV-B region by pure water should be re-examined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The water quality at two 'hot spot' areas along the Mediterranean coast of Israel was mapped with the hyper-spectral Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) sensor during two airborne campaigns (April 1997 and October 1999). The present study demonstrates the advantage of hyper-spectral remote sensing techniques as a rapid synoptic monitoring tool in coastal sites affected by land-based point sources of nutrients and particles. The coastal sites are characterized by patchy distribution and sharp concentration changes of SPM and Chl a. It is suggested that integration of CASI in compliance monitoring at 'hot spot' areas can provide vital information on the state of the environment and on the effectiveness of pollution control measures taken.																	1018-4619	1610-2304				OCT	2002	11	10A			SI		782	787										WOS:000180159600011

It is a dynamic and complex system that is vulnerable to human activities. This article summarizes results of geo-environmental mapping in the northwestern delta. Geo-environments are land- and water-resource units that are defined by the physical, chemical, hydrological, and biological properties and processes that establish, maintain, and modify them. More than 20 geo-environments were defined and delineated in a Geographic Information System (GIS) format through integrated remote sensing, statistical, and field analyses. Map units were grouped into five major geomorphic/ecologic systems: 1) marine-influenced coast; 2) marine-influenced distributary-channel. and island, 3) fluvial/marine transitional, 4) distributary-channel, and 5) interdistributary basin. The most extensive, are the interdistributary basins and distributary-channel systems, which comprise 44% and 15% of the map area, respectively. Although the Orinoco Delta is largely undeveloped, human activity in the northwestern delta,,especially construction of the Volcan dam, has substantially altered geo-environments in this region. The defined distribution and characteristics of the geo-environments provide a basis for designing strategic plans for prudent and sustained development of this portion of the Orinoco Delta ecosystem complex.																	0378-1844					OCT	2002	27	10					521	+										WOS:000178717400003

In the Pampa del Tamarugal, 50 km from the sea, conditions exist for the formation of radiation fog. Advective fog has been studied on the coast and orographic fog was observed at a few coastal sites near mountain ranges with elevations above 1000 in. Fog water collected by two standard fog collectors (SFC) for 3 1/2 years showed an average flux of 8.5 l m(-2) day(-1) on the coast and 1.1 l m(-2) day(-1) inland 12 km from the coastline. On only a few days in 10 months was water collected at the inland site of Pampa del Tamaragal. GOES satellite images are shown to illustrate the pattern of formation of the stratocumuli cloud over the sea, its approach to the coastline, the entrance of fog by corridors through the coastal range and the presence of radiation fog inland. The results are important for the understanding of fog formation and dissipation along the coastal mountain range and for the recognition of potential sites for the installation of fog water collectors, which can be used as a water source in the Atacama Desert. The results also provide vital information for use in the preservation of the unique ecosystems of the most and desert of the world.

Wind data from European Remote Sensing Satellite-1/2 (ERS-1/2) over the LB are analysed and surface wind stress and wind stress curls are calculated. First, we employed an optimal interpolation scheme to build up a dataset for 1985-1997 on an 18 km x 18 km grid. An ensemble mean SST field ((T) over bar) has been established with a rather weak horizontal gradient (19.4degreesC south-east of Rhodes to 22.4degreesC southeast of the LB). Second, we performed a composite analysis to obtain the monthly averaged SST anomaly field (`(T) over tilde) deviation from the ensemble mean. Three areas of evident SST anomalies were found: south of Rhodes, south-east of Crete and north-east of Cyprus. During the spring-to-summer transition ( March to May), a small low anomaly is formed south-east of Crete ((T) over tilde <-1. 4&DEG;C in May), and a small high anomaly is formed south of Rhodes (<(T)over tilde> >- 0.4degreesC in May). During the autumn-to-winter transition (October to November), a small high anomaly forms south-east of Crete ((T) over tilde >1.2degreesC in November), and a small low anomaly forms between Rhodes and Antalia Bay ((T) over tilde <- 0. 2&DEG;C in November). Third, we performed an empirical orthogonal function ( EOF) analysis on the residual <(T)over cap> relative to (T) over bar+(T) over tilde in order to obtain transient and interannual variations of the SST fields. EOF1 explains 73% of the total variance and represents the warm/cool anomaly pattern, with a maximum value in the region between the south of Rhodes and Cyprus and a minimum value off the western part of the Egyptian coast. EOF2 explains 6% of the total variance. A strong LB warm anomaly (1degreesC warmer) appears during August 1988, May 1994 and September-October-November 1994. A strong cool anomaly (1degreesC cooler) occurs during May 1987, November 1988, August 1989 and May 1992. The cross-correlation coefficient between wind stress curl from ERS-1/2 over the LB in the period from January 1992 to December 1997 and the SST anomaly were calculated, and it reveals the air-sea interaction in the LB.																	0143-1161					SEP	2002	23	18					3745	3761		10.1080/01431160110070663								WOS:000177859700015						
J	Lefevre, F; Yard, FH; Le Provost, C; Schrama, EJO				Lefevre, F; Yard, FH; Le Provost, C; Schrama, EJO			FES99: A global tide finite element solution assimilating tide gauge and altimetric information	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												An improved version of the global hydrodynamic tide solutions [finite element solutions (FESs) FES94, FES95.2.1, and FES98] has been developed, implemented, and validated. The new model is based on the resolution of the tidal barotropic equations on a global finite element grid without any open boundary condition, which leads to solutions independent of in situ data (no open boundary conditions and no assimilation). The accuracy of these "free" solutions is improved by assimilating tide gauge and TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimeter information through a representer assimilation method. This leads to the FES99 version of this model. For the eight main constituents of the tidal spectrum (M-2, S-2, N-2, K-2, 2N(2), K-1, O-1, and Q(1)), about 700 tide gauges and 687 T/P altimetric measurements are assimilated. An original algorithm is developed to calculate the tidal harmonic constituents at crossover points of the T/P altimeter database. Additional work is performed for the S2 wave by reconsidering the inverse barometer correction. To complete the spectrum, 19 minor constituents have been added by admittance. The accuracy of FES99 is evaluated against the former FESs. First, it is compared to two tide gauge datasets: ST95 (95 open-ocean measurements) and ST739 (739 coastal measurements). For ST95, the root-sum square of the differences between observations and solutions is reduced from 2.8 (FES95.2.1) to 2.4 cm (FES99), a gain of 17% in overall accuracy. Second, the variance of the sea surface variability is calculated and compared for FES95.2.1, FES98, and FES99 at the T/P and the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) crossover data points. FES99 performed best, with a residual standard deviation for the independent ERS-2 dataset of 13.5 cm (15.2 cm for FES95.2.1). Third, tidal predictions are implemented for the FESs to provide along-track estimates of the sea surface variability for T/P and ERS-2. Compared to ERS-2, FES99 residuals are 11.8 cm (12.4 cm for FES95.2.1). All the accuracy tests show that FES99 is a significant improvement compared to former FESs both in the deep ocean and along coasts.																	0739-0572					SEP	2002	19	9					1345	1356		10.1175/1520-0426(2002)019<1345:FAGTFE>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000177715000009

Fifteen studies have been reviewed, compared, re-assessed and a corrected shore drift map of the Goa coast is prepared and presented. Advantages and limitations of these methods are discussed. The present review and re-assessment confirms that, though sediment transport is bi-directional, the long-term net shore drift direction along Calangute and Colva beaches is southward. The overall net shore drift direction along Goa coast is also towards south. It is qualitatively determined that except for 3 short drift cells, shore zone has long-term stability. Finally, it is concluded that landform indicator study using remote sensing can be an effective method for determining long-term net shore drift along the coast.																	0749-0208					FAL	2002	18	4					612	621										WOS:000179414700003

Key to the dynamic processes is the mechanical behavior of the ice cover. During the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) field experiment, we deployed sensors to measure the internal ice stress at several locations within a 15 x 15 km area. These measurements are combined with satellite- derived ice motion and imagery products. The objective is to make a first step toward using these data sources for evaluating sea ice dynamics models by assessing whether the stress signal can be qualitatively linked to the regional-scale (10-100 km) deformation activity. Four case studies are presented, each with distinguishing characteristics: consolidation of the seasonal ice zone against the Alaskan coast (5-7 December 1997); advancement of the consolidation zone into the perennial ice pack (11-13 December); extreme divergence (14-17 January); and consolidation of the pack against Wrangel Island and the Siberian coast (20-23 February). The results of this analysis (1) demonstrate that stress measurements are related to the regional deformation behavior of the ice cover, (2) confirm that regional-scale ice dynamics is primarily a function of coastal geometry and sustained, large-scale wind direction and magnitude, (3) provide continued evidence that the ice pack behaves as a granular hardening plastic, and (4) encourage pursuit of efforts to use direct measurements of ice stress and deformation in the formulation and development of sea ice dynamics models.

J	Vialard, JM; Delecluse, P; Menkes, C				Vialard, JM; Delecluse, P; Menkes, C			A modeling study of salinity variability and its effects in the tropical Pacific Ocean during the 1993-1999 period	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] This paper investigates the mechanisms of near-surface salinity variability in the tropical Pacific during the 1993-1999 period, including the 1997-1998 El Nino. The role of salinity in the oceanic mean state and variability is also investigated. To this end, a general circulation model is forced by European Remote Sensing (ERS) + Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) wind stresses and simple parameterizations of the heat and freshwater fluxes interannual variability. The model correctly reproduces interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). At the peak of the 1997-1998 El Nino, the model and observations show that water fresher than 34.8 psu (usually confined to the western Pacific and close to the South American coast) has invaded the whole equatorial Pacific. This is the combined result of an eastward displacement of the western Pacific fresh pool to 150degreesW by zonal advection and increased precipitation in the eastern part of the basin. Sensitivity experiments allow us to evaluate the impact of salinity in the equatorial band. The 1993-1996 oceanic mean state is only weakly modified (by less than 0.2degreesC in SST and 0.05 m s(-1) in surface currents) in experiments with homogeneous salinity, but salinity has a larger impact on variability (standard deviation of 0.4degreesC in SST and 0.15 m s(-1) in surface currents). During the 19971998 El Nino, salinity effects are the strongest in the vicinity of the eastern edge of the warm and fresh pool. In this region, through its effect on both vertical mixing and horizontal pressure gradients, salinity increases SST by up to 0.8degreesC and surface currents by up to 0.2 m s(-1). Based on these results, it seems advisable to include salinity effects in quantitative studies or forecasts of the El Nino phenomenon.

J	Almeida-Guerra, P				Almeida-Guerra, P			Use of SPOT images as a tool for coastal zone management and monitoring of environmental impacts in the coastal zone	OPTICAL ENGINEERING												Modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors leading toward the achievement of serious plans regarding coastal management. A multitemporal analysis of land use in certain areas of the Colombian Caribbean Coast is described. It mainly focuses on environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic activities, such as deforestation of mangroves due to shrimp farming. Selection of sensitive areas, percentage of destroyed mangroves, possible endangered areas, etc., are some of the results of this analysis. Recommendations for a coastal management plan in the area have also resulted from this analysis. Some other consequences of the deforestation of mangroves in the coastal zone and the construction of shrimp ponds are also analyzed, such as the increase of erosion problems in these areas and water pollution, among others. The increase of erosion in these areas has also changed part of their morphology, which has been studied by the analysis of SPOT images in previous years. A serious concern exists about the future of these areas. For this reason new techniques like satellite images (SPOT) have been applied with good results, leading to more effective control and coastal management in the area. The use of SPOT images to study changes of the land use of the area is a useful technique to determine patterns of human activities and suggest solutions for severe problems in these areas.

Sequential data of IRS-P4 OCM has been analysed over parts of both east and west coast of India and a methodology to retrieve sea surface current velocities, has been applied. The method is based on matching suspended sediment dispersion patterns, in sequential two time lapsed images. The pattern matching is performed on a pair of atmospherically corrected and geo-referenced sequential images by Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) technique. The MCC technique involves computing matrices of cross-correlation coefficients and identifying correlation peaks. The movement of the pattern can be calculated knowing the displacement of windows required to match patterns in successive images. The technique provides actual flow during a specified period by, integrating both tidal and wind influences. The current velocities retrieved were compared with synchronous data collected along the east coast during the GSI cruise ST-133 of R.V. Samudra Kaustubh in January 2000. The current data were measured using the ocean current meter supplied by the Environmental Measurement and CONtrol (EMCON), Kochi available with the Geological Survey of India, Marine Wing. This current meter can measure direction and magnitude with an accuracy of +/-5degrees and 2% respectively. The measurement accuracies with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.99, for both magnitude (cm.s(-1)) and direction (deg.) were achieved.

We use here an instrumental synergy based on active and passive ground-based (Goa University, India), airborne (Mystere 20 research aircraft), and spaceborne (Meteosat-5) devices. An original method based on ground-based active actinic flux measurements is developed to assess the atmospheric, columnar aerosol single scattering albedo. This parameter has been found between 0.88 and 0.93 (at 440 nm) with an absolute uncertainty of 0.04 during the operating period from 11 to 23 March 1999. We have also assessed this parameter off the West Indian coast by comparing simultaneous airborne lidar and flux measurements with radiative transfer simulations. The value retrieved for the atmospheric column is close to 0.83+/-0.05 (at 523 nm) in agreement with the coastal value. The horizontal and vertical extent of the aerosol plume is investigated using airborne lidar and Meteosat-5 satellite. Using the Meteosat-5-derived aerosol optical thickness, we have estimated the regional extent of the shortwave aerosol direct radiative forcing. The vertical profile of the aerosol extinction coefficient derived from lidar sounding is used to assess the atmospheric shortwave heating rate induced by the aerosol layer. For an aerosol optical thickness of 0.6 (+/-0.12), as it has been observed in the aerosol plume in late March, the top of atmosphere direct aerosol forcing is 17 (+/-5) W m(-2). The surface forcing is between 2.5 and 4.5 higher than the top of atmosphere forcing. This difference leads to a significant heating of the three lowest kilometers of the atmosphere by the aerosols. For an aerosol optical thickness of 0.6, the atmospheric heating rate induced by aerosols is between 0.8 and 1.2 Kd(-1) depending on the aerosol single scattering albedo value.																	0747-7309					AUG 17	2002	107	D19							8006	10.1029/2000JD000116								WOS:000180372700004						
J	Furevik, BR; Johannessen, OM; Sandvik, AD				Furevik, BR; Johannessen, OM; Sandvik, AD			SAR-retrieved wind in polar regions - Comparison with in situ data and atmospheric model output	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												European remote sensing (ERS) satellites synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wind retrievals using CMOD-IFR2 are, for the first time, retrieved in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and in Arctic coastal areas and compared with in situ observations from reseach vessels (RVs) and output from a high-resolution atmospheric model. The root mean squares (rms) of the comparisons were 1.6 ms(-1) and 2 ms(-1), respectively. The spatial variation of the SAR wind fields established a decrease in wind speed close to the ice edge for the late summer situations where the wind was along the ice edge with the ice to the left. This decrease is believed to be due to changes in atmospheric stability, possibly through development of an internal boundary layer caused by the cold ice cover and melt water. Lower wind speed near the ice edge is confirmed by the atmospheric model and the in situ observations. Furthermore, good results are obtained from SAR wind retrieval in leads when compared with model output during a cold-air outbreak. Routine measurements in the MIZ are useful for estimating the wind stress, and therefore SAR may play an important role in this region. Finally, the identification of a jet out from Hinlopen Strait in the Svalbard region and low wind wakes along the coast in the SAR-retrieved wind field is confirmed by in situ observations as the RV moves through the region. The jet is also confirmed by the atmospheric model, which is able to reproduce the situation.																	0196-2892					AUG	2002	40	8					1720	1732		10.1109/TGRS.2002.802509								WOS:000178334200006						
J	Prospero, JM; Ginoux, P; Torres, O; Nicholson, SE; Gill, TE				Prospero, JM; Ginoux, P; Torres, O; Nicholson, SE; Gill, TE			Environmental characterization of global sources of atmospheric soil dust identified with the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) absorbing aerosol product	REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS												We use the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) sensor on the Nimbus 7 satellite to map the global distribution of major atmospheric dust sources with the goal of identifying common environmental characteristics. The largest and most persistent sources are located in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in a broad "dust belt" that extends from the west coast of North Africa, over the Middle East, Central and South Asia, to China. There is remarkably little large-scale dust activity outside this region. In particular, the Southern Hemisphere is devoid of major dust activity. Dust sources, regardless of size or strength, can usually be associated with topographical lows located in arid regions with annual rainfall under 200-250 mm. Although the source regions themselves are arid or hyperarid, the action of water is evident from the presence of ephemeral streams, rivers, lakes, and playas. Most major sources have been intermittently flooded through the Quaternary as evidenced by deep alluvial deposits. Many sources are associated with areas where human impacts are well documented, e. g., the Caspian and Aral Seas, Tigris-Euphrates River Basin, southwestern North America, and the loess lands in China. Nonetheless, the largest and most active sources are located in truly remote areas where there is little or no human activity. Thus, on a global scale, dust mobilization appears to be dominated by natural sources. Dust activity is extremely sensitive to many environmental parameters. The identification of major sources will enable us to focus on critical regions and to characterize emission rates in response to environmental conditions. With such knowledge we will be better able to improve global dust models and to assess the effects of climate change on emissions in the future. It will also facilitate the interpretation of the paleoclimate record based on dust contained in ocean sediments and ice cores.

J	Nolin, AW; Fetterer, FM; Scambos, TA				Nolin, AW; Fetterer, FM; Scambos, TA			Surface roughness characterizations of sea ice and ice sheets: Case studies with MISR data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												This work is an examination of potential uses of multiangular remote sensing imagery for mapping and characterizing sea ice and ice sheet surfaces based on surface roughness properties. We use data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) to demonstrate that ice sheet and sea ice surfaces have characteristic angular signatures and that these angular signatures may be used in much the same way as spectral signatures are used in multispectral classification. Three case studies are examined: sea ice in the Beaufort Sea off the north coast of Alaska, the Jakobshavn Glacier on the western edge of the Greenland ice sheet, and a region in Antarctica south of McMurdo station containing glaciers and blue-ice areas. The MISR sea ice image appears to delineate different first-year ice types and, to some extent, the transition from first-year to multiyear ice. The MISR image shows good agreement with sea ice types that are evident in concurrent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and ice analysis charts from the National Ice Center. Over the Jakobshavn Glacier, surface roughness data from airborne laser altimeter transects correlate well with MISR-derived estimates of surface roughness. In Antarctica, ablation-related blue-ice areas, which are difficult to distinguish from bare ice exposed by crevasses, are easily detected using multiangular data. These unusual ablation surfaces are smooth and, unlike nearby crevassed ice, are strongly forward scattering. These case studies demonstrate that MISR data can make an innovative and important contribution to remote sensing of ice sheet and sea ice surface properties.

A minimum of 25 sample points, in which the vegetation was described and environmental factors (salinity, light intensity, land/water ratio, abundance of herbivorous crabs and snail abundance) were measured or estimated, were taken on each site. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to summarize the data bulk, to investigate the vegetation dynamics (e. g., comparability of species distribution in the three vegetation layers), and/or to link the vegetation data to the environmental factors. Results showed that species clusters were relatively easy to delineate, whether mangrove zonation was present or not. Among the environmental factors, the abundance of propagule predators (mostly sesarmid crabs) contributed significantly to the variation in vegetation and could be an explanatory parameter for the observed vegetation data in a majority of sites. In the site where it was not, the most important factor in the ordination was the land/water ratio, which is important at the ecological level as well (link between water level and vegetation dynamics). However, none of the environmental factors could successfully explain the total variability in the vegetation data suggesting that other, more determining factors exist. Our results further provide information on the dynamic or non-dynamic nature of a forest and on its ability to rejuvenate, and may contribute to appropriate forestry management guidelines in the future.

J	El-Asmar, HM				El-Asmar, HM			Short term coastal changes along Damietta-Port Said coast northeast of the Nile Delta, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Landsat Thematic Mapper images (TM) covered the coastline between Damietta and Port Said, taken at intervals in 1984, 1987 and 1991, were used to detect shoreline changes. When combined with geomorphological and sedimentological data, the remote sensing data enable the classification of the coastline into five segments, based on whether erosional or depositional process domains dominate them. Although the 30m spatial resolution of the satellite TM data precludes precise calculation of rates of change, they do enable erosional and accretionary coastline segments of the Damietta Port Said coast to be recognised over these time scales. Segments 1 and 2 are erosional with an average shoreline recession of -41.4 m yr(-1), and -19.3 m yr(-1) respectively. Segment 3, Damietta spit, is an accretionary segment with an average shoreline advance of 81.4 m yr(-1). Segment 4, El-Deiba, experienced erosion in the period 1984-1987, with an average shoreline recession of -17 m yr(-1), but appears to have been stable over most of its length during the period 1987-1991, with observed declaration in the rate of shoreline recession to be -2.5 m yr(-1). Segment 5, El-Gamiel, was stable during the period 1984-1987, but due to the construction of projecting jetties around the mouth of the inlet and the subsequent interruption of the sediment transport supply, the coastline became accretionary updrift of the inlet (west) and erosional downdrift (east). Granulometric and heavy mineral analyses show significant differences between beach face sediment samples collected from the different coastline segments. The erosional segments are characterised by coarser sands and high concentrations of heavy minerals; while the accretionary segments are composed of finer sands with lower concentrations of heavy minerals. Poor coastal management strategies and the shortage of data on geomorphological processes along the coast has resulted in constructions taking place along sections of erosional coastline, requiring subsequent expensive defence measures. Moreover, these results have implication for future development on onshore facilities after the recent discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore.																	0749-0208					SUM	2002	18	3					433	441										WOS:000177756400003						
J	Stockdon, HF; Sallenger, AH; List, JH; Holman, RA				Stockdon, HF; Sallenger, AH; List, JH; Holman, RA			Estimation of shoreline position and change using airborne topographic lidar data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A method has been developed for estimating shoreline position from airborne scanning laser data. This technique allows rapid estimation of objective, GPS-based shoreline positions over hundreds of kilometers of coast, essential for the assessment of large-scale coastal behavior. Shoreline position, defined as the cross-shore position of a vertical shoreline datum, is found by fitting a function to cross-shore profiles of laser altimetry data located in a vertical range around the datum and then evaluating the function at the specified datum. Error bars on horizontal position are directly calculated as the 95% confidence interval on the mean value based on the Student's t distribution of the errors of the regression. The technique was tested using lidar data collected with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) in September 1997 on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Estimated lidar-based shoreline position was compared to shoreline position as measured by a ground-based GPS vehicle survey system. The two methods agreed closely with a root mean square difference of 2.9 m. The mean 95% confidence interval for shoreline position was +/- 1.4 m. The technique has been applied to a study of shoreline change on Assateague Island, Maryland/Virginia, where three ATM data sets were used to assess the statistics of large-scale shoreline change caused by a major 'northeaster' winter storm. The accuracy of both the lidar system and the technique described provides measures of shoreline position and change that are ideal for studying storm-scale variability over large spatial scales.

Both the mean and variable components of model alongshore wind stress increase by factors of 3-4 from north to south along the Oregon coast. There is evidence of orographic intensification near Cape Blanco, which is supported by previous aircraft and ship observations during August 1995. The systematic southward increase of southward stress will drive enhanced ocean upwelling along the southern Oregon coast and suggests the new hypothesis that systematic variations in local wind stress may contribute to the observed offshore displacement of the coastal upwelling jet in this region. It is inferred from an analysis of the model and surface data that ocean upwelling modifies coastal surface air temperatures by 1-5degreesC over timescales of 12-24 hours.					Kosro, P.

A couple of Spot images recorded during the summer of 1989 are processed to extract accurate geographical maps of the coastline defined. in this study, as the level corresponding to the lowest astronomical tide. The coastline extraction method is based on a reflectance model, providing depth measurements that were calibrated in the field. This method enables us to map the coastline regardless of the tide level above the lowest astronomical tide at the moment of the image capture. As this model can be extrapolated to a large area, hen sea water is clear (considering a restricted range of suspended matter concentration) and bottom colour is homogeneous, the variability of both water turbidity and bottom colour have been analysed on the images. From the remotely sensed coastlines. a statistical analysis of ridge and runnel system length and longshore migration has been performed for a 35 km long coastline located to the north of the Arcachon lagoon inlet. It has been observed that, during the summer of 1989 characterised by fair weather conditions, the typical ridge and runnel morphology remains nearly conservative. Whereas the ridge and runnel mean wavelength remains constant during the summer between 435 and 430 m, about 84% of the systems move southward at the mean rate of 2.4 m d(-1). These results derived from Spot image analysis were validated by in situ topographic surveys undertaken during similar hydrodynamical conditions.

These banks are composed of fine clay sediments originating from the Amazon River. In November 1998, field work was carried out on the Mahury River to measure the water colour and the concentration of suspended particles in surface water. An increase of the remote sensing reflectance due to high concentration of mineral particles was observed. The Mahury River survey (November 1998). together with an oceanographic survey onboard the ANTEA vessel (PRECHICO cruise, April 1999), enabled us to identify several classes of remote sensing reflectance spectra characterizing the continental shelf between Cayenne and the Brazil frontier: (1) light blue waters above the shelf break: (2) low salinity dark brown waters above the continental shelf. originating from the Amazon River (3) green waters above the 20-m isobath and (4) beige waters close to the coast and in the rivers mouths. The normalized water leaving radiances (nLw) computed from these spectra in the spectral bands of SeaWiFS are examined.

The use of remote sensing tools becomes essential in recognizing some of the sea-surface features that characterize the island mass effect phenomena. AVHRR, coastal zone color scanner (CZCS), and SeaWiFS ancillary National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data. together with highly developed processing tools from PANORAMA (Processing and Automatic Navigation Of ReAl-time iMAges) allowed the detection of atmospheric Von Karman Vortex Streets. warm water surface wakes, leeward eddies, Azorean front. and localized upwelling. Results from the remote sensing analysis also helped to promote the reanalysis of historical in situ data for the manifestation of these island effects. IPIMAR cruises carried Out between 1979 and 1982 collected temperature, salinity. density. and chlorophyll data, which A ere reinterpolated at the sea surface to study the island mass effect phenomena for the first time. Results have shown the formation of a warm water wake south of Madeira Island expanding 400 km offshore. The surface signature of the Azorean front. the so-called subtropical front, seems to take place within the Madeira latitude (33degreesN). North waters were consistently colder than the Warm and salty southern waters. AVHRR data also revealed eddies and fronts being formed in the region. Leeward eddies were often observed in the flanks of the islands: CZCS data showed highly productive eddies in the west of Madeira Island. Localized cold water with high chlorophyll concentrations x as also observed around the island's coast. A particularly dynamic area was the underwater ridge that connected Madeira and Desertas Islands. Future work should continue to sample these regions of interest with the simultaneous use of different satellite sensors. Vertical characterization of the different phenomena is needed.

One major goal for the Long-term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO) is to develop a real-time capability for rapid environmental assessment and physical/biological forecasting in coastal waters. To this end, observational data are collected from satellites, aircrafts, ships, fixed/relocatable moorings and autonomous underwater vehicles. The majority of the data are available in real-time allowing for adaptive sampling of episodic events and are assimilated into ocean forecast models. In this observationally rich environment, model forecast errors are dominated by uncertainties in the model physics or future boundary conditions rather than initial conditions. Therefore, ensemble forecasts with differing model parameterizations provide a unique opportunity for model refinement and validation. The system has been operated during three annual coastal predictive skill experiments from 1998 through 2000. To illustrate the capabilities of the system, case studies on coastal upwelling and small-scale biological slicks will be discussed. This observatory is one part of the expanding network of ocean observatories that will form the basis of a national observation network. These regional efforts should be linked through satellite remote sensing and surface current radar systems. Data on the ocean interior will be provided from subsurface AUVs and moorings. The combined data should be available through a network of virtual labs capable of rapid data visualization and dissemination.																	0364-9059					APR	2002	27	2					146	154	PII S0364-9059(02)03375-7	10.1109/JOE.2002.1002469								WOS:000175754700002						
J	Nguyen, HB; DeFerrari, HA; Williams, NJ; Venezia, WA				Nguyen, HB; DeFerrari, HA; Williams, NJ; Venezia, WA			Ocean acoustic sensor installation at the South Florida Ocean Measurement Center	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												A tri-axial array of acoustic hydrophones has recently been installed off the South Florida coast in 145 in of water. The installation is one of a number of projects that have begun making use of the new South Florida Ocean Measurement Center facilities in Dania, FL. The arrays are linked to shore via a fiber-optic cable and powered from shore with a separate insulated copper cable. Two of the arms of the array are deployed on the bottom to the east and south of the origin. The third array is a sub-surface vertical mooring which includes a pressure sensor to monitor the depth of the top buoy. Each axis contains 32 hydrophones spaced in a nonlinear distribution to facilitate acoustic coherence measurements. Other sensor configurations are possible, including the replacement of hydrophones with other instruments such as current meters or temperature, pressure, or conductivity sensors. Small projectors are placed at the base of the vertical array and at the ends of the horizontal arrays, making it possible to determine the location of each sensor in real time via time-of-flight measurements. Computers running the Linux operating system control the projectors and process data from each leg of the array. Each of the three computers is connected via fiber-optic lines to a Fast Ethernet switch box and network to shore. The computers can be accessed via TCP/IP connection and programmed from shore to suit new missions. A wireless link to the Nova Southeastern University network and the Internet makes it possible to access the system and conduct experiments from anywhere in the world. The current mission of this system is to study the coherence of shallow-water acoustic propagation. However, knowledge gained here will facilitate a variety of future projects-which include active and passive sonars, ambient noise study, high-frequency acoustic monitoring of fish migration, and acoustic tomographic monitoring of the Gulf Stream. Excellent data were obtained from several experiments. At the present time, only the vertical array is working but plans to restore the two horizontal arrays are actively pursued.																	0364-9059					APR	2002	27	2					235	244	PII S0364-9059(02)00693-3	10.1109/JOE.2002.1002478								WOS:000175754700011						
J	Irish, JD; Hay, AE; Traykovski, P; Newhall, A; Craig, R; Paul, WM				Irish, JD; Hay, AE; Traykovski, P; Newhall, A; Craig, R; Paul, WM			On attaching acoustic imaging instrumentation to the LEO-15 observatory for sediment transport and bottom boundary layer studies	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and Dalhousie University conducted a sediment transport study at the LEO-15 observatory maintained by Rutgers University and WHOI engineers off the central New Jersey coast. This study was designed to take advantage of the unique capabilities (power and telemetry) provided at the site. The various sensing systems were attached to a bottom-mounted frame and connected by divers to the underwater-mateable guest ports on the LEO-15 node. The node supplied power for the various acoustic and electronic systems and provided telemetry for control of the remote instrumentation and acquisition of several GBytes of data per day. A shore-based support station of several PC's and workstations networked together and connected to the Internet was set up at Rutgers Tuckerton Field Station to receive, display and store this data. Instrumentation was deployed in mid-November 1999, remained active until Christmas 1999, and was recovered in January 2000. The methodology of using the LEO-15 observatory was different from previous approaches used by the WHOI and Dalhousie sediment transport teams and had some subtle problems not obvious until the equipment was set up and utilizing the observatory. A second LEO-15 node, on shore at the Tuckerton field station, facilitated testing of each subsystem and the fully integrated system before offshore deployment. One set of problems involved the node's ground fault detection system that was designed to shut down all scientific instrumentation to protect the node when a current leak to seawater was detected on any power or telemetry line. WHOI connected all their sensing systems together to provide an optimum test of any system problem. Dalhousie had isolated their instrumentation (power and communications) so the ground fault circuit only tested the cables from the LEO-15 node to their electronics. The WHOI instrumentation developed a slowly increasing ground fault in one line that resulted in some unnecessary data loss. The underwater-mateable connectors required at the LEO-15 sometimes showed a low ground fault level leakage that disappeared when they were reconnected. Because of the constant power source, the electronics on the tripod remained powered up and active during the deployment, and individual sensors were powered and burst-sampled once or twice an hour, collecting similar to4 GBytes of data per day that was telemetered to shore. WHOI's high-speed link operated successfully at similar to400 kbits/sec and Dalhousie's at 2 Gb/s. Dalhousie experienced some problems with their remote system suddenly stopping that may be associated with changes made to interface it with the LEO-15 observatory. All data were archived at the Tuckerton facility as the Internet link to WHOI and Dalhousie could only provide 113 of the required speed to transmit the data collected daily. In spite of these problems, the systems worked much of the time and collected many gigabytes of data on the suspended sediment transport and structure in relationship to bedform roughness, and wave and current forcing. Real-time sensor functionality and data acquisition operations were monitored over the Internet. The goal of plugging instruments into the LEO-15-node and obtaining continuous long time-series remotely with no interruptions is not yet fully realized. Someone had to monitor the connection to keep systems functioning optimally. However, we learned much of the methodology to move toward full remote operations in the future which will improve future observatories, such as the new Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory.																	0364-9059					APR	2002	27	2					254	266	PII S0364-9059(02)04122-5	10.1109/JOE.2002.1002480								WOS:000175754700013

Over the course from 6 September to 8 October 1997, five near-shore anticyclonic eddies (NAEs) about 40 km in diameter were observed within the region between Tuapse and the Kerch Strait, their movement speed reaching about 15 cm/s at separate parts of their trajectories. Separation of an NAE (NAE-1) from the coast in the region of a widening shelf/slope west of Novorossiysk and its transformation into deep-sea eddy was traced. Lifetime of the anticyclone was no less than 1 month, its mean offshore speed was about 4.3 cm/s. According to the SeaWiFS data, the increased chlorophyll a concentration (compared with the mean concentration at the center of the eastern part of the sea) was observed on 8 October 1997 in four "young" NAEs after an intense precipitation, the decreased one at the same time occurred in NAE-1, which was depleted of supply by shelf waters. In Summer 1993, a large NAE (about 95 km in diameter) was observed in the region between Tuapse and Gelendzhik. Evolution of the eddy from 3 June to 8 November 1993 was traced. Lifetime of the eddy exceeded 5 months. Its mean offshore speed to the southwest since its separation from the coast (around 17 August) in the Novorossiysk region was about 1.2 cm/s. The difference between dynamic situations in the same season (autumn) of 2 years, 1997 and 1993, was likely associated with peculiarities of atmospheric circulation and related intensity of cyclonic circulation in the Black Sea.

A spatially explicit characterization of clear-cut logging and wildfire is a prerequisite to understanding the causes and consequences of disturbance in this region. We analyzed stand replacement disturbance over 4.6 million forested hectares of three major provinces in western Oregon between 1972 and 1995, contrasting the relative amounts of wildfire and harvest in each province and comparing harvest statistics among the dominant land ownership categories. Clear-cut harvest and wildfire occurred over 19.9% and 0.7% of the study area, respectively. The moist Coast Range Province (CRP) was dominated by private industrial (PI) ownerships and had the greatest concentration of cutting. The relatively dry Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) and the climatically moderate Western Cascades Province (WCP) were dominated by public landowners and had lower concentrations of cutting and larger amounts of wildfire than the CRP. Rates of harvest over time generally followed similar trends across landowners; it was lowest in the early 1970s, peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and then decreased to near 1970s levels by the mid-1990s. PI landowners had harvest rates that were about two and one-half times as high as public owners throughout the study period. Public and private nonindustrial (PNI) owners tended to have relatively small cutting units that remained spatially dispersed throughout the study period, whereas the PI owners had larger individual cutting units that tended toward spatial aggregation over time. Comparing the managed disturbance regimes with historical wild disturbance regimes can help us to understand the relative impact of management regimes on ecosystems.																	1432-9840					MAR	2002	5	2					122	137		10.1007/s10021-001-0060-X								WOS:000175429400002						
J	Pal, SR; Mohanty, PK				Pal, SR; Mohanty, PK			Use of IRS-1B data for change detection in water quality and vegetation of Chilka lagoon, east coast of India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Sedimentation, resulting from cyclic growth, spread and disintegration of macrophytes and influx of silt-laden fresh water through the riverine system, is the dominant process influencing the contemporary phase of lagoon modification in the Chilka. Remote sensing offers promise in the detection and delineation of the functional elements of lagoon modification. Therefore, IRS-1B LISS-I data along with synchronous ground data observations have been used in the present study for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the components involved in the modification and to obtain estimates of their distribution, abundance, diversity and physical state during an annual cycle. Results obtained indicate that the ecological parameters in the lagoon such as water quality and macrophytes undergo significant seasonal as well as interannual variability following interannual monsoon variability. Seasonal mode of variability appears to dominate over interannual mode. October and April appear as two extreme periods in the annual cycle of lagoon modification. Maximum likelihood classification for digital image analysis of time series data depicts the different lagoonal features, which largely agree with field observations. Area estimates for spectrally significant classes and their comparison with earlier studies indicate that the rate at which the vegetation is spreading has been increasing steadily and alarmingly. IRS data proved useful for predicting selected water quality parameters.																	0143-1161					MAR	2002	23	6					1027	1042		10.1080/0143116010076243								WOS:000174295900002						
J	Donoghue, DNM; Mironnet, N				Donoghue, DNM; Mironnet, N			Development of an integrated geographical information system prototype for coastal habitat monitoring	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES					Workshop on Intelligent Methods for Processing Space and Time-Related Data	1999	MAGDEBURG, GERMANY					This paper describes a prototype Integrated Geographical Information System (IGIS) developed for coastal habitat monitoring. It outlines the advantages and technical difficulties involved in combining specialist image processing functionality within the LaserScan IGIS software so that it could be used routinely by ecologists. The Coastal Habitat Information Monitoring System prototype set out to demonstrate the feasibility of using remotely sensed imagery for the routine mapping of important coastal habitats in the European Union. The prototype aims to provide an integrated software system to transform Earth Observation data into specialist map products. Normally such processing requires input from remote sensing scientists using specialist software and is not easily accessible to end-users. In principle, the methodology allows different satellite and airborne multi-spectral image data to be used to produce specialist coastal habitat maps. In this paper Landsat TM and IRS 1C LISS 3 data are evaluated and shown to be suitable for mapping the inter-tidal habitats of the Wash estuary on the East Coast of England. A strategic objective of study was to test the feasibility of incorporating all the processing functionality into a single integrated geographical information system. The project concluded satellite data from existing sensor systems can provide habitat data at a good level of detail but that to develop a fully operational processing capability would require considerable development of even the most advanced of the existing commercially available IGIS software package.

J	Duda, DP; Minnis, P				Duda, DP; Minnis, P			Observations of aircraft dissipation trails from GOES	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Two cases of aircraft dissipation trails (distrails) with associated fall streak clouds were analyzed with multispectral geostationary satellite data. One dissipation trail was observed in a single cloud layer on 23 July 2000 over southeastern Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay. Another set of trails developed at the top of multilayer cloudiness off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina on 6 January 2000. The distrails on both days formed in optically thin, midlevel stratified clouds with cloud-top heights between 7.6 and 9.1 km. The distrail features remained intact and easily visible from satellite images over a period of 1-2 h despite winds near 50 kt at cloud level. The width of the distrails became as large as 20 km within a period of 90 min or less. Differences between the optical properties of the fall streak particles inside the distrails and those of the clouds surrounding the trails allowed for the easy identification of the fall streak clouds in either the 3.9-mum brightness temperature imagery, or the 10.7-mum minus 12.0-mum brightness temperature difference imagery. Two independent remote sensing retrievals of both distrail cases showed that the fall streaks had larger particle sizes than the clouds outside of the trails, although the three-channel infrared retrieval was better at retrieving cloud properties in the multilayer cloud case.

Measurements were made in shallow (1-2 in) snow pits along a 350 km transect from the coast to the polar plateau, covering at least one annual cycle and an elevation range from sea level to about 2500 in. The aim of the study is to document spatial and temporal variations in snow-cover properties, with the further aim of relating these variations to environmental factors and to patterns observable by remote sensing. The measurements suggest five principal snow zones: (1) sea ice, (11) the seaward edge zone of the ice shelf, (111) the inner parts of the ice shelf, (iv) the snow cover above the grounding line and (v) the local topographic highs. Local topographic highs such as ice domes and ice rises differ from other snow environments: the snow is less densely packed, possibly an indication of locally reduced speed of the katabatic outflow. Fewer and thinner crusts on the topographic highs are consistent with RADARSAT backscatter variations.

The present study serves to review this literature and highlight the causes of such apparently large species numbers, while providing an objective and realistic review of the mangrove species actually present in Sri Lanka today. This study is based on standardized fieldwork over a 4-year period using well-established diagnostic identification keys. The study indicates that there are at present 20 identified `mangrove species' (major and minor components) and at least 18 mangrove associates' along the south-western coast of the island, and addresses the importance of clearly defining these terms. Incorrect identifications in the past have adversely affected interpretation of species composition in the framework of biogeography, remote sensing and biological conservation and management.

Altimetry and sea-surface temperature imagery are used to demonstrate that these episodes of strong horizontal advection are associated with mesoscale features. During the wintertime Northeast (NE) Monsoon these are capped-off mesoscale eddy features generated during the previous summertime Southwest (SW) Monsoon and have little horizontal transport of heat within the mixed layer. During the SW Monsoon the major contribution is strong offshore export of coastally upwelled water in a filament with a strong surface presence. Temperature and salinity properties from the moored array and a SeaSoar survey during the formation of the coastal filament confirm the offshore transport of the upwelled water mass to the site of the moored array, more than 600 km offshore. Estimates of the filament section heat flux are several percent of the total estimated heat flux due to upwelling along the Arabian Peninsula, and remote sensing data show that similar mesoscale variability along the coast is enhanced during the SW Monsoon. This points to the importance of mesoseale-modulated transports in not only the observed heat budget at the moored array, but in the overall upperocean heat budget in the Arabian Sea.

This paper examines a portion of Lake Superior's shoreline vi,here coastal landscape has been shaped by the introduction of 25 billion kg of stamp sand from the copper industry and subsequent dynamics associated with longshore currents. Shoreline areal change from this movement is documented through comparison of archival and current air photos. A series of historical air photo mosaics were processed with a Geographic Information System (GIS). Sets of spatially registered, temporal map polygons were developed to illustrate and allow, measurement of the areas of erosion and deposition, relevant to shoreline planning and measurement. Measurements indicate that the length of shoreline affected by the stamp sand increased by 2.4 km during a 59-year period. Measurements of area indicate a decrease of 8 ha in the same amount of time. Breadth of the stamp sand shows discernable decline of 630 in width at the original deposit area at the north near Gay, Michigan, and increase of 410 m width 1,500 in southward along the coast. The methodology and results are relevant to a diversity of linear and areal landscape considerations along shorelines (property rights, planning, conservation, etc.).																	0380-1330						2002	28	2					276	284		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70583-2								WOS:000176424300015						
J	Wimberly, MC; Spies, TA				Wimberly, MC; Spies, TA			Modeling landscape patterns of understory tree regeneration in the Pacific Northwest, USA	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Vegetation maps serve as the basis for spatial analysis of forest ecosystems and provide initial information for simulations of forest landscape change. Because of the limitations of current remote sensing technology, it is not possible to directly measure forest understory attributes across large spatial extents, Instead we used a predictive vegetation mapping approach to model Tsuga heterophylla and Picea , sitchensis seedling patterns in a 3900-ha landscape in the Oregon Coast Range, USA, as a function of Landsat TM imagery, aerial photographs, digital elevation models, and stream maps. Because the models explained only moderate amounts of variability (R(2) values of 0.24 - 0.56), we interpreted the predicted patterns as qualitative spatial trends rather than precise maps. P. sitchensis seedling patterns were tightly linked to the riparian network, with highest densities in coastal riparian areas. T. heterophylla seedlings exhibited complex patterns related to topography and overstory forest cover, and were also spatially clustered around patches of old-growth forest. We hypothesize that the old growth served as refugia for this fire-sensitive species following wildfires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Low levels of T. heterophylla regeneration in hardwood-dominated forests suggest that these patches may succeed to shrublands rather than to conifer forest. Predictive models of seedling patterns could be developed for other landscapes where georeferenced inventory plots, remote sensing data, digital elevation models, and climate C Z maps are available.

Variation in vertical height accuracy as a function of beach slope is investigated using a set of nine ERS Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the Humber/Wash area on the English east coast acquired between 1992 and 1994. Waterlines from these images are heighted using a hydrodynamic tide-surge model and interpolated using block kriging. On 1:500 slope beaches, an average block height estimation standard deviation of 18-22 cm is achieved. This rises to 27 cm on 1:100 slope beaches, and 32 cm on 1:30 slope beaches. The average heighting error at different slopes is decomposed into components due to waterline heighting error, inadequate sensor resolution and interpolation inaccuracy. It is shown that, at 1:500 slope, waterline heighting error and interpolation inaccuracy are the main error sources, whilst at 1:30 slope, errors due to inadequate sensor resolution become dominant. The ability of the technique to generate intertidal DEMs for almost the entire coastal zone in a complete ERS SAR scene covering 100 x 100 km is demonstrated.

J	Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A				Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A			Application of remote sensing data to monitor mangroves and other coastal vegetation of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES												Remote sensing data, because of its repetitive, synoptic and multi-spectral nature, has proved to be of an immense value in monitoring of coastal vegetation. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data have been extensively used to map mangroves and other coastal vegetation for the entire country's coastline. Large database on spatial extent of mangroves and their condition has been created on 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scale using IRS data (the database provides information for the first time on the mangrove areas of the entire Indian coast). Based on this study, it was observed that the Kori creek, Gujarat, has large area under mangroves. The repetitive nature of the data has helped in monitoring vital and critical areas, periodically. In one such study, on the Marine National Park, in the Gulf of Kachchh, mangrove areas were monitored for the last 25 years. The degradation of mangroves continued up to 1985 and the condition significantly improved due to the adoption of conservation measures. This has helped in planning various management actions to conserve this vital ecosystem. IRS data have been used in identifying dominant plant communities in many mangrove areas such as Bhitarkanika, Coringa, Mandovi estuary in Goa and the Gulf of Kachchh, etc, This is a unique approach for providing spatial information at plant community level and can be seen as a first step towards bio-diversity assessment. Along with the mangroves, seaweed, seagrass beds and dune vegetation have also been mapped with reasonable accuracy. With the better sensors planned for future, remote sensing-based information is going to be one of the major inputs in the preparation of management action plans.																	0379-5136					DEC	2001	30	4					195	213										WOS:000173106900001						
J	Huh, OK; Walker, ND; Moeller, C				Huh, OK; Walker, ND; Moeller, C			Sedimentation along the eastern Chenier Plain coast: Down drift impact of a delta complex shift	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Mississippi River Chenier Plain is a shore parallel landform (down-drift from the Atchafalaya distributary of the Mississippi River) consisting of an alternating series of transgressive sand-shell ridges and regressive, progradational mudflats. The late 1940s shift of 1/3 of the flow of the Mississippi to the newly developing Atchafalaya delta complex to the west has resulted in injection of the river waters and suspended sediment into the westward flowing currents of the coastal current system. This has reactivated the dormant processes of mud accumulation along this coast. These environmental circumstances have provided the opportunity to (1) investigate the depositional processes of the prograding, fine grained, mud flat facies of the open Chenier Plain coast and (2) to test the hypothesis that the impacts of the frequent cold front passages of fall, winter and spring exceed those of the occasional and more localized hurricane in shaping the coast and powering the dominant sedimentary processes. We conducted field investigations with the benefit of multi-scale, time series environmental surveillance by remote sensing systems, including airborne and satellite sensors. These systems provided invaluable new information on areal geomorphic patterns and the behavior of the coastal waters. This is a classic case of weather systems impacting inner shelf waters and sediments and causing the development of a new landform. It is clear that mud flats of the eastern chenier plain are prograding seaward, as well as progressively growing in a westerly direction.

The variability of the aerosol load over NIO is discussed based on three-dimentional numerical simulations made at a local scale by use of Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) and at a regional scale using the zoomed Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique global circulation model (LMD-Z version 3.3). Ground-based measurements of the columnar aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and of surface black carbon (BC) concentration were carried out at two different sites in India: Goa University on the NIO coast and Dharwar 150 kin inland. Local-scale investigations point out that the trend in BC concentration at the ground is not correlated with AOT. Lidar profiles obtained both from the surface at Goa and in the NIO from the Mystere-20 research aircraft indicate that a significant contribution to the total AOT (more than 50%) is due to a turbid monsoon layer located between I and 3 kin height. RAMS simulation shows that the advection of aerosols in the monsoon layer is due to the conjunction of land-sea breeze and topography. We present the regional-scale extent of the aerosol plume in terms of AOT derived from the visible channel of Meteosat-5. During March, most of the Bay of Bengal is overcast by a haze with a monthly average AOT of 0.61 +/-0.18, and a spatially well-defined aerosol plume is spreading from the Indian west coast to the Intertropical Convergence Zone with an average AOT of 0.49 +/-0.08. Those values axe bigger than in February with AOT at 0.35 +/-0.18 and 0.37 +/-0.09 for the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, respectively. One of the principal findings of this paper is that a significant contribution to the aerosol load over the NIO is due to the advection of continental aerosols from India in a well-identified monsoon layer above the marine boundary layer. Moreover, it is suggested that the increase in biomass burning plays a significant role in the increasing trend in AOT during the winter dry monsoon season.

Adjacent German-Polish coastal waters, the Oder (Szczecin) Lagoon and the Oder (Pomeranian) Bight therefore suffer from severe eutrophication and water quality problems. At the same time, summer (bathing) tourism is the most important economical factor in this coastal zone, especially on the islands of Usedom and Wolin. On the basis of model simulations and remote sensing data we analysed the spatial extent and variability of the Oder river plume in the lagoon and the Balic Sea in common summer situations and during the extreme Oder flood in August 1997. Water quality shows pronounced gradients between coastal waters and open Baltic Sea. In the lagoon, it usually takes more than 6 weeks until Oder water enters the large western bay, the Kleines Haff. During transport, degradation, transformation and sedimentation processes alter the water quality and prevent the inner coast of Usedom from direct impact of polluted Oder water. Ongoing nutrient supply promotes intensive algal proliferation in all parts of the lagoon and contributes to the low water transparency. Oder water passing the lagoon and entering the Baltic Sea is transported over long distances in narrow bands along the shore. Under easterly winds the water quality near well-known spas on Usedom is reduced due to Oder river plume impact. Upwelling effects can have negative impact on water quality, too. Intensive blooms of potentially, toxic blue-green algae species, are the rule in the lagoon and frequent in the Oder Bight in summer. They are a hazard and limit the acceptance of swimming beaches at the inner coast of Usedom. Practical consequences of variable water quality gradients e.g. on hygienic water sampling are discussed.

J	Hagen, E; Feistel, R; Agenbag, JJ; Ohde, T				Hagen, E; Feistel, R; Agenbag, JJ; Ohde, T			Seasonal and interannual changes in Intense Benguela Upwelling (1982-1999)	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												Monthly maps of remotely sensed sea surface temperatures derived from NOAA/AVHRR thermal images are used to describe changes in 'Intense Benguela Upwelling' during 1982-1999. The coastal area under investigation lies between 9-34degrees S and 8-20degrees E and the total area of cold water between the coast and the course of the 13 degreesC isotherm is considered to be an index of intense, active upwelling. It exhibits a decreasing trend over the study period of 18 years and some evidence for a quasi-cycle of about 27 months. Seasonal cycles are discussed for the total cold water area as well as for its mean alongshore and offshore extents. The main season of cold surface water was found to occur between July and September during the austral winter. It peaks in August with a mean area of about 30x10(3) km(2) and relaxes drastically during the rest of the year. The underlying process of intense coastal upwelling is regionally trapped in two coastal zones. These are centred around 26 and 29degrees S and reach a mean offshore extension of 210 and 130 km, respectively, to form giant upwelling filaments. The area of cold water drastically shrinks, roughly by a factor of two, during weak upwelling years but significantly expands by a factor of about 1.5 during strong years. Associated sea level changes along the south-west African coast were derived from measurements at four coastal stations between 23 and 34degrees S during 1982-1987. The first principal component describes about 63 % of the total sea level variance. The lowest sea levels were found in the prominent Luderitz cell near 26degrees S. On both the annual and interannual time scale, decreasing cold water areas are accompanied by increasing sea levels and vice versa. Mean seasonal cycles reveal that variations in the total cold water area tag behind those in the sea level along the entire south-west African coast by about 1 month.

India has the world's most gigantic monsoon system which is extremely important for the Indian agriculture. India gets most of its rain during four months (June to September) of the monsoon season. In July we get the highest number of tropical disturbances in the Indian oceanic region. During the month of July 1996, two low pressures and one depression formed over Indian region. The present study aims to derive the moisture profile for the period July 1996, by using remote sensing technique and their impact on the analysis-forecast system. The inclusion of satellite derived moisture in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model results (i) the weakening monsoon flow pattern near Somalia region, (ii) the reduction of wind speeds in the south Bay of Bengal, (iii) the formation of a trough in the west coast of India, and (iv) the realistic rainfall prediction over the Orissa and Andhra Pradesh region, etc. All these effects are in contrast to the existing control and could help in better prediction of rainfall and flow pattern during the monsoon season.																	0187-6236					OCT 1	2001	14	4					203	209										WOS:000171489500004

Data are also visualized in maps by a tool properly developed, named GOMEView. The validation procedure is based on ground measurements obtained by sunphotometers. Results show that calibration of the surface reflectance is crucial to obtain the best results, i.e. in agreement with the ground measurements. Aerosol data have also been classified on the basis of their optical properties evidencing for instance, the presence of desert aerosol over the sea along the west coast of Sahara. Cloud retrievals were also analyzed in terms of their occurrence and amount. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transatlantic shipping incurs significant southerly detours during the ice season and offshore oil production facilities and procedures must be specially designed for operation in iceberg-frequented waters, including additional ships dedicated to iceberg "management". As a result, considerable effort has been expended in the development of various remote sensing tools for reliable, all-weather detection of icebergs. The RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite provides the opportunity to substantially increase iceberg detection frequency and accuracy. This paper presents some of the results of the validation study for the iceberg detection capabilities of RADARSAT-1 that was conducted during 2000 on the East Coast of Canada. Wide 2, Wide 3 and ScanSAR Narrow B scenes were acquired at various near-shore and offshore locations in Newfoundland during the months of May and June. Ground-truth data on icebergs, mainly using scaled aerial photography, were collected coincident with RADARSAT-1 acquisitions. The ground-truth iceberg positions were correlated to the locations of targets in the RADARSAT-1 imagery, and the characteristics of the iceberg signatures within the SAR images were documented. Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) techniques were used in the empirical determination of the probability of iceberg detection as a junction of iceberg size, wind speed and radar incidence angle. For SAR incidence angles greater than around 35 degrees, icebergs with sizes on the order of the resolution of the particular SAR mode can generally be detected. Larger icebergs will be detected more consistently, and even during rough sea states.																	0703-8992					OCT	2001	27	5					476	486		10.1080/07038992.2001.10854888								WOS:000172811700008

The science behind the long-range performance of HFSWR was presented in Part 1. The system described was installed on Canada's east coast, where it is being used to demonstrate continuous, all-weather surveillance of the EEZ to beyond 200 nm. The system consists of two land-based HFSWRs and an Operations Control Center (OCC). The two unmanned radars provide coverage of the Grand Banks region of Newfoundland, renowned for its offshore resources, particularly fish and oil. The system has been designed to assist authorities to more efficiently monitor such illegal activities as drug trafficking, smuggling, piracy, illicit fishing and illegal immigration. In addition, the system may be used for tracking icebergs, environmental protection, search and rescue, resource protection, sovereignty monitoring, and remote sensing of ocean surface currents and winds. Extensive performance testing of the system has been conducted using the two fully functional radars. It is shown that the HFSWR system complements existing surveillance assets to dramatically increase the effectiveness of air and surface reconnaissance missions by vectoring them directly to targets of interest.

Direct on-road ammonia measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Remote sensing was employed for the first time to measure NH3 levels in the exhaust of on-road light duty motor vehicles. The sensor also measured the concentration of CO2, CO, hydrocarbons, and NO, among other pollutants, in the emitted exhaust. Field measurements were conducted at a Los Angeles freeway on-ramp; vehicles traveled at cruise speeds between 20 and 25 m s(-1) (45-55 mi h(-1)). Mean fleet NH3 levels of 44.7 +/- 4.1 ppm were observed. These emissions exhibited a highly skewed distribution: 50.1% of the emitted NH3 was contributed by 10% of the sampled fleet. The pollutant distribution among high NH3 emitters is analyzed to identify the conditions that lead to three-way catalyst malfunction and, hence, NH3 formation. In contradiction with previous reports, we found that high NH3 emissions could not be attributed to vehicles running under rich air-fuel conditions. We estimate a mean fleet NH3 mass emission rate of 667 57 mg L-1 (E-r = 94 +/- 8 mg km(-1)). These findings could have significant implications on air quality in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of California, since they support the hypothesis that emissions from motor vehicles constitute a dominant regional source of NH3, between 20 and 27% of total daily emissions. As NH3 is the predominant atmospheric base, tropospheric levels play a key role in the buffering capacity of the atmosphere and, hence, the formation of fine aerosol. Our results could explain the ubiquitous distribution of ammonium fine particles observed during fall stagnation conditions in the SoCAB.																	0013-936X					SEP 15	2001	35	18					3735	3741		10.1021/es002046y								WOS:000171055400022	11783653					
J	Legrand, M; Plana-Fattori, A; N'doume, C				Legrand, M; Plana-Fattori, A; N'doume, C			Satellite detection of dust using the IR imagery of Meteosat 1. Infrared difference dust index	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI) is a satellite dust product designed for climatological applications, designed specifically for dust remote sensing in and regions such as the Sahel and Sahara. It is based on the atmospheric response to dust, extracted from midday Meteosat-IR imagery, and takes advantage of the impact of dust aerosols on the thermal infra-red radiance outgoing to space. Simulations show a quasi-linear relationship between satellite response to dust and shortwave optical depth, with a sensitivity depending on particle size distribution and radiative surface properties. Comparison of measured satellite response with photometric optical depth agrees with the simulations. Water vapor significantly affects the satellite signal for cases of large columnar amounts and oceanic air masses advected inland. Hence apart from possible coastal effects, the water vapor effect can be neglected in the Sahelian-Saharan zone north of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, coinciding with the major regions of African dust emission and transport. The construction of the IDDI involves the processing of reference images, theoretically representing the outgoing radiance obtaining under clear-sky conditions. Errors may arise from (1) dust remaining in the reference images and (2) seasonal shifts of the reference level; however, the latter error will be offset by averaging used in climatological processing. An error budget is presented for the station of Gao. A statistical comparison of IDDI data with visibility measured at synoptic stations results in (1) a validation of the product, and (2) a climatologically relevant visibility-IDDI relation, valid for the and regions of northern Africa. The latter relation is consistent with both simulations and photometric measurements. IDDI maps over Africa compare successfully with optical depth over adjacent ocean regions derived from Meteosat-VIS imagery. The observed continuity of dust plumes across the African coast demonstrates the consistency between both products.																	0747-7309					AUG 27	2001	106	D16					18251	18274		10.1029/2000JD900749								WOS:000170579400042						
J	Hormazabal, S; Shaffer, G; Letelier, J; Ulloa, O				Hormazabal, S; Shaffer, G; Letelier, J; Ulloa, O			Local and remote forcing of sea surface temperature in the coastal upwelling system off Chile	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												An analysis is presented of records of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level and winds collected during the period 1991-1995 along the coast of northern and central Chile (sea level also from the Peru coast in 1991-1994), and of SST from remote sensing during the austral summers of 1991 and 1992 off northern Chile. Large, interannual fluctuations of SST and sea level off northern Chile are linked to vertical displacements of the equatorial thermocline during El Nino-La Nina events. In the intraseasonal, 50-day band, SST and sea level are intimately related all along the coast, whereby SST anomalies lag sea level perturbations by about 12 days. Such sea level fluctuations are due to free, coastal-trapped waves, ultimately forced via equatorial Kelvin waves by 50-day wind events in the western and central tropical Pacific. These results and those of the remote sensing analysis suggest significant remote forcing of SST fluctuations in the coastal zone off Chile by the action of the coastal-trapped waves. Off central Chile, SST is also related to local wind stress in the intraseasonal band. Simulations with a simple, local, wind-driven upwelling/entrainment model capture rather well observed synoptic and intraseasonal oscillations of SST there. Off northern Chile, however, this simple model is not successful in simulating observed SST. An attempt to include effects of coastal-trapped waves into this simple, one-dimensional model did not improve model fit to data at either location. An explanation for the apparent strong influence of these waves on SST along this coast should therefore be sought in other effects not considered by this model such as cross-shelf and alongshore advection.

The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT, Chennai) has deployed this buoy at 13 degreesN, 87 degreesE, by fixing various meteorological instruments and sensors to acquire sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature (Ta), wind speed (Ws), wind direction (Wd) and ocean currents (Cs) using remote sensing technique through (NSAT-1D) satellite at an interval of 3 h. The results of the analysis of the above parameters have shown clearly a response (SST difference between before and after formation) of about 0.7 degreesC for the Gopalpur cyclone and 0.9 degreesC for the Paradip cyclone. Ta has shown rapid variations following the rapid movement of cloud decks across the buoy during the cyclone period. The observed changes in the wind speed and direction are in concurrence with analysed mean sea level pressure oscillations. Finally, this study recommends more buoy-based marine meteorological observations over this region and the neighbouring areas, where the tropical cyclones generally occur and subsequently hit the Coromandal coast.

The total biomass is estimated, based on the morphology of the dominant species Laminaria longicruris. Kelp-covered and kelp-free areas are differentiated from each other in water depth of 0-6 m and 0-7 m with the HRV and TM images, respectively. The median biomass estimated for the kelp-covered category of the classified image is (1500 +/- 400) g m(-2). The multidate image shows a spatial variation of the kelp beds in 45% of the area. Areas where no change occurred occupy at least 70 ha, while growth and decay of kelp are observed in much smaller areas, in shallow water and at the boundary of kelp beds.																	0143-1161					JUL 20	2001	22	11					2083	2094		10.1080/01431160116919								WOS:000169546300003

Live coral cover, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity were monitored during 1997-98, in conjunction with 'hot spot' satellite bleaching predictions of NOAA's NESDIS. Coral reef bleaching during the 1997-98 El Nino at Bahia Banderas coincided closely with satellite bleaching predictions and with experimental observations on coral tolerance to thermal stress. The initial bleaching event rapidly evolved into an unprecedented massive coral mortality (96%), equivalent to the catastrophic coral mortalities observed in the Galapagos Islands during the 1982-83 ENSO. The sudden mass bleaching and mortality of corals at Bahia Banderas was most likely caused by the marked accelerated warming rate (+3.5 degreesC mo(-1)), an order of magnitude higher than that observed during the 1982-83 El Nino in the Galapagos Islands (+0.35 degreesC mo(-1)). Also, the SST anomaly observed during the 1997-98 ENSO at Bahia Banderas (+6.1 degreesC) was 30% higher than in 1982-83 in the Galapagos area (+4.5 degreesC). The recovery of the Bahia a Banderas coral reefs is uncertain since the dead coral substrate has already been covered with filamentous fleshy algae. In contrast to the long-lasting existence of corals and coral reefs in the region, reef frameworks are typically very thin. This situation may indicate the frequent recurrence of mortality events due to environmental extremes, such as ENSO, that have limited reef development in the northeastern tropical Pacific Ocean.

J	Fouache, E; Gruda, G; Mucaj, S; Nikolli, P				Fouache, E; Gruda, G; Mucaj, S; Nikolli, P			Recent geomorphological evolution of the deltas of the rivers Seman and Vjosa, Albania	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Rising in the Neogene hills of the Mallakaster, the rivers Seman and Vjosa have built up two large joint deltas on the Albanian Adriatic shore. This shoreline is characterized by a low sandy coast with bars and spits. Changes in the river courses and migration of the mouths of the deltas were rapid and numerous from the Holocene period until the beginning of drainage works in the 1950s. The drainage basins of the two rivers are developed in soft elastic rocks (flysch and molasse) in the proportion of 71.4 per cent for the Seman and 44.8 per cent for the Vjosa. Both rivers carry abundant sediment loads, amounting to 6.7 x 10(6) tonnes per year for the Vjosa and 13. x 10(6) tonnes per year for the Seman. This is the reason why the alluvial deposits of the Seman have built up two-thirds of the alluvial plain. The use of a SPOT image dated 25 May 1995 (HRV 3 081-268) enabled us to view the effects of coastal and fluvial dynamics, the role of neotectonics as well as the predominance of the plume of suspended sediment of the Seman river. Using this image, a geomorphological map was drawn, which identifies the palaeochannels of the Seman and the Vjosa. In order to date those palaeochannels we have made an archaeological inventory from oral and written published information. The location of the sites we studied was checked systematically in the field. The mediaeval and Ottoman archives kept in Tirana also provided substantial information, as well as the reconstitution of the evolution of the shoreline between 1870 and 1990, carried out using an inventory of topographic maps. This work allowed us to reconstitute the progression of the deltas of the Seman and the Vjosa since antiquity. We may then infer that from antiquity up to the Middle Ages, the deltas of the Seman and the Vjosa both progressed very moderately and in a comparable way. However, at the end of the 15th century the Seman underwent a major change in its course, through a southward migration of the river. The natural processes of alluviation and changes in the river courses seem to have been accelerated as agricultural exploitation of the Neogene hills that form most of the drainage basin of the Seman increased. This exploitation is linked with the massive exportation of cereal from the port of Skela e Pirgut, which started in the 14th century. It appears that the 20th century has been the period of the largest progression of the deltas during historical times. The speed of progression increased as early as the beginning of the century, as a result of the rapid growth of the rural population densities. Soil erosion from arable fields increased catchment sediment yields to promote rapid changes in the river courses. This resulted in abandonment of deltaic mouths, a phenomenon leading to a straightening of the coast. Thus to the south of the present mouth of the Seman the coast receded by 7 to 30 m per year between 1968 and 1990 as a result of the abandonment of a mouth.

An important cautionary note is that the surface plumes visible in the remote-sensing data (even though nearly coincident with flooding) do not represent mass output from the rivers.																	0091-7613					JUL	2001	29	7					659	662		10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<0659:MFOFCW>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000169671300023

Spatially referenced fishery data and satellite-derived advanced very high resolution radiometry (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data were examined using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The distribution and relative abundance of I. argentinus in the Falkland Islands fishery was examined for the period 1989-96. Three consistent areas of high abundance were observed to the north-east (shelf-break region) and north-west (shelf region) of the islands, and close to the northern coast of East Falkland. Areas of high sea surface temperature gradients (thermal gradients) extracted from remotely sensed satellite images were used as an indicator of mesoscale oceanographic activity and compared with the location of the fishery. I. argentinus were found to be associated with areas of thermal gradients, commonly seen at the interface of Falkland Current and Patagonian shelf waters. The techniques used in this analysis allow the overlay and analysis of physical oceanographic and fishery data with potential applications in fisheries management and operational fisheries oceanography.

The analysis of a sardine-recruitment time-series fur the period 1976-1998 shows that there has been a decreasing trend since 1983 (with the exceptions of 1991 and 1992), the years from 1993-1995 representing the lowest values in that time series. Horse mackerel exhibited a decrease from 1986 until 1990. and from 1992-1995, the latter representing the lowest value For the period 1986-1998. Sea surface temperature (SST) derived From satellite data were used to compute monthly SST upwelling indices along the Portuguese west coast over a period from 1987-1997. The analysis focused on seasonal and annual upwelling variability of Portugal, and its possible effects on sardine and horse mackerel recruitment to the fishery. An increasing trend in SST upwelling indices during the winter (January-March). especially between 1992 and 1995 was found. The upwelling events observed off Portugal during winter months, which correspond to the spawning season for sardine and horst: mackerel, had a negative impact on the recruitment of these fish species. This effect on recruitment could be due to an increase in conditions favourable to the offshore transport of larvae and consequently an increase in their mortality. Prior to 1992, when no upwelling events occurred during winter, recruitment dynamics was closely linked with the spring-summer seasonal upwelling variability off the Portuguese west coast.

Wave refraction studies have been conducted to determine locations of wave convergence and divergence. rip currents and to provide quantitative measurements of littoral drift and drift direction for local as well as regional areas. However, studies based on geomorphic indicators aided with remote sensing techniques were reliable to determine littoral drift cells and drift direction within each cell and net littoral drift direction along west coast of India. This review indicates that though littoral drift is variable, bi-directional and season dependent, long-term net littoral drift along west coast of India is southwards. Efforts have also been made to highlight the neglected aspects, merits and demerits of various methods used.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUN	2001	30	2					57	64										WOS:000168988600001

Field observations made in the wet and dry seasons concurrent with the space missions and chemical analyses of floodwaters confirm that flooding is the product of discharge from the Yucatan aquifer, which consists of a fresh-water lens floating on seawater, This discharge controls the distribution of wetlands. Therefore, vegetation and flooding patterns, mapped with SIR-C imagery, provide valuable information on the hydrogeology of the region. Radar-image maps of wetlands and flooding indicate that there are three major zones of groundwater discharge that correlate with structures of the buried Chicxulub crater--zone 1 with the peak ring, zone 2 with the crater rim, and zone 3 with the exterior ring. Zone 1 has sulfate-poor discharge, unlike the sulfate-rich discharge in zones 2 and 3, The highest discharge is in zone 3, where the buried crater is closest to the surface. This groundwater-discharge pattern can be explained by tidal pumping of fresh water to the surface through high permeability zones developed in the Tertiary carbonates overlying crater faults and escarpments.																	0016-7606					MAR	2001	113	3					403	416		10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0403:SIRCSC>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000167183700009						
J	Senet, CM; Seemann, J; Ziemer, F				Senet, CM; Seemann, J; Ziemer, F			The near-surface current velocity determined from image sequences of the sea surface	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												A method to measure the ocean's near-surface current velocity vector based on the analysis of remote sea-surface image sequences was developed. The spatial and temporal records were transformed to the wavenunber-frequency domain, resulting in a three-dimensional (3-D) image power spectrum. In the spectrum, the signal energy of the waves is localized on a shell defined by the dispersion relation of surface waves. The sum of the sensor's velocity and the near-surface current profile deforms the dispersion shell due to the Doppler-frequency shift. An iterative least-squares fitting technique and an error-estimation model was implemented. To improve the method's accuracy, spectral wave energy found in higher harmonics of the dispersion shell and aliasing effects are taken into account. The most important nonlinear mechanism leading to higher harmonics is explained as resulting from wave shadowing due to the low grazing angles typical for ground-or ship-based radars. The low rotation time of nautical radar antennas causes temporal undersampling, which leads to aliasing in the frequency domain. In this paper, the improved method is examined analytically and is tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The variation of the shape of the measured or simulated 3-D image spectra, especially the peak wavenumber, the directional spread, and the main travel direction, controls the behavior and accuracy of the technique. A comparison of velocities acquired by nautical radar and independent Doppler Log current measurements is presented. The technique's accuracy, its limits, and its adaptability are discussed. Additional improvements are proposed, which lead to higher accuracy considering the shape of the spectral background noise and the technique's applicability to high ship speeds. The presented method is an important step toward operationalization of a commercial wave-monitoring system based on nautical radars.																	0196-2892					MAR	2001	39	3					492	505		10.1109/36.911108								WOS:000167628100003						
J	Greenslade, DJM				Greenslade, DJM			The assimilation of ERS-2 significant wave height data in the Australian region	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The results from an experiment to assimilate satellite altimeter significant wave height (SWH) data into an ocean wave model are presented. Data from the European Remote-sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2) are used. Statistical interpolation is used to construct analysed SWH fields using the altimeter data. The ocean wave model is AUSWAM, a version of WAM, which runs operationally at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and provides up to 96-h forecasts of sea-state, Forcing is obtained from surface wind fields calculated from the operational atmospheric systems. Model spectra are adjusted using various assimilation strategies. Results were validated against a number of waverider buoys situated around the Australian coast. Over two 35-day periods, it was found that assimilation of the ERS-2 SWH data reduced the systematic bias in analysed SWH by approximately 10% (with a change of sign), The Scatter Index was reduced by 6% and the rms error by approximately 8%, The improvement in model skill is also retained throughout the forecast period. The assimilation is found to have the greatest impact at locations on the west coast of Australia, where the sea-state is dominated by swell, It is suggested that errors in the modelled wave fields arise from a combination of overpredicted wind speeds and excessive dissipation at low wavenumbers.

J	Rignot, E				Rignot, E			Evidence for rapid retreat and mass loss of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Thwaites Glacier, the second largest ice stream in West Antarctica, drains an area of 166500 +/- 2000 km(2) which accumulates 55 +/- 5 Gt a(-1) (or 60 +/- 6 km(3) ice a(-1)) into the Amundsen Sea, unrestrained by an ice shelf. Using interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) data collected by the European Remote-sensing Satellites (ERS-1 and -2) in 1996, an output flux of 71 +/- 7 Gta(-1) (or 77 +/- 8 km(3) ice a(-1)) is estimated at the grounding line, where ice thickness is deduced from hydrostatic equilibrium. A similar flux, 70 +/- 7 Gt a(-1) (or 76 +/- 8 km(3) ice a(-1)), is obtained at a gate located 20 km upstream, where ice thickness was measured in 1978 by ice-sounding radar. Total accumulation in between the two gates is 1.6 Gt a(-1), or 1.8 km(3) ice a(-1). Ice discharge therefore exceeds mass accumulation by 30 +/- 15%, and Thwaites Glacier must be thinning and retreating at present. The InSAR data show that the glacier floating ice tongue exerts no back pressure on the inland ice, calves into tabular icebergs along a significant fraction of its grounding line, and has a grounding-line thickness which exceeds a prior-calculated limit for stability. Glacier thinning is confirmed at the coast by the detection of a 1.4 +/- 0.2 km retreat of its grounding line between 1992 and 1996 with InSAR, which implies 3.2 +/- 0.6 in ice a(-1) thinning at the glacier center and less near the sides. These results complement the decimeter-scale annual surface lowering observed with satellite radar altimetry several hundred kin inland of the grounding line. The magnitude of ice thinning estimated at the coast, however, rules out temporal changes in accumulation as the explanation for surface lowering. Ice thinning must be due to changes in ice flow.

J	Boyd, IL; Hawker, EJ; Brandon, MA; Staniland, IJ				Boyd, IL; Hawker, EJ; Brandon, MA; Staniland, IJ			Measurement of ocean temperatures using instruments carried by Antarctic fur seals	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The study aimed to test the utility of instruments deployed on marine mammals for measuring physical oceanographic variation and, using this method, to examine temperature variation in the coastal waters around South Georgia. There was a significant correlation between temperature measurements made using a towed undulating oceanographic recorder (UOR) and concurrent measurements from time-depth recorders (TDRs) fitted to lactating Antarctic fur seals foraging from the coast of South Georgia, Congruence was found at horizontal spatial scales from 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees to 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees (degrees of latitude and longitude), and at a vertical scale of 10 m. However, there was no significant correlation between temperature measured by TDRs in the top 5 m and sea surface temperature (SST) measured by satellite remote sensing. TDR data provided information about temperature variation vertically through the water column, and through rime. The UOR data were used to recalibrate the TDR data in order to correct for the slow response time of the TDR thermistor relative to the speed of seal movements through the water column. Seasonal temperature variation was apparent, and temperatures also varied between regions, and with bathymetry. These results were consistent with the current interpretation of the coastal oceanography around South Georgia. In particular, the relationship between on- and off-shelf waters showed larger amounts of warmer surface water in a region in which more run-off was to be expected. The study also showed that Antarctic fur seals concentrate their activity in regions of colder, and presumably oceanic, water. Such instrumented animals could provide near real time data for assimilation into ocean models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Broitman, BR; Navarrete, SA; Smith, F; Gaines, SD				Broitman, BR; Navarrete, SA; Smith, F; Gaines, SD			Geographic variation of southeastern Pacific intertidal communities	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We conducted field surveys of rocky intertidal communities at 18 sites distributed between 29degrees S and 36degrees S on the coast of central Chile in order to document broad patterns of functional and trophic group abundance and evaluate their association with oceanographic features. Results showed that the main sessile components of the landscape throughout the region were kelps (16 %) and crustose algae (48 %) in the low intertidal zone, while mussels beds (30 %) and corticated algae (32 %) dominated the mid-intertidal zone. Geographic trends in abundance across the entire region varied from no clear regional patterns for some groups (e.g. barnacles), to smooth gradients increasing or decreasing toward higher latitudes for others (kelps and ephemeral algae) and to an abrupt switch from dominant to scarce northward of 32degrees S in 1 group (mussels). Significant among-site negative correlations were detected between the abundances of most algal functional groups and between mussels and barnacles. Herbivore density was negatively correlated with kelp and corticated algal cover, and positively correlated with crustose algal abundance. These correlations reinforce the notion that local biological interactions can partially account for the among-site variability in functional group abundance. We assessed the influence of mesoscale oceanographic features through satellite image analyses, by classifying the study sites as either strongly or weakly influenced by coastal upwelling. At sites strongly influenced by upwelling, we found significantly higher cover of kelps in the low intertidal zone and of corticated algae in the mid-intertidal zone. Cover of ephemeral algae in the mid-intertidal zone was significantly lower at sites strongly affected by upwelling. Contrary to predictions of bottom-up community regulation models, we found no significant differences in abundance of sessile filter feeders (mussels or barnacles), herbivores or carnivores. A significant proportion of the regional variation in abundance in some of the most abundant functional groups within each tidal level was associated with the latitudinal gradient in annual mean sea surface temperature (SST). We detected a significant correlation between SST and the abundance of kelps and crustose algae in the low intertidal zone, and mussels and ephemeral algae in the mid-intertidal zone. The abrupt change in the abundance of mussels in the mid-intertidal zone at about 32degrees S may indicate a similarly abrupt change in biological or environmental conditions. Lack of significant correlation between the abundance of mussels and other functional groups suggests that biological interactions may not be responsible for this geographic discontinuity. We suggest that oceanography may be largely involved in the geographic variability detected in patterns of community structure. Recent remote sensing studies documenting oceanographic discontinuities around the 32degrees S zone support our suggestion. Our results highlight the need for further experimental and oceanographic studies in areas where strong biophysical gradients are observed. Such areas may well reflect the existence of steep oceanographic gradients sensitive to large-scale environmental forcing.

J	Parodi, A; Boni, G				Parodi, A; Boni, G			Phenomenological validation of a regional rainfall frequency analysis	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PART B-HYDROLOGY OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE												The interpretation of the experimental evidence of the presence of a double component in the distribution of rainfall annual maxima (RAM) observed along he Tyrrhenian coast of Italy is discussed here. Using a simple model for rainfall storm generation the effect of the presence or absence of the European blocking condition on the generation of the double component in the RAM is investigated. The model is calibrated on the essential meteorological characteristics of the Mediterranean storms provided both by remote sensing and high resolution raingauge data. It allows to give a physical explanation for the variability of the parameters distribution with time observation interval. The maxima extracted from the model generated rainfall time series show statistical properties very similar to those obtained by sample data. In particular the model derived rainfall frequency curves and intensity duration frequency curves show a good agreement with the observed ones. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Smyth, TJ; Miller, PI; Groom, SB; Lavender, SJ				Smyth, TJ; Miller, PI; Groom, SB; Lavender, SJ			Remote sensing of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll during Lagrangian experiments at the Iberian margin	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll data are used to characterise the period of upwelling during a cruise on which two Lagrangian drift experiments were conducted off the Iberian Atlantic coast in August 1998. During the cruise there was a prolonged period of equator-ward winds which favour upwelling; three distinct maxima were observed in the meteorological data interspersed with periods of relaxation. The SST and chlorophyll imagery show upwelling to be active with distinct offshore filaments that are cooler and of higher chlorophyll concentration than the surrounding oceanic water; these filaments represent an important cross-shelf transport mechanism. A front detection methodology has been applied to satellite images and suggests that these filaments are distinct, long-lived features, characterised by enhanced primary production.

J	Shaw, AGP; Vennell, R				Shaw, AGP; Vennell, R			Measurements of an oceanic front using a front-following algorithm for AVHRR SST imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Subtropical Front (STF) is a global front which extends around the Southern Ocean and is the boundary where the Subantarctic Surface Water mass (SAW) converges with the subtropical Surface Water mass (STW). The Southland Front (SF) is part of the STF, which lies off the east coast of the South Island, New Zealand. The SF is narrow, approximately 8 km, with a temperature difference of approximately 1.8 degrees C which can be detected using remote sensing Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data. The work presented here is an application of remote sensing for the first detailed study of the surface spatial and temporal variability of the SF. The variability of the SF was quantified using an algorithm developed to follow the Front using AVHRR SST imagery. The algorithm used a new approach to determine the position, mean SST, SST difference, width, and gradient across the Front. Three timescales of variability were examined: long-term (three years), annual, and seasonal. The algorithm efficiently followed the SF and consistently showed the three-year mean position was stable and constrained by the bathymetry of the continental slope. Seasonally, the front moved inshore during summer. The temperature gradient across the front was strongest and the front narrowest in winter. The decrease in SST gradient during the three-year data set coincided with the decrease in Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

J	Parkinson, CL				Parkinson, CL			Variability of Arctic sea ice: The view from space, an 18-year record	ARCTIC					Conference on Arctic Seas - Currents of Change	OCT 21-24, 1998	MYSTIC, CT					A recently compiled 18-year record ( 1979 to 1996) of sea ice concentrations derived from four passive-microwave satellite instruments has allowed the quantification of a variety of measures of Arctic sea ice variability. Earlier maps generated using data through August 1987 have been updated to 18-year summaries of the annual range of sea ice distributions, the interannual variability of average monthly sea ice distributions, the frequency of sea ice coverage over the 18-years, the length of the sea ice season, and trends in the length of the sea ice season. Linear least squares trends over the 18-year record show the sea ice season to have lengthened over some sizeable regions, especially in the Bering Sea, Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, the Labrador Sea, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, but to have shortened over a much larger area, including the Sea of Okhotsk, the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, and all the seas along the north coast of Russia. The area with trends showing sea ice seasons shortening by over 0.5 days/year is 7.5 x 10(6) km(2), over 2.5 times the area experiencing a lengthening of the sea ice season by over 0.5 days/year. Neither the shortening nor the lengthening, however, is uniform or monotonic over the 18-year record. Instead, the ice cover exhibits widespread interannual variability, not just in the length of the sea ice season but for each month-a fact well illustrated by the monthly average September ice coverage, which was at its lowest extent in 1995 but at its second highest one year later, in the final year of the record. The maps of ice frequency and ice variability can help identify how anomalous individual years are. In some cases, they can help forestall unnecessary concern over seemingly unusual conditions which, upon examination of the maps, are found to fall well within the observed variability.

For one possible countermeasure we have developed an oil sensor. This sensor can be applied for a remote sensing technique (LIDAR) and fluorescence analysis. This system can distinguish oil spices in laboratory. We have tried to obtain field experience for the first time using fluorescence LIDAR (F-LIDAR). The F-LIDAR system was used to carry out a field analysis around Yuge Island on board a ship (Yuge-Maru). The fluorescence response was detected but oil was not detected during this voyage. We think that cause for this result was the microbes, based on an observation of seawater by an optical microscope. F-LIDAR can observe microbes under environmental conditions.

New data on coastal erosion in the Laptev Sea, which are based on field measurements and remote sensing information, and existing data on coastal erosion in the CBS as well as riverine sediment discharge into both the Laptev Sea and the CBS are included. Strong regional differences in the percentages of coastal erosion and riverine sediment supply are observed. The CBS is dominated by the riverine sediment discharge (64.45x10(6) t a(-1)) mainly of the Mackenzie River, which is the largest single source of sediments in the Arctic. Riverine sediment discharge into the Laptev Sea amounts to 24.10x10(6) t a(-1), more than 70% of which an related to the Lena River. In comparison with the CBS, the Laptev Sea coast on average delivers approximately twice as much sediment mass per kilometer, a result of higher erosion rates due to higher cliffs and seasonal ice melting. Ln the Laptev Sea sediment input by coastal erosion (58.4x10(6) t a(-1)) is therefore more important than in the CBS and the ratio between riverine and coastal sediment input amounts to 0.4. Coastal erosion supplying 5.6x10(6) t a(-1) is less significant for the sediment budget of the CBS where riverine sediment discharge exceeds coastal sediment input by a factor of ca. 10.																	1437-3254					DEC	2000	89	3					450	460		10.1007/s005310000113								WOS:000166020600002

The data we used are NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) IR (infrared) images taken In 1996 and 1997 summer at the HRPT (High Resolution Picture Transmission) receiving station built on Tai-Ping Island, which is located in the central SCS. An upwelling intensity, defined by the total heat loss in the upwelling cold water region, is used to determine the relationship between coastal upwelling and the wind stress derived from the ERS-2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) data. The results show that the upwelling intensity has a good linens relationship with the total alongshore wind stress while it has a fore: correlation with the cross-shore component of wind stress. These results imply that the alongshore wind stress is the main factor to pump the cold water up to the sea surfacer layer. Meanwhile, the satellite infrared images also indicate that the centroid of cold water moved southward from 15 degreesN to 11 degreesN during the observation period. The size of upwelling area changed as well, and finally evolved into a cold jet stretching offshore along 11 degreesN-12 degreesN in the mid-August 1997. Satellite infrared and altimeteric data short; that the evolution of upwelling region is closely associated with the development of two anticyclonic circulations in the western SCS.

Most previous studies have analysed ENSO-induced changes in climate based on a single variable, such as rainfall. Also, it is generally assumed that the ENSO impact in East Africa is geographically uniform. 2 The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the impact of ENSO on East African ecosystems, by measuring teleconnections between an ENSO index and a number of ecosystem variables in a spatially explicit way and for different time lags. We analysed the spatial patterns of teleconnections in the region by combining time series of climate variables measured for meteorological stations with time series of a vegetation index and surface temperature data measured by remote sensing. 3 Our results confirm the ENSO impact on the climatic and ecological variability in East Africa. However, the pattern of teleconnections is much more complex than generally assumed, both in terms of spatial distribution and impact on different ecosystem variables. Not all climate and land surface variables are teleconnected to ENSO in the same way, which leads to a complex impact of ENSO on the ecosystem. Moreover, the ENSO impact is highly differentiated in space, as the direction, magnitude and timing of this impact are controlled by the local climate system, the presence of large lakes, proximity to the coast and, possibly, local topography and land cover.																	0960-7447					NOV	2000	9	6					481	497		10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00208.x								WOS:000166996000004						
J	Diem, JE; Comrie, AC				Diem, JE; Comrie, AC			Integrating remote sensing and local vegetation information for a high-resolution biogenic emissions inventory - Application to an urbanized, semiarid region	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												This paper presents a methodology for the development of a,high-resolution (30-m), standardized biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions inventory and a subsequent application of the methodology to Tucson, AZ. The region's heterogeneous vegetation cover cannot be modeled accurately with low-resolution (e.g., l-km) land cover and vegetation information. Instead, local vegetation:data are used in conjunction with multispectral satellite data to generate a detailed vegetation-based land-cover database of the region. A high-resolution emissions inventory is assembled by associating the vegetation data with appropriate emissions factors. The inventory reveals a substantial variation in BVOC emissions across the region, resulting from the region's diversity of both native and exotic vegetation. The importance of BVOC emissions from forest lands, desert lands, and the urban forest changes according to regional, metropolitan, and urban scales. Within the entire Tucson region, the average isoprene, monoterpene, and OVOC fluxes observed were 454, 248, and 91 mug/m(2)/hr, respectively, with forest and desert lands emitting nearly all of the BVOCs. Within the metropolitan area, which does not include the forest lands, the average fluxes were 323, 181, and 70 mug/m(2)/hr, respectively. Within the urban area, the average fluxes were 801, 100, and 100 mug/m(2)/hr, respectively, with exotic trees such as eucalyptus, pine, and palm emitting most of the urban BVOCs. The methods presented in this paper can be modified to create detailed, standardized BVOC emissions inventories for other regions, especially those with spatially complex vegetation patterns.																	1047-3289					NOV	2000	50	11					1968	1979		10.1080/10473289.2000.10464223								WOS:000165390600011	11111341

Precisely quantifying and mapping deciduousness in tropical forests will be necessary for calibrating remote sensing images which attempt to assess canopy properties such as carbon cycling, productivity, or chlorophyll content. We thus set out to assess the degree of canopy deciduousness in three moist, semi-deciduous tropical forests in central Panama. One site is a 6-ha research plot near the Atlantic coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2830 mm/yr. The second site is a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, near the center of the isthmus of Panama, where rainfall is 2570 mm/yr, and the final site is a 4-ha plot near the Pacific coast of Panama, where rainfall is 2060 mm/yr. At each site, a random sample of trees from all canopy species (those with individuals greater than or equal to 30 cm DBH) were visited and scored for deciduousness three times during the 1997 dry season. The estimated peak fraction of deciduous individuals in the canopy at the wetter site was 4.8%, at the intermediate site, 6.3%, and at the drier site, 24.3%. The estimated fraction of crown area deciduous peaked at 3.6%, 9.7%, and 19.1% at the wet, medium, and dry sites respectively. The percentage of canopy species that was deciduous -14%, 28%, and 41%-was much higher than the percentage of deciduous individuals, because not all individuals of deciduous species were deciduous. During the 1999 dry season, every individual of all the deciduous species was visited at the two drier sites, and the total number of deciduous trees observed closely matched the estimated numbers based on the smaller 1997 samples.																	1100-9233					OCT	2000	11	5					649	658		10.2307/3236572								WOS:000166253100005						
J	Konicki, KM; Holman, RA				Konicki, KM; Holman, RA			The statistics and kinematics of transverse sand bars on an open coast	MARINE GEOLOGY												Ten years (1987-1996) of time exposure video images of the nearshore region at Duck, NC were used to study transverse sand bars, bathymetric features of intermediate length scales (10-200 m) oriented oblique or perpendicular to the shoreline. These transverse sand bars extend seaward from both the shoreline (trough transverse bars) and the shore-parallel sand bar (offshore transverse bars). Transverse bars had not previously been observed in an energetic coastal environment such as that at Duck, and their dynamics and role in nearshore processes is unknown. Frequency of occurrence statistics and length scales of the transverse bars were calculated using the video images. Trough and offshore transverse bars appeared a mean of 39 and 73 days per year, respectively. The offshore bars were found to be much larger features than the trough bars, with mean wavelengths (alongshore spacing between consecutive crests) of 79 and 172 m for trough and offshore bars, respectively. Both the trough and offshore bars were found to persist for periods of days to months. The alongshore movement of the bars was measured and compared to estimates of surf zone longshore currents which were calculated from wave height and wave angle data. Both sets of bars were observed to move at rates up to 40 m/day. At times, both trough and offshore bars were observed shifting in the same direction as the current was flowing, and at other times, both sets of bars remained stationary, even under relatively strong longshore currents. Trough bars were also observed moving against the current. An hypothesis, proposed by Barcilon and Lau (1973) [J. Geophys. Res. 78(15). 2656-2664], that the transverse bars were created as a sea bed instability under longshore currents, was tested by comparing the magnitude of estimated surf zone longshore currents with times of formation or presence of transverse bars. There was no evidence to suggest that the bars were formed by this simple longshore current instability mechanism. Instead, it is plausible that the combined effects of waves and currents may drive the formation of these features. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Observations included: aircraft and satellite remote sensing, H.F. and X-band radar, ship surveys and in situ instruments on the sea bed and at the sea surface. These observations aimed to monitor, over three successive winter periods, the dynamics and sediment distributions in the vicinity of this rapidly eroding coastline, Associated modelling applications included components simulating: (i) tides and surge currents; (ii) wave evolution, (iii) vertical distributions of turbulence and SPM (suspended particulate matter) and (iv) resulting spatial patterns of sediment transport in the region. Simulations of tidal currents confirmed the accuracy of such models, given accurate fine-resolution bathymetry and appropriate boundary conditions. New developments of WAM, the spectral wave model required for fine-resolution applications in shallow water (described by Monbaliu et al, [Monbaliu, J., Padilla-Hernandez, R., Hargreaves, J.C., Carretero Albiach, J.C., Luo, W., Sclavo, M., Gunther, H., 2000. The spectral wave model WAM adapted for applications with high spatial resolution. This volume.]) are tested here. A number of additional features pertaining to shallow water are revealed including the sensitivity to specification of wind directions and the excessive temporal spreading of short-lived distant events. Likewise, the application of the generic single-point models for vertical profiles of turbulence and SPM (described by Baumert et al. [Baumert, H., Chapalain, G., Smaoui, H., McManus, J.P., Yagi, H., Regener, M., Sundermann, J., Szilagy, B., 2000. Modelling and numerical simulation of turbulence, waves and suspended sediment for pre-operational use in coastal seas. This volume]), are tested and also shown to be appropriate for simulating localised resuspension of SPM. This simulation also illustrates how, in shallow water (< 15 m), tidal and wave dynamics interact with significant mutual adjustments and with first-order influence on stress at the sea bed and thereby erosion and suspension processes. Some preliminary simulations of net sediment movement are included, involving an integration of the above effects. These simulations emphasise how, in all but the shallowest water, the mobility of coarse grain sediments is limited to occasions of extreme waves. By contrast, the movement of fine sediments follows that of the residual tidal current streamlines, i.c., primarily longshore with attendant cross-shore dispersion. However, significant variation between closely-spaced observations indicates the irregularity and complexity of such distributions. It is concluded that because of the inability to prescribe the spatial distribution of available surficial sediments (including size distributions) such simulations can only be expected to reproduce the essential statistical characteristics of SPM concentrations. The availability of extensive remote sensing or in situ data can help to circumvent this problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

CISNet is composed of intensive, long-term monitoring and re search sites around the U.S. marine and Great Lakes coasts. In this partnership, EPA and NOAA are funding research and monitoring programs at pilot sites that utilize ecological indicators and investigate the ecological effects of environmental stressors. NASA is funding research aimed at developing a remote sensing capability that will augment or enhance in situ research and monitoring programs selected by EPA and NOAA. CISNet has three objectives: 1) to develop a sound scientific basis for understanding ecological responses to anthropogenic stresses in coastal environments, including the interaction of exposure, environment/climate, and biological/ecological factors in the response, and the spatial and temporal nature of these interactions, 2) to demonstrate the value of developing data from selected sires intensively monitored to examine the relationships between changes in environmental stressors, including anthropogenic and natural stresses, and ecological response, and 3) to provide intensively monitored sites for development and evaluation of indicators of change in coastal systems.																	0167-6369					SEP	2000	64	1					379	390		10.1023/A:1006455505015								WOS:000089244600029

Here we apply a similar technique for ocean areas over the glint region. The glint, or oceanic specular reflection, has a high value of surface reflectance and thus, can work as well as or better than applications over land regions. The method is applied for glint regions measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) simulator, an imager flown on the NASA. ER-2 research aircraft and simulating the expected measurements from the MODIS instrument on board the Earth Observing System (EOS)-Terra satellite. The measurements are made for the Atlantic coast of the United States during the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX). The remote sensing technique is compared with measurements of water vapor column by the Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) Differential Infrared Absorption Lidar (DIAL) lidar system also on board the ER-2. Water vapor was derived with an error of +/-5 mm PW (precipitable water vapor). Most of the errors are associated with the limitations of an experiment that was not originally designed for this purpose. Much better performance is expected from the actual MODIS instrument.																	0094-8276					SEP 1	2000	27	17					2657	2660		10.1029/1999GL011156								WOS:000089254700018						
J	Walker, ND; Hammack, AB				Walker, ND; Hammack, AB			Impacts of winter storms on circulation and sediment transport: Atchafalaya-Vermilion Bay region, Louisiana, USA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study investigates the changes in circulation, sediment resuspension, sediment flux and salinity that accompany "winter storms" in the Atchafalaya Bay region, events that occur 20 to 30 times each year between October and April. NOAA-14 satellite reflectance imagery and time-series measurements of winds, water levels, current velocity and turbidity demonstrate that wind direction and speed are the major controlling factors for circulation, sediment transport and suspended sediment concentrations. East winds (occurring 62% of the time) induce westward flow of sediment-laden Atchafalaya river water along the coast. West winds reverse the direction of plume movement and increase the size of the plume, partly as a result of Ekman processes. The strong north winds, characteristic of winter storms, cause rapid flushing from the shallow bays (30-50% of volume) and water level changes in excess of 1 meter. Seaward of these bays, a large sediment plume (180 km alongshore, 75 km offshore) is produced by the wind-wave resuspension of bottom sediments and the wind-forced seaward transport of bay and inner shelf waters. Water and sediment flux is primarily southeastward, temporarily disrupting the westward flow of river water along the coast. In the Vermilion-Cote Blanche Bay system, northwest winds maximize sediment resuspension and the seaward flux of sediment-laden river and bay water. The storm-related sediment resuspension and transport reduces the rapidity of delta development and deposition in these bays and re-distributes sediment along the inner shelf.

Due to heavy nutrient load of the river Oder especially the large Oder Lagoon (680 km(2)) suffers from severe eutrophication. Heavy cyanobacteria blooms and high water turbidity are common during summer and a problem for further tourist development. Three applications of a flexible two-dimensional flow and transport model system covering extremely different spatial scales are presented to underline the value of this simple tool for research and coastal management: a) Water flow and transport simulations in the Oder Lagoon during the extreme Oder flood of August 1997 were used to explain the large scale suspended matter and algae (Mycrocystis) distribution, visible on satellite images. b) flow simulations were conducted to analyse an extreme small-scale sub-surface patchiness of Ceratium in a sheltered bay (0.15 km(2)). c) The model was applied to simulate flow in a littoral zone and inside reed stands. Algae patchiness is visible on very different spatial scales and hydrodynamics plays a major role for its formation. The model system with its modifications, like spatial wind inhomogeneity, spatially variable bottom friction and locally increased grid density allowed to tackle problems with different spatial scales and to achieve a closer linkage between hydro-physics and biology. It is a valuable tool to predict the transport of algae and the endangerment of beaches. In this regard remote sensing is an important supporting method.																	0031-5362					SEP	2000	102			1			65	75										WOS:000166145900009

The primary goal of the experiments was to determine the sea-bed properties through inversion of acoustic data. Using a towed source, the inversion method is tested at different source/receiver separations in an area with a range-dependent bottom. The sources transmitted over a broad band of frequencies (90-600 Hz) and the signals were measured on a vertical array of hydrophones, The acoustic data were continuously collected as the range between the source and receiving array varied from 0.5 to 6 km, An extensive seismic survey was conducted along the track providing supporting information about the Layered structure of the bottom as well as layer compressional sound speeds. The oceanic conditions were assessed using current meters, satellite remote sensing, wave height measurements, and casts for determining conductivity and temperature as a function of water depth. Geoacoustic inversion results taken at different source/receiver ranges show sea-bed properties consistent with the range-dependent features observed in the seismic survey data. These results indicate that shallow-water bottom properties may be estimated over large areas using a towed source fixed receiver configuration.																	0364-9059					JUL	2000	25	3					364	386		10.1109/48.855390								WOS:000088552500009						
J	Moorman, BJ; Michel, FA				Moorman, BJ; Michel, FA			The burial of ice in the proglacial environment on Bylot Island, Arctic Canada	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												In the proglacial environment on Bylot Island there are many occurrences of buried ice. Ground-penetrating radar and remote sensing techniques were combined with standard field observations to examine the processes and settings associated with the burial of surface ice, and the potential for preservation of buried ice. Of the different types of surface ice present (i.e. glacier, icing, permanent snow bank), glaciers were found to have the greatest potential for becoming buried, through sediment concentration at the surface during the melt-out of sediment-laden ice. A number of lateral and end moraines were found to have cores of glacial ice over 10 m thick. Deltaic sedimentation was also found to be effective at preserving buried glacial ice; however, the occurrence of this depositional setting is infrequent. The burial of icing and permanent snow banks was found not to occur to any great extent owing to their dynamic and generally erosional settings. Ground ice on Bylot Island is readily preserved owing to the cold ground temperatures. However, in a few locations recent fluvial activity had exposed massive ice bodies, resulting in the initiation of retrogressive thaw flows. Evidence of past thermokarst activity is widespread, but no evidence of current activity was discovered. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Global distributions of those Angstrom parameters are consistent with present knowledge on the distributions of desert-derived, biomass-burning, and anthropogenic pollutant aerosols obtained by groundbased and aircraft measurements. Especially, it is found that thin anthropogenic aerosols can be identified with large Angstrom exponent values around the east coast of North America, Europe, and eastern Asia.

There is a large range of the diffuse attenuation coefficient, from a minimum of 0.14 m(-1) for green light in the outer stations to 3.65 m(-1) for blue light at the most inshore station in the Clyde Estuary. The reason for this gradient of attenuation is, in parr, the presence of high concentrations of yellow substance at the inshore stations. Twenty-five samples of yellow substance analysed had absorption coefficients which decayed exponentially with wavelength: the mean decay constant being -0.018 nm(-1) The yellow substance is introduced in the freshwater runoff from the land: the evidence for this is the strong negative relationship between yellow substance and salinity. The presence of salinity (and hence yellow substance) stratification produces observable changes in the attenuation of light at the halocline. Attenuation by particulate material is of lesser importance overall but must be accounted for to produce an accurate model of light attenuation in the Clyde Sea. An r.m.s. (root mean square) difference of 0.08 m(-1) between observed and predicted attenuation coefficients is achieved using values of specific particulate absorption from the literature. A simple model of the ratio of reflectance coefficients in water whose optical properties are dominated by yellow substance is proposed. According to this the ratio of reflection coefficients in the red and one other colour should increase linearly with yellow substance concentration. The linear fit should be best if the other colour is chosen in the blue end of the spectrum. This theory is supported by the small data set presented here, and this implies that yellow substance and hence salinity, could be remotely sensed front space in these waters.

LASE measured high-resolution profiles of water vapor and aerosols in regions of urban haze plumes over the U.S. eastern seaboard. Real-time LASE aerosol measurements were used to guide the in situ aircraft to sample haze layers. In this paper the vertical and horizontal distributions of aerosol backscatter measured by LASE are presented along with the temporal evolution of the haze layers. The aerosol backscatter data also identify the presence of gradients in the aerosol plumes, the presence of low-altitude clouds, and optically thin cirrus. This information is useful for many of the radiometeric observations made during TARFOX and can help explain observational differences among ground, airborne, and satellite observations. An iterative procedure is discussed which was used to invert lidar data to retrieve aerosol scattering ratios, extinction, and total optical depths from the LASE measurements. The sensitivity of these retrievals to assumed parameters is discussed and the results of retrievals are also compared to the well-known Bernoulli method. LASE water vapor measurements were made across the entire troposphere using a three "line pair" method to cover the range of water vapor mixing ratio from <0.01 g/kg near the tropopause to similar to 20 g/kg near the surface in a single aircraft pass over the experiment region. These measurements also show two-dimensional distributions of large spatial gradients in water vapor in the lower and upper troposphere. These observations are useful in the calculation of IR radiation fields and relative humidity fields, since relative humidity has a strong influence on the growth of aerosols and their scattering properties. Water vapor profiles, aerosol scattering ratios, aerosol extinction coefficients and aerosol optical depths were derived using the methodology presented in this paper from LASE measurements during TARFOX. These measurements are compared with other in situ and remote measurements during TARFOX in the companion papers [Ferrare et al., this issue (a, b)].																	2169-897X					APR 27	2000	105	D8					9903	9916		10.1029/1999JD901198								WOS:000086658600011

Such comparisons are important to verify the consistency between various remote sensing measurements before employing them in any assessment of the impact of aerosols on the global radiation balance. Total scattering ratio and extinction profiles measured by the ground-based NASA Goddard Space Flight Center scanning Raman Iidar system, which operated from Wallops Island, Virginia (37.86 degrees N, 75.51 degrees W), are compared with those measured by the Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment (LASE) airborne lidar system aboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft. Bias and root-mean-square differences indicate that these measurements generally agreed within about 10%. Aerosol extinction profiles and estimates of AOT are derived from both lidar measurements using a value for the aerosol extinction/ backscattering ratio S-a = 60 sr for the aerosol extinction/backscattering ratio, which was determined from the Raman lidar measurements. The lidar measurements of AOT are found to be generally within 25% of the AOT measured by the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sun Photometer (AATS-6). However, during certain periods the lidar and Sun photometer measurements of AOT differed significantly, possibly because of variations in the aerosol physical characteristics (e.g., size, composition) which affect S-a. Estimates of PWV, derived from water vapor mixing ratio profiles measured by LASE, are within 5-10% of PWV derived from the airborne Sun photometer. Aerosol extinction profiles measured by both lidars show that aerosols were generally concentrated in the lowest 2-3 km.

On July 17 and 24 the LASE profiles of aerosol extinction and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) had a bias difference of 0.0055 km(-1) (10%) and a root-mean-square difference of 0.026 km(-1) (42%) when compared to corresponding profiles derived from the airborne in situ data when the nephelometer measurements are adjusted to ambient relative humidities. Larger differences for two other days were associated with much smaller aerosol optical thicknesses (July 20) and differences in the locations sampled by the two aircraft (July 26). LASE profiles of AOT are about 10% higher than those derived from the airborne Sun photometer, which in turn are about 10-15% higher than those derived from the airborne in situ measurements. These differences are generally within the error estimates of the various measurements. The LASE measurements of AOT generally agree with AOT derived from both the Along-Track and Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR 2) sensor flown on the European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2) and from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) airborne simulator (MAS) which flew with LASE on the NASA ER-2 aircraft. Effective particle sizes derived from the MAS data indicate that the LASE retrievals of AOT are valid for effective particle radii less than 0.4 mu m. Variations in the relative humidity derived from the LASE water vapor measurements on July 26 are found to be highly correlated with Variations in the effective particle size derived from the MAS.																	2169-897X					APR 27	2000	105	D8					9935	9947		10.1029/1999JD901201								WOS:000086658600013

A novel technique is used to estimate the aerosol complex index of refraction in distinct vertical layers from a combination of aerosol in situ size distribution and remote sensing measurements during the Tropospheric Aerosol Radiative Forcing Observational Experiment (TARFOX). In particular, aerosol backscatter measurements using the NASA Langley LASE (Lidar Atmospheric Sensing Experiment) instrument and in situ aerosol size distribution data are utilized to derive vertical profiles of the "effective" aerosol complex index of refraction at 815 nm (i.e., the refractive index that would provide the same backscatter signal in a forward calculation on the basis of the measured in situ particle size distributions for homogeneous, spherical aerosols). A sensitivity study shows that this method yields small errors in the retrieved aerosol refractive indices, provided the errors in the lidar-derived aerosol backscatter are less than 30% and random in nature. Absolute errors in the estimated aerosol refractive indices are generally less than 0.04 for the real part and can be as much as 0.042 for the imaginary part in the case of a 30% error in the lidar-derived aerosol backscatter. The measurements of aerosol optical depth from the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer (AATS-6) are successfully incorporated into the new technique and help constrain the retrieved aerosol refractive indices. An application of the technique to two TARFOX case studies yields the occurrence of vertical layers of distinct aerosol refractive indices. Values of the estimated complex aerosol refractive index range from 1.33 to 1.45 for the real part and 0.001 to 0.008 for the imaginary part.

King penguins at the Antarctic polar front, east of Kerguelen sector	COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE DES SCIENCES SERIE III-SCIENCES DE LA VIE-LIFE SCIENCES												The main objective of this work was to assess the potential of diving birds to monitor the hydrographic features near the Antarctic polar front. We compared the temperature/depth profiles recorded by instrumented King penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus at Kerguelen Islands (South Indian Ocean) with the oceanographic and remote sensing (satellite) data available for the same area during the same season. The birds were equipped with time/depth/temperature recorders or Argos transmitters. In addition, two birds were instrumented (of which one successfully) both with a time/depth/temperature recorder and an Argos transmitter. King penguins foraged as far as 400 km from the coast, in water masses with a vertical temperature structure characteristic of the region just south of the polar front. The temperature/depth profiles recorded throughout the dives (up to 270 m) revealed a pronounced thermocline. A three-dimensional distribution of water temperature was reconstructed. Comparison with previous hydrographic data shows a high correlation. Instrumented predators may therefore usefully and cheaply complement the database provided by conventional hydrographic surveys and remote sensing, especially in distant and rough areas such as the Southern Ocean.

J	Hester, MW; Mendelssohn, IA				Hester, MW; Mendelssohn, IA			Long-term recovery of a Louisiana brackish marsh plant community from oil-spill impact: vegetation response and mitigating effects of marsh surface elevation	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Oil spills can have significant, short-term, negative impacts on coastal marshes, but the long-term effects and eventual recovery are not well documented, particularly in brackish marshes. The goals of this investigation were to: (1) document the long-term recovery of a Louisiana brackish marsh plant community impacted by a 1985 oil spill; (2) separate the effect of the oil spill on marsh deterioration from ambient rates of marsh deterioration; and (3) assess the relative importance of residual oil in the sediment and decreased marsh surface elevation in the failure of certain areas to recover. A total of 68 permanent plots previously established in 1985 were re-surveyed for plant and soil recovery in the fall of 1989. Although substantial (and near total) vegetative recovery was evident by significant increases in live and total vegetative cover,many of the plots that were initially heavily impacted by oil still displayed elevated levels of total saturated hydrocarbons in the soil. August 1990 measurements of plant photosynthetic response and edaphic variables revealed no significant differences between control plots and plots heavily impacted by oil that displayed vegetative regrowth. Rates of wetland land loss in the oiled marsh during an 8-year period that bracketed the time of the spill were within the historical range measured for this site and similar to the land loss rates of adjacent reference marshes. Results from a manipulative field transplant experiment indicated that the long-term failure of certain small areas to revegetate was primarily due to a decrease of marsh surface elevation (increased flooding stress), not a residual oil effect.

Size distribution spectra measured over the ocean near Sagres (Portugal), on-board the Research Vessel Vodyanitsky and on-board the Avion de Recherche Atmospherique et Teledetection (ARAT) have been used to parameterize the aerosol vertical distribution. This parameterization, which is essential to the analysis of airborne lidar measurements, has been validated via closure experiments on extinction coefficient profiles and aerosol optical depth (AOD). During the studied event, AOD's retrieved from lidar measurements at 0.73 mu m range between 0.055 and 0.10. The parameterized aerosol vertical distribution has been used to shift AOD retrievals from 0.73 to 0.55 mu m to enable comparison with other remote sensing instruments. At the latter wavelength, AOD's retrieved from lidar measurements range between 0.08 and 0.14. An agreement better than 20% is obtained between AOD's derived from lidar and sunphotometer measurements made at the same time and place over the ocean near the coast. However, large differences are observed with the AOD estimated from Meteosat imagery in the same area. These differences are thought to be caused by large uncertainties associated with the Meteosat sensitivity for small AOD's or by the presence of thin scattered clouds. Lidar-derived particulate extinction profiles and scattering coefficient profiles measured by a nephelometer mounted on the ARAT, in a different part of the plume, were found in good agreement, which could be an indication that absorption by pollution aerosols is small and/or that soot is present in small amounts in the European pollution plume. Lidar measurements have also been used to differentiate the contribution of different aerosol layers to the total AOD. It is shown that the AOD in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) can contribute as much as 70% of the total AOD in some regions. At 0.73 mu m, the AOD in the continental plume was observed to diminish with the distance to the coastline from 0.04 to 0.03.

J	Shen, CY; Fusina, RA; Shay, LK				Shen, CY; Fusina, RA; Shay, LK			An assessment of local coastal dynamics observed with high-frequency radar	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												An assessment is made of the dominant processes governing the circulation in a 30 km by 40 km area off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where surface current velocity vectors have been obtained using shore-based high-frequency radars in the High Resolution Remote Sensing experiment in 1993. Although the currents in this region are constantly under the influence of winds and tides, frequent intrusion of energetic flows into the area, apparently mostly of Gulf Stream origin, is shown to have a strong influence on the current variability. Analysis of vorticity and divergence shows that the flow intruding into the area is strongly rotational with positive vorticity. This rotational motion is not in geostrophic balance with the surface pressure gradient, and an inertial oscillation is often excited as a result, with vorticity and divergence oscillating 90 degrees out of phase. On average the geostrophic imbalance generates a net surface flow divergence, which, in turn, induces negative vorticity that more than offsets the positive vorticity advected into the region. However, vertical viscous transfer of positive vorticity from subsurface to surface is shown to be required to complete the surface vorticity balance; the same energetic cyclonic shear flows that intrude into the area are suggested as the source of the subsurface vorticity as these flows of Gulf Stream origin are known to be subducted under buoyant shelf water.																	0148-0227					MAR 15	2000	105	C3					6517	6530		10.1029/1999JC900326								WOS:000085882400015						
J	Yi, DH; Minster, JB; Bentley, CR				Yi, DH; Minster, JB; Bentley, CR			The effect of ocean tidal loading on satellite altimetry over Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Vertical displacements of emerged land caused by oceanic tidal loading are of the order of several tens of millimetres in polar regions. They constitute a long wavelength signal, the amplitude of which is comparable to elevation changes that might be associated with climate-driven changes in ice-sheet volume. Using bilinear interpolation on a 1 degrees by 10 global grid, we examine the amplitudes and phases of vertical displacements caused at any given epoch by the eight most important ocean tide constituents of recent ocean tide models, extrapolated to high latitudes. This permits estimation of the oceanic tidal loading corrections to measurements made by a satellite altimeter along the satellite ground track. We have done so systematically over Antarctica, for a scenario flight of ICESAT, which carries the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), whose primary science goal is to monitor ice-sheet mass balance. Ocean loading tide corrections near the coast of Antarctica can reach several centimetres; overall they average about 10 mm.

While direct sensing techniques provide good data, they are limited in their temporal and spatial scope. There is a need for assessing the three-dimensional (3-D) time-varying refractivity structure. Recently published results (Gingras et al, [1]) indicate that matched-field processing methods hold promise for remotely sensing the refractive profile structure between an emitter and receive array, This paper is aimed at precisely quantifying the performance one can expect with matched-held processing methods for remote sensing of the refractivity structure using signal strength measurements from a single emitter to an array of radio receivers. The performance is determined,ia simulation and is evaluated as a function of: 1) the aperture of the receive array; 2) the refractivity profile model; and 3) the objective function used in the optimization. Refractivity profile estimation results are provided for a surface-based duct example, an elevated duct example, and a sequence of time-varying refractivity profiles. The refractivity profiles used were based on radiosonde measurements collected off the coast of southern California.

J	Bendix, J				Bendix, J			Precipitation dynamics in Ecuador and northern Peru during the 1991/92 El Nino: a remote sensing perspective	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The formation, dynamics and spatial distribution of heavy precipitation during the 1991/92 El Nino in Ecuador and northern Peru were examined by means of Meteosat-3 imagery, NOAA-AVHRR-based multichannel sea surface temperatures (MCSST) and additional meteorological observations. The Convective and Stratiform Technique (CST) was used for rain retrieval by means of Meteosat IR data and a cross-correlation approach was applied to Meteosat image sequences to derive cloud motion winds (CMW) which are essential for the analysis of circulation patterns leading to severe precipitation. From an analysis of 45 days with severe precipitation it is proven that three mechanisms were responsible for the formation of heavy rains. Each mechanism reveals a specific localised impact. (1) The most frequent mechanism (frequency of similar to 61%) represents an extended land-sea breeze system. During such weather conditions, predominantly locally confined precipitation patterns occurred. Areas affected by the sea wind front during the day were the coastal plains up to the 1000 m contour line on the western Andean slope. Local maxima in the frequency of cloudiness leading to precipitation could be found at isolated peaks of a lower coastal cordillera. At night the highest frequency of precipitation was found over the warm water surface of the Gulf of Guayaquil, mainly due to its coastal shape which significantly favours convergence of the nocturnal land breeze. (2) Convection, initiated in the coastal plain and on the western Andean slopes during the afternoon, was significantly intensified by an entrainment of remainders of cirrus shields form the Amazon basin. These cloud fragments spilled over the Andes with well developed trades in the mid/upper troposphere which blew in the opposite direction to the daily sea/up-slope breeze. The spill over points were characterized by areas of deep convection on the western Andean slopes and were frequently valley axes perpendicular to the mountain chain as well as the Andean depression in southern Ecuador. (3) During the main El Nino phase (March-April), heavy and persistent precipitation was extended over wide areas of the coastal plain showing neither a distinct diurnal cycle nor preferential areas. deep convection was frequently organized in mesoscale convective complexes (MCC) and was spatially correlated with MCSST > 27 degrees. The extensive instability of the troposphere during these weather conditions was marked by convective cloud streets and an intensification of the meridional Hadley circulation off the coast of southern Ecuador and Peru.																	0143-1161					FEB 15	2000	21	3					533	548		10.1080/014311600210731								WOS:000084754100008

The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea area and is connected with the North Atlantic Ocean through the North Sea. The applied method is based on the analysis of environmentally corrected radar altimeter (RA) data in conjunction with simulated water levels obtained by an operational circulation model of the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (Bundesamt fdr Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie, BSH) and tide gauge data. RA data of the First European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) have been analysed. The RA data were collected during the three-day repeat cycle from August 12 to December 9, 1991. An advantage of the analysis is the coverage and the geographical location of one and the same frequently repeated descending sub-satellite pass over the Bothnian Bay and the central Baltic Sea. Due to the assumed linear dynamics of this sea area the observation of sea level changes in the sense of a standing wave between the Bothnian Bay and the Baltic Proper is investigated. Amplitudes of water level changes up to 1 m have been recorded at tide gauge stations in the northern and southern parts of the Baltic Sea, respectively, during August and December 1991, Water level changes of less than 20 cm were calculated from the corrected altimeter data during the overflights of ERS-1. Tide gauge data and water level differences of tide gauge data measured at Kemi (Bothnian Bay), Finland, and Kolobrzeg at the Polish coast were used for frequency analyses. The analysed time series have been limited to five months due to the duration of the three-day repeat cycle of ERS-1. For frequency analysis the given sampling interval of 4 h is not appropriate, but a period of 12.4 h was clearly identified. This period corresponds to the fourth mode of theoretical estimated ones. The differences of water levels of the simulated data between Kemi and Kolobrzeg of about 25 cm agree fairly well with the results obtained by the RA data. Due to these results and the synoptic view of the along-track subsatellite passes it turned out that seiches can be observed by the ERS-1 radar altimeter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Videography, a cheap, simple and flexible airborne remote sensing technique, was used for derivation of relief. A hand-held Hi 8 camera and a small aeroplane were used to collect video data of a 1300 m x 320 m strip of beach and foredune area on Ameland (the Netherlands). Simultaneously, the ground control points (GCPs) were measured with laser electronic distance measurement (EDM) equipment. A series of overlapping frames was grabbed, contrast-stretched and corrected for interlacing effects. The resulting images were processed with software that has some photogrammetric capabilities, R-WEL's Desktop Mapping System (DMS). The images and the positions of the GCPs enabled computation of the camera orientation, and allowed for image rectification and stereo correlation. Stereo pairs form the basis for anaglyphs, which give a perception of height. In addition, the parallax in the stereo pairs allows a derivation of quantitative height information. Some of the derived height values are, however, incorrect. This was due to inaccuracies in the camera technology and the use of photogrammetric software that was not designed principally to process video imagery.

J	Singer, BC; Harley, RA				Singer, BC; Harley, RA			A fuel-based inventory of motor vehicle exhaust emissions in the Los Angeles area during summer 1997	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A fuel-based approach was used to estimate stabilized exhaust carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB). Fleet-average emission factors of 80 +/- 7 g l(-1) CO and 9.3 +/- 1.5 g l(-1) VOC were calculated from more than 60,000 infrared remote sensor measurements collected at 35 sites throughout the greater Los Angeles area during summer 1997. Fuel use by SoCAB cars and light/medium-duty trucks was estimated to be 5.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(7) I day(-1) based on statewide gasoline sales during summer 1997. Fuel-based estimates of 4700 +/- 500 metric tons day(-1) CO and 550 +/- 90 metric tons day(-1) VOC are higher than stabilized exhaust emissions estimates of California's MVEI 7G model by factors of 2.4 +/- 0.2 for CO and 3.5 +/- 0.6 for VOC. According to fuel-based inventory estimates, stabilized CO emissions in 1997 were lower by 20% than emissions during summer 1991. Fuel use increased by 8% during this period while the CO emission factor decreased by 26%. The relationship between income level and vehicle emissions was examined using census data reserved to the zip code level. On average. CO and VOC emission factors of vehicles registered in the lowest income areas were double those of vehicles registered in the highest income areas. Differences in vehicle emissions between neighborhoods were due in part to differences in the prevalence of older vehicles, but also resulted because vehicles of the same age had higher emissions in lower-income areas.

Knowledge of this has often been quite imprecise since measurements could only be made from diver observations or camera pictures at times when the water was clear. A self-contained, tripod-mounted rotating-beam sonar system has been developed, which allows bottom topography to be imaged on scales of a few square centimeters out to 4-m radius at regular intervals in time. Most importantly, this system produces images during high suspended sediment concentration transport events, when knowledge of the bottom structure and movement is most crucial. To accomplish this, a Simrad/Mesotech sonar head was adapted as the sensing element for remote use. A separate self-contained controller/recorder was constructed and housed in its own pressure case with sufficient battery and storage capacity for up to six months deployment with hourly imaging. The controller/recorder was based on the PC/104 family of components. It digitized the acoustic signal to 12 bits at 75 kHz and stored the 450-kbyte images on 2 Gbytes of hard disk. After recovery, the data were retrieved from the instrument via an ethernet link for analysis. Three deployments were made with the system on the east and west coasts of the United States, and three distinctly different types of bottom topography were observed. STRESS III on the northern California shelf in 90 m of water showed random, small amplitude features due to biologically formed structures in the bottom. The STRATAFORM experiment, farther north by the mouth of the Eel River in 50 m of water, showed 10-cm wavelength anorbital ripples. A deployment at the LEO-15 site off the New Jersey coast in 12 m of water showed large orbital ripples, which were well correlated with wave direction and wave particle excursions. The acoustic system was able to image these ripples as they moved and changed direction during storm events. This unique view of how the bottom feature evolution relates to the forcing will enable improvements to be made in modeling and sediment transport predictions.																	0739-0572					NOV	1999	16	11	2				1830	1841		10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016<1830:ASCSSS>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000083859600013						
J	Warnock, RE; Gieskes, WWC; van Laar, S				Warnock, RE; Gieskes, WWC; van Laar, S			Regional and seasonal differences in light absorption by yellow substance in the Southern Bight of the North Sea	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Absorption spectra (250-800 nm) of yellow substance were measured in 1993 and 1994 along five onshore-offshore transects in the Southern Eight of the North Sea in different seasons. All spectra had a common shape, so the amount of yellow substance could be established using one reference wavelength as a proxy variable. The exponential slope parameter at 380 nm (S) of the absorption spectra ranged from -0.016 to -0.023 per nm when regression was based upon the 250-650 nm wavelength range; values were 25% lower when fitting was performed over the more restricted waveband 360-540 nm, partly due to a minor shoulder at 260-275 nm in all spectra. The concentration of yellow substance, expressed as the absorption coefficient at 380 nm (a(380); m(-1)), varied over an order of magnitude, from low values down to 0.17 m(-1) in the English Channel, up to 1.00-1.25 m(-1) near the Rhine and Scheldt outflow, to maxima of up to 1.75 m(-1) in the neritic-estuarine waters at the entrance to the shallow Wadden Sea. This regional distribution pattern was in agreement with the known water-mass circulation and with the location of sources of yellow substance: highest concentrations close to the shore under the influence of freshwater inflow, lower values with increasing distance from the coast, where Atlantic Ocean water is the major water-mass component. No significant seasonal variation in yellow-substance concentration was found anywhere when a correction was applied for salinity. Extrapolation to zero salinity yielded an absorption coefficient at 380 nm of 5.38 m(-1) for the freshwater input at both the Texel and Walcheren transects, but of 3.29 m(-1) at the Noordwijk transect, reflecting differences in yellow-substance concentration between the Rhine, the Meuse, and Lake IJssel, as previously noted in fluorescence measurements. Yellow-substance concentration was not only correlated with salinity but also, albeit much less, with chlorophyll concentrations; the contribution of phytoplankton to the yellow-substance pool was marginal but significant. A relation appeared to exist between yellow-substance absorbance at 380 nm and yellow-substance fluorescence intensity; fluorescence measurements in the southern North Sea can be translated to absorption (more appropriate for ocean colour detection by remote sensing) by equating I mFl unit to an absorption coefficient at 380 nm of 0.056 m(-1), and using the exponential relation a(ys)(lambda) = a(ys)(lambda(ref)) exp(-S(lambda - lambda(ref))) for extrapolation to UV-Vis spectral absorption.

J	Mustard, JF; Carney, MA; Sen, A				Mustard, JF; Carney, MA; Sen, A			The use of satellite data to quantify thermal effluent impacts	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Thermal effluent from a large coal-fired electric generating facility located on Mt. Hope Bay in the Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, U.S.A.) has been implicated in a large decline in fish populations in this region. Detailed information on the spatial and temporal properties of this thermal input (approximately 5 million m(3) day(-1) of thermal effluent 7 degrees C above ambient) is, however, lacking. In this paper it is shown that the spatial extent and magnitude of the thermal impacts can be quantitatively determined by exploiting the strengths of remotely sensed data. Seasonal trends of surface temperature in the Narragansett Bay estuary were derived from a composite of 14 thermal infrared satellite images (Landsat TM Band 6) with a spatial resolution of 120 m. The derived temperatures were validated against independent measures of surface temperature for a number of sites within the bay, and it was shown that the satellite measures were within 1 degrees C of the in situ temperatures. Relationships among thermal properties and physical characteristics were identified through a comparison of the seasonal temperature patterns of 12 regions within the bay. As expected, depth was the primary factor in determining the magnitude of seasonal temperature variation in the estuary, while advective exchange with the coast ocean was the second most important factor. Although the behaviour of Mount Hope Bay was significantly correlated with the other upper estuarine regions, the bay did not experience autumn cooling, which is characteristic of upper estuarine waters. From late summer through to autumn, the average temperature difference between Mount Hope Bay and Upper Narragansett Bay was 0.8 degrees C, which can be attributed to warming from the thermal effluent of the Brayton Point Power Station in Mount Hope Bay. An unsupervised (statistical) classification of temperature as a function of season revealed the natural boundaries between areas with different seasonal temperature signals, and statistically identified Mount Hope Bay as a unique area in the upper estuary which had anomalously high temperatures throughout the year. Among the scenes included in the unsupervised analysis, Mount Hope Bay was on average 0.8 degrees C warmer than the rest of the upper estuary, and the total area affected is 36 km(2).

All the atmospheric radiative effects, including the SO2 plume emission/absorption, are computed by the MODTRAN 3.5 radiative transfer code. We apply the model to two MIVIS images acquired over Mount Etna, located on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, during the "Sicilia-94" remote sensing campaign on July 24 and 25, 1994. The June 25 image was acquired during the night; this is the first attempt to estimate the SO2 content in volcanic plume using nocturnal thermal infrared images. The total flux estimates range from 20.9 kg (s-1) (1810 t d(-1)) to 82.2 kg s(-1) (7100 t d(-1)) depending on the plume geometry used in the procedure. These results, except one case (82.2 kg s(-1)), are in agreement with the estimates derived from correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) measurements collected during the same period. We also evaluate the dependencies of the results on several parameters such as plume geometry, surface emissivity, water vapor content, and wind speed.

Landsat TM data were useful in the geomorphic interpretation of a desert, aeolian environment to distinguish the mineralogies found in the Wahiba area, and in extending the identification of sand mineralogy beyond the point-specific grid produced from field sampling. The Wahiba Sand Sea has been previously divided into upper (north and higher in elevation) and lower (south and lower in elevation) portions, based on dune morphology. Large-scale spatial distributions of mineral composition follow a similar pattern to that of the geomorphic regions within the dune field. Field and Landsat TM data suggests the upper Wahiba is comprised of well-mixed carbonate and quartz sand with some areas of significant mafic content. Surface sand in the eastern and western margins of the upper Wahiba originate from the lower Wahiba and from local wadis. Sand in the lower Wahiba was likely derived from southern sabkhas and the coastal area and is quartz-rich with isolated locations of carbonate-rich sand. We suggest that these carbonate-rich patches in the lower Wahiba were derived from reworked aeolianites (lithofied sand dunes) which underlie most of the sand sea, and not directly from the coast, as previously reported.

Southerly winds force an offshore surface Ekman flow over the inner continental shelf. Colder and nutrient-rich waters from below upwell toward the surface replacing offshore-homing surface waters. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite ERS-2 before and after upwelling-favorable mind episodes in early summer 1996 along the New Jersey coast are presented here. Lower backscatter conditions appearing in the SAR imagery after the onset of upwelling demonstrate the influence of the upwelling regime on the sea surface roughness. Satellite sea surface temperature (SST) observations and in-situ sea temperature vertical profiles confirm upwelling conditions, Three key mechanisms are suggested to explain the lower radar returns observed under upwelling conditions, an increase in the atmospheric marine boundary layer stability, an increase in the viscosity of surface waters, and the presence of biogenic surfactants in the upwelling region.

This system produces false color imagery similar to that of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bands 5,4,3. Imagery from this system was useful for differentiating among a variety of land-use types including plant species, soil surface conditions, and water. Computer analysis of the imagery showed that many of the ecological variables could be quantified. An accuracy assessment performed on the classified image showed an overall accuracy of 82.4%. The imagery was also useful for interpreting the coarser resolution TM. Ground radiometric reflectance measurements were made of various ecological parameters to assist in interpreting the imagery.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	1999	15	4					1145	1150										WOS:000083470300026

Synoptic measurements of optical data acquired from the airborne scanner were used to map chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in surface waters in the study area. This airborne hyperspectral scanner was found as an expedient monitoring tool for the relatively small geographic area of the current study, as it enabled to reveal the patchy distribution, and sharp concentration changes of the mapped water characteristics, The distribution of SPM, concentrations in Haifa Bay was mainly dictated by the polluted riverine inputs, with concentrations between 1 and 3 mg l(-1) at its seaward border and higher by more than 1 order of magnitude at the river estuaries. The chi-a concentrations mapped and measured in this sur,ey were unusually low (<2 mu g l(-1)) due to a long-period intermission of anthropogenic phosphate and nitrate input to the bay. SPM and chl-a spatial distributions along the lower rivers system exhibit variations which could be plausibly explained by the hydrological structure and geochemical impacts on the riverine water sources. The correlation between SPM and some particulate heavy metal concentrations was found as a useful tool for monitoring such environmental hazardous substances, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ground truth data were used to assess vegetative change occurring in the 20 years since the report of Judd et al, (1977) on the vegetation of South Padre Island. Estimates of total cover by ground truth and remote sensing techniques were similar (2.45% difference) on South Padre Island. Thus, airborne multispectral digital videography is an effective technique for assessing changes in total vegetative cover of Texas barrier islands. This technique will be an effective tool for documenting changes in total cover on barrier islands due to natural perturbations such as hurricanes and human disturbances including vehicular traffic. Imagery obtained at altitudes of 200 m or greater did not permit discrimination of dominant species in each of an island's topographic zones. However, acquisition of imagery at a time of the year when dominant species are in specific phenological stages, such as flowering, and at a lower altitude may facilitate their recognition. Comparison of data from a single trans-island transect in 1997 with data from three trans-island transects and 18 transects across the foreshore, backshore, and primary dunes in 1977 suggests that there has been a marked decrease in species richness of the backshore and primary dune zones of South Padre Island. There also was a change in dominant species in the backshore zone. These changes in species richness and dominance may be largely attributable to vehicular traffic in these zones.																	0038-4909					SEP	1999	44	3					261	271										WOS:000082891200003						
J	Nagendra, H; Gadgil, M				Nagendra, H; Gadgil, M			Biodiversity assessment at multiple scales: Linking remotely sensed data with field information	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												We examine the efficacy of a scheme of multiscale assessment of biodiversity linking remote sensing on larger spatial scales with localized field sampling. A classification of ecological entities from biosphere to individual organisms in the form of a nested hierarchy is employed, such that entities at any level are differentiated in terms of their composition/configuration involving entities at the next lower level. We employ the following hierarchy: biosphere (10(14) m(2)), ecoregions (10(11)-10(12) m(2)), ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)), ecotopes (10(3)-10(6) m(2)), and individual organisms (10(-4) 10(2) m(2)). Focusing on a case study of West Coast-Western Chats ecoregion (1.7 x 10(11) m(2)) from India, we demonstrate that remotely sensed data permit discrimination of 205 patches of 11 types of sufficiently distinctive ecomosaics (10(8)-10(10) m(2)) through unsupervised classification by using distribution parameters of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, with a pixel size of 3.24 x 10(6) m(2). At the ecomosaic scale, Indian Remote Sensing LISS-2 satellite data with a pixel size of 10(3) m(2) permit discrimination of approximate to 30 types of sufficiently distinctive ecotopes on the basis of supervised classification, Field investigations of angiosperm species distributions based on quadrats of 1-10(2) m(2) in one particular landscape of 27.5 x 106 m(2) show that the seven ecotope types distinguished in that locality are significantly different from each other in terms of plant species composition, This suggests that we can effectively link localized field investigations of biodiversity with remotely sensed information to permit extrapolations at progressively higher scales.

This framework should also be applicable to other coastal areas and for broader management applications. One of the components of this framework is the development and the dissemination of a spectral wave model capable of dealing with shallow watt's conditions and with the interaction between tide and waves. At the beginning of the project, it was opted to improve the capabilities of the WAM-Cycle 4 model, a model which is considered state of this art at least for deep and intermediate water depths. Three milestones were set: waves on shelf scale, waves on coastal scale and waves interacting with tides on coastal scale. Waves on shelf scale have been studied through an intercomparison exercise between different implementations at the different participating institutes. For wave modelling in coastal regions where usually shallow water conditions prevail and high spatial resolution is needed, considerable enhancements to the WAM-Cycle 4 model have: been made so that the model has become practically applicable. Waves interacting with tide forms the last part. This part of the study is still in progress and will be completed by the end of the 3-year PROMISE project. The wave influence on suspended sediment transport on a regional scale is discussed, notably the approximation of wave effects in the process description. The resuspension and deposition of sediments is represented by a pragmatic and efficient approach to include wave effects through the characteristic influences of wind variations, shielding effects and wave attenuation. Data are essential for wave modelling verification as for any other modelling verification. Both the use of data from the far field and the near field are discussed. An overview is given of the data sets that will he disseminated through the PROMISE project. These sets include data available from mainly national research campaigns supplemented by data from remote sensing and model data. These data sets are expected to provide useful information for the research community to test their models. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	White, K; El Asmar, HM				White, K; El Asmar, HM			Monitoring changing position of coastlines using Thematic Mapper imagery, an example from the Nile Delta	GEOMORPHOLOGY					Symposium on New Techniques in Geomorphology	JAN, 1998	UNIV SURREY, GUILDFORD, ENGLAND		UNIV SURREY			Coastline movement due to erosion and deposition is a major concern for coastal zone management. Very dynamic coastlines, such as sections of the Nile Delta coast, pose considerable hazards to human use and development, and rapid, replicable techniques are required to update coastline maps of these areas and monitor rates of movement. The synoptic capability of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery enables monitoring of large sections of coastline at relatively coarse (30 m) spatial resolution. By comparing positions of the Nile Delta coast in 1984, 1987 and 1990/1991, mapped using a region-growing image segmentation technique, areas of rapid change can be identified and targeted for more detailed monitoring in the field, or using higher resolution images. Rates of erosion and deposition can be estimated crudely, and areas where change appears to be accelerating can also be identified, Areas of severe erosion along the Nile Delta coast are found to be confined to the promontories of the present day mouths of the Nile at Rosetta and Damietta. Eroding shorelines are mostly flanked by accreting shorelines, showing that some of the eroded material is redistributed along the coast. The technique outlined here has potential to augment conventional field-based surveying for monitoring shoreline changes over short timescales. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Young, IR				Young, IR			Seasonal variability of the global ocean wind and wave climate	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												A data set spanning a period of 10 years and obtained from a combination of satellite remote sensing and model predictions is used to construct a global climatology of ocean wind and wave conditions. Results are presented for: significant wave height, peak and mean wave period and wave direction as well as wind speed and direction. The results are presented in terms of mean monthly statistics. The processed data set provides global resolution of 2 degrees. The climatology clearly shows the zonal variation in both wind speed and wave height, with extreme conditions occurring at high latitudes. The important role played by the intense wave generation systems of the Southern Ocean is clear. Swell generated from storms in the Southern Ocean penetrates throughout the Indian, South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. During the Southern Hemisphere winter, this swell even penetrates into the North Pacific. The results confirm visual observations that the Southern Ocean is consistently the roughest ocean on earth. It is shown, however, that this is mainly caused by consistent high wind speeds, rather than the extended westerly fetch which exists. The west coasts of most continents have noticeably rougher wave climates than their respective east coasts, as a result of the longer generation fetches which exist on the west coasts.

Plant species studied included beach croton (Croton punctatus), beach morningglory (Ipomoea imperati), camphorweed (Heterotheca subaxillaris), partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata), railroad vine (Ipomoea pes-capre), sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum), seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and seaoats (Uniola paniculata). Reflectance measurements were made at the visible green (0.52-0.60 mu m), visible red (0.63-0.69 mu m), and near-infrared (0.76-0.90 mu m) wavelengths. Reflectance values differed significantly (p = 0.05) among the plant species and soil surfaces at all three wavelengths and on all dates. Differences in reflectance among the plant species were attributed to variable foliage coloration, phenology, and vegetative density. Spectral differences between soil surfaces were attributed to their contrasting surface conditions (wet, dry). Color-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs obtained of study sites on three dates showed that many plant species could be differentiated. More plant species could be distinguished on the September photographs than on the other dates. Spectral measurements of several species were related to their image tonal responses on the CIR aerial photography. However, growth form, geometric shape, and textural image response of species were also important in their discrimination on aerial photos.																	0749-0208					SUM	1999	15	3					789	795										WOS:000081365000017

Determination of calibration constants for OCTS-received radiances and development of an efficient look-up table method for synthesizing the radiances are key issues for development of the present two-channel algorithm with use of channel 6 and 8 radiances of OCTS. This algorithm has been applied to Level-1B OCTS GAC data sets for producing three month (April, May, and June 1997) global distributions of Angstrom parameters. Geographical and seasonal distribution patterns of Angstrom parameters suggest that anthropogenic sulfate aerosols in mid-latitudes and biomass burning aerosols in the subtropical region are characterized by small particles having large Angstrom exponents, whereas mineral dust particles from subtropical arid regions are characterized by large particles having small Angstrom exponents. There was a fairly good agreement between satellite-retrieved values of Angstrom parameters and values obtained by sky radiometers located on coasts.

These measurements have usually been made using ground-based radar systems or aircraft in situ probes. Difficulties encountered in practice using these systems include accounting for the air motion at points remote from the radar systems and small sample volumes measured using the aircraft probes. An airborne W-band radar system provides a measurement from a much larger sample volume, close to the aircraft, with a correction for air motion possible using the data from the aircraft inertial navigation system. The Coastal Stratus Experiment conducted off the coast of Oregon in late 1995 provided W-band radar and microphysical probe data sampled from much of the same region of a marine stratus cloud. The unique combination of cloud probes and W-band radar on board the University of Wyoming King Air allowed the radar sampling to be only 60 m away from the probe sampling region. Doppler spectrum data from the W-band radar were used to produce estimates of the drop size spectrum density N(D). These estimates were compared to measurements of N(D) taken by the Particle Measuring Systems forward scattering spectrometer, 1D, and 2DC probes. This comparison suggests that a vertically pointing airborne W-band radar is a viable remote sensing tool for measuring N(D) in clouds and precipitation. This radar provides information on drop size distribution variation on a much smaller horizontal scale than the probes as a result of the much higher sample rate and larger measurement sample volume.																	0739-0572					MAY	1999	16	5					504	517		10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016<0504:CISAWB>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000080224700002

A reflectance model for remote sensing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The spatial and temporal distribution of Trichodesmium in the world's oceans is highly variable and can potentially be assessed using satellite imagery. Distinguishing these organisms from other phytoplankton in the upper ocean using remotely sensed information, however, requires an optical model that uniquely characterizes Trichodesmium. Here, we parameterize a standard remote-sensing reflectance model using measured values of Trichodesmium's inherent optical properties, namely the spectral dependence of the chlorophyll-specific optical absorption cross-sections and the spectral dependence of the chlorophyll-specific backscatter cross-sections. Values for the chlorophyll-specific absorption cross-sections are described in the previous paper. We calculated the spectral chlorophyll-specific backscattering cross-section (b(b)*) from measurements of the chlorophyll-specific volume-scattering function and the spectral backscatter coefficients. b(b)* was 0.0027 m(2) (mg chlorophyll a [Chl a])(-1) at 436 nm and 0.002 m(2) (mg Chi a)(-1) at 546 nm; these cross-sections are approximately one order of magnitude higher than those for "typical" phytoplankton. The optical model revealed that the combination of high backscatter, absorption, and fluorescence could be used to distinguish moderate to high concentrations (>1 mg Chl m(-3)) of Trichodesmium from other phytoplankton. The model also predicted that surface scum blooms of Trichodesmium would have high reflectance in the near infrared. The high reflectance feature of surface Trichodesmium blooms was used in conjunction with sea truth and data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) to map a 300,000-km(2) Trichodesmium bloom off the Somali Coast in May 1995. The nitrogen fixed by this bloom was estimated to be 9.4 x 10(8) gN d(-1). These results demonstrate the potential of using remote-sensing techniques in the estimation of nitrogen fixation and the contribution of nitrogen fixation to global biogeochemical processes.

The relationship between the erosion, accretion and gross areas (defined as the sum of erosion and accretion areas ignoring the negative sign of erosion) has also been investigated as revealed by satellite images and hydrographic profiles. Three zones were identified: (1) the western zone is marked by shoreline accretion; (2) the central zone which has mixed erosion and accretion; and (3) the eastern zone which is characterized by slight erosion with minor and localized accretion areas. Comparisons among variation of erosion, accretion and gross areas were carried out for the three time periods. Results indicate similarity of trends of erosion, accretion and gross areas calculated from images and ground-based profiles.																	0143-1161					APR 15	1999	20	6					1087	1106		10.1080/014311699212867								WOS:000080119700004						
J	Tiren, SA; Askling, P; Wanstedt, S				Tiren, SA; Askling, P; Wanstedt, S			Geologic site characterization for deep nuclear waste disposal in fractured rock based on 3D data visualization	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												Three-dimensional (3D) visualization of data is an essential step in the development of descriptive hydrologic and rock-mechanical models of fractured rock systems. Data includes geological properties, rock mechanical properties and hydraulic responses. The 3D visualization approach is applied to characterizing a hypothetical site for a high-level nuclear waste repository located at 500 m depth in granitoids of the trans-Scandinavian igneous belt (1.6-1.8 Ga old). The study is based on site-specific data at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) on the southeastern coast of Sweden. The data are extensive and spatially complex and are based on surface information, as well as a large number of boreholes penetrating up to 1000 m. At this site, fractures and fracture zones control both groundwater flow and mechanical stability. Structures are found within a 2x2x1 km deep model block representing the site. 3D locations of fractures and fracture zones are hypothesized based on surface and subsurface geological and geophysical information, including borehole radar. This results in a 3D geological model structure of the site. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Through satellite remote sensing this study investigates the distribution of these plants along a southern section of the Kenyan coast. The visible bands (red, green and blue) and the near infra-red band of a Landsat Thematic Mapper image acquired in 1992 were combined in order to detect seagrasses and algae in 10 sectors along the section of the coast. Ground truthing was done at three locations along the same section. Results indicate that two distinct zones of vegetation can be recognised, and ground truthing reveals their identity is rocky substrate with mostly algae and seagrasses, respectively. The extent of the vegetation in the two zones has been quantified in square kilometres for the 10 sectors. However, care is needed in the interpretation of the satellite images when dealing with artefacts such as clouds. The zonation of the algal vegetation is discussed for one of the study sites.

J	Higurashi, A; Nakajima, T				Higurashi, A; Nakajima, T			Development of a two-channel aerosol retrieval algorithm on a global scale using NOAA AVHRR	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												This study proposes a two-channel satellite remote sensing algorithm for retrieving the aerosol optical thickness and the Angstrom exponent, which is an index for the aerosol size distribution. An efficient lookup table method is adopted in this algorithm to generate spectral radiances in channels 1 and 2 of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over ocean areas. Ten-day composite maps of the aerosol optical thickness and the Angstrom exponent have been obtained from AVHRR global area coverage data in January and July of 1988. Aerosol optical thickness maps show that the major aerosol sources are located off the west coast of northern and southern Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The most important contributor is soil-derived particles from the Sahara Desert that cross the Atlantic Ocean. The authors' optical thickness values tend to be larger than values given by the NOAA operational algorithm. A 10-day composite map of Angstrom exponent showing man-made air polluted regions, such as the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the east coasts of North America and China, has large values, suggesting that small particles are dominant in these regions.

Case study of 17 April 1994. Part I: Observations	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												During the intensive European Cloud and Radiation Experiment 1994 (EUCREX'94) conducted off the coast of Brittany (France) over the Atlantic Ocean during April 1994, natural cirrus have been analyzed from in situ and remote sensing measurements. The authors have particularly studied the case of 17 April 1994. For this day a cirrus bank is described by a complete dataset, that is, classic airborne thermodynamical measurements, microphysical (forward scattering spectrometer probe) and OAP-2D2-C (optical array probe-cloud) probes manufactured by Particle Measuring System, and radiative (Barnes Precision Radiation Thermometer, Eppley pyranometers, and upward- and downward-looking pyrgeometers) measurements above and below the cloud. More specific airborne instruments were used such as upward backscatter lidar with polarization capabilities (LEAN-DRE) on board the Avion de Recherches Atmosperiques et Teledetection and the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) radiometer on board the Falcon for measurement of bidirectional and polarized reflectances. The scene was also documented by NOAA-12/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data. However, the nonsphericity of cirrus ice crystals is clearly demonstrated by the lidar backscattering depolarization ratio measurements (Delta(p) = 24%) acid by the absence of any rainbow in POLDER bidirectional reflectances. A specular reflection of the solar light observed on POLDER images indicates the presence of horizontally oriented ice particles in the cloud. All these optical properties will be studied in a companion paper (Part II) and compared with optical properties derived from microphysical models in order to evaluate the radiative impact of natural cirrus clouds.																	0027-0644					APR	1999	127	4					486	503		10.1175/1520-0493(1999)127<0486:RSOCRP>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000079571400004						
J	Fuelberg, HE; Newell, RE; Longmore, SP; Zhu, Y; Westberg, DJ; Browell, EV; Blake, DR; Gregory, GL; Sachse, GW				Fuelberg, HE; Newell, RE; Longmore, SP; Zhu, Y; Westberg, DJ; Browell, EV; Blake, DR; Gregory, GL; Sachse, GW			A meteorological overview of the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) Tropics period	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												NASA's Pacific Exploratory Mission-Tropics (PEM-T) experiment investigated the atmospheric chemistry of a large portion of the tropical and subtropical Pacific Basin during August to October 1996. This paper summarizes meteorological conditions over the PEM-T domain. Mean flow patterns during PEM-T are described. Important circulation systems near the surface include subtropical anticyclones, the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and middle latitude transient cyclones. The SPCZ and ITCZ are areas of widespread ascent and deep convection however, there is relatively little lightning in these oceanic regions. A large area of subsidence Is associated with the subtropical anticyclone centered near Easter Island. PEM-T occurred during a period of near normal sea surface temperatures. When compared to an 11 year climatology (1986-1996), relatively minor circulation anomalies are observed during PEM-T. Some of these circulation anomalies are consistent with much stronger anomalies observed during previous La Nina events. In general, however, the 1996 PEM-T period appears to be climatologically representative. Meteorological conditions for specific flights from each major operations area are summarized. The vertical distribution of ozone along selected DC-8 flights is described using the DIAL remote sensing system. These ozone distributions are related to thermodynamic soundings obtained during aircraft maneuvers and to backward trajectories that arrived at locations along the flight tracks. Most locations in the deep tropics are found to have relatively small values of tropospheric ozone. Backward trajectories calculated from global gridded analyses show that much of this air originates from the east and has not passed over land within 10 days. The deep convection associated with the ITCZ and SPCZ also influences the atmospheric chemistry of these regions. Flights over portions of the subtropics and middle latitudes document layers of greatly enhanced tropospheric ozone, sometimes exceeding 80 ppbv, In situ carbon monoxide in these layers often exceeds 90 ppbv. These regions are located near, and especially south of Tahiti, Easter Island, and Fiji. The layers of enhanced ozone usually correspond to layers of dry air, associated with widespread subsiding air. The backward trajectories show that air parcels arriving in these regions originate from the west, passing over Australia and even extending back to southern Africa. These are regions of biomass burning. The in situ chemical measurements support the trajectory-derived origins of these ozone plumes. Thus the enhanced tropospheric ozone over the central Pacific Basin may be due to biomass burning many thousands of kilometers away. Middle-latitude portions of the PEM-T area are influenced by transient cyclones, and the DC-8 traversed tropopause folds during several flights. The flight area just west of Ecuador experiences outflow from South America. Thus the biomass burning that is prevalent over portions of Brazil influences this area.

J	Wang, YP; Zhang, RS; Gao, S				Wang, YP; Zhang, RS; Gao, S			Velocity variations in salt marsh creeks, Jiangsu, China	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Velocity variations in a tidal cycle were measured in four salt marsh creeks on the Jiangsu coast, eastern China. Results of regressional analysis show that a marked linear relationship is present between the tidal current velocity and the rate of water level changes. Further, two or three significant velocity surges exist in a tidal cycle. A theoretical analysis indicates that one of the regressional coefficients of the linear equations represents the effect of a component of progressive tidal waves (the tidal waves over the study area are not purely standing waves) and the other coefficient is affected by the geomorphology (i.e. bed slope) of the creeks and the marsh surface. The observed tidal current velocity surges can be related to a rapid water level change las observed during the initial stage of the flood within a creek) or the combined effects of water level changes and bed morphology las observed at the end of the flood or during the ebb). Towards the end of the ebb, the surges may be influenced also by the ground water which flows from the marsh surface into the creeks. The established linear relationships may be utilised to develop new techniques to calculate current velocities in the creeks using remote sensing images.

Mapping, surveying, and monitoring of the large expanses in remote areas are facilitated by remote-sensing technology. The best source for topographic mapping is satellite altimetry. It is often argued that satellite radar altimeter data over ice cannot be used to map ice surfaces with a slope exceeding 0.65 degrees. In the work presented in this paper, we extend the limits of altimeter data evaluation using (a) geostatistical methods, and (b) an atlas approach to mapping all of Antarctica north of 72.1 degrees S at 3-km resolution. Ordinary Kriging is applied to altimeter data from the GEOSAT Geodetic Mission, selected for its denser coverage as compared to the Exact Repeat Mission. The resultant maps yield a wealth of new information, in particular along the margin of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet including location and topography of drainage systems of small glaciers and location of some of the ice shelves. The atlas sheets Riiser-Larsen Peninsula, Prince Olav Coast, Mawson Coast West (Kemp Coast), Lambert Glacier, Ingrid Christensen Coast, Pennell Coast, Napier Mountains, Knox Coast, Sabrina Coast, and Antarctic Peninsula (Graham Land) are presented and analyzed. Repeated mapping facilitates the monitoring of changes in surface elevation may indicate dynamically and climatically induced mass changes of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				JAN 20	1999	20	2					241	258		10.1080/014311699213424								WOS:000078661900003						
J	Yin, KD; Harrison, PJ; Chen, J; Huang, W; Qian, PY				Yin, KD; Harrison, PJ; Chen, J; Huang, W; Qian, PY			Red tides during spring 1998 in Hong Kong: is El Nino responsible?	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The magnitude of El Nino in 1997-98 was one of the strongest of the century. A series of red tides occurred in Hong Kong territorial waters between mid-March and mid-April 1998, resulting in the loss of HK$250 (US$32) million in fish kill damage. The causative species was Gyrodinium auteolum. We used a time series of satellite images to track the development of the harmful algal bloom and relate its movement to physical oceanographic conditions. Prior to the red tide event in Hong Kong, harmful algal blooms had occurred earlier (November 1997-February 1998) along the south China coast to the east of Hong Kong, although the species were different. The progression of harmful algal blooms from northeast to southwest coincided with the southwesterly movement of the south China Coastal Current as indicated by the satellite images of SST (sea surface temperature) from the satellite AVHRR. Remote sensing images of chlorophyll a (chl a) from SeaWiFS (sea-viewing wide field of view sensor) confirmed high near-shore chi a for the same region. The entire event coincided with the dramatic change in the oceanographic conditions of the northern portion of the South China Sea between 1997 and 1998 for the period of March to mid-April. as revealed in the weekly composite SST. The SST images showed a warm tongue pointing north to the south China coast in 1998 versus a cold tongue pointing south in 1997 in the middle of the South China Sea. The differences are believed to be due to El Nino and responsible for setting up the physical oceanographic conditions which were favorable for the formation of harmful algal blooms along the south China coast. The warm tongue in SST suggested that the warm water from the South China Sea might have been piling up towards the south China coast. On the other hand, downwelling of the south China Coastal Current along the coast due to the Northeast Monsoon during March might have been moving against the South China Sea warm water at the bottom. As a result, the coastal waters of the south China coast including Hong Kong became trapped along the coast. Given local eutrophied conditions of the China coast, the outbreak of harmful algal blooms occurred over a coast-wide scale (similar to 400 km) in winter 1997 and spring 1998. It appears that the use of satellite SST images is helpful in detecting large-scale changes in oceanographic conditions and relating the changes to possible outbreak of harmful algal blooms.

It will be produced globally at single-pixel resolution; the algorithm uses as many as 14 of the MODIS 36 spectral bands to maximize reliable cloud detection and to mitigate past difficulties experienced by sensors with coarser spatial resolution or fewer spectral bands. The MODIS cloud mask is ancillary input to MODIS land, ocean, and atmosphere science algorithms to suggest processing options. The MODIS cloud mask algorithm will operate in near real time in a limited computer processing and storage facility with simple easy-to-follow algorithm paths. The MODIS cloud mask algorithm identifies several conceptual domains according to surface type and solar illumination, including land, water, snow/ice, desert, and coast for both day and night. Once a pixel has been assigned to a particular domain (defining an algorithm path), a series of threshold tests attempts to detect the presence of clouds in the instrument field of view. Each cloud detection test returns a confidence level that the pixel is clear ranging in value from 1 (high) to zero (low). There are several types of tests, where detection of different cloud conditions relies on different tests. Tests capable of detecting similar cloud conditions are grouped together. While these groups are arranged so that independence between them is maximized, few, if any, spectral tests are completely independent. The minimum confidence from all tests within a group is taken to be representative of that group. These confidences indicate absence of particular cloud types. The product of all the group confidences is used to determine the confidence of finding clear-sky conditions. This paper outlines the MODIS cloud masking algorithm. While no present sensor has all of the spectral bands necessary for testing the complete MODIS cloud mask, initial validation of some of the individual cloud tests is presented using existing remote sensing data sets.

J	Shao, GF; Young, DR; Porter, JH; Hayden, BP				Shao, GF; Young, DR; Porter, JH; Hayden, BP			An integration of remote sensing and GIS to examine the responses of shrub thicket distributions to shoreline changes on Virginia Barrier Islands	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The high-water-shoreline positions in 1852, 1871, 1910, 1919, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1980, and 1990 for Hog Island, a barrier island located at the eastern shore of Virginia, were determined with the NOS T-sheets and aerial photographs. Shrub thicket distributions for northern Hog Island were extracted from black/white and infrared: color aerial photographs for the years of 1949, 1962, 1974, and 1989. The overlay operations between shrub age and land age data layers indicated that shrub coverage on Hog Island was closely related with shoreline changes. By examining 138-year shoreline changes on 50-m-interval transects of Hog Island, it was found that the sine function could describe shoreline change patterns better than earlier used simple models. The overlay between old NOS T-sheets and 1993 TM satellite image suggested that there would be at least three types of shoreline changes for different barrier islands. All these three types of shoreline change patterns could be interpreted with the sine function model. The potential distribution of shrub thickets on Hog Island was simulated based on the shoreline change model. The shrub line and shoreline positions were closely related with each other, but there were time lags between shrub thicket expansion and shoreline accretion.																	0749-0208					WIN	1998	14	1					299	307										WOS:000071622500024

The general objetives of our study were: (1) characterize the taxonomic composition and community structure, as a function of categories or trophic revels in subtidal and intertidal habitats; (2) characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of the diversity and abundance of species in the communities studied, relating these to variations in productivity and sea surface temperature (obtained by remote sensing); and (3) evaluate the effects of upwelling on community attributes in relation to similar comparisons between areas with and without upwelling. Our results show that the frequency of upwelling was not a determining factor in the diversity of the rocky littoral communities which were studied. Although the species richness of the subtidal benthos and ichthyofauna is greater in Caleta Constitucion (permanent upwelling) than in Carrizal Bajo (seasonal upwelling), these values were lowest for San Lorenzo (permanent upwelling). In contrast, the species richness of intertidal habitats did not show evident differences among the communities studied. There was no relationship evident between the diversity of primary producer and benthic herbivores with the Frequency of coastal enrichment. However, patterns of abundance and diversity of some producers groups (eg. Chlorophytes) showed that the importance of coastal upwelling cannot be discarded in specific cases, although the changes may not be observed at the community level. An analysis of the relationship between the general trophic structure of benthic intertidal and subtidal communities did not show major differences in trophic linkage at the carnivore level. However, although trophic linkages between herbivores are similar between localities, there were significant differences between habitats. In contrast, trophic linkages between assemblages of fishes showed significant differences in structure and complexity between localities with and without permanent upwelling. Trophic relationships documented for subtidal habitats constitute the first contribution to the knowledge of the trophic structure in these habitats of northern Chile.																	0716-078X					DEC	1998	71	4					479	499										WOS:000078276100005

Here the LATEX winds are compared with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) scatterometer winds for the same period and region. Comparisons show no significant bias between LATEX and ERS-1 wind speeds or directions. LATEX and ERS-1 wind fields nearly coincide except during extreme meteorological events when ERS-1 fields may show noncoherent patterns over distances for which coherence is expected; for those situations, LATEX winds appear more realistic. Although there is no significant bias between wind speeds, the direction bias is more than 10 degrees between the LATEX and NCEP winds. The largest differences between LATEX and NCEP winds occurred near the coast. In summer, the NCEP and LATEX winds showed larger differences and smaller variance; for winter the reverse was true.

Three models were used for interpolating the in situ data: (1) a distance-weighted interpolation algorithm in which only the in situ data are taken into account; (2) an algorithm in which the ratios between the measured SPM concentrations and reflectances are interpolated, and the distribution of SPM is calculated from the field of interpolated ratios and the synoptic reflectance image; and (3) a distance-weighted algorithm similar to model-1, but with an additional weight factor that is based on local differences in reflectance. The models were tested for periods of 1 and 3 weeks in September 1990 and January 1991, and for the merged set consisting of all in situ data measured in September and January, respectively, between 1973 and 1993. Model-2 and -3 gave largely similar results and had a performance superior to model-1, particularly because they showed more detailed structures in the spatial distributions. Validations and cross-validations showed that the absolute concentrations of SPM predicted by the models were too low at high in situ concentrations and too high at low in situ concentrations. This shortcoming was due to the relatively high degree of smoothing that we applied in the models to account for the large variance of the in situ data. Semivariograms and correlograms indicated that the in situ data had substantial variability and were poorly correlated even at short distances. Only for the 20-year-merged data set did some correlation (< 60%) exist for stations < 50 km from each other. Monthly distributions of SPM were calculated with model-3 and the 20-year data set. The distributions confirm the main patterns previously found by others, such as the turbidity plume crossing the North Sea from southeast England towards the depository in the Skagerrak and the Norwegian Channel. The distributions indicate that materials from this plume may be deposited in the central North Sea in spring and summer and eroded again in autumn and winter. Areas with maximum SPM concentrations were identified off the Belgian coast and north of the Wadden Sea, particularly in winter, from which particles are entrained into the main current in a narrow strip along the continental coast to the German Eight. The results suggest that the two main fluxes of SPM in the North Sea, off England and along the continental coast, remain largely separated until they both end in the Skagerrak.

J	Lehner, S; Horstmann, J; Koch, W; Rosenthal, W				Lehner, S; Horstmann, J; Koch, W; Rosenthal, W			Mesoscale wind measurements using recalibrated ERS SAR images	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The precision images (PRI) of the synthetic aperture radars (SAR) on board the European Remote Sensing Satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 are used to derive mesoscale wind fields over the ocean. For calculation of the wind speed the C-band model (CMOD4) is used, which was originally developed by Stoffelen and Anderson [1993] for the European Space Agency (ESA) to derive wind fields from measurements of the wind scatterometer (SCAT). In the case of the ERS-1/2 SAR the CMOD4 is used to compute the wind speed from the normalized radar backscatter cross section (NRCS) and the incidence angle of the radar beam, both computed from the SAR.PRI data. The third input variable is the wind direction, which is estimated from the wind streaks in the images or from ground truth measurements. The SAR data are affected by a power loss, caused by saturation of the analog to digital converter (ADC) of the SAR. Therefore the images have to be recalibrated. Errors in the derived wind speed are mainly due to ADC saturation and uncertainties of the input wind direction. These errors are estimated for various wind conditions. Mesoscale wind fields computed from ERS-1/2 SAR.PRI images taken between the Shetland Islands and the west coast of Norway are compared to ground truth measurements and modeled wind fields from the German weather service (DWD). Wind fields of the nonhydrostatic mesoscale model Geesthacht simulation model of the atmosphere (GESIMA) are compared to the derived wind field of the ERS-1 SAR.PRI image at the island Rugen in the Baltic Sea.

J	Korsbakken, E; Johannessen, JA; Johannessen, OM				Korsbakken, E; Johannessen, JA; Johannessen, OM			Coastal wind field retrievals from ERS synthetic aperture radar images	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A unique series of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) 1 and 2 C band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images was obtained off the southern coast of Norway during the Coast Watch'95 experiment in September 1995. In this paper we carry out a systematic analysis of the mesoscale coastal wind field conditions expressed in the SAR images. Four different categories of phenomena including windrows, fetch-limited seas, wind fronts, and oceanographic fronts are examined and discussed. The quantitative retrievals of the wind field are based on examination of both the SAR image backscatter characteristics and the spectral properties. Results are compared and validated against coincident ship and buoy data, providing complementary and independent observations of the oceanographic and meteorological conditions.

In particular, sea surface roughness patterns generated by katabatic winds blowing from 1800 m high. mountains through a broad valley at the western coast of Calabria (southern Italy) into the Gulf of Gioia is investigated. The ERS-1 SAR images show that their areal extent and shape vary strongly, depending on the meteorological conditions. The roughness pattern sometimes has the form of a mushroom, an elongated tongue, a broad blob, or a narrow truncated band. For one event (September 8, 1992) we have simulated the wind field at the sea surface by using a nonhydrostatic mesoscale atmospheric model and then compared it with the wind field derived from the ERS-1 SAR image by using the C band wind scatterometer model CMOD4. The comparison shows that the atmospheric model reproduces quite well the mushroom-like form of the wind field pattern, while the wind speed is obtained somewhat lower than the one inferred from the SAR image. This study demonstrates that SAR images acquired over coastal waters are well suited to study local wind fields in coastal areas and to test numerical models that describe local wind fields which extend from the coast onto the sea.

J	Li, Y; Huang, W; Fang, M				Li, Y; Huang, W; Fang, M			An algorithm for the retrieval of suspended sediment in coastal waters of China from AVHRR data	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												An algorithm using an analytical model based on the difference of the NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) Channel 1 (580680nm) and Channel 2 (72-1100 nm) reflectance data is developed for the retrieval of suspended sediment in coastal and shelf waters. The model assumes that the suspended sediment-concentration, S, is a function of the difference of the water leaving reflectance of Channels 1 and 2, R-d The formula is governed by the optical parameters of water and suspended sediment, including volume scattering and absorption coefficients of the two channels. The analytical model yielded a best fit curve when the water leaving reflectance of the two channels were plotted against each other for Case 2 water, where the suspended sediment concentration ranged from 5 to over 100 g m(-3) A standard curve of S against R-d was obtained. Using Tassan's (1994) recommendations for the contribution of water and suspended sediment to the in-water absorption and backscattering coefficients in his three-component color model, the suspended sediment concentration corresponding to the maximum point of R-d was about 60 g m(-3), and was independent of the atmospheric optical properties. Thus, this process provides a convenient tool to remove the atmospheric fluctuations of atmospheric transmittance by reconciling the maximum point of the image with the standard curve. The algorithm was tested using data from seven transects in the China Sea, and the retrieved results for the Zhujiang (Pearl River) Estuary were compared with the sea-truth data with good agreement. This suggests that the algorithm can be used as a seasonal regional model for water masses along the China coast. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper describes how ground radiometry with a Spectron spectroradiometer has been used to examine spectra for a range of surfaces and to compare different CASI bandsets for discrimination of different classes of intertidal vegetation and sediments. CASI in spatial mode records data in up to 14 programmable wavebands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. Different CASI bandsets have been devised for different purposes (some within this project with the aid of Spectron data). A range of these bandsets are compared on simulated CASI data derived from Spectron ground radiometry. Principal component analysis and discriminant analysis show that these CASI handsets are capable of separating spectra from 10 key surfaces, but that the various bandsets differ little in their effectiveness and that precise waveband selection is not critical.																	0143-1161					APR	1998	19	6					1189	1205		10.1080/014311698215685								WOS:000073315500012

The foraging activities of the birds on Arctic breeding grounds are leading to loss of vegetation and habitat destruction, particularly in coastal areas bordering the Hudson and James Bays. 2 Multitemporal analysis of LANDSAT data has been carried out to detect vegetational change from 1973 to 1993 at La Perouse Bay and its vicinity, the site of a breeding colony of snow geese. 3 Difference vegetation images (DVI) (difference between infra-red and red images) were prepared from images obtained in late summer in 1973, 1984 and 1993, in order to enhance vegetation density. Pair-wise differences were calculated between these DVI images, which resulted in three, secondary, classified images. Classification of the three secondary images (1973-84, 1984-93, 1973-93) yielded three well-defined classes: water, vegetation decline and no change in vegetation. 4 Histogram counts gave the following values for areas of vegetation decline: 1973-84, 1026 ha; 1984-93, 1428 ha; 1973-93, 2454 ha. 5 The loss of vegetation and the destruction of habitat are discussed in relation to the foraging activities of the expanding goose population.																	0022-0477					APR	1998	86	2					362	+										WOS:000073764500014

Data from AVHRR/NOAA and VISSR/GMS are used for the cloud top structure, while data from SSM/I 85 GHz channels and Keifu-maru radar are used for the internal signature of the Cloud Band. The analyses of two scenes reveal the asymmetric structure of the Cloud Band in the east-west direction: the western part includes a large amount of cloud water and the precipitation area is in the central part. The eastern part comprises less cloud water and precipitation. These suggest that the updraft region is located in the western part of the Cloud Band. While these internal signatures in the east-west direction are common to both scenes, the appearance of the cloud top structure differs between the two. In addition, the internal signatures differ quantitatively in the north-south direction. The variation in the structure seems to reflect the effect of a meso-alpha cyclone. This implies that the Cloud Band is a front-like feature in a meso-alpha cyclone, which develops from a simple discontinuous line between a northwesterly monsoon and a northeasterly wind in the lower troposphere.				ueda, hiroshi/P-9078-2014													0026-1165	2186-9057				APR	1998	76	2					169	189		10.2151/jmsj1965.76.2_169								WOS:000073830400002

Sharp regional distinctions in landform and meteorology, in addition to relatively scant historical wind data, preclude a comprehensive assessment based on existing data, motivating a regional approach to the assessment using a diversity of techniques. Our approach combines remote sensing, simplified meteorological modeling, analysis of historical measurements, biological indicators, and shortterm spot-measurements to characterize promising wind sites. The southern Red Sea coast is a rich wind resource. Long term Red Sea wind data from the comprehensive ocean-atmosphere data set (COADS) reveal that average annual wind speeds at 10 m along the lower 200 km of coastline are from 6 to 7.5 m/s. The United States Air Force Environmental Technical Applications Center's (USAFTEC's) DATSAV hourly surface wind data for Aseb indicate annual mean wind speeds of 9 m/s for one site, with average winds above 11 m/s during the winter monsoons from October through April.

Landsat TM, SPOT XS and CASI data of mangroves from the Turks and Caicos Islands, were classified using each method. All classifications of SPOT XS data failed to discriminate satisfactorily between mangrove and non-mangrove vegetation. Classification accuracy of CASI data was higher than Landsat TM for all methods, and more mangrove classes could be discriminated.

Velocities of Thwaites Glacier range from 2.2 km a(-1) above the grounding line to 3.4 km a(-1) at the limit of measurements on Thwaites Glacier ice tongue. The glacier increases in velocity by about 1 km a(-1) where it crosses the grounding line. Over the period 1984-93,Thwaites Glacier ice tongue accelerated by about 0.6 km a(-1).

Antarctica. The interferograms are constructed from SAR images provided by the European Space Agency's remote-sensing satellites (ERS-1/2). Narrow bands of large shear strain rate are observed along the boundaries between fast-flowing ice-shelf ice and no-flow boundaries. Large rifts, opened where the ice shelf separates from the coast, appear to be filled with a melange of sea ice, ice-shelf fragments, and snell: Trial and error is used to find the best match between artificial interferograms, constructed from modelled ice flow and the observed interferograms. We find that at both HIR and LC, ice within the coastal boundary layers must be significantly softer than adjacent ice. At HIR the rift-filling ice melange transmits stress from one ice-shelf fragment to another; thus it must have mechanical competence and must moderate both separation of the ice shelf from the coast and the release of icebergs. However, the ice melange along the LC does not. The difference may be related to melange thickness, which could vary in the two locations due to differences in sub-ice-shelf oceanography or perhaps to regional atmospheric warming, currently under way along the Antarctic Peninsula. Future warming could weaken the melange ice around HIR as well, causing the ice shelf to lose contact with that shelf-front anchor.

Classical upwelling patterns were observed near the coast, with strong fronts characterized by cold water, high chlorophyll a, and high nutrients. CDOM concentration showed a negative correlation with temperature in the surface waters throughout the study region, reflecting upwelling as the major source of CDOM to surface waters. Three water mass types were identified and found to have distinctive excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fingerprints. Persian Gulf Water had two fluorescence maxima due to UV and visible humic substance fluorescence. Maximum CDOM concentrations were found in the core of this water mass. Upwelling water had five or six fluorescence peaks, due to new and old CDOM. Elevated CDOM concentrations at the depth of the chlorophyll a maximum indicated production of new CDOM associated with the phytoplankton bloom. Oligotrophic water had extremely low CDOM concentrations, and only UV-absorbing and fluorescing compounds were found. This is consistent with CDOM which has been subjected to extensive exposure to solar irradiation at the sea surface. A new fluorophore with an Ex/Fm maximum at 280/340 nm is described from highly productive waters. Two new EEM fingerprints are presented, one for oligotrophic blue waters showing photoresistant DOM, and one for upwelling water that may be of biological origin. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We find that the model must account for rifts, mechanically competent sea ice which fills rifts, and ice softening in coastal boundary layers in order to agree with the ice-deformation pattern implied by observed interferograms. Analysis of the stress field in the model experiment that best matches the observed interferograms suggests that: (1) HIR introduces weakness into the ice shelf through the generation of large-scale rifts, and (2) the melange of sea ice and ice-shelf fragments that fills the rifts stabilizes the shelf front by providing mechanical coupling between the fractured shelf front and the adjacent coast. The rift-filling melange could melt more easily than the surrounding ice shelf and thus could represent a vulnerability of the FRIS to climate warming.

J	Martin, S; Kawase, M				Martin, S; Kawase, M			The southern flux of sea ice in the Tatarskiy Strait, Japan Sea and the generation of the Liman Current	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												The circulation in the surface waters of the Japan Sea is driven in part by thermohaline forcing associated with the flux of cold, low-salinity water from the Tatarskiy Strait. Existing numerical models suggest that this water contributes to the Liman Current, which flows from northeast to southwest along the Russian coast. The major source of Japan Sea freshwater is the Amur River, which flows into the sea through Tatarskiy Strait, but has a near-zero minimum during January to March. As an alternate source of freshwater to the surface layer, we derive from meteorological and remote sensing data for the 1992-1994 winters, the magnitude of the freshwater flux generated by the southward transport and melt of pack ice in the Tatarskiy Strait. Given characteristic geostrophic northerly wind speeds of 10 m s(-1) and air temperatures of -13 degrees C, the winter freshwater flux into the ice edge is about 10 km(3) month(-1). Although no oceanographic or sea ice data exist for the Strait, comparison of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of ice processes in the Strait with those in the Bering Sea where oceanographic data exist suggests that ice edge melting in the Strait generates an oceanic frontal structure and a westward geostrophic current, which we hypothesize feeds into the Liman Current. Comparison of the results of a simple baroclinic model driven by this freshwater flux with a section across the Liman Current yields comparable density differences and transports. In summary, our results show that the freshwater flux associated with the southward ice transport in the Tatarskiy Strait may contribute to the driving of the Liman Current during winter.																	0022-2402					JAN	1998	56	1					141	155		10.1357/002224098321836145								WOS:000072549800006

The average fleet PM-10 emission rate was 0.138 g/mi, while the average emission rate for smokers was 0.395 g/mi. It was concluded that the casual observation of smoking vehicles was not very successful in identifying high PM-10 emitting vehicles. The particulate matter composition was primarily carbonaceous, with a variable distribution between the elemental and organic carbon fractions, and showed no significant difference in the percent organic carbon fraction between smokers and non-smokers. The PM composition differed, on average, between pre-repair and post-repair samples. The effect of the California Smog Check repair program on PM emission rates could not be evaluated due to concerns regarding the effect of vehicle conditioning on these measurements.																	0013-936X					DEC	1997	31	12					3405	3412		10.1021/es9700257								WOS:A1997YJ88200033						
J	Morel, A				Morel, A			Consequences of a Synechococcus bloom upon the optical properties of oceanic (case 1) waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A dense Synechococcus population has been observed in oceanic offshore waters (400 km from the Mauritanian coast) within the upper 30-m-thick layer. With cell counts >3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), about half (0.6) of the total Chi a concentration (1.25 mg m(-3)) was attributable to the cyanobacteria. The optical properties of this water body markedly differed from those of case 1 waters with the same Chin concentration. The euphotic depth was diminished (by similar to 10 m on average) and the spectral attenuation coefficients for downwelling irradiance were increased (by 40-60% in the green and blue pans of the spectrum); the absorption band characteristic of phycoerythrin was easily detected on filtered material, as well as within the in-water light field and in the water-leaving upward radiant flux. The amplitude of the departures of the actual optical properties from those predicted for normal case 1 waters are described and then analyzed through radiative transfer computations. The peculiar Chi-specific absorption capabilities of Synechococcus (originating from the small size and the presence of phycobilins and zeaxanthin), rather than a significant increase in the bulk scattering properties, are at the origin of the deviations observed. The possibility of detecting such a particular algal bloom, through remote-sensing techniques based on the ocean reflectance, requires a high radiometric sensitivity and dedicated spectral channels. If detection is feasible, quantifying the cyanobacterial biomass from satellite information remains a difficult task. The variability in the relative proportions of phycobilins and Chi a for these organisms impedes a quantitative assessement of their contribution to the total Chl biomass.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				DEC	1997	42	8					1746	1754		10.4319/lo.1997.42.8.1746								WOS:000073407700010						
J	Fingas, MF; Brown, CE				Fingas, MF; Brown, CE			Review of oil spill remote sensing	SPILL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY BULLETIN												Airborne and space-borne sensors are reviewed and evaluated in terms of their usefulness in responding to oil spills. Recent developments and trends in sensor technology are illustrated with specific examples. The discussion of the sensors is divided into two main categories, namely active and passive. Active sensors are those that provide their own source of illumination or excitation, whereas passive sensors rely on illumination from a secondary source. A common passive sensor is an infrared camera or an IR/UV (infrared/ultraviolet) system. The inherent weaknesses include the inability to discriminate oil on beaches, among seaweeds or debris. Among active sensors, the laser fluorosensor is a most useful instrument because of its unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, ice and snow. It is the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Disadvantages include the large size, weight and high cost. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches and foul weather remote sensing. Radar is costly, requires a dedicated aircraft, and is prone to many interferences. Equipment that measures relative slick thickness is still under development. Passive microwave has been studied for several years, but many commercial instruments lack sufficient spatial resolution to be practical, operational instruments. A laser-acoustic instrument, which provides the only technology to measure absolute oil thickness, is under development. Equipment operating in the visible region of the spectrum, such as cameras and scanners, is useful for documentation or providing a basis for the overlay of other data. It is not useful beyond this because oil shows no spectral characteristics in the visible region which can be used to discriminate oil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Gordon, HR; Du, T; Zhang, TM				Gordon, HR; Du, T; Zhang, TM			Remote sensing of ocean color and aerosol properties: resolving the issue of aerosol absorption	APPLIED OPTICS												Current atmospheric correction and aerosol retrieval algorithms for ocean color sensors use measurements of the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance in the near infrared, where the contribution from the ocean is known for case 1 waters, to assess the aerosol optical properties. Such measurements are incapable of distinguishing between weakly and strongly absorbing aerosols, and the atmospheric correction and aerosol retrieval algorithms fail if the incorrect absorption properties of the aerosol are assumed. We present an algorithm that appears promising for the retrieval of in-water biophysical properties and aerosol optical properties in atmospheres containing both weakly and strongly absorbing aerosols. By using the entire spectrum available to most ocean color instruments (412-865 nm), we simultaneously recover the ocean's bio-optical properties and a set of aerosol models that best describes the aerosol optical properties. The algorithm is applied to simulated situations that are likely to occur off the U.S. East Coast in summer when the aerosols could be of the locally generated weakly absorbing Maritime type or of the pollution-generated strongly absorbing urban-type transported over the ocean by the winds. The simulations show that the algorithm behaves well in an atmosphere with either weakly or strongly absorbing aerosol. The algorithm successfully identifies absorbing aerosols and provides close values for the aerosol optical thickness. It also provides excellent retrievals of the ocean bio-optical The algorithm uses a bio-optical model of case 1 waters and a set of aerosol models for its The relevant parameters of both the ocean and atmosphere are systematically varied to find the best (in a rms sense) fit to the measured top-of-the-atmosphere spectral reflectance. Examples are provided that show the algorithm's performance in the presence of errors, e.g., error in the contribution from whitecaps and error in radiometric calibration.

J	Ward, DH; Markon, CJ; Douglas, DC				Ward, DH; Markon, CJ; Douglas, DC			Distribution and stability of eelgrass beds at Izembek Lagoon, Alaska	AQUATIC BOTANY												Spatial change in eelgrass meadows, Zostera marina L., was assessed between 1978 and 1987 and between 1987 and 1995 at Izembek Lagoon, Alaska. Change in total extent was evaluated through a map to map comparison of data interpreted from a 1978 Landsat multi-spectral scanner image and 1987 black and white aerial photographs. A ground survey in 1995 was used to assess spatial change from 1987. Eelgrass beds were the predominant vegetation type in the lagoon, comprising 44-47% (15000-16000 ha) of the total area in 1978 and 1987. Izembek Lagoon contains the largest bed of seagrass along the Pacific Coast of North America and largest known single stand of eelgrass in the world. There was a high degree of overlap in the spatial distribution of eelgrass among years of change detection. The overall net change was a 6% gain between 1978 and 1987 and a <l% gain between 1987 and 1995. The lack of significant change in eelgrass cover suggests that eelgrass meadows in Izembek Lagoon have been stable during the 17-year period of our study. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Harley, RA; Sawyer, RF; Milford, JB				Harley, RA; Sawyer, RF; Milford, JB			Updated photochemical modeling for California's South Coast Air Basin: Comparison of chemical mechanisms and motor vehicle emission inventories	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Large uncertainties remain in photochemical models used to relate emissions of VOC and NOx to ambient O-3 concentrations. Bias in motor vehicle emission estimates for VOC has been a long-standing concern. An improved Eulerian photochemical model is described and applied to the August 27-28, 1987, period in southern California. The chemical mechanism used in the model is SAPRC93, which predicts peak ozone concentrations 22% higher on average than the LCC mechanism used previously. A revised motor vehicle emission inventory was developed using gasoline sales and infrared remote sensing data for CO and measured ambient NMOC/CO and NOx/CO ratios. On-road vehicle emissions for the South Coast Air Basin in summer 1987 were estimated to be (1800 +/- 400) x 10(3) and (710 +/- 160) x 10(3) kg day(-1) for NMOC and NOx, respectively. These values are 2.4 and 1.0 times, respectively, the corresponding current official inventory estimates (MVEI 7G). Ozone concentrations predicted using the CIT airshed model matched observations more closely when the revised inventory was used in place of official emission estimates. If the vehicle fleet in 1987 were operating with no emission controls, NMOC and NO, emissions would have been 5900 x 10(3) and 1200 x 10(3) kg day(-1) respectively. On average, peak predicted ozone concentrations for the controlled vehicle fleet operating in 1987 were 43% lower than values predicted for the uncontrolled vehicle fleet. The peak predicted ozone concentration with the uncontrolled vehicle fleet was 500 ppb.

The OASIS controllers are part of a long-term ''coastal ocean observatory,'' consisting of an infrastructure of ships, submersibles, an array of remote sensing platforms (moorings, drifters), communication links between sensors and laboratory, and data management facilities. The OASIS controller coordinates retrieval of data from a varying array of up to 28 oceanographic sensors, which may output digital, analog, or frequency data. The controller provides scheduling, sensor control software, data logging, preliminary data processing, and two-way telemetry between remote platform and ship or shore station. Telemetry allows real-time access to data and permits users to alter control parameters as necessary. Two OASIS moorings have been successfully deployed off the central California coast since 1992. Real-time access and two-way telemetry has allowed the moorings to become testbeds for the deployment of new sensors and widely used observational and planning tools. Over longer timescales the moorings will be an important tool for tracking environmental variability. OASIS drifters have been tested in ii deployments off California and 3 deployments in the equatorial Pacific. This paper describes the OASIS controller, its deployment on moorings and drifters, and presents oceanographic data that demonstrate the types of information obtained both from central California and the equatorial Pacific.																	0739-0572					OCT	1997	14	5					1199	1211		10.1175/1520-0426(1997)014<1199:MADFRT>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1997XX16200016

The application of remote sensing methods to the study of estuarine mixing processes in the Tay Estuary, supported by ground measurements, has discovered convergent front mechanisms and complex hydrodynamic processes which had not previously been recognized in the Tay Estuary. This integrated approach has enabled the various features and mixing mechanisms found in the lower section of the estuary to be interrelated. The limitations of using a two-dimensional mathematical and a physical model to predict the complex mixing processes affecting water quality in the Tay Estuary are discussed.

Harmonic coefficients of the wind direction signals were derived from experimental data versus incidence angle, It was found that the first harmonic coefficients, which are caused by the up and downwind asymmetric surface features, had a small increasing trend with the incidence angle, In contrast, the second harmonic coefficients, caused by the up and crosswind asymmetry, showed significant variations in T-v and U data, with a sign change when the incidence angle increased from 45 degrees to 65 degrees. Besides the first three Stokes parameters, the fourth Stokes parameter, V, which had never been measured before for sea surfaces, was measured using our 19-GHz channel, The Stokes parameter V an odd symmetry just like that of the third Stokes parameter U, and increases with increasing incidence angles, In summary, sea surface features created by surface winds are anisotropic in azimuth direction and modulate all Stokes parameters of sea surface microwave brightness temperatures by as large as a few Kelvin in the range of incidence angles from 45 degrees to 65 degrees applicable to spaceborne observations.																	0196-2892					SEP	1997	35	5					1177	1187		10.1109/36.628785								WOS:A1997XW39000009						
J	White, WA; Morton, RA				White, WA; Morton, RA			Wetland losses related to fault movement and hydrocarbon production, southeastern Texas coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Time series analyses of surface fault activity and nearby hydrocarbon production from the southeastern Texas coast show a high correlation among volume of produced fluids, timing of fault activation, rates of subsidence, and rates of wetland loss. Greater subsidence on the downthrown sides of faults contributes to more frequent flooding and generally wetter conditions, which are commonly reflected by changes in plant communities leg., Spartina patens to Spartina alterniflora) or progressive transformation of emergent vegetation to open water. Since the 1930s and 1950s, approximately 5,000 hectares of marsh habitat has been lost as a result of subsidence associated with faulting. Marshes have expanded locally along faults where hydrophytic vegetation has spread into former upland areas. Fault traces are linear to curvilinear and are visible because elevation differences across faults alter soil hydrology and vegetation. Fault lengths range from 1 to 13.4 km and average 3.8 km. Seventy-five percent of the faults visible on recent aerial photograph are not visible on photographs taken in the 1930's, indicating relatively recent fault movement. At least 80% of the surface faults correlate with extrapolated subsurface faults; the correlation increases to more than 90% when certain assumptions are made to compensate for mismatches in direction of displacement. Coastal wetlands loss in Texas associated with hydrocarbon extraction will likely increase where production in mature fields is prolonged without fluid reinjection.																	0749-0208					FAL	1997	13	4					1305	1320										WOS:A1997XZ99900033						
J	Graber, HC; Haus, BK; Chapman, RD; Shay, LK				Graber, HC; Haus, BK; Chapman, RD; Shay, LK			HF radar comparisons with moored estimates of current speed and direction: Expected differences and implications	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The validation of estimates of ocean surface current speed and direction from high-frequency (HF) Doppler radars can be obtained through comparisons with measurements from moored near-surface current meters, acoustic Doppler current profilers, or drifters. Expected differences between current meter (CM) and HF radar estimates of ocean surface vector currents depend on numerous sources of errors and differences such as instrument and sensor limitations, sampling characteristics, mooring response, and geophysical variability. We classify these sources of errors and differences as being associated exclusively with the current meter, as being associated exclusively with the HF radar, or as a result of differing methodologies in which current meters and HF radars sample the spatially and temporally varying ocean surface current vector field. In this latter context we consider three geophysical processes, namely, the Stokes drift, Ekman drift, and baroclinicity, which contribute to the differences between surface and nearsurface vector current measurements. The performance of the HF radar is evaluated on the basis of these expected differences. Vector currents were collected during the High Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment II off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in June 1993. The results of this analysis suggest that 40%-60% of the observed differences between near-surface CM and HF radar velocity measurements can be explained in terms of contributions from instrument noise, collocation and concurrence differences, and geophysical processes. The rms magnitude difference ranged from 11 to 20 cm s(-1) at the four mooring sites. The average angular difference ranged between 15 degrees and 25 degrees of which about 10 degrees is attributed to the directional error of the radar current vector estimates due to the alignment of the radial beams.																	0148-0227					AUG 15	1997	102	C8					18749	18766		10.1029/97JC01190								WOS:A1997XR35600015

Temporal variation in surface albedo was determined using an extensive data set from six tower sites with multiple years of data. Four distinct patterns in evolution of the seasonal trend in daily albedo were discovered for the six sites and appeared to be related to vegetation and surface moisture characteristics. All sites showed an albedo response to solar zenith angles greater than 60 degrees, at smaller zenith angles hourly albedo was a good representation of daily values. TM imagery from a dry year (1984) and a wet year (1991) were used to derive maps of albedo for the study area. Spatial variation of albedo was examined within representative training areas centered on the six tower sites. The magnitude of spatial variation in albedo was typically less than 0.04 for all sites. Spatial variability was slightly greater in the wet year. A one pixel transect of albedo across the study area showed the largest difference between lakes and terrestrial surfaces. However, within the terrestrial zones, alternating patches of open forest and tundra and differences in wetness create a coherent pattern in albedo across the landscape.

J	Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E; Sanderson, EW				Zhang, M; Ustin, SL; Rejmankova, E; Sanderson, EW			Monitoring Pacific coast salt marshes using remote sensing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The rapid decline in the extent and health of coastal salt marshes has created a need for nondestructive methods for evaluating the condition of salt marsh ecosystems. This paper describes simultaneous uses of held sampling and remote sensing approaches to understand salt marsh ecosystem functions and species distributions and discusses the implications for salt marsh monitoring using remote sensing. Three sites along the Petaluma River near the entrance into San Pablo Bay, California, which represented a range of soil salinity, water content, and nutrients, were studied. Standing biomass was directly assessed by field sampling and indirectly estimated through canopy reflectance. The sites were dominated by almost monotypic stands of Salicornia virginica, Spartina foliosa, and Scirpus robustus. For Salicornia, we found a positive relationship between salinity and biomass up to a threshold of 42 g/kg, after which biomass declined monotonically with increasing salinity. No Scirpus or Spartina were found at soil salinities >20 g/kg. Although significantly different levels of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were found in the interstitial water and soils at these sites, no strong relationships were found between biomass and nitrate nitrogen. Soil ammonium nitrogen, in contrast, was positively related to biomass. Soil redox and salinity increased with elevation and distance from the shoreline, while soil moisture and H2S decreased. Canopy biomass was estimable using remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices at 58-80% accuracy depending on. species. Simple Vegetation Index (VI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) measured by handheld field spectrometers were the best estimators of green biomass for high cover of Salicornia. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Soil Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI) gave the best estimates for Spartina while the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) was the best estimate for Scirpus. The relationships between vegetation indices and biomass were developed from field spectra. The VI was used to estimate spatial patterns of biomass across the salt marsh from Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM image showed spatial patterns corresponding with species zones and biomass abundance. Narrow band reflectance features measured with a handheld spectrometer can be used to predict canopy plant water content (R-2 = 63%). Interpolated estimates of water content from field-measured canopy reflectance were shown to relate to variation in salinity and soil moisture. Canopy water content was estimated from Airborne Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data, which showed similar spatial patterns at the site. Results indicate that both biomass production and canopy water content can be accurately determined from remotely sensed spectral measures. Species-specific differences in these characteristics may be used for monitoring species distribution and abundance from airborne or satellite images.																	1051-0761					AUG	1997	7	3					1039	1053										WOS:A1997XQ08100026

H., Nunes, R. A., 1981. Estuar. Coast. Shelf Sci. 13, 257-266). The front was observed as it propagated through the inlet and moved into the main channel of a small estuary (Tweed Estuary, UK) during a flooding spring tide. High salinity coastal waters plunged beneath low salinity estuarine waters, the plunge lines defining a ''V'' shaped front for part of the flood. The data were obtained using aircraft and sea-truth measurements as part of a two-day field programme in September 1994. Hydrographic surveys undertaken during similar environmental conditions in September 1993 also are used to aid interpretation. A convex-seaward front was observed in the seaward section of the inlet at LW + 2.1 h (LW = low-water). By LW + 2.7 h, approaching maximum flood currents at mid-water, a ''V'' shaped tidal intrusion front was observed at the neck of the inlet, with the ''V'' pointing up-estuary. These data are consistent with measured salinity in the inlet at LW + 2.1 h and the occurrence of a critical inflow Froude number in the inlet neck at LW + 2.7 h. At this time a tongue of colour-difference waters was observed which extended about 400 m into the estuary and emanated from the intrusion front inside the inlet. The front moved through the neck as flood currents increased, entered the estuary main channel at LW + 3.1 h and collapsed within the channel at LW + 3.3 h. The plunge point then transferred to the tip of the colour-demarcation tongue, which subsequently developed a ''V'' head and migrated up-estuary with an apparent speed that was approximately equal to the estimated difference between tidal and buoyancy current speeds (0.2 m s(-1)). Measured salinity showed the horizontal, near-surface structure of the intrusion front when it was located approximately 1 km inside the estuary at LW + 3.9 h. A lens of less saline surface water was observed slightly up-estuary of this front, effectively trapped between the main channel and shoals. The front then remained effectively stationary until LW + 4.6 h, at which time it dissipated. Pronounced frontal structures that defined the boundary of the low salinity lens, on the channel margins and over the inundated shoals, remained however, and were surveyed at LW + 4.8 h. These frontal structures, and a diminished lens of fresher waters, were observed remotely by aircraft at LW + 5.6 h, within 30 min of high-water. The effects of mixing, basal current circulations and variable channel depths, especially the occurrences of particularly deep areas, are discussed. Centrifugal effects are shown to be important.

Airborne in situ methods directly measure aerosol characteristics such as size distribution and scattering coefficient at a particular altitude and infer the total column optical properties, such as optical thickness. Ground-based remote sensing is sensitive to the aerosol optical properties of the entire column and infers the physical properties from inversion of sky radiance. Comparison of optical thickness measurements are encouraging but inconclusive because of measured profiles which extend no higher than 2 km. By comparing aerosol volume size distributions we find that the two systems are in agreement in the radius size range 0.05-2 mu m, after the stratospheric aerosol mode is removed from the remote sensing data. At larger aerosol sizes both systems suffer from greater uncertainty, and the larger aerosols themselves are less spatially uniform because of their short lifetimes. The combination of factors makes the comparison at larger radii impossible. The disadvantages of the in situ systems are that there is a measuring efficiency for each device which is dependent on aerosol size and that airborne in situ measurements are rare events in time and space. Also, in situ instruments dry the aerosol before measurement. Automatic remote sensing procedures measure the total column ambient aerosol unaffected by drying or sampling issues, and these instruments can be installed globally to make observations many times per day. However, the disadvantages to remote sensing are that the inferred physical properties are dependent on the assumptions and numerical limitations of the inversion procedures. The favorable comparison between the two types of measurement systems suggests that these drawbacks are manageable in both cases.

Rapidly occurring land-cover and land-use change in the Western Ghats has serious implications for the biodiversity of the region. Both landscape changes as well as the distribution of biodiversity are phenomena with strong spatial correlates. Recent developments in remote-sensing technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow the use of a landscape ecology and spatial analysis approach to the problem of deforestation and biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats. Applications of this approach include analyses of land-cover and landuse change; estimation of deforestation rates and rates of forest fragmentation; examination of the spatial correlates of forest loss and the socioeconomic drivers of land-use change; modelling of deforestation; analysis of the consequences of land-cover and land-use change in the form of climate change and change in distribution of biodiversity; biomass estimation; gap analysis of the effectiveness of the protected area network in conserving areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; and conservation planning.

J	Brown, CW; Podesta, GP				Brown, CW; Podesta, GP			Remote sensing of coccolithophore blooms in the western South Atlantic Ocean	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												High-reflectance patches are regularly observed off the southeastern coast of South America during the lat austral spring and summer in visible satellite imagery of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). Unfortunately, coincident in situ samples for identifying their cause are lacking. To ascertain the likelihood that these patches represent surface blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, their distribution pattern was mapped and their spectral signature evaluated by classifying CZCS imagery with a supervised, multispectral classification scheme that had been developed to detect this phytoplankton species. On the basis of the similarity of these characteristics to those of documented cases, we conclude that the high-reflectance patches observed in surface waters of the shelf and beyond are E. huxleyi blooms. The blooms seasonally occupied an area as large as 550,000 km(2). Standing stock estimates indicate that the detected blooms produce an average of 1.5-4.9X10(5) metric tons of calcite carbon and 4.0X10(3) t of dimethyl sulfide sulfur. The bloom's production of these climatically relevant compounds and their alteration of optical properties in the surface layer suggest that the blooms significantly affect the biogeochemistry and ecology of this region.

J	Liousse, C; Dulac, F; Cachier, H; Tanre, D				Liousse, C; Dulac, F; Cachier, H; Tanre, D			Remote sensing of carbonaceous aerosol production by African savanna biomass burning	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We present an estimate of the yearly flux of total and black carbon aerosols emitted by savanna biomass burning in Africa from satellite data and ground-based measurements. Smoke plumes are identified using visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared derived information. In the savanna region of our study, these structures could either decrease or increase the visible albedo of advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). It is hypothesized that variations of chemical composition and particulate size distribution may create such differences. The 5S model [Tanre et al., 1990] is used to simulate radiative transfer through smoke plumes and background atmosphere. The overall uncertainty of the derived aerosol optical depth (tau(a)) is 75% and mainly due to the choice in particulate composition and size distribution aerosol. Impact of the aerosol mixture (internal versus external mixture) has been also tested. For smoke plumes a typical value of tau(a) (at 0.55 mu m) is 0.5, and 0.1 for the background atmosphere. Specific extinction cross sections are calculated using Mie theory applied to different representative aerosol models, allowing the retrieval of aerosol columnar concentrations from aerosol optical depth values and integrated aerosol mass loadings in fire plumes. The overall uncertainty on the determination of aerosol load is estimated to be lower than a factor of 5. The atmospheric carbonaceous aerosol flux from savanna burning in Africa was estimated to be 6.5 Tg C yr(-1), which compares with that obtained from emission factor on-site measurements (13 +/- 5 Tg C yr(-1)).																	2169-897X					MAR 20	1997	102	D5					5895	5911		10.1029/96JD03404								WOS:A1997WQ02100004						
J	Morrison, RIG				Morrison, RIG			The use of remote sensing to evaluate shorebird habitats and populations on Prince Charles Island, Foxe Basin, Canada	ARCTIC												Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper imagery was used to produce a 17-habitat classification of Prince Charles Island, Fore Basin, Northwest Territories, through a combination of supervised and unsupervised approaches. Breeding shorebirds and habitats were surveyed at 35 study plots in July 1989. Habitat-specific breeding densities calculated from these observations were used to estimate total populations of breeding shorebirds on the island based on areas of habitat derived from the classified image. Breeding densities were further modelled in two ways: first, to adjust for distance from the coast, where regression analyses found a significant relationship between distance and density, and second, to include only those pixels of areas considered suitable for breeding, using results of a proximity analysis to determine habitat associations between known breeding locations (pixels) and other habitats. Six species of shorebirds were found breeding on Prince Charles Island, with a combined population (after modelling) estimated at 294000 pairs. Comparison of breeding densities and estimated populations of shorebirds with those recorded at other arctic locations indicated that Prince Charles Island supports highly significant numbers of shorebirds, especially white-rumped sandpipers and red phalaropes. Comparison of reference areas of known habitat with those on the classified image indicated classification accuracy averaged over 90%. Remote sensing appears to offer a reliable method for assessing habitats and regional breeding populations of birds in at least some areas, providing that classification methods are carried out in a carefully controlled manner. Use of the method over broad areas of the Arctic would require considerable work to recalibrate imagery for different geographic regions.																	0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	1997	50	1					55	75										WOS:A1997WQ21000007						
J	Liu, Z; Bromwich, DH				Liu, Z; Bromwich, DH			Dynamics of the Katabatic Wind Confluence Zone near Siple Coast, West Antarctica	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												The surface wind pattern over the ice sheets of Antarctica is irregular with marked areas of airflow confluence near the coastal margins. Where cold air from a large interior area of the ice sheet converges (a confluence zone), an anomalously large supply of air is available to feed the coastal katabatic winds, which, as a result, are intensified and more persistent. The confluence zone inland of Siple Coast, West Antarctica, differs from its East Antarctic counterparts in that the terrain slopes become gentler rather than steeper as the coast is approached. In addition, synoptic processes exert substantially more impact on the behavior of the surface winds. A month-long field program to study the dynamics of the springtime katabatic wind confluence zone has been carried out near Siple Coast. Two sites, Upstream B (83.5 degrees S, 136.1 degrees W) and South Camp (84.5 degrees S, 134.3 degrees W), were established roughly perpendicular to the downslope direction. The held program involved the use of the ground-based remote sensing equipment (sodar and RASS) along with conventional surface and balloon observations. Previous analyses revealed the cross sectional structure of the confluence zone as consisting of a more buoyant West Antarctic katabatic airflow overlying a less buoyant katabatic airflow originating from East Antarctica. The force balances inside the confluence zone are here investigated for three situations: mean (all available wind profiles from balloon launches), and two extreme cases (light and strong winds). A linear regression method is used to estimate the mean vertical wind shears and horizontal temperature gradients. The vertical wind shears are used to examine whether or not the airflows are in geostrophic balance. The results are 1) the airflow above the surface at both sites is in geostrophic balance for the three situations; 2) inside the West Antarctic katabatic wind zone, there are three forces in the north-south direction-the restoring pressure gradient force associated with blocking of the katabatic and synoptic winds, the downslope buoyancy force, and the synoptic pressure gradient force associated with the time-averaged low in the South Pacific Ocean; 3) above the West Antarctic katabatic wind layer, the observed easterly wind is due to the synoptic pressure gradient force associated with the low; 4) inside the East Antarctic katabatic wind zone, in addition to the above three forces, there is the downslope buoyancy force associated with the inversion; and 5) large-scale transient synoptic systems strongly influence the downslope wind speed and the boundary layer depth, resulting in the light and strong wind cases.

Based on field data and remote sensing images (AVHRR and CZCS), two mechanisms associated with island-generated eddies, largely responsible for the formation and distribution of chlorophyll around the Canary Islands, are proposed. First, nutrient pumping and vertical uplifting of the deep chlorophyll maximum by cyclonic eddies might represent important sources of primary production in the oligotrophic waters of the Canary region. Second, eddies are responsible for the horizontal transport and distribution of chlorophyll originating near the islands or off the African coast. Water with high chlorophyll content, resulting from island stirring or local upwelling at the flanks of the islands, is incorporated into cyclonic eddies in their development and subsequently transported downstream. On the other hand, anticyclonic eddies can also entrain water rich in chlorophyll when interacting with the offshore boundary of the African coastal upwelling. This chlorophyll will be advected southward as the eddy drifts. The recurrence of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, together with the presence of upwelling filaments throughout the year, must have important biological consequences in the formation and transport of organic matter in the Canary region.

J	Bohm, E; Hopkins, TS; Minnett, PJ				Bohm, E; Hopkins, TS; Minnett, PJ			Passive microwave observations of the Northeast Water Polynya interannual variability: 1978-1994	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					Northeast Water Polynya Symposium	MAY 01-05, 1995	HELSINGOR, DENMARK					A description of the seasonal cycle and interannual behavior of the Northeast Water (NEW) Polynya based upon a series of daily total ice concentrations derived from passive microwave satellite observations (1978-1994) is presented. The integrated ice-free areal extent within the region extending from 76 to 82 degrees N and from the coast of northeast Greenland to the shelf break is used as an indication of the opening of the NEW Polynya. The Polynya stays open from the beginning of May to the end of September. The summer maximum total water (TW) area ranges from a minimum 59,000 (in 1992) to a maximum of 120,000 km(2) (in 1985) and the date of maximum opening from the beginning of July to the end of September. The largest values of TW during summer are observed for 1985, 1990 and 1991 and are accompanied by the appearance of a secondary opening to the south. In contrast, the smallest TW's that occurred in 1987, 1989 and 1992, exhibit only a northern cell. Monthly averages of heat budget, cloud cover, air temperature, and resultant vector wind are analyzed in order to explain the observed variations of TW in the NEW Polynya. It is found that the variations of TW are due to the heat budget which, for the pentad March 1985-February 1990, explains 86% of the observed variance in TW with a lag of one month. This lag indicates that the response of the Polynya to the thermal forcing is not dominated by higher frequency variability. Utilizing this relationship and the TW for the summers of 1992 and 1993, the potential amount of melt water was estimated assuming all the heat was available for melting, The values of 51 and 79 cm, are in good agreement with independent estimates of seasonal melting based on hydrography, The effects of wind are not easily decoupled from those of the heat budget making it difficult to establish more precisely the extent to which the Polynya may be considered a closed system.

J	El-Raey, M				El-Raey, M			Vulnerability assessment of the coastal zone of the Nile delta of Egypt, to the impacts of sea level rise	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												A survey of the derailed quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of the Nile delta coast of Egypt to the impacts of sea level vise, is presented. GIS and remote-sensing techniques are used together with ground-based surveys to assess vulnerability of the most important economic and historic centers along the coast, the cities of Alexandria, Rosetta and Port-Said. Results indicate that, in these cities alone, over 2 million people will have to abandon their homes, 214000 jobs and over $35.0 billion in land value, property, and tourism income may also be lost due to a SLR of 50 cm. The loss of the world famous historic, cultural and archeological sites is unaccountable. The vulnerability of other low land in Egypt outside these cities remains to be assessed. Development of institutional capabilities for ICZM and upgrading awareness are highly recommended for adaptation in the long run. Periodic nourishment of Alexandria and Rosetta beaches, detached break waters for Polt-Said, and sand dune fixation are the recommended no regrets management measures. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Everitt, JH; Judd, FW; Escobar, DE; Davis, MR				Everitt, JH; Judd, FW; Escobar, DE; Davis, MR			Integration of remote sensing and spatial information technologies for mapping black mangrove on the Texas gulf coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Black mangrove [Auicennia germinans (L.) L.] occurs at several locations along the Texas gulf coast. A hard freeze in December 1989 severely damaged this species, but the extent of damage has not been determined. Airborne color-infrared (CIR) video imagery was used with global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies for distinguishing and mapping the current distribution of black mangrove. Black mangrove populations could be easily distinguished on CIR video imagery. The integration of a GPS with the video imagery permitted latitude/longitude coordinates of black mangrove populations to be recorded on each image. The GPS coordinates were entered into a GIS to map black mangrove populations along the Texas coast. Major black mangrove concentrations near Port Isabel-South Bay and Port Aransas on the lower and lower-mid Texas coast, respectively, had fully recovered from the freeze. A remnant population of an historical black mangrove concentration on the upper-mid Texas coast near Port O'Connor, that was devastated by a 1983 freeze, was severely damaged and reduced in number by the 1989 freeze. The integration of videography, GPS, and GIS are valuable tools that can enable coastal resource managers to develop regional maps showing the distribution of black mangrove over large areas.																	0749-0208					WIN	1996	12	1					64	69										WOS:A1996TW33400007						
J	Graber, HC; Thompson, DR; Carande, RE				Graber, HC; Thompson, DR; Carande, RE			Ocean surface features and currents measured with synthetic aperture radar interferometry and HF radar	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												This paper describes the results of the first quantitative comparison between high-resolution ocean surface current fields extracted from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (INSAR) measurements and those from an high-frequency (HF) ocean surface current radar (OSCR) system. Data from each of these radar systems along with supporting measurements from shipboard and buoy-mounted sensors were collected during the High-Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment (High-Res) on June 20, 1993, on the continental shelf off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Both components of the surface current were obtained from the INSAR system at roughly 10-m resolution from two orthogonal flight legs over the region separated in time by about 30 min. The OSCR system measured two-dimensional surface current vectors at about 1-km resolution over this same region, while the USNS Bartlett was collecting hydrographic samples and near-surface current measurements. Two-dimensional wave spectra as well as meteorological and additional current measurements were collected at two buoys within the experimental area. We discuss in the paper two techniques for eliminating the effect of surface wave motion on the INSAR current estimates. One method relies on some knowledge of the local wind and wave field and the use of a microwave scattering model. The other method makes use of a few in situ current measurements spaced at different range locations across the INSAR image. Using either of these techniques, we find that the agreement between the INSAR and OSCR current estimates is generally very good. Furthermore, the INSAR current and magnitude imagery show the presence of undulating surface features where abrupt changes in the current speed and direction occurred. The ship surveys indicate that these features were caused by the collision of water masses of different density. We show for the first time in this paper a high-resolution, area-extensive vector surface current map derived from the INSAR of the two-dimensional flow in the vicinity of these features. Our results demonstrate convincingly that high-resolution oceanic surface current vectors can be derived from INSAR current measurements and that these measurements may be very beneficial for detailed studies of the dynamics of small-scale surface features in regions of strong current divergences or shears.																	0148-0227					NOV 15	1996	101	C11					25813	25832		10.1029/96JC02241								WOS:A1996VT41900016

Since January 1993, a three-axis Doppler sodar has been operating in this area to investigate the variability of the boundary layer structure and dynamics. In this paper, the capabilities, behavior and advantages of using this ground-based remote-sensing system in Antarctica are evaluated after one year of measurements. This instrument may play an important role in boundary layer studies in remote regions where other profiling techniques (e.g., kitoons, slow ascent balloons) are difficult and expensive. All year long, except in summer when the signal-to-noise ratio was dramatically reduced by the noise of a large group of Adelie penguins, reliable measurements were available up to 900 m. The reliability of the vertical wind velocity has been checked and the influence of the local topography on the flow pattern has been evaluated. Some preliminary results regarding the statistical analysis of the horizontal and vertical velocities and an overview of the main physical processes are also shown. The statistical analysis of the wind speed shows that the wind blows from the 30 degrees angular sectors centered at 90 degrees, 150 degrees, 180 degrees, and 0 degrees. The winds from 90 degrees and 150 degrees constitute the main local circulation and have, most of the time, the characteristics of a katabatic flow, whereas the winds blowing from 180 degrees, arising from the surface temperature difference between the sea and the land, are land breezes. Strong winds coming from the ocean (0 degrees), attributable to the inland penetration of depressions, have been observed in May, October, and November. Finally, some examples of the observed thermal structures, as depicted in the facsimile recording, are shown.				viola, angelo /C-7184-2015	viola, angelo pietro/0000-0002-6545-7496; ARGENTINI, STEFANIA/0000-0002-7939-0309												0006-8314	1573-1472				OCT	1996	81	1					75	103		10.1007/BF00119401								WOS:A1996WB60500008						
J	Yates, MG; GossCustard, JD; Rispin, WE				Yates, MG; GossCustard, JD; Rispin, WE			Towards predicting the effect of loss of intertidal feeding areas on overwintering shorebirds (Charadrii) and shelduck (Tadorna tadorna): Refinements and tests of a model developed for the Wash, east England	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The limitations of a model developed in an earlier study to predict the effect of salt-marsh reclamation on shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and seven wader species (Charadrii) feeding on the Wash, east England, are addressed. The model related the numbers of each species feeding down-shore of the marsh in a 1-km broad transect to the area of mud or sand present, and thus to the width of the shore itself. 2. Three censuses of the intertidal feeding grounds were made during the winters of 1989-90. 1990-91 and 1991-92, in addition to one made in 1985-87 on which the earlier model was based, to incorporate annual variations in bird numbers into the model and to re-affirm the constancy in bird distribution. Sediment distribution was determined by satellite image analysis, The model was reformulated to include quadratic relationships. 3. The model was tested both within the Wash and on the Essex coast of east England, Within the Wash. its predictions improved as each year's census was incorporated and as predictions were made for areas of increasing size. Outside the Wash, the model predicted the numbers of all species with reasonable precision, suggesting it can be applied over a wider geographical area. 4. It was concluded that the model gives satisfactory predictions of how, in general, bird numbers would change in response to changes in shore width and sediment composition. BY converting numbers to percentages, its predictions can be applied to particular areas for which the pre-change bird numbers are known. The model may also be applicable to predicting the effect of other changes that directly or indirectly reduce the shore width: for example, barrage construction, sea-level rise and disturbance.																	0021-8901					OCT	1996	33	5					944	954		10.2307/2404676								WOS:A1996VY72900004

The observations represent the first ER-2 Doppler radar (EDOP) measurements and perhaps the most comprehensive multispectral precipitation measurements collected from a single aircraft. The objectives of this paper are to 1) examine the relation of the vertical radar reflectivity structure to the radiometric responses over a wide range of remote sensing frequencies, 2) examine the limitations of rain estimation schemes over land and ocean backgrounds based on the observed vertical reflectivity structures and brightness temperatures, and 3) assess the usefulness of scattering-based microwave frequencies (86 GHz and above) to provide information on vertical structure in the ice region. Analysis focused on two types of convection: a small group of thunderstorms over the Florida Straits and sea-breeze-initiated convection along the Florida Atlantic coast. Various radiometric datasets are synthesized including visible, infrared (IR), and microwave (10-220 GHz). The rain cores observed over an ocean background by EDOP, compared quite well with elevated brightness temperatures from the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) 10.7-GHz channel. However, at higher microwave frequencies, which are ice-scattering based, storm evolution and vertical wind shear were found to be important in interpretation of the radiometric observations. As found in previous studies, the ice-scattering region was displaced significantly downshear of the convective and surface rainfall regions due to upper-level wind advection. The ice region above the rain layer was more opaque in the IR, although the 150- and 220-GHz brightness temperatures T-b approached the IR measurements and both corresponded well with the radar-detected ice regions. It was found that ice layer reflectivities and thicknesses were approximately 15 dBZ and a few kilometers, respectively, for detectable ice scattering to be present at these higher microwave frequencies. The EDOP-derived rainfall rates and the simultaneous microwave T-b's were compared with single-frequency forward radiative transfer calculations using a family of vertical cloud and precipitation water profiles derived from a three-dimensional cloud model. Over water backgrounds, the lower-frequency emission-based theoretical curves agreed in a rough sense with the observed radar rainfall rate-T-b data points, in view of the uncertainties in the measurements and the scatter of the cloud model profiles. The characteristics of the ice regions of the thunderstorms were examined using brightness temperature differences Delta T-b such as T-b (37 GHZ) - T-b (220 GHz). The Delta T-b's (150-220, 89-220, and 37-86 GHz) suggested a possible classification of the clouds and precipitation according to convective cores, elevated ice layers, and rain without significant ice above the melting layer. Although some qualitative classification of the ice is possible, the quantitative connection with ice path was difficult to obtain from the present observations.																	0894-8763					OCT	1996	35	10					1736	1762		10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1736:SOFTUH>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1996VP28100011						
J	Cooke, WF; Koffi, B; Gregoire, JM				Cooke, WF; Koffi, B; Gregoire, JM			Seasonality of vegetation fires in Africa from remote sensing data and application to a global chemistry model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This paper sets out to show the potential use of remote sensing of active vegetation fires for continental- to global-scale modeling of biomass burning studies. It focuses on the analysis of the seasonality of vegetation fires for the African continent, as derived from NOAA-AVHRR-GAC-5km satellite data. These data are ideally suited for savanna fires, which constitute between 60 and 80% of the biomass burnt in Africa. Monthly counts of fire pixels, within 1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude grid cells, over continental Africa have been calculated from November 1984 through October 1989. These 1 degrees grid cells are summated to a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid to enable comparison with previous studies and are analyzed at this resolution to show various features of the fire season. The analysis shows that previous attempts to characterize the seasonality of biomass burning have tended to underestimate the intensity of the peak months of burning or have predicted too long a fire season in certain areas. It also shows that there can be, for a given area, a temporal shift in the timing of the fire season from year to year. Such an interannual variability of fire seasonality makes satellite data more appropriate than statistical data for the modeling of atmospheric transport of vegetation fire products and the comparison with experimental measurements. Modeled values of black carbon mass concentration from a global transport model (MOGUNTIA), using the seasonality of biomass burning as an independent variable, are compared with measurements taken at Amsterdam Island (38 degrees 30'8, 77 degrees 30'E) and Lamto, Ivory Coast (6 degrees N, 5 degrees W). Although 5-year averaged satellite data were used, the seasonality as derived from satellite data determined in this paper gives modeled values of black carbon mass concentration that are in good agreement with the measurements.																	2169-897X					SEP 20	1996	101	D15					21051	21065		10.1029/96JD01835								WOS:A1996VJ67700013

A combined remote sensing/modeling approach for the estimation of the diurnal distribution of the amount of biomass burning in Central African Republic (C.A.R.) savanna fires is proposed. The fire propagation model (BEHAVE) developed by Rothermel was adapted to the fuel characteristics encountered in C.A.R. Ground and airborne measurements with satellite images (NOAA/AVHRR) were used to predict an accurate estimate of the burnt biomass. This combination allows the calculation of the distribution of the number of fires during the day providing an evaluation of the instantaneous fluxes of the compounds emitted in the atmosphere by these fires.																	0167-7764					SEP	1996	25	1					1	19		10.1007/BF00053283								WOS:A1996VW63900001						
J	Huh, OK; Moeller, CC; Menzel, WP; Rouse, LJ; Roberts, HH				Huh, OK; Moeller, CC; Menzel, WP; Rouse, LJ; Roberts, HH			Remote sensing of turbid coastal and estuarine waters: A method of multispectral water-type analysis	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Analysis of digital imagery from the 100 m resolution airborne Multispectral Atmospheric Mapping Sensor (MAMS) indicates that scatter pots of remotely sensed sea surface temperature versus visible and near infrared subsurface reflectance can be used to quantitatively distinguish coastal water types. The Louisiana Gulf coast, a complex region of deltas, estuaries, and marshy wetlands, is the setting for this work. Gulf inner shelf and Mississippi River waters are the primary source water types, but four additional water types are formed locally and are readily detectable with MAMS including: shallow ambient bay water, fresh marsh water drainage, salt marsh drainage, and soil water drainage. In situ measurements of suspended sediment concentration and sea surface temperature in the Atchafalaya and adjacent bays have verified the characteristics of these water types. It is found that under the forcing of atmospheric cold front passages, water type differentiation is enhanced, creating a mosaic of water types in these coastal waters. Multispectral remote sensing of these complex, variably turbid coastal waters, provides data useful for studies of water type formation and coastal circulation processes.				Menzel, W.

J	Jumars, PA; Jackson, DR; Gross, TF; Sherwood, C				Jumars, PA; Jackson, DR; Gross, TF; Sherwood, C			Acoustic remote sensing of benthic activity: A statistical approach	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Acoustic backscatter at 40 kHz was recorded from a circular area of silt 75 m in radius every 0.1 d at a water depth of 91 m off the coast of northern California for 49 d in winter 1988-1989. Data were resolved into pixels that extended 7.5 m radially and 5 degrees azimuthally. We analyzed the relatively small change in backscatter intensity and phase from a given pixel. In a time-series analysis, this change in backscatter was decomposed into three components putatively due to large, rare, transient nekton and epibenthos; more abundant benthopelagic organisms that caused volume reverberation; and more sedentary benthos. Benthic change in backscatter was presumed due to movement of animals and other biogenic modifications of sound speed in the sediment-water medium. Patterns of benthic activity and volume backscatter near the seabed changed abruptly twice, with the middle interval showing highest levels. During this middle interval, winter storms disturbed surficial sediments, offshore transport occurred near the seabed, and the benthic component was dominated by activity perfectly in phase with and linearly proportional to median, local, downwelling irradiance. We suspect that this circadian pattern was due to the burrowing urchin Brisaster latifrons that is known from previous studies at this site to emerge on the sediment surface at night when food resources are available there and to reburrow during the lighted part of the day. Extensive correlative physical data collected at the site as part of interdisciplinary studies (CODE and STRESS) allowed us to exclude other physical forcings as likely explanations for diurnal change in backscatter. In a spatial analysis, the transient component was removed explicitly pixel by pixel, and volume reverberation was removed implicitly to leave a benthic remainder that could be analyzed for spatial variation. Benthic activity showed distinct patchiness with coherence scales of roughly 5-10 m and negative spatial autocorrelation in activity levels near the largest spatial lag available (similar to 140 m). Patches did not move appreciably during the study.

J	Forget, P; Broche, P				Forget, P; Broche, P			Slicks, waves, and fronts observed in a sea coastal area by an X-band airborne synthetic aperture radar	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This article reports observations made in a sea coastal zone by an airborne X-band SAR. This zone includes a basin connected to the sea and the vicinity of the Rhone river estuary. We present the experiment and the data processing procedures including, in particular, a method for removing speckle effects from image spectra of waves. Observations of slick patterns in the basin are reported and used to relate their spatial distribution to features of the circulation as predicted by modelling. Then, we present the wave phenomena observed at sea. Off-shore, the observation are found to be consistent with actual wine conditions. Differences in wave visibility between the images are discussed using the ocean wave SAR imaging theory. The significant wave height is calculated from the image presenting the best geometry for wave detection. Along the coast, the wave transformations observed are discussed on the basis of the results of a simple wave model initialized by the main wave parameters measured off-shore. The complicated refraction effects predicted by the model can only be partially detected on the radar images because of the geometry of the observations. Finally, a frontal event is detected and interpreted as the signature of the boundary of the river plume. The wave-current model of Skop and Leipold (1988) explains the brightness of the radar signature of the front. Among other results, the conclusion emphasizes the good adequation of airborne SAR systems for remote sensing of the coastal environment.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JUL	1996	57	1					1	12		10.1016/0034-4257(95)00173-5								WOS:A1996UZ25100001						
J	Singer, BC; Harley, RA				Singer, BC; Harley, RA			A fuel-based motor vehicle emission inventory	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												A fuel-based methodology for calculating motor vehicle emission inventories is presented. In the fuel-based method, emission factors are normalized to fuel consumption and expressed as grams of pollutant emitted per gallon of gasoline burned. Fleet-average emission factors are calculated from the measured on-road emissions of a large, random sample of vehicles. Gasoline use is known at the state level from sales tax data, and may be disaggregated to individual air basins. A fuel-based motor vehicle CO inventory was calculated for the South Coast Air Basin in California for summer 1991. Emission factors were calculated from remote sensing measurements of more than 70,000 in-use vehicles. Stabilized exhaust emissions of CO were estimated to be 4400 tons/day for cars and 1500 tons/day for light-duty and medium-duty trucks, with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 20% for cars and +/- 30% for trucks. Total motor vehicle CO emissions, including incremental start emissions and emissions from heavy-duty vehicles were estimated to be 7900 tons/day. Fuel-based inventory estimates were greater than those of California's MVEI 7F model by factors of 2.2 for cars and 2.6 for trucks. A draft version of California's MVEI 7G model, which includes increased contributions from high-emitting vehicles and off-cycle emissions, predicted CO emissions which closely matched the fuel-based inventory. An analysis of CO mass emissions as a function of vehicle age revealed that cars and trucks which were ten or more years old were responsible for 58% of stabilized exhaust CO emissions from all cars and trucks.

The dunes which consist of Quatemary to Recent sediments are a major part of the various coastal landforms such as lagoons, estuaries, bays, beaches, spits, bars, deltas, marshes, tidal flats, mud flats, etc. The dunes occupy a large part of the Coromandel coast and have a key role in the morphology and landuse planning of this coastal zone. These dunes are an important source of ground water, heavy minerals, silica (glass) sands and are also potential avenues for social forestry, mixed forests, plantations and recreational resorts. As a first step in coastal zone management, mapping of these dunes and study of their relation to landuse is to be carried out. Their large extent and widespread habit make conventional mapping techniques difficult to use. Hence, the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1A) imagery has been used to map them. This paper gives an account of mapping these coastal dunes using IRS-1A imagery, a study of their morphology, the related landuse/land cover details, and also suggestions for optimal landuse management techniques.																	0169-2046					MAY	1996	34	3-4					189	195		10.1016/0169-2046(95)00233-2								WOS:A1996UT15800004

The apparent lack of associated insects or diseases that could have caused this change led to an investigation of possible environmental causes. Suspected variables were fog chemistry and frequency, rain chemistry, and ozone exposure. Significant (p = 0.05-0.01) spatial and temporal correlations of foliar browning with the fog frequency and fog chemistry variables have been detected, and their possible cause-effect relationship evaluated using both conventional on the ground sampling and remote sensing techniques. The use of remote sensing techniques, though not conclusive over the time it was carried out, did show the potential for future investigation of this type. In this study the deterioration of the two principal taxa, paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and mountain paper birch (Betula cordifolia Regel), were examined in terms of crown dieback and compared. These two taxa occur as separate stands or as a mixture in the birch plots. Comparisons of mortality responses of the two birch taxa together with results of leaf browning on transplanted young clones of the two taxa indicated a significantly (p < 0.001) greater sensitivity of B. cordifolia, whereas no significant differences between the taxa exist for percentage of trees with dieback. The potential role of sensitive indicators, such as B. cordifolia, as biomonitors of atmospheric change in an ecotonal situation like the Fundy coast is important, as these may give us the first indications of vegetation response to a changing chemical and physical environment.																	0045-5067					APR	1996	26	4					682	688		10.1139/x26-078								WOS:A1996UH46800021						
J	Ibsen, ML; Brunsden, D				Ibsen, ML; Brunsden, D			The nature, use and problems of historical archives for the temporal occurrence of landslides, with specific reference to the south coast of Britain, Ventnor, Isle of Wight	GEOMORPHOLOGY					3rd International Geomorphology Conference	AUG 23-28, 1993	MCMASTER UNIV, HAMILTON, CANADA	Int Assoc Geomorphologists	MCMASTER UNIV			The purpose of this paper is to describe and evaluate the nature of the European historical archives which are suitable for the assessment of the temporal occurrence and forecasting within landslides studies, using the British south coast as an example. The paper is based upon the British contribution to the Environment programme EPOCH, 1991-1993. A primary requirement of a research programme on process occurrence is to determine the event frequencies on as many time and space scales as possible. Thus, the analysis of archives is, potentially, an essential preliminary to the study of the temporal occurrence of landslide events. The range of such data sources extends from isolated, fortuitously dated sites from the Quaternary assemblage, through inferred event impacts using dendrochronology or lichenometric time series to historical records of causal factors such as rainfall data and more recently, deliberately recorded packages of cumulative or continuous data. Most countries have extensive historical sources which may be of considerable value in establishing the characteristics of geomorphological processes. These include narrative in literature, prints and other artwork, terrestrial and aerial photographs, remote sensing series, newspapers, incidental statements and scientific journals and reports. There are numerous difficulties in accessing, extracting, organising, databasing and analysing such data because they are not usually collated for scientific use. Problems involve such incalculable errors as: the experience, training and conscientiousness of the observer; the editing and recording process; judging the validity of the data used and the haphazard nature of recorded events in time and space. Despite these difficulties, such data do yield a record which adds to the representative temporal sample at a level above some threshold reporting position. It therefore has potential for specific statistical analysis. An example of a reasonable temporal landslide record is the data base of the Ventnor complex on the Isle of Wight initially established in 1991 by Geomorphological Services Limited (GSL), now of Rendel Geotechnics, and supplemented by the collections of the first author. The record displays an increase in landslide events over the present century, due probably to increasing technology and awareness of hazard and the development of process geomorphology. However, the landslide record was subsequently correlated with the Ventnor precipitation series. This indicated that wet year sequences usually gave rise to significant landslide events. The increasing variability and number of rainfall events predicted by various climatic units, e.g. the Hadley Centre, may therefore indicate a fundamental increase in landslide events in the future.																	0169-555X					APR	1996	15	3-4					241	258		10.1016/0169-555X(95)00073-E								WOS:A1996UK81300006						
J	Sublette, MS; Young, GS				Sublette, MS; Young, GS			Warm-season effects of the Gulf Stream on mesoscale characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The meteorological regime off the coast of North Carolina exhibits little synoptic-scale baroclinity during the summer months. As a result, the large-scale atmospheric forcing in this region is frequently weak. Given this weak synoptic forcing, mesoscale boundary layer circulations are dominant. One such circulation develops in response to the sea surface temperature discontinuity between the Gulf Stream and the relatively cooler water of the Continental Shelf. When synoptic conditions are favorable, differences in surface fluxes of heat and moisture across this discontinuity cause the development of an ageostrophic solenoidal circulation and the creation of an atmospheric boundary layer convergence zone. This resulting frontal zone, or Gulf Stream atmospheric front (GSAF), is a commonly observed feature in this region during the warm season. Simulations using The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale model are combined with data gathered from the High-Resolution Remote Sensing Experiment to study the effects of the Gulf Stream on mesoscale circulations in the warm-season marine atmospheric boundary layer. Particular attention was given to determining whether a model with resolution and physics similar to those of operational mesoscale forecast models can adequately predict this phenomenon. Although limitations in the horizontal and vertical resolution of the model prevent detailed reproduction of the meso-gamma-scale structure of the GSAF, the model does produce a significant meso-beta boundary layer convergence zone in response to the local SST maximum associated with the Gulf Stream. The magnitude of the modeled response is primarily a function of air-sea temperature difference, the local wind vector, and the depth of the boundary layer.																	0027-0644					APR	1996	124	4					653	667										WOS:A1996UG73900007						
J	Hudak, DR; Stewart, RE; Thomson, AD; List, R				Hudak, DR; Stewart, RE; Thomson, AD; List, R			Warm frontal structure in association with a rapidly deepening extratropical cyclone	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The detailed characteristics of a CASP II warm frontal passage are presented in this article. This storm, Intensive Operating Period (IOP) 13 (February 26-27, 1992), was observed in detail with an array of diverse instruments. It has the advantage over earlier freezing precipitation studies of having simultaneous, in situ and remote sensing measurements by aircraft and ground-based Doppler radar. The associated precipitation was in the form of banded structures parallel to the front. Within these bands were embedded precipitation cores, some parallel to the band, some perpendicular. The warm front itself was characterized by major perturbations in its kinematic and thermodynamic features. The cores oriented parallel to the front were the result of embedded convection generated, at least in part, by the irregularities in the frontal surface. The cores oriented perpendicular to the front were closely associated with the 0 degrees C isotherm on the underside of the frontal inversion. Precipitation phase changes played a significant role in the occurrence of wide near 0 degrees C regions, both vertically and horizontally These regions had a profound influence on the observed precipitation types and led to complex precipitation-thermodynamic-dynamic interactions. Instabilities produced by these interactions are seen in wave-like features observed by the Doppler radar in these regions, both parallel and perpendicular to the frontal zone.																	0705-5900					MAR	1996	34	1					103	132		10.1080/07055900.1996.9649559								WOS:A1996VC18500006						
J	Bromwich, DH; Liu, Z				Bromwich, DH; Liu, Z			An observational study of the katabatic wind confluence zone near Siple Coast, West Antarctica	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A month-long field program to study the springtime katabatic wind confluence zone (where katabatic winds converge) has been carried out near Siple Coast, West Antarctica. Based on previous observations and numerical studies, two surface camps, Upstream B (83.5 degrees S, 136.1 degrees W) and South Camp (84.5 degrees S, 134.3 degrees W), were established. Ground-based remote sensing equipment(sodar and RASS), along with conventional observations, were used. Combining the analyses of surface observations and wind and temperature profiles at the above camps, the following picture for the cross-sectional structure of the confluence zone emerges. A relatively cold katabatic airflow, which probably comes from East Antarctica, occupies the layer between the surface and roughly 500 m AGL. Low-level jets are present below 200 m AGL and are stronger near the Transantarctic Mountains. Diurnal variation is present in this cold drainage flow and decreases toward the Transantarctic Mountains. Weak-inversion-layer tops are found near 500 m AGL, which is roughly equal to the depth of the cold katabatic Bow. The warmer West Antarctic katabatic airflow overlies the cold drainage Bow from East Antarctica and has a depth of approximately 1000 m at Upstream B and more than 1500 m at South Camp; this is caused by blocking of the converging West Antarctic airflow by the Transantarctic Mountains. This warm flow originates near the surface far upslope in the vicinity of Byrd Station (80 degrees S, 120 degrees W). A baroclinic zone, formed where the two drainage flows are horizontally adjacent, appears to become unstable with some frequency to generate mesoscale cyclones.

Three of them are fully equipped with a remote sensing system. This system, including a bispectral scanner system Daedalus AA 2000 and a multispectral scanner system Daedalus DS 1268, can make a quick and effective survey both of the shoreline and large areas offshore and process and interpret real time data. Environmental (oil pollution erosion, coastal assessment) and policing purposes (identification and appraisal of illegal releases, prevention and repression of unauthorized building) are supported by such surveys. Satellite platforms (ERS-1, ERS-2) can he utilized for surveillance duties, although, in the case of operational activities, a comparison with the data available from airborne remote sensing system must be made. The planning of such a programme cannot be carried out without a keen cost-benefit evaluation.

Three main parameters, i.e., moisture content and its salinity, salt content and water-table level are exhibiting themselves as different colours in the coloured images. The approach described herein is recommended to be applied along the Red Sea coasts and other similar areas in order to present a preliminary but precisely identification of sabkha environments utilizing remote sensing techniques.																	0143-1161					FEB	1996	17	3					527	536										WOS:A1996TX65900007

Landsat Thematic Mapper and Spot XS satellite images were processed to create pasture growth status maps describing timbered and cleared areas, and priority areas for phosphorus fertiliser application. A digital elevation model was used to describe slope and aspect, and as a basis for interpolation of monthly surfaces of rainfall, temperature, radiation and evaporation from the Australian Climate Surfaces. These data were combined with a simple growth index model to create production surfaces for tropical, subtropical and temperature pasture types. The property was classified into zones defined by the seasonal growth patterns of the 3 pasture classes. The database was used to identify potential areas for further pasture improvement by a series of logical rules and map overlays to define pasture suitability for currently timbered areas with a slope of less than 20 degrees. The northern section of the property with the highest rainfall, best suitability for temperate pasture and good road access was chosen for land capability and fauna impact studies on the basis of this analysis. The study provides an example of the application of spatial data to practical management issues in pastoral agriculture.

Massive deforestation has taken place, mainly in the last 20 years, 79% of unprotected forests have been eliminated on the 100 X 100 km study area. Deforestation is also beginning to encroach on protected areas. Forest fragments are mainly found close to the deforestation front. In areas which were first deforested, forest fragments are very scarce and are restricted to less productive soils; they are often severely degraded. Young secondary forests develop on abandoned fields, but primary forest regeneration seems unlikely in light of the distance from seed sources and the increase in population pressure. Conservation initiatives in this zone of high biodiversity should focus on protected areas, taking into account short and long term benefits for the local population.																	0960-3115					JAN	1996	5	1					37	53		10.1007/BF00056291								WOS:A1996TW70400003						
J	Frihy, OE				Frihy, OE			Some proposals for coastal management of the Nile delta coast	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Although the 260 km coastline of the Nile delta is undergoing regional retreat, there are a number of localities experiencing accretion. Recent studies on the Nile delta coast have confirmed that significant erosion has affected approximately half of the coastline, with the greatest effects being adjacent to the Rosetta and Damietta promontories. Significant erosion has also occurred along the central bulge of the delta coast at Burullus. On the whole, the eroded sand is carried along the shore eastward, or locally to the west, migrating from the Nile promontories. The sand is then deposited in areas of beach accretion within the saddles or embayments between these promontories. Recognition of long-term trends of shoreline changes along the delta coast provides a basis for proposing a coastal management scheme for new resort benches. In this study, five presently unused accretionary coastal stretches have been identified for development possibilities to serve the northern delta region. Evaluation of these coasts was based on rates of annual coastline encroachment, littoral drift and morphodynamic status, all of which would provide information on management of these beaches. A database management system, using remote sensing and conventional field survey methods in combination with a geographical information system (GIS) tool, is proposed for implementing an integrated coastal zone management plan for multiple uses of the Nile delta coastal zone, and the identified unused benches in particular This system would help in carrying out activities related to coastal and marine management, including holiday resort beach industry, tourism, marine recreation, fisheries, land reclamation, human settlement and planning infrastructures.

J	Barale, V; Folving, S				Barale, V; Folving, S			Remote sensing of coastal interactions in the Mediterranean region	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The coastal regions of the Mediterranean are the site of countless economic and recreational activities, but are threatened by dramatic dangers of misuse and pollution. Adequate tools are needed to study the environmental pressure imposed on these regions by the conflicting needs of protecting their ecological balance and exploiting their natural resources. Coastal ecosystems are very sensitive to the environmental impact of land use in watersheds, along the coast and further inland, of fluvial discharges, and of marine processes. Weathering, erosion, or waste disposal on land, as well as other activities at sea, such as shipping, dumping or oil extraction, are but a few of the factors which would require that the coastal areas be suitably monitored. Modern techniques of environmental assessment call for the rise of integrated observation systems. The collection of data with traditional coastal installations remains an important component of such research. However, the large space scales and short time scales of many near-coastal and/or marine processes require the use of (orbital) remote sensors. In particular, optical sensors, operating in the visible/infrared spectral region, have shown their usefulness for providing novel information on physical, gee-chemical and biological processes of the coastal area. Optical remote sensing of the coastal zone finds applications in studies of land use, surface cover, hydrology and coastal ecology at large; of water quality and sediment transport, coastal runoff and circulation, or dynamical processes (looking, e.g., at the evolution of pigment and/or temperature patterns, and their distribution as related to plankton dynamics, currents or river plumes); as well as in those of energy transfer, carbon cycling and climatology in general. Selected applications of optical observation techniques in the Mediterranean region, conducted in the framework of international demonstration programmes (i.e. the Ocean Colour European Archive Network, OCEAN, Project), provide examples of the remote sensing potential in the field of integrated coastal/marine environmental management.

The satellite data is in the form of sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite using an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor. The fishery data is the catch of southern bluefin tuna and albacore for the Japanese longline tuna fishery off the Tasmanian coast. The winter fishing seasons for May to July 1991 and 1992 are considered in detail. The study focuses on the relationship between southern bluefin tuna and albacore and the occurrence of warm core eddies and thermal fronts. In 1991 a persistent mesoscale eddy was observed using the NOAA-11/AVHRR infrared data. In 1992 there was no similar eddy structure but a strong thermal front occurred. Southern bluefin tuna and albacore catches tend to occur at the location of the eddy and thermal fronts. An algorithm that identifies the edges of thermal fronts proved to be a good predictor of the location of productive fishing areas.																	0214-8358					SEP-DEC	1995	59	3-4					445	454										WOS:A1995TG02900026						
J	AAS, E; SORENSEN, K				AAS, E; SORENSEN, K			FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF THE RELATION BETWEEN SATELLITE AND SEA RADIANCES IN COASTAL WATERS	APPLIED OPTICS												Estimates of the different contributions to the satellite radiance above the outer Oslofjord are presented. The contribution from the sea is of the order of 10% of the total signal, and the part due to reflection from the sea surface constitutes 10-20%. The presence of land may increase the satellite radiance up to 4-9%, but such effects, which are probably reduced to 1/e at a distance of 1 km from the coast, cannot be detected in the present measurements. In situ observations of the marine radiance are corrected for shadings by ship and instrument and for varying solar altitude. The average correction for the self-shading effect of the marine instrument becomes 30-50% in these waters. The linear relations between satellite and sea radiances are determined with correlation coefficients of better than 0.95. The observed minimum value of the satellite radiance (or darkest pixel) is not a satisfactory approximation for the atmospheric correction. It is concluded that, in coastal waters and at the present stage, satellite observations have to be combined with held measurements to obtain reliable results.

Measurements of the solar transmission coefficient taken during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) were used in a radiative transfer algorithm to produce values of albedo, absorption, and optical depth. A microwave radiometer provided measurements of the liquid water path (LWP). For a given LWP, the ASTEX optical depths averaged a factor of 2 smaller than the optical depths observed during the marine stratocumulus phase of the First International Cloud Climatology Program Regional Experiment (FIRE) at San Nicolas Island, off the coast of southern California. The variability of boundary-layer aerosol concentrations measured during ASTEX is sufficient to produce a factor of 2 change in optical depth. Further evidence suggests that the cloud droplet effective radius was nearly a factor of 2 larger during ASTEX than during FIRE.																	0022-4928					AUG 15	1995	52	16					2827	2838		10.1175/1520-0469(1995)052<2827:SBRSOM>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1995RN65500011						
J	KUNTE, PD				KUNTE, PD			ON SOME ASPECTS OF BARRIER ISLANDS OF THE WEST-COAST, INDIA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Three barrier island systems, namely, Maniyet barrier island system, Vypin-Cochin barrier island system, and Alleppey barrier island system situated along the west coast of India are located, mapped and studied using remote sensing data, topographic maps, and naval hydrographic charts. Efforts are made to gather geomorphic evidences which are helpful in understanding possible stages of formation of barrier islands. Based on transgressional and regressional nature of the coast, physiography of barrier islands, and the shoreline changes, it has been concluded that the evolution of the barrier islands has taken place in three prominent stages: (1) Initial emergence of the land during which paleo beach ridges were formed, (repressional phase), (2) subsequent submergence of the land, which is characterized by engulfment of beach ridges (transgressional phase), and (3) emergence of the coast during which breaching (regression phase) of ridges and barrier island formation took place.																	0749-0208					SPR	1995	11	2					508	515										WOS:A1995QW95500015

AN OVERVIEW	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The complex combination of synoptic- and mesoscale interactions, topographic influences, and large population densities poses a multitude of challenging problems to winter weather forecasters throughout the eastern United States. Over the years, much has been learned about the structure, evolution, and attendant precipitation within winter storms. As a result, numerous operational procedures, forecast applications, and objective techniques have been developed at National Weather Service offices to assess the potential for hazardous winter weather. An overview of the challenge of forecasting winter weather in the eastern United States is presented, including a historical review of several legendary winter storms, from the Blizzard of 1888 to the Halloween Nor'easter of 1991. The synoptic-scale features associated with East Coast winter storms are described. The mesoscale nature of many eastern winter weather events is illustrated through an examination of the Veterans' Day Snowstorm of 11 November 1987, and the Long Island Snowstorm of 13 December 1988. The development of applied forecast techniques and the potential for new remote sensing technologies (e.g., Doppler weather radar and wind profilers) and mesoscale models to improve operational forecasts of winter weather hazards are also discussed, Companion papers focus on cyclogenesis, terrain-related winter weather forecast considerations in the Southeast, and lake effect snow forecasting.																	0882-8156					MAR	1995	10	1					5	20		10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0005:WWFTTE>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1995QU38500002

The DMS(a) instrument is fully automated, providing improved precision, and processes up to four samples per hour. Over most of the cruise track, which followed the 19 degrees S parallel between Brazil and Africa, DMS(w), was significantly correlated to climatologically averaged chlorophyll concentrations obtained from coastal zone color scanner data, suggesting that remote sensing may be useful for estimating seawater DMS levels at least in some ocean regions. The cruise track proceeded from waters of low productivity (off the coast of Brazil and in the subtropical gyre) to higher productivity (the Benguela Current and the upwelling region off Namibia and Angola); meteorological conditions were steady with consistent easterly winds. DMS values for air and water were low (approximate to 50 ppt and 1-2 nmol L(-1), respectively) in the areas of low productivity and increased simultaneously (approximate to 100-300 ppt and 3-15 nmol L(-1)) as productivity increased. DMS sea-to-air fluxes (average 7.3 mu mol m-2 d(-1)) were calculated based on different parameterizations; for the study region the differences between the results obtained from the different models were minor. DMS(a) was strongly correlated to its emission flux from the sea surface as estimated from DMS(w) and meteorological parameters. This suggests that the air/sea transfer parameterizations used are suitable for providing estimates of DMS flux from the oceans.

J	COCH, NK				COCH, NK			GEOLOGIC EFFECTS OF HURRICANES	GEOMORPHOLOGY					25th Binghamton Symposium in Geomorphology	SEP 24-25, 1994	SUNY, BINGHAMTON, NY		SUNY			Hurricanes are intense low pressure systems of tropical origin. Hurricane damage results from storm surge, wind, and inland flooding from heavy rainfall. Field observations and remote sensing of recent major hurricanes such as Hugo (1989), Andrew (1992) and Iniki (1992) are providing new insights into the mechanisms producing damage in these major storms. Velocities associated with hurricanes include the counterclockwise vortex winds flowing around the eye and the much slower regional winds that steer the hurricane and move it forward. Vectorial addition of these two winds on the right side of the storm gives a higher effective wind speed than on the left side. Coast-parallel hurricane tracks keep the weaker left side of the storm against the coast, whereas coast-normal tracks produce a wide swath of destruction as the more powerful right side of the storm cuts a swath of destruction hundreds of kilometers inland. Storm surge is a function of the wind speed, central pressure, shelf slope, shoreline configuration, and anthropogenic alterations to the shoreline. Maximum surge heights are not under the eye of the hurricane, where the pressure is lowest, but on the right side of the eye at the radius of maximum winds, where the winds are strongest. Flood surge occurs as the hurricane approaches land and drives coastal waters, and superimposed waves, across the shore. Ebb surge occurs when impounded surface water flows seaward as the storm moves inland. Flood and ebb surge damage have been greatly increased in recent hurricanes as a result of anthropogenic changes along the shoreline. Hurricane wind damage occurs on three scales - megascale, mesoscale and microscale. Local wind damage is a function of wind speed, exposure and structural resistance to velocity pressure, wind drag and flying debris. Localized extreme damage is caused by gusts that can locally exceed sustained winds by a factor of two in areas where there is strong convective activity. Geologic changes occurring in hurricanes include beach erosion, dune erosion, inlet formation from flood and ebb surge, landscape changes through tree destruction by wind and nearshore channeling and sedimentation resulting from ebb surge. Multi-decadal wet and dry cycles in West Africa seem to be associated with increases (wet periods) and decreases (dry periods) in the frequency of Atlantic Coast landfalling hurricanes. Coastal zone population and development has increased markedly in a time of low hurricane frequency in the 24 year dry cycle from 1970 to the present. However, no previous climatic cycle in this century has exceeded 26 years. We may be entering a multi-decadal cycle of greater hurricane activity, placing these highly urbanized shorelines in considerable danger.																	0169-555X					AUG	1994	10	1-4					37	63		10.1016/0169-555X(94)90007-8								WOS:A1994PE61700006

Approximately 3400 individual SST images have been generated from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Global Area Coverage data and resampled to form a coherent cloud-free data set. From the satellite data set an SST upwelling index defined as the zonal temperature difference has been derived as a function of latitude and time. Wind data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts have been used to determine a second upwelling index calculated as the fraction of the Ekman transport perpendicular to the coast. The two independent indices have been compared with previously published data of seasonal variability and have been examined for interannual variabilities. In general the two upwelling indices demonstrate the known seasonal variability which exists south of 20-degrees-N and north of 25-degrees-N and the almost permanent upwelling between 20-degrees-N and 25-degrees-N. Off Portugal and Cape Ghir, there are temporal shifts between the maximum winds and the maximum zonal temperature differences of 2 and 3 months, respectively, while at most other locations the indices are temporally well correlated. Interannual variabilities are greater where upwelling is seasonal compared to those regions where upwelling is dominant throughout the year. The strongest interannual variabilities are found south of 20-degrees-N where upwelling was particularly weak during the period from the end of 1982 to the beginning of 1984, coinciding with the exceptionally strong 1982/1983 El Nino in the Pacific Ocean.																	0148-0227					JUL 15	1994	99	C7					14197	14207		10.1029/94JC00814								WOS:A1994NY03700011

False color composites generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and SPOT image data, digital elevation models derived from stereophotogrammetric analysis of SPOT data, and field observations document that a approximately 10-km-wide swath inland from the coast is covered in many places with coalescing alluvial fans of Quaternary age. Wadis cutting through the fans exhibit several pairs of fluvial terraces, and wadi walls expose alluvium interbedded with coralline limestone deposits. three distinct coral terrace are evident along the coastline. Climatic, eustatic, and tectonic uplift controls on the overall system were simulated using a cellular automata algorithm with die following characteristics: (1) uplift as a function of position and time, as defined by the elevations and ages of corals; (2) climatic variations driven by insolation changes associated with Milankovitch cycles; (3) sea level fluctuations based on U/rh ages of coral terraces and eustatic data; and (4) parameterized fluvial erosion and deposition. Results imply that the fans and coralline limestones were generated in a setting in which the tectonic uplift rate decreased over the Quaternary to negligible values at present. Coralline limestones formed during eustatic highstands when alluvium was trapped upstream and wadis filled with debris. During lowstands, wadis cut into sedimentary deposits; coupled with continuing uplift, fans were dissected, leaving remnant surfaces, and wadirelated terraces were generated by down cutting. Only landforms from the past three to four eustatic sea level cycles (i.e., approximately 300 to 400 kyr) are likely to have survived erosion and deposition associated with fluvial processes.

Two scenes from different dates were processed using a conventional maximum likelihood classifier and a fully constrained linear mixture model. The Landsat TM data was atmospherically and radiometrically corrected to allow meaningful comparison to be made between the scenes. The data were geometrically rectified and incorporated into a coastal monitoring Geographical Information System (GIS) along with information acquired from previous ground based surveys. The relative accuracy of two mapping procedures was assessed by cross tabulating the satellite imagery with ground based surveys. The results show that both classification techniques adequately delimit over 90% of the intertidal vegetation. However, both methods had difficulty in discriminating between the Pioneer zone vegetation and intertidal sediments. Linear unmixing appeared to be the most accurate method for mapping pioneer zone vegetation and this should form the basis of further research.

J	WHITEHOUSE, BG; LANDERS, PM				WHITEHOUSE, BG; LANDERS, PM			TRANSFERRING EARTH OBSERVATION IMAGERY TO THE COASTAL ZONE VIA CELLULAR TELEPHONY	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Systems designed to provide the marine user with operational environmental information require a means to communicate data to sea in near-real time. The transfer of data (images) obtained by environmental remote sensing satellites is complicated by the raster-based structure of the corresponding data files and by their relatively large size. Analysis of marine mobile communications technologies indicates that the least expensive for this application is cellular telephony. Experiments were conducted off the coast of eastern Canada to determine the usefulness of cellular telephony for transferring remote sensing imagery to the coastal zone. They included sea surface temperature (SST) images derived from NOAA AVHRR data and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained by ERS-1. For comparison, simple ASCII text files also were transferred. Results demonstrate that cellular telephony can satisfy the technical, time, and cost requirements of coastal operational remote sensing applications. By incorporating data compression techniques, SST images were transmitted at a maximum rate of 12.2 kbps (kilobits per second). Processed SAR images were transmitted at significantly lower rates. Transmissions up to 50 km from shore were completed successfully. Comparison of these results with those obtained in other regions indicate that processed SST images have been transmitted at rates of 21 kbps and to distances as great as 150 km from shore. Investigation of such variances indicate transmission speed is influenced by the extent to which the image has been processed prior to transmission and by the use of compression techniques. Transmission distance varies from location to location, largely due to variances in regional atmospheric effects and quality of shipboard installations.																	0025-3324					SUM	1994	28	2					78	81										WOS:A1994PQ19700011						
J	DAUZAT, J				DAUZAT, J			RADIATIVE-TRANSFER SIMULATION ON COMPUTER-MODELS OF ELAEIS-GUINEENSIS	OLEAGINEUX												Radiative transfers within oil palm stands can be studied using computer models of trees. The morphological data required for generating computer models were measured on a set of palms in Ivory Coast as described in R. Lecoustre et al. (1993). The CIRAD-AMAP software was then used to reconstitute a scene of 11 palms. Different numerical models were subsequently used to simulate the interception and the scattering of light within the scene. In situ radiative measurements were carried out in the observed stand: incident radiation (direct and diffuse) and radiation transmitted to soil level. The ''Shadow'' model was used to simulate the pattern of transmitted radiation at soil level. Despite this model does not thoroughly account for scattering by the canopy. the light transmission rates simulated by this model. were quite close to the observed ones. This model is therefore of particular interest for intercropping management. The ''Transrad'' model simulates multiple scattering of light and yields as output a complete radiative balance of the canopy. The simulations showed that the lower leaves (up to rank 34) still absorb high levels of photosynthetically active radiation. Last, the directional reflectance of the stand was simulated with a ray-tracing model. Because the calculations lay on realistic palm models, acute simulations are performed. Such simulations could be of great help for remote sensing studies. Three dimensional computer mock-ups of palms enable detailed and accurate simulations of radiative transfers using numerical models. Such an approach open a wide field of applications: selection of optimal tree density, management of leaf pruning, assessment of intercropping possibilities, remote sensing interpretation... Further work is to be carried on for different palm stands, at different ages and with different varieties.																	0030-2082					MAR	1994	49	3					81	90										WOS:A1994NL50000001

This effort was part of a joint project between NASA and the University of Puerto Rico to develop techniques to monitor the water quality of a Caribbean coastal zone. This paper presents the methods and algorithms developed to map and analyze short term changes in the source and spatial distribution of SPM in Mayaguez Bay by using remotely sensed data acquired by the Calibrated Airborne Multispectral Scanner (CAMS). A PC-based data acquisition system was developed to record continuous ship measurements of select in- water variables. Spectral reflectances derived from CAMS red and near-IR data were corrected for atmospheric effects and then used to generate maps of SPM. These maps displayed SPM plumes associated with the mouths of the bay's three river systems. Significant day-to-day differences in the spatial characteristics were observed, suggesting that changes in river discharge occurred. However, an analysis of estimated river discharge, sediment yield, local wind field, and thermal river plume indicates that observed sediment plumes result primarily from wind-driven resuspension events.																	0043-1370					MAR-APR	1994	30	2					271	282										WOS:A1994NJ81900010

One component of the LIMEX'89 program was the study of ocean waves penetrating the marginal ice zone. In this paper, we consider nearly coincidental observations of waves in ice by airborne SAR and wave-induced ice motion measurements. We explain the wave patterns observed in the SAR imagery, and the corresponding SAR image spectra, in terms of SAR wave imaging models. These include the well-known tilt cross-section modulation, linear, quasi-linear, and nonlinear velocity bunching forward mapping models (FMMs), and the assertion that the concept of coherence time limitation applies differently to the cases of waves in ice and open water. We modify the concept of the scene coherence time to include two parts: first, a decorrelation time deduced from the inherent azimuth cutoff in the nonlinear velocity bunching FMM; and second, the intrinsic scene coherence time which is a measure of the time scale over which an open water Bragg scattering patch retains its phase structure. Either of these coherence time scales could dominate the SAR image formation process, depending upon the environmental conditions (the wave spectrum and the wind speed, for example). These two coherence time scales are independently estimated based upon a quasi-linear velocity bunching FMM applied to some of the LIMEX'89 observations. Observed SAR image spectra and forward mapped ice motion package spectra are favorably compared.																	0148-0227					SEP 15	1993	98	C9					16411	16425		10.1029/93JC00914								WOS:A1993LX76400010

Declines in water quality related to turbidity from coastal development, ocean discharges, and non-point source runoff have caused reductions in the areal extent of these kelp beds. Historically the kelp beds have been monitored by a variety of methods including small format infrared and color photography. New digital remote sensing instruments combined with geographical information system (GIS) databases offer an efficient method for collecting and analyzing data on changes in kelp bed size and location. SPOT satellite imagery has been found to provide adequate resolution for mapping the larger beds of giant kelp along the California coast. Beds smaller than 10 ha are not resolved well with SPOT imagery and need to be mapped with a resolution greater than the 20 m pixel size provided by the SPOT multispectral imagery. Imagery from a prototype of the Positive Systems ADAR system, an airplane mounted multispectral video sensor, provided a spatial resolution of 2.3 m in 4 spectral bands. ADAR imagery taken on 2 October 1991 of the San Onofre Kelp Bed in northern San Diego County showed 39% more kelp than small format color infrared photography made during the same time period.																	0018-8158					JUN 18	1993	261						307	312										WOS:A1993LR16800037						
J	KUNTE, PD; WAGLE, BG				KUNTE, PD; WAGLE, BG			REMOTE-SENSING APPROACH TO DETERMINE NET SHORE DRIFT DIRECTION - A CASE-STUDY ALONG THE CENTRAL EAST-COAST OF INDIA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Thematic Mapper imageries of Landsat 5 are visually interpreted to determine long-term sediment transport direction also called net shore drift direction along central east coast of India. Two approaches are adopted while utilizing the remote sensing data for this purpose. Net shore drift direction is determined firstly by studying various coastal landform indicators and secondly by studying offshore turbidity distribution patterns. The results of both the approaches are compared and presented here. Landform indicators study suggests that shore drift direction is towards the southwest direction during northeast monsoon and towards northeast direction during southwest monsoon period. From offshore turbidity pattern, shore drift direction is determined as towards the southwest. Based on these studies and other related evidence, it is concluded that net shore drift direction is towards south-southwest. The present study demonstrates the capability of satellite remote sensing, which provides periodic, integrated and synoptic views, for determining net shore drift direction correctly, economically, and quickly.																	0749-0208					SUM	1993	9	3					663	672										WOS:A1993LK50300005

Satellite based observations have been found to provide valuable inferences about the sediment levels of oceanic waters. The West coast of India is highly prone to erosion especially during the monsoon season due to the wave action associated with the south westerly currents. The heavy run-off from west flowing rivers in the peninsular region also contribute to the high level sedimentation in the offshore regions. In the present study, the multidate data from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-IA has been utilised to analyse the sedimentation levels and dispersal patterns for the coastal region of Mangalore in Southern India. Digital techniques have been employed to bring out the variations in the sedimentation patterns (upto 14 levels) for the pre and post- monsoon seasons. The available insitu observations on wind, waves and tides have been used to understand the seasonal dispersal characteristics. The study has indicated high level of sedimentation in the post-monsoon period, revealing highly erosion prone nature of the coast. A semi- quantification of the sedimentation has also been attempted through correlation with sea truth data.																	0273-1177					MAY	1993	13	5					75	78		10.1016/0273-1177(93)90530-O								WOS:A1993KY21200009

Unstable filamentary features (''filaments'' herein) are observed on the front, having length scales comparable to that of the front itself, and growing and decaying on a timescale of a few days. The process of initiation of the filaments is observed to be variable, although as these features develop, their appearances tend to converge. All the filaments are eventually advected onto, and subsumed within the Algerian coastal current. It is suggested that variations in the flow in the Eastern Alboran Gyre are responsible for the initiation of the filaments, and that the interaction of the same gyral flow with the lateral topography of the southern Spanish coast is responsible for one mode of initiation as well as for other features associated with the front: A second mode of initiation appears to be associated with a deformation of the frontal interface unconnected with the coastal topography. The flow regime in the Algerian Basin close to the front appears to play a role in the distortion and suppression of the filaments. Measurements of the wavelengths, growth rates and phase speeds of the filaments are presented, and these indicate that, in general, their growth rate is greater than their rate of decay, and that their phase speeds tend to be greater during the diminution phase than during the growth phase. Comparisons of these parameters with those derived from a theoretical model of an isolated surface front are generally favourable.																	0992-7689					MAY	1993	11	5					419	430										WOS:A1993LG84300008

This included the integration of remote sensing, geophysical data sets, digital elevation data and geological field observations. Digital image processing techniques have been applied to the satellite images, raster aeromagnetic and gravity, and digital elevation data. The Trollfjord-Komagelv Fault Zone divides the Varanger Peninsula into two structurally distinct regions, one dominated by an allochthonous basin to the north, and an autochthonous/parautochthonous basin to the south; both contain metasedimentary rocks of Late Precambrian to Early Cambrian age. The fault zone is a major regional strike-slip fault zone which can be traced to the northwest into offshore basins in the southwestern Barents Sea; and to the south-east along the northern coast of the Kola Peninsula. This study has shown that the Trollfjord-Komagelv Fault Zone is probably part of a regional NW-SE to WNW-ESE lineament system which is well defined in the Archaean to Proterozoic crystalline rocks to the south of the Varanger Peninsula. Gravity gradients and magnetic anomalies associated with these lineaments indicate that they are deep-seated fractures; and in most places they are expressed as topographic lineaments. The kinematic analyses of conjugate shear fractures and fault-slip data suggest that the region has experienced multiple horizontal/subhorizontal compressional stress fields with different orientations, the NW-SE and NE-SW being most significant, in time and space. Preliminary observations also suggest a shift of the sigma1 from horizontal/subhorizontal to vertical/subvertical with time. The occurrences of these multiple tectonic events indicate that the lineaments are composite shear zones and tensional fractures which were probably affected by repeated movements of varying sense in response to variations in the regional stress fields.																	0143-1161					MAR 20	1993	14	5					979	1003		10.1080/01431169308904390								WOS:A1993LA88500012

This 12 channel visible-infrared scanning spectrometer is flown on NASA's ER-2 aircraft, collecting 100 m resolution data over a 37 km swath from an altitude of 20 km. Time series charts of water temperature and suspended sediment content record the rapid (days) response of these shallow coastal waters to the cold front system of March 30-April 1, 1989. The river discharge sediment plumes stream down wind from the coast, remaining as coherent discrete water masses for up to 100 km. Detectable temperature gradients evolve rapidly in the estuarine waters in response to changing atmospheric conditions, with lowest temperatures developing in shallowest regions. Water level setup and setdown created by surface winds and barometric pressure strongly affect the exchange of river, estuarine and Gulf water. Behavior of the turbid river and estuarine discharge plumes is important as they serve as the source for new sediment deposits along the coastline. The utility of time series from high resolution, multispectral imagery in coastal environmental research, resource management, and pollution control is clear from this short term, multimission coverage.

This has been documented in a number of unpredicted events along the coast of Norway, such os storm surges, harmful algal blooms, and oil spills. Systematic integration of remote sensing observations, field observations, and numerical model results is critical for such improvement. We will demonstrate this by presenting examples of (1) model validation by spaceborne infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing observations; and (2) water quality monitoring and simulation using airborne spectrometry and models. High resolution, coupled physical-chemical-biological models, as well as implementation of data assimilation schemes, are needed before a dedicated system for monitoring and forecasting of the coastal environment can become fully operational.																	0099-1112					MAR	1993	59	3					351	361										WOS:A1993LC77500007

The radar deployment took place along the coast of northeast England during August and early September 1988 in parallel with extensive ship based CTD density and ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) measurements which provided data in the vertical plane to complement those of the HF radar. We describe two main results. Firstly, during a spring-tide period of strengthening inshore density gradients, an along-front jet with speeds of up to 14 cm s-1 was detected in the long term HF radar residual field. The location and spatial form of this jet correspond with estimates of geostrophic currents derived from the measured density field. Secondly, a transverse ''double-sided'' surface flow convergence centred close to the frontal boundary and of net magnitude 4 cm s-1 accompanied the large along-front jet. Such a weaker cross-frontal component has been anticipated on theoretical grounds but never previously observed in this detailed fashion. The experiment underlines the power of a synergistic approach, based on HF remote sensing radar and ADCP, for the study of frontal circulation in coastal zones.

Data on attenuation of light and fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sea water were collected with a spectral transmissiometer and a submersible fluorometer within a depth range of 0-250 m at several stations. More than fifty-fold variations of fluorescence intensity over space and time were due to the combined action of different sources of DOM in the straits. The surface maximum of fluorescing DOM, related to river outflow, was spreading from Oslo fjord to the central Skagerrak in late spring. This maximum may be ecologically important because it diminishes shortwave PAR. In the autumn the brightest DOM fluorescence was found in the Kattegat and along the Norwegian coast in accordance with earlier studies. The local minima of DOM fluorescence are associated with the Jutland current. Both the instability of the current and a ten-fold difference in DOM content between deep layers of the Skagerrak and Kattegat resulted in strong synoptic variability of fluorescence in the transitional area between the straits. Seasonal and synoptic variabilities of ''yellow substance'' were minimal in the southern Kattegat. The vertical gradients of DOM fluorescence were mostly negative at the depth of the thermocline of the open Skagerrak in spring, reaching values of 40-50 % m-1. Fine structure and complex shape were inherent to fluorescence profiles from areas of intensive water mixing. DOM fluorescence closely covaried with attenuation of UV light: the correlation coefficient was + 0.9 for wavelength w <= 350 nm regardless of season. The inverse dependence between wavelength derivative and magnitude of UV attenuation in the straits did not change with season. DOM fluorescence and water salinity were negatively correlated at depths of 25-50 m but they varied independently in the upper 10 m. No significant correlation between fluorescence and nitrates has been found. Estimates of correlation with phosphates ranged from 0.7 to 0.8. In general, the changes of fluorescence were due to variations of DOM content in sea water but not to variability of DOM composition or state. The properties of DOM fluorescence in the Skagerrak-Kattegat area make it a useful natural tracer of water movements suitable for active remote sensing with airborne lidar.

Background information on the areal extent and status of these mangroves is limited and makes their protection and management difficult. A model study has been carried out on the Mida Creek mangroves based on a double sampling approach starting with SPOT multispectral satellite imagery followed by ground checks to provide information on species composition, density and distribution of mangroves. The utilization of mangroves and uses around and within the mangroves were determined. During this study, seven mangrove species were identified in Mida Creek, namely: Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba, Xylocarpus granatum and Lumnitzera racemosa. This report briefly outlines the present utilisation of mangrove species. It is recommended that a multidisciplinary management plan be developed in order to conserve and manage the mangroves of Kenya on a sustainable yield basis.																	0018-8158					NOV 20	1992	247	1-3					29	36		10.1007/BF00008202								WOS:A1992KJ25300005

Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to develop, manipulate, and synthesize model input including land cover, digital elevation data, and site characteristics data. The SLAMM3 model evaluated the input data to predict responses of coastal wetlands and lowlands to inundation and erosion by sea level rise, and determined transfers from one habitat to another on a cell-by-cell basis. Significant changes were predicted from different scenarios of sea level rise: 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.25 m. The simulations indicated that 31.9 percent and 40.0 percent of wetlands within the study area would be lost with a 1.0 m and 1.25 m sea level rise, respectively, while 6.5 percent would be lost with 0.5 m rise.																	0099-1112					NOV	1992	58	11					1579	1586										WOS:A1992JV67200006

These theories [2], [4]-[6] have been developed to explain the SAR signal modulation in relationship with small variations of water roughness induced by internal wave or current or wind field variations. Analysis of the RAREM data indicates, for the first time, that the marine surface life (here, tuna schools and marine mammals) and fishing activities (here, nets and fish traps) can generate a SAR signal modulation of comparable order of magnitude at the C-band ( 5.3 GHz). This has confirmed expectation for SAR, after the preliminary experiment made in X-band (9.6 GRz). From the RAREM data, the results of satellite simulations, considering ERS1 characteristics, are presented and show good promise for fishing activity surveys. This high sensitivity of SAR provides unique opportunities to obtain direct information on fishing and surface marine life activities in large survey areas. From that, we assume that the aerial SAR data and, under certain conditions, satellite SAR data may dramatically enhance and complement classical methods (statistics) used in fishery management, the essential goal in halieutics.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				SEP	1992	30	5					1085	1089		10.1109/36.175346								WOS:A1992JZ98400029

One aspect of these experimental programs was the observation of ocean waves penetrating into the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Based upon directional wavenumber spectra derived from SAR image data, the wave attenuation rate is estimated using SAR image spectra and compared with predictions from a model developed by Liu and Mollo-Christensen (1988). The wave and ice conditions were considerably different in LIMEX '87 and LIMEX '89. However, the model-data comparisons are very good for all ice conditions observed. Both the model and the SAR-derived wave attenuation rates show a characteristic roll-over at high wavenumbers. A model for the eddy viscosity is proposed, using dimensional analysis, as a simple function of ice roughness and wave-induced velocity. Eddy viscosities derived from SAR and wave buoy data for the wave attenuation rate show a trend that is consistent with the proposed model.																	0705-5900					JUN	1992	30	2					192	206		10.1080/07055900.1992.9649437								WOS:A1992MG39600003

The 1979-1981 southwest monsoon phytoplankton blooms in the northwest Arabian Sea peaked during August-September, extended from the Omani coast to about 65-degrees-E, and appeared to lag the development of open-sea upwelling by at least 1 month. In all 3 years the bloom was driven by spatially distinct upward nutrient fluxes to the euphotic zone forced by the physical processes of coastal upwelling and offshore Ekman pumping. Coastal upwelling was evident from May through September, yielded the most extreme concentrations of phytoplankton biomass, and along the Omani coast was limited in its impact on upper ocean biological variability to the continental shelf. Ekman pumping stimulated the development of a broad open-ocean component of the southwest monsoon phytoplankton bloom oceanward of the Omani shelf. Phytoplankton biomass on the Omani continental shelf was increased during both the early and late phases of the 1980 southwest monsoon due to stronger coastal upwelling under the most intense southwesterly winds of the four summers investigated. Diminished coastal upwelling during the early phase of the weak 1982 southwest monsoon resulted in a coastal bloom that reached a mean phytoplankton pigment concentration that was 28% of that seen in 1980. The lack of a strong regional northwestern Arabian Sea bloom in late summer 1982 is attributed to the development of persistent, shallow temperature stratification that rendered Ekman pumping less effective in driving upward nutrient fluxes.																	0148-0227					JAN 15	1992	97	C1					733	750		10.1029/91JC02225								WOS:A1992GZ12300012

For the most part, regional archaeological approaches have not been applied to this coastal zone, although regional site surveys have been carried out. Some of the sociocultural phenomena to be examined at the regional level are impacts of geomorphic changes on human occupations, ecological adaptations, settlement patterns, polities and their territories, demographic reconstructions, trade networks, human migrations, and culture history. Regional studies might be operationally organized under the sponsorship of NSF and related federal agencies, the State of Alaska and the Province of British Columbia, universities, Native corporations, or under a combined sponsorship of logistical support centers. Remote sensing and computer spatial technologies are available to facilitate regional studies, and such studies may be the most appropriate for coping with coastal erosion which is constantly destroying shoreline sites. The unique perspectives offered by regional approaches can provide new information about the relationships that once existed between ancient peoples of the southern Alaskan coastal zone.																	0066-6939						1992	29	2					192	204										WOS:A1992KA68800015

Model results for sea temperature and mixed layer depth were compared to measurements from ships, moored temperature sensors, and satellites. The main features of the variations in temperature and mixed layer depth can be explained by the local meteorological forcing and vertical mixing, together with a general southward flow in the study area. Superimposed are short-term variations which are obviously related to variable currents and the associated horizontal heat transport.

The phytoplankton bloom in the northwestern Arabian Sea peaked during August-September, extended from the Oman coast to about 65-degrees-E, and lagged the development of open-sea upwelling by at least 1 month. In total, the pigment distributions, hydrographic data, and model results all suggest that the bloom was driven by spatially distinct upward nutrient fluxes to the euphotic zone forced by the physical processes of coastal upwelling and offshore Ekman pumping. Coastal upwelling was evident from May through September, yielded the most extreme concentrations of phytoplankton biomass, and along the Arabian coast was limited to the continental shelf in the promotion of high concentrations of phytoplankton. Upward Ekman pumping to the northwest of the Somali Jet axis stimulated the development of a broad open-sea phytoplankton bloom oceanward of the Oman shelf. Vertical mixing during the 1979 southwest monsoon was apparently not a primary cause of the regional-scale phytoplankton bloom.																	0148-0227					NOV 15	1991	96	C11					20623	20642		10.1029/91JC01711								WOS:A1991GQ69300018

Results showed that black mangrove populations had a distinct red signature on the CIR video imagery that could be separated from other vegetation, soil, and water. Computer-based image analyses of the imagery showed that black mangrove populations could be quantified. Airborne video data provides a near-real-time tool for distinguishing and delineating black mangrove communities and should be useful for assessing damage to populations following catastrophic weather events such as freezes and tropical storms. Aerial surveys are also less costly to conduct with video than with photography.																	0749-0208					FAL	1991	7	4					1169	1173										WOS:A1991GF13000016

Maximum total heat fluxes occurred over the Gulf Stream northeast of Cape Hatteras where very cold, dry air encountered the Gulf Stream and where the wind speeds were very large. Maximum 6-h values for the total heat flux were as high as 2015 W m-2. The magnitude of the area-average heat flux in the MBL was influenced not only by the surface air and dewpoint temperatures and the surface wind speeds off the coast but also by the area covered by Gulf Stream water (sea surface temperature greater than 22-degrees-C). The heat flux distribution off the coast rapidly produced large horizontal temperature (approximately 10-degrees-C) and humidity (4 g kg-1) differences over distances on the order of 100 km. The large influx of moisture at the surface in response to the large latent heat fluxes caused the lifting condensation level relative to the surface to lower, influencing the production of offshore cloudiness and subsequently lowering the cloud-base height. Destablization of the (or increased instability in the) boundary layer also occurred over short distances offshore. The boundary-layer depth increased rapidly, the rate of increase being largest between the coast and the Gulf Stream.																	0027-0644	1520-0493				SEP	1991	119	9					2252	2279		10.1175/1520-0493(1991)119<2252:AOTEOT>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1991GF87600011						
J	POWELL, MD; DODGE, PP; BLACK, ML				POWELL, MD; DODGE, PP; BLACK, ML			THE LANDFALL OF HURRICANE HUGO IN THE CAROLINAS - SURFACE WIND DISTRIBUTION	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Hurricane Hugo struck Charleston, South Carolina, on 22 September 1989 as the most intense hurricane to affect the United States since Camille in 1969. The northeastern eyewall, which contained the maximum winds measured by reconnaissance aircraft shortly before landfall, moved inland over a relatively unpopulated area and there were few fatalities. However, no observations were available to document the surface wind distribution in this part of the storm as it continued inland. To improve specification of surface winds in Hugo, empirically adjusted aircraft winds were combined with coastal, offshore, and inland surface observations and were input to the Ooyama objective analysis algorithm. The wind analysis at landfall was then compared with subsequent analyses at 3 and 6 h after landfall. Reconstruction of the surface wind field at landfall suggests that the maximum (approximately 13 min mean) surface wind at the coast was 50 m s-1 in the Bulls Bay region, approximately 40 km northeast of Charleston. Surface roughness over land caused wind speeds to drop off rapidly just inland of the coast to only 50% of values measured by reconnaissance aircraft at the same location relative to the strom over water. Despite relatively rapid increases in the central sea-level pressure and decreases in the mean circulation as Hugo progressed inland, hurricane-force wind gusts extended Hugo's damage pattern well past Charlotte, North Carolina, approximately 330 km inland. Accurate determination of surface wind distribution in land-falling hurricanes is dependent upon the spatial density and quality of surface wind measurements and techniques to adjust reconnaissance flight-level winds to the surface. Improvements should allow forecasters to prepare more-accurate warnings and advisories and allow more-thorough documentation of poststorm effects. Empirical adjustments to reconnaissance aircraft measurements may replace surface data voids if the vertical profile of the horizontal wind is known. Expanded use of the airborne stepped-frequency microwave radiometer for remote sensing of ocean surface winds could fill data voids without relying upon empirical methods or models. A larger network of offshore, coastal, and inland surface platforms at standard (10-m) elevations with improved sampling strategies is envisioned for better resolution of hurricane wind fields. A rapid-response automatic station network, deployed at prearranged coastal locations by local universities with meteorology and/or wind engineering programs, could further supplement the fixed platform network and avoid the logistical problems posed by sending outside teams into threatened areas.				dodge, peter/A-9808-2017; Powell, Mark/I-4963-2013; Black, Michael/C-3250-2014	Powell, Mark/0000-0002-4890-8945; Black, Michael/0000-0001-9528-2888												0882-8156					SEP	1991	6	3					379	399		10.1175/1520-0434(1991)006<0379:TLOHHI>2.0.CO;2								WOS:A1991GG19200005

The widening of the shelf, its steplike deepening northeastward along the coast, and the presence of the Haltenbank generate intense eddy activity. Further, northeast, Atlantic Water is steered anticyclonically around the Haltenbank, and the Norwegian Coastal Current is squeezed toward the coast. The variability of the modeled and observed near-surface current is shown by ray-tracing calculations to be able to generate significant wave-current refraction. In addition to its importance for wave modeling and prediction, this fact opens possibilities for indirect surface current measurements from directional wave observations, particularly from synthetic aperture radar.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN 15	1991	96	C6					10487	10506		10.1029/91JC00299								WOS:A1991FT34300007

MARINE STRATOCUMULUS OBSERVATIONS	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A multispectral scanning radiometer has been used to obtain measurements of the reflection function of marine stratocumulus clouds at 0.75, 1.65 and 2.16-mu-m. These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the First ISCCP [International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project] Regional Experiment (FIRE), conducted off the coast of southern California during July 1987. Multispectral images of the reflection function were used to derived the optical thickness and effective particle radius of stratiform cloud layers on four days. In addition to the radiation measurements, in situ microphysical measurements were obtained from the University of Washington Convair C-131A aircraft. In this paper we compare remote sensing results with in situ observations, which show a good spatial correlation for both optical thickness and effective radius. These comparisons further show systematic differences between remote sensing and in situ values, with a tendency for remote sensing to overestimate the effective radius by approximately 2-3-mu-m, independent of particle radius. The optical thickness, in contrast, is somewhat overestimated for small optical thicknesses and underestimated for large optical thicknesses. An introduction of enhanced gaseous absorption at a wavelength of 2.16-mu-m successfully explains some of these observed discrepancies. Marginal probability density functions of optical thickness, liquid water path and effective radius have been derived from our remote sensing results. The joint probability density function of liquid water path and effective radius shows that the effective radius increases as the liquid water path increases for optically thin clouds, in contrast to optically thick clouds for which the effective radius decreases with increasing liquid water path.

J	FALKINGHAM, JC				FALKINGHAM, JC			OPERATIONAL REMOTE-SENSING OF SEA ICE	ARCTIC												The Ice Branch of Environment Canada's Atmoshpheric Environment Service is responsible for providing information about ice conditions in Canada's offshore areas. Principal clients include the Canadian Coast Guard, commercial shipping companies, the oil and gas industry and fishermen, who all require accurate information on ice distribution in near real-time. In order to provide this information, the Ice Branch employs a Challenger jet aircraft equipped with dual wide-swath synthetic aperture radars and a Dash-7 equipped with a real aperture side-looking airborne radar. These aircraft image approximately 100 million km2 annually. Radar image data from these aircraft are downlinked during flight via an S-band telemetry link to Coast Gaurd icebreakers and to satellite stations in the Ice Reconnaissance Data Network, which relays the data to the Ice Centre in Ottawa. There, the data are integrated with remotely sensed data from satellites and are used as the basis for ice analysis charts produced and distributed by radio facsimile on a daily basis.																	0004-0843						1991	44			1			29	33										WOS:A1991GV42500007						
J	SUTTON, J				SUTTON, J			THE ROLE OF IMAGING RADAR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CANADIAN ARCTIC - BACKGROUND AND APPLICATIONS	ARCTIC												Imaging radars have been in use in the Canadian Arctic for over 20 years. Initially the use was sporadic, as the relatively new, declassified technology in the form of real aperture side-looking airborne radars (SLAR) was flown and the results studied. This situation existed until the late 1970s, when the use of two types of imaging radars became more widespread. The Atmospheric Environment Service (AES) introduced the Motorola APS-94 SLAR for use on regular reconnaissance flights, while the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) introduced the CV-580 X-L Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for periodic missions in the Arctic for research in support of ice studies and shipping. As demand for ice information increased in support of offshore drilling in the Beaufort Sea and navigation in the Eastern Arctic and along the east coast, more systems were brought on line. AES added two more SLARs to their reconnaissance efforts in the early '80s, while Intera developed a digital SLAR and two digital SAR systems, STAR-1 and STAR-2. As part of a multi-year program to support AES's ice reconnaissance mandate in the Arctic and east coast areas, Intera has developed a dual-sided SAR in a jet aircraft for high-resolution, large-area coverage. Imaging radar, with its all-weather, day/night and cloud-penetrating capability, has proved to be the almost ideal sensor for many arctic applications. In support of offshore drilling in Alaska and Canada, large areas were flown to obtain up-to-date information for use in navigation and forecasting ice conditions. Real-time SAR and SLAR data can be downlinked to ships navigating in ice-infested waters to aid officers in determining the safest, most efficient and economical routing through the ice. Research into ice properties and signatures has improved our knowledge and understanding of the ice, which covers a large part of Canada's territorial waters for much of the year.																	0004-0843						1991	44			1			122	129										WOS:A1991GV42500018						
J	LEGG, CA				LEGG, CA			A REVIEW OF LANDSAT MSS IMAGE ACQUISITION OVER THE UNITED-KINGDOM, 1976-1988, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR OPERATIONAL REMOTE-SENSING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A review of Landsat MultiSpectral Scanner 'Quicklook' images in the National Remote Sensing Centre archive indicates that, on average, only one satellite pass in six over the United Kingdom results in cloud-free imagery. There are significant regional and inter-annual variations in acquisition of cloud-free imagery. Coastal districts are relatively less cloudy than inland upland areas, while the south-east of Britain and the western coast have the highest percentages of useful imagery. Inter-annual variations suggest that the chances of acquiring data from currently operational satellites within the precise date intervals required for automated crop mapping on a regular basis are very low. A wide range of other operational applications of remote sensing with less rigorous acquisition requirements are possible in the U.K. with current sensors. The study highlights the need for more frequent imaging by sensors of Thematic Mapper and SPOT HRV types, in order to minimize the effect of cloud cover, and the longer-term requirement for development of all-weather microwave imaging systems of comparable spatial and spectral resolution to current optical sensors.																	0143-1161					JAN	1991	12	1					93	106		10.1080/01431169108929634								WOS:A1991EV59800007

The area studied was on the north coast of Porquerolles island (Hyeres, SE France). The treated data were compared with mapping carried out by diving. We show that satellite remote sensing may permit a distinction between certain epibenthic populations and bottom types down to 10 m depth. Thus the usefulness of the satellite is reduced where the sublittoral is steeply shelving, as the mappable area is narrow and represented by only a few pixels, each of which tends to overlap several separate biocoenoses. The image treated was obtained in June under very favourable conditions, with dense meadows of relatively epiphyte-free Posidonia oceanica seagrass, calm sea, and very clear water. However, much of the image was subject to marked reflectance, which reduced image usefulness. To avoid this problem, future requests for images should take into account the season and parameters, such as overflight time and satellite angle, likely to be associated with high reflectance at the site in question.																	0399-1784						1991	14	3					299	307										WOS:A1991FW22400008

Data collected since 1932 during the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey show consistent patterns of geographical, seasonal and annual variation in the distribution of phytoplankton and its major taxonomic components. There is a trend of increased colouration in Recorder silks in the southern North Sea until approximately 1975 since when Colour levels (assumed to be indicative of algal biomass) have declined. In the eutrophic Dutch Wadden Sea the algal crop continued to increase; in Dutch coastal North Sea waters a trend of biomass increase reversed since 1984, apparently due to a reduction in Rhine river outflow. Long-term observations made at Helgoland since the 60's also show trends of increasing nutrients and phytoplankton biomass only to 1984. Adverse effects such as deoxygenation, foam formation and toxin production have been linked to mass concentrations of algae known as blooms. There is no evidence from existing reports for an increase in their frequency, although some years stand out with larger numbers. Occurrence of blooms can partly be explained by hydrographic conditions. More than 30 taxa are recognised as occurring in bloom proportions in the North Sea, approximately one third of which can be toxic. The crop of Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) is not likely to increase with eutrophication due to silicate limitation. An extensive subsurface maximum of armoured dinoflagellates, its abundance governed by hydrographic conditions, is the most characteristic feature of the central and northern North Sea in the summer months. Abundance, sometimes dominance, of picoplankton and of species that are not readily detected by microscopic observations has been documented by measurements of taxon-specific pigments such as chlorophyll b (green algae), alloxanthin (Cryptophyceae) and 19' - hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (Prymnesiophyceae or Haptophyceae). Analysis of time series of satellite images is a promising way to assess in a quantitative and, more important, synoptic way the patchy distribution of phytoplankton over large regions. Growth processes of the phytoplankton respond according to variables amenable to such satellite remote sensing. Empirical and theoretical relationships that can be established between chlorophyll a, C-14 uptake, turbidity, stratification, suspended sediment type, irradiance and temperature in some well-investigated areas make remote sensing a potential tool to obtain reliable estimates of primary production in the whole North Sea. The C-14 method for estimates of the rate of algal growth processes appears to agree reasonably well with other methods, both involving incubation of samples and in situ measurements of temporal changes of oxygen and pH. The level of net primary production is 250 g C.m-2.a-1 in the central North Sea, 150 to 200 g C.m-2.a-1 in the northern North Sea, and 200 g in the South. The main metabolic processes involved in phytoplankton growth have been modelled mathematically in terms of the most important controlling environmental parameters. Such parameters comprise not only those of a chemical signature (micro- and macronutrients, both inorganic and organic) but also physical effects of vertical mixing and sinking, and biological effects including allelopathic interactions, antibiotic excretions, vertical migration, and mortality due to grazing and parasitism. The balance between primary production and consumption of organic matter appears to vary both geographically and seasonally. The process of regeneration of primary products both in the water column and in and near the bottom seems to be of major importance. Future research should center around a study of growth-controlling parameters in laboratory culture experiments. The studies should include uptake of dissolved organic compounds by all taxonomic groups, including pico- and nanophytoplankton, and all aspects of ecosystem structure and function involving the relation between algae and microheterotrophs making up the small food web. There is a need to synthesize existing information on phytoplankton in the North Sea and the factors governing its growth, such as nutrients, river input and stratification intensity. Complicated inter-relationships and successional patterns between individual species which are limited by varying physiological requirements and adaptation to differing hydrographic regimes reemphasizes the importance of species identification in phytoplankton studies. Many future problems in phytoplankton research will not be resolved without accurate identification of algal species. Taxonomic expertise takes many years to acquire; there is at present a shortage of skills in this area and more resources should be turned towards training and long-term support.																	0077-7579					NOV	1990	26	2-4					295	331		10.1016/0077-7579(90)90094-W								WOS:A1990FA34200004
