J	Sibanda, M; Murwira, A				Sibanda, Mbulisi; Murwira, Amon			Cotton fields drive elephant habitat fragmentation in the Mid Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												In this study we tested whether cotton fields contribute more than cereal fields to African elephant (Loxodonta africana) habitat loss through its effects on woodland fragmentation in the Mid-Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe. In order to test this hypothesis, we first mapped cotton and cereal fields using MODIS remotely sensed data. Secondly, we analysed the effect of the area of cotton and cereal fields on woodland fragmentation using regression analysis. We then related the fragmentation indices, particularly edge density with elephant distribution data to test whether elephant distribution was significantly related with woodland fragmentation resulting from cotton fields. Our results showed that cotton fields contributed more to woodland fragmentation than cereal fields. In addition, results showed that the frequency of the African elephant increased where cotton fields were many and small relative to cereal fields. We concluded that cotton fields are the main driver of woodland fragmentation and therefore elephant habitat in the Mid-Zambezi Valley compared with cereal fields. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling alpha- and beta-diversity in a tropical forest from remotely sensed and spatial data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Comprehensive information on species distribution and species composition patterns of plant communities is required for effective conservation and management of biodiversity. Remote sensing offers an inexpensive means of attaining complete spatial coverage for large areas, at regular time intervals, and can therefore be extremely useful for estimating both species richness and spatial variation of species composition (alpha- and beta-diversity). An essential step to map such attributes is to identify and understand their main drivers. We used remotely sensed data as a surrogate of plant productivity and habitat structure variables for explaining alpha- and beta-diversity, and evaluated the relative roles of productivity-habitat structure and spatial variables in explaining observed patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity by using a Principal Coordinates of Neighbor Matrices analysis. We also examined the relationship between remotely sensed and field data, in order to map alpha- and beta-diversity at the landscape-level in the Yucatan Peninsula, using a regression kriging procedure. These two procedures integrate the relationship of species richness and spatial species turnover both with remotely sensed data and spatial structure. The empirical models so obtained can be used to predict species richness and variation in species composition, and they can be regarded as valuable tools not only for identifying areas with high local species richness (alpha-diversity), but also areas with high species turnover (beta-diversity). Ultimately, information obtained in this way can help maximize the number of species preserved in a landscape. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Use of an Airborne Lidar System to Model Plant Species Composition and Diversity of Mediterranean Oak Forests	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Airborne lidar is a remote-sensing tool of increasing importance in ecological and conservation research due to its ability to characterize three-dimensional vegetation structure. If different aspects of plant species diversity and composition can be related to vegetation structure, landscape-level assessments of plant communities may be possible. We examined this possibility for Mediterranean oak forests in southern Portugal, which are rich in biological diversity but also threatened. We compared data from a discrete, first-and-last return lidar data set collected for 31 plots of cork oak (Quercus suber) and Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) forest with field data to test whether lidar can be used to predict the vertical structure of vegetation, diversity of plant species, and community type. Lidar- and field-measured structural data were significantly correlated (up to r= 0.85). Diversity of forest species was significantly associated with lidar-measured vegetation height (R2= 0.50, p < 0.001). Clustering and ordination of the species data pointed to the presence of 2 main forest classes that could be discriminated with an accuracy of 89% on the basis of lidar data. Lidar can be applied widely for mapping of habitat and assessments of habitat condition (e.g., in support of the European Species and Habitats Directive [92/43/EEC]). However, particular attention needs to be paid to issues of survey design: density of lidar points and geospatial accuracy of ground-truthing and its timing relative to acquisition of lidar data.																	0888-8892					OCT	2012	26	5					840	850		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2012.01869.x								WOS:000308484500010	22731687

We investigated whether inter-crown pixel information from VHR imagery could be used for taxonomic identification of trees and characterization of successional stages of tropical Andean mountain forest. Location Santa Lucia cloud forest reserve, NW Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We gathered digital camera imagery (0.05-m spatial resolution), using a remote-controlled helicopter platform, from primary and secondary forest and identified visible crowns to species before extracting digital crown samples (2-m radius). Using an object-based approach, histogram descriptors and diversity metrics of pixel intensity in red, green and blue (RGB) bands were calculated for crowns, and patterns in similarity explored using ordination. Predictive models were developed and validated using four decision tree models (CHIAD, Exhaustive CHIAD, CRT and QUEST). Results Aerial imagery represented 54% of families, 53% of genera and 56% of species sampled from the ground. Ordination (redundancy analysis) confirmed that inherent continuities, based on crown metrics, correlated with traditional species, genus and family groupings (P < 0.05). Data were best described by histogram means in the green band. The best predictive model (CRT) generated a 47% probability of correct species identification for 41 species with similar success at genus and family level. Predictive ability was highly species-specific, ranging from zero for some taxa to 93% for Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec. Conclusions From the crown metrics tested, we found the mean pixel intensity in the green band was most effective in predicting species and species grouping of tropical mountain trees. This metric integrates species-specific differences in leaf density of crowns and reflectance in the green waveband. High predictive success for indicators of primary (Cornus peruviana J.F. Macbr.) and secondary forest (Cecropia gabrielis Cuatrec.) shows that VHR imagery can be used to identify species from pixel information to provide ecological information on successional status. Further research is needed to develop pattern and textural metrics specifically for hyperspatial digital imagery to identify tree species from crown imagery in diverse tropical forests.

Based on time series Landsat TM/ETM+ imageries and historical data, relationships between urban land expansion and its influencing factors from 1989 to 2009 were analyzed by using an integrated approach of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The results showed that built-up land increased from 151.16 km(2) in 1989 to 383.76 km(2) in 2009. Approximately 64.25% of the newly emerging built-up land was converted from cropland (29.47%), forest and shrub (25.78%), water (3.73%), wetland (4.61%), and bare land (0.66%) during 1989 and 2009. With a remarkable decrease in cropland, the proportion of non-agricultural population increased by 23.6%. Moreover, rapid development of infrastructures, facilities, industrial parks, and urban and rural settlements along the Minjiang River resulted in the eastward and southward expansion of built-up land. Additionally, the growth pattern of built-up land in the NWDA is highly correlated with socio-economic factors, including the gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, and structure of industry. As a result, the observed environmental degradation such as loss of cropland and wetland due to heavy pressure of rapid urbanization have greatly impaired the carrying capacity of city. Thus, in addition to scientific and rational policies towards minimizing the adverse effects of urbanization, coordination between the administrative agencies should be urgently strengthened to balance the conflicts between urban development and ecological conservation to make sure the sustainable land use.																	1002-0063					OCT	2012	22	5					568	577		10.1007/s11769-012-0564-7								WOS:000308439400007

Explaining elephant (Loxodonta africana) and buffalo (Syncerus caffer) spatial distribution in the Zambezi Valley using maximum entropy modelling	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We used the maximum entropy (MAXENT) technique to explore how anthropogenic and physical factors influence the habitat of elephants and buffalo in a Southern African savanna landscape. Results show that for both species the distance to agricultural fields is the most important factor determining the choice of habitat. Without having used the nature reserves' and conservancy's boundary as an input in the maximum entropy model, the model was mapping out the high probability of buffalo and elephant presence to coincide within their boundaries. The analysis of the habitat condition show that higher presence of wildlife in the nature reserves compared with cultivated areas is not dependent on the abundance of green biomass, proximity to surface water, or terrain slope, since these do not significantly differ between nature reserves and communal lands. We conclude that the presence of agricultural fields contributes more in shaping the habitats of both buffalo and elephant than other environmental variables. In the communal lands where the agricultural fields are concentrated along the rivers elephants and buffalo are pushed away from the rivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mapping abandoned agriculture with multi-temporal MODIS satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Agriculture is expanding and intensifying in many areas of the world, but abandoned agriculture is also becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe (-1,236,000 km(2)) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, -250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65%. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1% of the total area, compared to 29.6% agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8% producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003-2008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8% over the use of NDVI data alone. The approach that we identified here is promising and suggests that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales, which is relevant to gain a better understanding of this important land use change process.

It is important to evaluate natural vegetation recovery processes and provide basic information on ecological aspects of the recovering environment after the earthquake. To circumvent the weather limits of remote sensing in the Wenchuan earthquake-hit areas, and to meet the need for regional observation analyses, three Landsat TM images pre- and post-earthquake in Mao County were used for analysis. Post-earthquake normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were compared to pre-earthquake values with an NDVI-based index differencing method to determine the extent to which the vegetation was damaged in relation to the pre-earthquake pattern, and the rate of recovery was evaluated. The spatial characteristics of vegetation loss and natural recovery patterns were analyzed in relation to elevation, slope and aspect. The results indicated that severely damaged sites occurred mainly in river valleys, within a range of 1,500-2,500 m elevation and on slopes of 25-55A degrees. The distance from rivers, rather than the distance from active faults, controls the damage patterns. After 1 year of natural regeneration, 36 % of the destroyed areas showed a decrease in NDVI value, 28.8 % showed very little change, 19.1 % showed an increase, and 16.1 % also increased with a recovery rate greater than 100 %. Moreover, there is a good correlation between recovery rate and both slope and elevation, but recovery patterns in the damaged area are complicated. Our results indicate that natural recovery in this arid valley is a slow process.

Modeling spatio-temporal change patterns of forest cover: a case study from the Himalayan foothills (India)	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												The present study used temporal remote sensing data for 1990, 2001 and 2006 to assess spatio-temporal patterns of forest cover changes in Shiwalik range of the Himalaya, Dehradun forest division. Forests are innately associated to human well-being. However, with the increasing anthropogenic activities, deforestation has increased. Quantitative change analysis of the forest cover for the past two decades provides valuable insight into the forest conservation vis-A -vis anthropogenic activities in the region. Spatio-temporal datasets along with biotic and abiotic variables provide opportunities to model the forest cover change further. The present study investigates forest cover change and predicts status of forest cover in the Dehradun forest division. Land Change Modeller (LCM) was used to predict status of forest cover for 2010 and 2015 using current disturbance scenarios. Comparing actual LULC of 2006 with the predicted LULC of 2006 validated change prediction model and agreement was 61.03%. The forested areas are getting degraded due to anthropogenic activities, but deforestation/degradation does not contribute much in expanding urban area. Agricultural areas and fallow lands are the main contributors to increased urban area. The study demonstrates the potential of geospatial tools to understand spatio-temporal forest cover change and generate the future scenarios.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				SEP	2012	12	3					619	632		10.1007/s10113-011-0272-3								WOS:000307534400016

Neal			Utilization of a Species Occupancy Model for Management and Conservation	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Conserving habitat is increasingly challenging as human populations grow. Remote-sensing technology has provided a means to delineate species' habitat on large spatial scales. However, by combining habitat delineations with predictions of species' occurrence, habitat models can provide additional utility applications for conservation by allowing us to forecast how changing environmental and landscape conditions affect species' occurrence and distribution. We demonstrate how a spatially explicit habitat occupancy model for the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) can be used as an impact assessment and conservation planning tool. We used predictions of patch-level occupancy rates and created several scenarios that simulated the removal or protection of warbler habitats. Resulting changes to habitat structure and availability were used to assess the resulting impacts of removal or protection on the occurrence probability for remaining habitat patches. By recalculating occupancy based on changes to habitat, our approach provides the ability to assess and compare impacts of location and orientation of development so that the least harmful option relative to predicted occurrence can be chosen. Potential applications of our modeling approach are many because our methods provide a useful tool for identifying potential impacts and assisting with mitigation efforts focused on the conservation and management of a species.

Fast developmental activities and population pressure in the hills of Khanapara-Bornihat area near Guwahati city (about 10 km east of Guwahati) results rapid alteration of the land use/land cover in the recent times. This also causes the growth of land use over the unsuitable topography. As a result, there is a general degradation of the natural resources within the area. So, urgent measures have to be adopted to take up the conservation measure for the management of natural resources. Watershed wise conservation is considered to be the most acceptable and convenient approach. In the context of watershed management, watershed prioritization gained importance in natural resource management. The present study makes an attempt to prioritize the sub-watersheds for adopting the conservation measure. The prioritization is based on land use and slope analysis using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques in Khanapara-Bornihat area of Assam and Meghalaya state (India). The study area of 323.17 sq. km is divided into three 5th order, four 4th order and two 3rd order sub-watersheds. Land use/Land cover change analysis of the sub-watersheds has been carried out using multi temporal data of SOI toposheets of 1972 and IRS LISS III imagery of 2006. The study shows the significance changes in land use pattern especially in settlement and forest lands from 1972 to 2006. Slope map of the sub-watersheds prepared from the contour values in the toposheets show the wide variation of slope in the area ranging from 0A degrees to 87A degrees. Based on the extent/nature of land use/land cover changes over time and land use/land cover-slope relationship analysis, the sub-watersheds are classified into three categories as high, medium and low in terms of priority for conservation and management of natural resources.																	0255-660X					SEP	2012	40	3					435	446		10.1007/s12524-011-0163-6								WOS:000305983300009

Effective conservation and management plan is thus required to protect these resources, to aid with conservation need mapping and monitoring of seagrasses using high resolution remote sensing data is very much required. Hence, the present study was made to record the seagrass aerial cover in the Lakshadweep islands using IRS P6 LISS IV satellite data. The suitability of LISS IV sensor for seagrass mapping was tested for the first time with an overall accuracy of 73.16%. The study found an area of 2590.2 ha of seagrasses in Lakshadweep islands with 1310.8 ha and 1279.4 ha dense and sparse seagrass cover respectively. The study recommends the use of LISS IV data for mapping the shallow water seagrasses, as mapping efficiency increases nearly 4 times more than the LISS III data, as the former (LISS IV) picks up the small patches of seagrasses and delineates the coral and reef vegetation patches from seagrass class.																	0255-660X					SEP	2012	40	3					467	481		10.1007/s12524-011-0179-y								WOS:000305983300012

Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh. These landscapes representing different eco-climatic zones were subjected to landscape ecological analysis and various landscape composition, patch and edge characteristic metrics were computed to find the extent of fragmentation in the natural vegetation. The natural vegetation comprised of forests (10.24%), grasslands (31.04%) and scrublands (2.95%) as the landscape elements (LSE). These LSEs were further segregated into different LSE types based on the dominant species of plant communities in the landscapes. These LSE types were surveyed for species diversity in the three landscapes. The total landscape area (TLA) covered by natural vegetation in Nichar, Kalpa and Pooh landscapes was calculated to be 651.42, 529.02 and 1,673.72 km(2) making the total area covered with natural vegetation in the district as 2,854.16 km(2). The Pooh block, lying in the east of the district, though covered the largest area of the landscape, was poor in terms of landscape composition as compared to the Nichar block which was rich in landscape elements as suggested by the diversity measures. The extent of fragmentation was found to be highest in Nichar. The Nichar landscape was observed to be having higher mean values of species diversity than other blocks which is consistent with the trends observed with patches diversity. This was in contrast to the Pooh landscape where the patch diversity as well as the species diversity was the lowest. Thus, an ecological analysis utilizing landscape metrics and biodiversity field sampling of vegetation, was attempted for such heterogenous landscapes in high altitudes of Himalaya, which provided a baseline data for the management and conservation of these virgin mountainous areas.

Tracking the effect of climate change on ecosystem functioning using protected areas: Africa as a case study	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Protected areas represent important core 'units' for in situ conservation. However, the current static system is at risk from the effects of global environmental change. This is especially true in Africa. a biodiversity-rich continent expected to be hit hard by climate change. Focusing on African protected areas that experience limited human impact (International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I and II), we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of climate change on the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP). We expected a lower annual NPP and higher seasonality in NPP in Eastern and Southern Africa; changes in NPP dynamics to coincide with changes in precipitation; no correlation between changes in NPP dynamics and human development. To test these expectations, we used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an index of NPP. Results show that, between 1982 and 2008, an increased vegetation greenness was observed in 27% of the protected areas monitored (mostly in Western Africa), and an increased seasonality in 9% of them (mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa). Our results lend support to current expectations regarding the impacts of climate change, and demonstrate how protected areas of IUCN categories I and II could be used to track the effect of climate change on ecosystem functioning in Africa, and possibly elsewhere. The study highlights the need for a dynamic approach to conservation, where the relevance and efficiency of management actions need to be regularly evaluated. It also demonstrates that satellite-based approaches offer a cheap, verifiable way to quickly identify protected areas of concern at a global scale, supporting managers in their effort to design and apply adaptive management strategies.

This paper outlines a multi-objective neural network based method for the classification of olive trees (OT), bare soil (BS) and different cover crops (CC), using remote sensing data taken in spring and summer. The main findings of this paper are: (1) the proposed models performed well in all seasons (particularly during the summer, where only 48 pixels of CC are confused with BS and 10 of BS with CC with the best model obtained. This model obtained a 97.80% of global classification, 95.20% in the class with the worst classification rate and 0.9710 in the KAPPA statistics), and (2) the best-performing models could potentially decrease the number of complaints made to the Andalusian and European administrations. The complaints in question concern the poor performance of current on-ground methods to address the presence or absence of cover crops in olive orchards. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Geospatial revolution and remote sensing LiDAR in Mesoamerican archaeology	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The application of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), a laser-based remote-sensing technology that is capable of penetrating overlying vegetation and forest canopies, is generating a fundamental shift in Mesoamerican archaeology and has the potential to transform research in forested areas world-wide. Much as radiocarbon dating that half a century ago moved archaeology forward by grounding archaeological remains in time, LiDAR is proving to be a catalyst for an improved spatial understanding of the past. With LiDAR, ancient societies can be contextualized within a fully defined landscape. Interpretations about the scale and organization of densely forested sites no longer are constrained by sample size, as they were when mapping required laborious on-ground survey. The ability to articulate ancient landscapes fully permits a better understanding of the complexity of ancient Mesoamerican urbanism and also aids in modern conservation efforts. The importance of this geospatial innovation is demonstrated with newly acquired LiDAR data from the archaeological sites of Caracol, Cayo, Belize and Angamuco, Michoacan,Mexico. These data illustrate the potential of technology to act as a catalytic enabler of rapid transformational change in archaeological research and interpretation and also underscore the value of on-the-ground archaeological investigation in validating and contextualizing results.																	0027-8424					AUG 7	2012	109	32					12916	12921		10.1073/pnas.1205198109								WOS:000307551700024	22802623

Disentangling how past anthropogenic and natural factors contributed to current biome distribution is thus a crucial issue to understand their complex interactions on wider time scales and to improve predictions and conservation strategies. This is particularly important in biodiversity hotspots, such as Madagascar, dominated by large open habitats whose origins are increasingly debated. Although a dominant narrative argues that Madagascar was originally entirely covered by woodlands, which were destroyed by humans, a number of recent studies have suggested that past climatic fluctuations played a major role in shaping current biome distributions well before humans arrived. Here, we address the question of the origin of open habitats in the Daraina region in northern Madagascar, using a multiproxy approach combining population genetics modeling and remote-sensing analyses. We show that (i) contrary to most regions of Madagascar, the forest cover in Daraina remained remarkably stable over the past 60 y, and (ii) the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), a forest-dwelling lemur, underwent a strong population contraction before the arrival of the first humans, hence excluding an anthropogenic cause. Prehuman Holocene droughts may have led to a significant increase of grasslands and a reduction in the species' habitat. This contradicts the prevailing narrative that land cover changes are necessarily anthropogenic in Madagascar but does not preclude the later role played by humans in other regions in which recent lemur bottlenecks have been observed.

J	Zhang, YJ; Hu, K; Huang, RY				Zhang, Yongjun; Hu, Kun; Huang, Rongyong			Bundle adjustment with additional constraints applied to imagery of the Dunhuang wall paintings	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												In the digital conservation of the Dunhuang wall painting, bundle adjustment is a critical step in precise orthoimage generation. The error propagation of the adjustment model is accelerated because the near-planar photographic object intensifies correlation of the exterior orientation parameters and the less than 60% forward overlap of adjacent images weakens the geometric connection of the network. According to the photographic structure adopted in this paper, strong correlation of the exterior orientation parameters can be verified theoretically. In practice, the additional constraints of near-planarity and exterior orientation parameters are combined with bundle adjustment to control the error propagation. The positive effects of the additional constraints are verified by experiments, which show that the introduction of weighted observation equations into bundle adjustment contributes a great deal to the theoretical and actual accuracies of the unknowns as well as the stability of the adjustment model.

J	Collin, A; Long, B; Archambault, P				Collin, Antoine; Long, Bernard; Archambault, Phillippe			Merging land-marine realms: Spatial patterns of seamless coastal habitats using a multispectral LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A lack of spatially, structurally and thematically accurate habitat data complicates conservation and management planning as well as ecological research within structurally complex littoral enviromnents. The Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Survey (SHOALS) has considerable potential to provide such data, by means of its proficiency in generating high-resolution measurements of emerged and immersed elevations and to create thematic maps. Return signals, i.e., waveforms, contain signatures and structural information of salt-marsh and benthic cover. This paper focuses on the capability of the SHOALS to assess the structural complexity of emerged and immersed coastal habitats, and to define the contribution of SHOALS data, both elevation and intensity, in order to accurately and seamlessly map these habitats from supratidal to nearshore levels. The study area was selected based upon the variety of littoral cover types, encompassing kelp habitat, eelgrass meadow, beach, salt-marsh, farm and urban coastal environments. Firstly, the LiDAR-derived green waveform, through an ad hoc decision-tree, satisfactorily assessed the structural complexity of littoral habitats (r = 0.75, p<0.01). Secondly, synergistic combination between NDLVI (LiDAR-derived red and near-infrared data) and topographic/bathymetric surfaces (LiDAR-derived near-infrared and green, respectively) enabled the accurate mapping of 19 littoral habitats (overall accuracy and kappa coefficient equaled to 90.09% and 0.8883, respectively). Accordingly, a single multispectral (three bands) LiDAR survey holds significant potential for monitoring small-scale structural complexity, as well as constructing spatially and temporally seamless patterns of coastal habitats.

Modelling the impact of a La Nina event on a South West Pacific Lagoon	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												In view of increasing environmental awareness and biodiversity conservation, understanding the main forcing mechanism driving biogeochemical cycles in coral reefs and lagoon coastal areas is a priority. La Nina events cause unbalanced situations in the Equatorial Pacific and result in enhanced precipitation in South West Pacific coastal areas. We investigated the impact of heavy rainfalls during the 2008 La Nina event on the New Caledonia lagoon using a 3D coupled on-line hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Simulations and data showed that the whole lagoon was impacted by river inputs and stronger hydrodynamics, enhancing chlorophyll-a concentration by a factor between 1.7 and 1.9. The coupled model provided new insights into plume transport, highlighting that eastern plumes can be advected northwards or can reach the South West Lagoon, depending on the balance between regional, tide-induced, and wind-induced surface currents. It also provided a synoptic view of lagoon biogeochemical-hydrodynamic response, when remote sensing data are not available due to cloud coverage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lu, H; Shi, JC				Lu Hui; Shi JianCheng			Reconstruction and analysis of temporal and spatial variations in surface soil moisture in China using remote sensing	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												An ensemble method was used to combine three surface soil moisture products, retrieved from passive microwave remote sensing data, to reconstruct a monthly soil moisture data set for China between 2003 and 2010. Using the ensemble data set, the temporal and spatial variations of surface soil moisture were analyzed. The major findings were: (1) The ensemble data set was able to provide more realistic soil moisture information than individual remote sensing products; (2) during the study period, the soil moisture increased in semiarid regions and decreased in arid regions with anoverall drying trend for the whole country; (3) the soil moisture variation trends derived from the three retrieval products and the ensemble data differ from each other but all data sets show the dominant drying trend for the summer, and that most of the drying regions were in major agricultural areas; (4) compared with the precipitation trends derived from Global Precipitation Climatology Project data, it is speculated that climate change is a possible cause for the drying trend in semiarid regions and the wetting trend in arid regions; and (5) combining soil moisture trends with land surface temperature trends derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete, the study domain was divided into four categories. Regions with drying and warming trends cover 33.2%, the regions with drying and cooling trends cover 27.4%, the regions with wetting and warming trends cover 21.1% and the regions with wetting and cooling trends cover 18.1%. The first two categories primarily cover the major grain producing areas, while the third category primarily covers nonarable areas such as Northwest China and Tibet. This implies that the moisture and heat variation trends in China are unfavorable to sustainable development and ecology conservation.

Despite the wealth of data available from satellite tracking (ST) studies, such data have rarely been used to model species distributions. Using a novel method, we show how to exploit satellite data to analyse whether and how a migratory species responds to fluctuating environmental conditions in its wintering area. This is particularly crucial for establishing comprehensive conservation measures for rare species in areas that are threatened by increasing land use and climate change. 2. We use ST data of Eleonoras falcon Falco eleonorae, a long-distance migratory raptor that winters in Madagascar, and assess the performance of static species distribution models (SDM) as well as multi-temporal models. ST data were derived from seven falcons tracked during three consecutive wintering periods and for a total of 2410 bearings, of which 512 locations were used in SDMs. We employed environmental predictors (climate, topography and land cover) with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds (c. 1 km2) to match rigorously filtered ST data with an accuracy of =1 km. 3. We first created a model with low temporal but high spatial resolution (half-year). To predict suitable habitat for each month of the wintering season, we took advantage of the high temporal resolution inherent in ST data and employed temporally corresponding remote sensing data [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 10-day composites] together with other variables to create monthly models. 4. We show that ST data are suited to build robust and transferable SDMs despite a low number of tracked individuals. Multi-temporal SMDs further revealed seasonal responses of the study species to changing environmental conditions in its wintering area. 5. Synthesis and applications. We present a transferable approach to predict the potential distribution of organisms as well as their dynamic response to changing environmental conditions. Future conservation management plans could include the prediction of a species reaction to changing land-use practices or climate change based on the methodology proposed here. This would provide an early warning system for the decline of populations wintering in remote areas that underlie strong climatic fluctuations.

In Borneo most of the forests are classified as permanent forest estates and are selectively logged using conventional logging techniques causing high damage to the forest ecosystems. Incorporation of sustainable forest management into climate change mitigation measures such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) can help to avert further forest degradation by synergizing sustainable timber production with the conservation of biodiversity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of such initiatives, monitoring methods for forest degradation and above-ground biomass in tropical forests are urgently needed. In this study we developed an index using Landsat satellite data to describe the crown cover condition of lowland mixed dipterocarp forests. We showed that this index combined with field data can be used to estimate above-ground biomass using a regression model in two permanent forest estates in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Tangkulap represented a conventionally logged forest estate while Deramakot has been managed in accordance with sustainable forestry principles. The results revealed that conventional logging techniques used in Tangkulap during 1991 and 2000 decreased the above-ground biomass by an annual amount of average -6.0 tC/ha (-5.2 to -7.0 tC/ha, 95% confidential interval) whereas the biomass in Deramakot increased by 6.1 t C/ha per year (5.3-7.2 t C/ha, 95% confidential interval) between 2000 and 2007 while under sustainable forest management. This indicates that sustainable forest management with reduced-impact logging helps to protect above-ground biomass. In absolute terms, a conservative amount of 10.5 t C/ha per year, as documented using the methodology developed in this study, can be attributed to the different management systems, which will be of interest when implementing REDD+ that rewards the enhancement of carbon stocks.

J	Wang, XL; Wang, Q; Wu, CQ; Liang, T; Zheng, DH; Wei, XF				Wang, Xuelei; Wang, Qiao; Wu, Chuanqing; Liang, Tao; Zheng, Donghai; Wei, Xingfeng			A method coupled with remote sensing data to evaluate non-point source pollution in the Xin'anjiang catchment of China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Non-point source (NPS) pollution has been recognized as the largest threat to water resources throughout the world, and the evaluation of NPS loads is a priority. In China, some models, such as SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) model, have been widely used at the watershed scale. However, variations in natural and social factors make it difficult to find a proper model to use on NPS pollution management in China. In this study, a "Dualistic Structure" model is coupled with remote sensing data to capture the spatial and temporal processes of NPS pollution. Land parameters were derived from HJ-1A and HJ-1B satellite data (resolution 30 m), which offered greatly enhanced spatial resolution. This approach offers the advantage of being a rapid estimation system with fairly precise knowledge of the distribution, sources and quantities of NPS pollutants, and it can be used at the country scale, including in areas with insufficient data. The method is used in the Xin'anjiang catchment, an important water source for Hangzhou city, China. The simulation in this study includes the spatial distribution of monthly total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) loads and the total production of NPS pollutants. The simulations were compared to pollution census (PC) data in 2010 and the results of SWAT model, with an average R-2 larger than 0.7. Additionally, the impacts of soil erosion and human activities on NPS pollution were assessed, indicating that soil and water conservation is very significant factor in the Xin'anjiang catchment. Results indicate that by coupling remote sensing data and parameter retrieval techniques to "Dualistic Structure" models, estimations of NPS loads on the catchment scale can be improved by spatial pixel-based modeling. This rapid NPS estimation system will offer effective support to policy makers for environmental management in China. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mapping and monitoring deforestation and forest degradation in Sumatra (Indonesia) using Landsat time series data sets from 1990 to 2010	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												As reported by FAO (2005 State of the World's Forests (Rome: UNFAO), 2010 Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2010/095 (Rome: UNFAO)), Indonesia experiences the second highest rate of deforestation among tropical countries. Hence, timely and accurate forest data are required to combat deforestation and forest degradation in support of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation policy initiatives. Within Indonesia, Sumatra Island stands out due to the intensive forest clearing that has resulted in the conversion of 70% of the island's forested area through 2010. We present here a hybrid approach for quantifying the extent and change of primary forest in Sumatra in terms of primary intact and primary degraded classes using a per-pixel supervised classification mapping followed by a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based fragmentation analysis. Loss of Sumatra's primary intact and primary degraded forests was estimated to provide suitable information for the objectives of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD and REDD+) program. Results quantified 7.54 Mha of primary forest loss in Sumatra during the last two decades (1990-2010). An additional 2.31 Mha of primary forest was degraded. Of the 7.54 Mha cleared, 7.25 Mha was in a degraded state when cleared, and 0.28 Mha was in a primary state. The rate of primary forest cover change for both forest cover loss and forest degradation slowed over the study period, from 7.34 Mha from 1990 to 2000, to 2.51 Mha from 2000 to 2010. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data set was employed to evaluate results. GLAS-derived tree canopy height indicated a significant structural difference between primary intact and primary degraded forests (mean height 28 m +/- 8.7 m and 19 m +/- 8.2 m, respectively). The results demonstrate a method for quantifying primary forest cover stand-replacement disturbance and degradation that can be replicated across the tropics in support of REDD+ initiatives.

Forest changes over a century in Sardinia: implications for conservation in a Mediterranean hotspot	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												The Mediterranean basin is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots. However, only 5% of its original vegetation is still in place, and the landscape has been managed and transformed by humans for at least the last two millennia. In the last century the mechanization of agriculture and the over-use of semi-natural habitats have influenced the region even more than before, with huge consequences, especially on islands. Sardinia is the second largest island in the Mediterranean basin, and it has been considered for long as a semi-natural area with an economy based on traditional agroforestry and pastoral practices. Considering four maps covering Sardinia and ranging from 1935 to 2007, we measured the rate of forest changes demonstrating a constant trend towards forest increase, and with a complete recovery of the total forest surface compared to the late 1800s. The traditional agroforestry practices decrease in time due to socio-economic reasons, with deeper consequences for the mosaic of traditional agricultural areas and semi-natural habitats, as well as for the conservation of the unique biodiversity of Sardinia. Species typically linked to Mediterranean forests recovered and are recovering, while species linked to traditional semi-natural landscapes decreased, facing conservation problems. We suggest that the current challenges for biodiversity conservation in the island should be focused together with the agricultural policies towards the preservation and improvement of traditional open areas, even important in the history of the entire Mediterranean hotspot.

Coastal habitats support large number of marine and wetland species including shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers and allies). In this study, we investigate how coastal habitats may be impacted by sea level rise in the Farasan Islands, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We use Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus - a common coastal breeding shorebird - as an ecological model species to predict the influence of sea level rise. We found that any rise of sea level is likely to inundate 11% of Kentish plover nests. In addition, 5% of the coastal areas of Farasan Islands, which support 26% of Kentish plover nests, will be flooded, if sea level rises by one metre. Our results are constrained by the availability of data on both elevation and bird populations. Therefore, we recommend follow-up studies to model the impacts of sea level rise using different elevation scenarios, and the establishment of a monitoring programme for breeding shorebirds and seabirds in Farasan Islands to assess the impact of climate change on their populations.

This has led to intensive competitions against limited water resources and caused a number of potentially adverse effects on local ecosystems and human society. As water demand by human activities is increasing, balancing water demands between human society and ecosystems is desired to improve economic development without causing too much disturbance on the environment and ecosystems within a wetland. In this study, a computationally efficient quantitative method was developed to calculate the ecological flow requirement (i.e., water demand by ecosystems) in an alpine wetland of western China. The proposed method was also carried out by means of remote sensing images interpretation. Through this method, variations in water demands by human beings and ecosystems could be reflected and analyzed, which would be useful in helping formulate water allocation strategies under multiple objectives such as environmental protection, economic development, and ecological conservation. The method was then applied to assess ecological flow requirements in Zoige Wetland of western China. The results indicated that to maintain the basic ecological structure and integrity of the wetlands, the minimum reserve of 6.218 billion m(3)/a and a suitable reserve of 6.639 billion m(3)/a of water would be required. Also, the application results indicated that the method is applicable and can be expanded to other similar wetlands for balancing water demands between ecosystems and human beings.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2012	66	5					1525	1533		10.1007/s12665-011-1392-2								WOS:000305214900025

Species distribution models that relate occurrence or abundance of a species to environmental predictors can be applied for both purposes. We build a generalized linear model relating the distribution of breeding Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) to remotely sensed environmental data to estimate the current distribution of breeding territories throughout Denmark. Additionally, we apply three different methods to calculate population estimates from the model predictions. The most parsimonious model includes only coverage of deciduous forest and its squared effect as significant predictors. Correspondence between predictions of breeding territories and atlas data on breeding Tawny Owls is high (73%), indicating that our model captures an essential part of this species' habitat requirements. The three population estimates suggests the number of breeding pairs in Denmark to be similar to 4,800, similar to 7,200, or similar to 20,500, respectively. This case adds to the existing body of literature that illustrates that species distribution models can be useful to predict the distribution of species and for estimating population size.

The inter-annual coefficient of variation (CoV) of normalized difference vegetation index was used as a measure of vegetation dynamics to address ecological consequences associated with climate change and the impact of land-cover/land-use change. The slope of a linear regression of inter-annual CoV over the entire time span was used as a sustainability indicator to assess the trend of vegetation dynamics from 1975 to 2010. Deduced vegetation dynamics were then associated with precipitation patterns, land surface temperature, and the impact of levees on alluvial hydrologic partitioning and river channelization reflecting the links between society and natural systems. The results show, a higher inter-annual accumulated vegetation index, and lower inter-annual CoV distributed over the uplands remaining virtually stable over the time frame investigated; relatively low vegetation index with larger CoV was observed over lowlands, indicating that climate change was not the only factor affecting ecosystem alterations in the Missouri River floodplain. We cautiously conclude that river channelization, suburbanization and agricultural activities were the possible potential driving forces behind vegetation cover alteration and habitat fragmentation on the Lower Missouri River floodplain.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				JUL	2012	27	6					843	857		10.1007/s10980-012-9748-x								WOS:000305218000005

The objective of this study was to assess and identify critical sub-catchments for soil conservation management using the USLE, GIS, and remote sensing techniques. The Tapacura catchment is one of the planning units for water resource management of the Recife Metropolitan Region. Maps of the erosivity (R), erodibility (K), slope (LS), cover-management (C), and support practice (P) factors were derived from the climate database, digital elevation model, and soil and land-use maps. In order to validate the simulation process, total sediment delivery ratio was estimated. The results showed a mean sediment delivery ratio (SDR) of around 11.5 % and a calculated mean sediment yield of 0.108 t ha(-1) year(-1), which is close to the observed one, 0.169 t ha(-1) year(-1). The obtained soil loss map could be considered as a useful tool for environmental monitoring and water resources management. The methodology applied showed acceptable precision and allowed the identification of the most susceptible areas to soil erosion by water, constituting an important predictive tool for soil and environmental management in this region, which is highly relevant for the prediction of varying development scenarios for Tapacura catchment. This approach can be applied to other areas for simple and reliable identification of critical areas of soil erosion in catchments.

Identifying Potential Rainwater Harvesting Sites of a Semi-arid, Basaltic Region of Western India, Using SCS-CN Method	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Upper Karha watershed from semi-arid part of Deccan Volcanic Province, India was investigated to identify the potential sites to construct rainwater harvesting structures with the help of remote sensing and geographical information system. Attempt was made to understand the basaltic terrain in spatial context to find out the rainwater harvesting structures like farm ponds, percolation tank, check dams and gully plugs deriving from thematic layers, such as landuse/landcover, slope, soil, drainage and runoff from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and other collateral data. Subsequently, these layers were processed to derive runoff from Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method using Arc-CN runoff tool. The SCS-CN method shows that the high runoff potential is from water-body, agriculture land (including harvested land) and followed by settlement, open scrub, dense scrub and low for the open forest, dense forest area. Parameters like hydro-geomorphology, geology were considered as per Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development specifications for identification of the structures. The thematic layers overlaid using intersection based on these specifications. Derived sites were investigated for its suitability and implementation by ground truth field verification. In conclusion, the method adopted in present study deciphers the more precise, accurate and ability to process large catchment area than other methods.																	0920-4741					JUL	2012	26	9					2537	2554		10.1007/s11269-012-0031-3								WOS:000304411800007

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Efficient management and conservation of natural habitats requires a thorough knowledge and sustained monitoring of their ecological quality. In recent years, several methods have been developed to assess the local conservation status in the field. These typically combine estimates of coarse-scale indicators, such as tree and grass encroachments, with very fine-scale indicators that require precise fieldwork, such as the number of key species present. We first tested whether coarse-scale field characteristics can provide information on fine-scale indicators. Then, this idea was extended to remote sensing techniques to derive estimates of fine-scale properties that cannot be derived directly by the sensors. The method was elaborated for two Natura 2000 heathland areas, combining field conservation status assessments of over 650 locations with remote sensing information derived from an airborne hyperspectral scanner image. Boosted regression trees using field estimates of coarse-scale parameters as predictors were able to explain up to 43% of the variation in the fine-scale indicators. When using remote sensing data, models performed only slightly less. Up to 35% of the variation was explained using remote sensing estimates of coarse-scale parameters as predictors, and up to 39% was explained when additional remotely sensed land cover data were included in the models. Although these rates are not high in absolute terms, model predictions for certain parameters were more precise than field estimates, especially for criteria with a high between-observer variability. These results clearly illustrate the potential of remote sensing imagery to derive information on the conservation status of habitats, even for fine-scale elements that are too small to be derived directly.

Integrating Museum and GIS Data to Identify Changes in Species Distributions Driven by a Disturbance-Induced Invasion	COPEIA												Two topics of great importance to conservation biologists and managers are the impact of habitat degradation on species' distributions and the effects of invasive species on the decline of other species. I evaluate the interaction of these threats by comparing the impact of a native invasive amphibian species on a formerly allotopic amphibian species in disturbed versus undisturbed habitat. Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus fowleri) historically thrived in a range of habitats Including urban and suburban areas in the mid-twentieth century, but has recently undergone a range contraction concurrent with the spread of the Coastal Plain Toad (Incilius nebulifer) into recently disturbed habitat. Contemporary surveys of historical collection sites obtained from museum records of vouchered specimens were used to document changes in the distribution of both species over the past half-century. Temporal changes in habitat disturbance at collection sites were detected by comparing historical aerial photographs with current remote sensing data. Analysis of species' distribution in different disturbance levels showed that A. fowleri is unaffected by disturbance in areas where I. nebulifer is absent, but at sites where the species are sympatric the distribution of A. fowleri in degraded habitat contracted while the expansion of I. nebulifer increased substantially. This study demonstrates that anthropogenic habitat alteration can facilitate dispersal and colonization by an invasive species, resulting in the significant decline of a native species that is otherwise tolerant of disturbance.																	0045-8511	1938-5110				JUN 27	2012		2					307	320		10.1643/CE-10-159								WOS:000305928700017

SUITABLE BREEDING HABITAT FOR GOLDEN EAGLE (AQUILA CHRYSAETOS) IN A BORDER OF DISTRIBUTION AREA IN NORTHWESTERN SPAIN: ADVANTAGES OF USING REMOTE SENSING INFORMATION VS. LAND USE MAPS	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												We developed predictive models of suitable breeding habitat potential for Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), in an area of 13500 km(2) in Northwestern Spain. We used 48 locations of well-known nesting territories as response variable and 27 environmental parameters, in the form of raster maps, as predictors. These parameters are mainly related to land use, degree of anthropic disturbance, terrain irregularity and habitat heterogeneity. Automated techniques were developed to estimate the potential distribution of locations suitable for nesting within the study area, using the DOMAIN algorithm and implemented in the statistical environment R. The raster maps, at 250 meter resolution, included topographic variables (i.e. altitude, slope, insolation, etc), remote sensing information (MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index), land use maps, temperature, biodiversity indexes, habitat fragmentation estimates and human influence. The study revealed that suitable areas for nesting are characterized by altitude ranges between 255-1443 m.a.s.I., steep slopes, Mediterranean climatic influence and low human pressure. This study also shows the advantages of using remote sensing information instead of traditional land use maps in this kind of studies. The results are consistent with the ecological requirements of the species and reveal that the locations with highest habitat suitability for nesting in the study area. This analysis constitutes a useful conservation tool for the implementation of management actions for this endangered species in this transitional ecological area in the Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula.																	0240-8759					JUN	2012	62	2					77	85										WOS:000309849100005

Optical data provide interesting information to inventory vegetation and agricultural practices in wetlands but are limited to cloud-free periods. For this reason it is not possible to precisely delineate the extent of saturated areas as well as water cycles and water levels in these areas with passive remote sensing techniques. The objective of this article is to evaluate fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 time-series datasets to identify and locate the seasonal dynamics of saturated areas in wetlands. To that end, the development and validation of a supervised PolSAR segmentation including multitemporal analysis of wetland evolution and polarimetric decomposition method is presented. The proposed methodology is based on the segmentation of a polarimetric descriptor, the Shannon Entropy, which has been shown to be a very sensitive parameter to the temporal variability of flooded areas. The results were validated using ground truth measurements in the field and a LiDAR image. They showed that it is possible to produce detailed water feature maps useful for delineating and monitoring the seasonal dynamics of saturated areas extent in wetlands. These products provide useful information to identify and delineate wetlands to support conservation and management in these ecosystems across large areas.																	1712-7971					JUN	2012	38	3					240	252		10.5589/m12-017								WOS:000306968400003

We aimed at testing low-cost remote sensing sources and simple methodology for recognising the invasive species Robinia pseudacacia and thus founding a monitoring scheme. A study area with mixed wooded stands containing R. pseudacacia has been selected for this purpose in NE Slovenia. Four different sources (Landsat ETM and airborne orthophotos from summer and spring) were tested together with a filtering for forested areas. Filtering was based either on Landsat information or on a forest polygon layer as alternatives. Generalised linear models were constructed in a training window within the study area to establish a statistical rule of recognition for the species based on spectral information. Models were tested both within and outside the training window for accuracy. As means of accuracy assessment both the well-established AUC and the specially adapted Jaccard index have been applied. The best and most reliable recognition was achieved by using the spring orthophoto, in which the species was captured in flower, combined with a GIS filtering by a forest vector layer. The superiority of this combination was especially striking when tested over the full study area. The Jaccard index appeared to be more sensitive in discrimination between models. Thus we conclude that even spectrally less detailed data sources may provide a basis for successful monitoring if the phenology of the target species is also considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Wetland Monitoring, Serving as an Index of Land Use Change-A Study in Samaspur Wetlands, Uttar Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world and any alterations might lead to changes in their bio-physical, socio-economic and climatic conditions. Wetland dynamics as an index of land use change were studied. Satellite remote sensing was utilized to understand the periodic and seasonal dynamics of Samaspur wetlands using Landsat and RESOURCESAT-1 temporal data. Index-based (i.e., Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) classification resulted in meaningful discrimination of wetland classes. Results indicate (i) effective water spread areas have increased to optimum capacity at 1990 due to the influence of Sharda canal, (ii) expansion of the agricultural area has led to reduction of the wetland buffer area, and (iii) increase in vegetation biomass due to pesticide-fertilizer runoff and sedimentation load. We also reiterate (i) free availability of the Landsat satellite data in public domain facilitating such monitoring studies and (ii) availability and utility of SWIR band information in wetland classification exercise. The study concludes that policy-driven measures have both long and short term impacts on land use and its natural wetland ecosystems; and the characterizing the later serves as indictor of the former and perhaps vice versa.

A case-study from Saudi Arabia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We propose a framework for spatially estimating a proxy for coral reef resilience using remote sensing. Data spanning large areas of coral reef habitat were obtained using the commercial QuickBird satellite, and freely available imagery (NASA, Google Earth). Principles of coral reef ecology, field observation, and remote observations, were combined to devise mapped indices. These capture important and accessible components of coral reef resilience. Indices are divided between factors known to stress corals, and factors incorporating properties of the reef landscape that resist stress or promote coral growth. The first-basis for a remote sensed resilience index (RSRI), an estimate of expected reef resilience, is proposed. Developed for the Red Sea, the framework of our analysis is flexible and with minimal adaptation, could be extended to other reef regions. We aim to stimulate discussion as to use of remote sensing to do more than simply deliver habitat maps of coral reefs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using Landsat imagery to map forest change in southwest China in response to the national logging ban and ecotourism development	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Forest cover change is one of the most important land cover change processes globally, and old-growth forests continue to disappear despite many efforts to protect them. At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62% in 1990 to 64% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26% in 1990, to 20% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14%) or non-pine scrub forest (66%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a "best-case scenario" for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.

The aim was to understand the recent distribution pattern of epiphytic orchids, with respect to (i) the micro-site conditions and (ii) the type and intensity of land use. The occurrence of epiphytic orchids was recorded for a grid with 1.5 km cell size. The cells represent different types and intensities of human impact. Site factors such as bark rugosity, bark pH, diameter at breast height (dbh; 1.3 m) of host trees, exposure to wind and sunlight intensity were recorded. With regard to the species richness and abundance of epiphytic orchids, we compared different human impact categories from very strong human impact (settlement area) to very low human impact (national park). Remote sensing was used for a supervised classification of land cover. Ficus religiosa turned out to be the most important host species for orchids in urban areas, while Schima wallichii and Alnus nepalensis significantly host orchids in the other categories. Both species richness and abundance of epiphytic orchids were significantly higher under very low human impact (forest in national park) and also some remaining patches of primary forest than the other regions. Micro-climate is crucial for orchid populations. Host bark pH, bark rugosity, sunlight intensity and host exposure were significantly different for all human impact categories in order to harbour epiphytic orchid species. Habitats with a mixture of mature trees are suitable and essential for the conservation of viable populations of epiphytic orchids in settled areas. The study reveals that to improve the population size of orchids it is essential for future urban forestry to: (i) Protect old trees as carriers of existing epiphytic orchid diversity, (ii) protect medium old trees to ensure that they may become old trees, (iii) plant new host trees for the future, (iv) plant in groups instead of single isolate trees. Trees should especially be planted in areas where orchids still exist to provide more trees for orchid population enlargement (e.g. along riparian system). Native species should be favoured; the pool of such native host species is wide.

J	Gao, J; Li, XL; Brierley, G				Gao, Jay; Li Xilai; Brierley, Gary			Topographic influence on wetland distribution and change in Maduo County, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Accurate information on the spatial distribution and temporal change of wetlands is vital to devise effective measures for their protection. This study uses satellite images in 1994 and 2001 to assess the effects of topography and proximity to channels on wetland change in Maduo County on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, western China. In 1994 wetlands in the study area extended over 6,780.0 km(2). They were distributed widely throughout the county, with a higher concentration in the south, and were especially prominent close to streams. The pattern of wetlands demonstrated a bell-shaped distribution curve with elevation, ranging over hill slopes with gradients from 0-19A degrees, the commonest gradient being around 3A degrees. Although the aspects of these hill slopes range over all directions, there is a lower concentration of wetlands facing east and southeast. The extent of wetlands in 2001 decreased to 6,181.1 km(2). Marked spatial differentiation in the pattern of wetlands is evident, as their area increased by 1,193.3 km(2) at lower elevations but decreased by 1,792.2 km(2) at higher ground, resulting in a net decrease of 598.8 km(2). In areas with a gradient < 2A degrees or > 9A degrees the area of wetlands remained approximately consistent from 1994-2001. Newly retained wetlands are situated in relatively flat lowland areas, with no evident preference in terms of aspect. Wetlands on north-, east- and northeast-facing hillslopes with a bearing of 1-86A degrees were more prone to loss of area than other orientations. The altered pattern of wetland distribution from higher to lower elevation on north-facing slopes coincided with the doubling of annual temperature during the same period, suggesting that climate warming could be an important cause.

Several atmospheric monitoring instruments are already being deployed for real-time surface-level retrieval of atmospheric composition, optical coefficients, particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5), aerosol optical depth (AOD), and particle size distribution. However, these measurements are, in general, very cost intensive and can realistically be deployed only over very limited areas. Therefore, it is very important that advanced modeling methods be employed to fill these gaps and provide air quality predictions that can be used for forecasts as well as a better understanding of the interplay of meteorology, atmospheric emissions, and chemistry. In particular, for the New York State area, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation uses Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to couple meteorology to local emissions, and there is intense interest in trying to assess the model performance beyond current surface network measurements. In particular, a deeper understanding of boundary layer processes can be made by experimentally exploring the vertical distribution model forecasts to better understand the underlying causes when model forecast results are not accurate. To this end, we develop a comprehensive Mie-scattering-based procedure including the effects of relative humidity that allows us to convert CMAQ aerosol distribution data into vertical-profile multiwavelength optical parameters that can be compared to column-integrated and vertical-profiling measurements to assess model performance and point to areas where the model is deficient. In particular, we make use of multiwavelength light detection and ranging (LIDAR), sunphotometer, ceilometer, and existing tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) measurements to assess various vertical and column-integrated parameters of the CMAQ model under different stability conditions. In particular, we find that, for cases where the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is stable, the column-integrated AOD comparisons are in good agreement unlike the days with dynamic PBL. This is also consistent with observations that the TEOM PM2.5 trends are closely followed by the CMAQ model during these stable conditions. On the other hand, significant errors between the surface CMAQ PM2.5 and TEOM measurements can occur which can be traced to unphysically high particulate concentration profiles distributed too close to the surface not seen in ceilometer/LIDAR profiles. Finally, we note that, even for the stable cases, the multiwavelength optical depth data show that, for sufficiently low wavelengths, the column AOD in the model is underestimated, illustrating that there is a general underestimation of ultrafine (Aitken) particulates which can dramatically affect health.

Landsat images were used to prepare both the 1989 and 2009 land cover maps, which were then used to detect changes in the vegetation cover for the barangays. In addition to conventional accuracy assessment parameters such as; proportion correct, and standard Kappa index of agreement, two other parameters; quantity, and allocation disagreements were used to assess the accuracy of the land cover classification. Results revealed that there were gains and losses of vegetation cover in most of the barangays, but overall vegetation cover increased by 11% (around 625 ha) based on the original extent of 1989. Those barangays that showed substantial net losses in vegetation cover need to be prioritised for rehabilitation planning. As exemplified in this study, the collection, processing and analysis of relevant RS and GIS information, can facilitate priority-setting in the planning of environmental rehabilitation and conservation by the local government at both city and barangay levels.

Specifically, we assess whether the use of LANDSAT data in habitat distribution modelling may account for land use management, allowing accurate mapping of real distribution patterns. In particular, we explore whether reflectance values may be a better alternative to other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches (i.e. spectral vegetation indices and classified land cover maps). Finally, we test whether modelling performance is affected by the ecological traits of the dominant species of the target formations. Location Cantabrian Mountains (NW Spain). Methods We generated maps for the four formations (two specialists vs. two generalists) using MaxEnt. First, we ran the models with environmental predictors only (topography, climate, lithology and human disturbances). Then, we compared the advantages of including, in turn, different data derived from LANDSAT imagery: reflectance values (corresponding to different wavelength channels of the multispectral image), a spectral index and a land cover map. We assessed changes in explanatory power and also in the formations predicted distribution patterns. Results Formations dominated by specialist species were accurately mapped on a base of environmental variables only, whereas those dominated by generalists were overpredicted. Average mean temperature, southness and distance to urban areas were the variables contributing most in predictions of environmental models. LANDSAT channels increased the accuracy of all models, but mainly those for formations dominated by generalist species. They showed advantages against other remote sensing data traditionally used in modelling approaches. Main conclusions Habitat distribution models allowed accurate mapping of heath and shrub formations. The use of reflectance values as predictors improved the accuracy of the models, particularly for formations dominated by generalist species, supplying environmental information that was otherwise unavailable.

Predicting the distribution of Montastraea reefs using wave exposure	CORAL REEFS												In the Caribbean region, forereef habitats dominated by Montastraea spp. have the highest biodiversity and support the largest number of ecosystem processes and services. Here we show that the distribution of this species-rich habitat can be explained by one environmental predictor: wave exposure. The relationship between wave exposure and the occurrence of Montastraea reefs was modelled using logistic regression for reefs throughout the Belize Barrier Reef, one of the largest and most topographically complex systems in the region. The model was able to predict correctly the occurrence of Montastraea reefs with an accuracy of 81%. Consistent with historical qualitative patterns, the distribution of Montastraea reefs is constrained in environments of high exposure. This pattern is likely to be driven by high rates of chronic sediment scour that constrain recruitment. The wide range of wave exposure conditions used to parameterize the model in Belize suggest that it should be transferable throughout much of the Caribbean region, constituting a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional habitat mapping and complementing global efforts to map reef extent.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although Mediterranean temporary pools are of great value for conservation, they are in rapid decline under the impact of various forms of anthropogenic pressure. Their disappearance from the landscape may result in a weakening of the biological connections between pools due to increasing isolation and the impoverishment of their communities. In Western Morocco (province of Benslimane), temporary pools have undergone severe regression over the past decades. The quantification of these losses and the impact on the richness of plant communities remain, however, unstudied. Since this is of vital importance for the conservation of the biodiversity of these habitats, a study has been undertaken associating (1) an assessment of the pool losses (both in density and surface area) between 1955 and 2001 using remote sensing, (2) surveys of vegetation and water depth (in 2006) in 48 pools, and (3) an assessment of the density and surface area of pools occurring within a 3 km radius around each of the sampled pools. The results show a loss of 23% in number and 61% in surface area of pools in the province over a period of 47 years. This decline, promoted by their small size and shallowness, is probably related to socio-economic changes (intensification of agricultural practices and population growth). The richness in characteristic and rare species of the pools was related to both local (water depth) and regional features (land use, pool density and total water surface area in the surrounding landscape). The significant impact of the current density of pools and their total surface area on the conservation value of the studied pools suggests a weakening of the metacommunity dynamics between pools. Given the rapid socio-economic changes in the province and the current rate of pool disappearance (0.5% per year) we predict a continuing reduction in pool density with a high risk of the widespread loss of their unique flora in the long term.																	0018-8158					JUN	2012	689	1					23	36		10.1007/s10750-011-0679-3								WOS:000303591200003						
J	Franke, J; Keuck, V; Siegert, F				Franke, Jonas; Keuck, Vanessa; Siegert, Florian			Assessment of grassland use intensity by remote sensing to support conservation schemes	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Grassland is a land cover in the area of conflict between agriculture and conservation, where intensification of land use is a major threat to grassland biodiversity. Grassland use intensity is a key factor for the conservation value of grassland, and detailed spatial data on grassland use intensity is needed to improve strategies for biodiversity conservation. A new remote sensing-based approach using multi-temporal high resolution RapidEye satellite data was developed in the present study that makes a large-scale assessment of grassland use intensity possible. RapidEye is a constellation of five satellites with 6.5 m spatial resolution, which allows frequent and timely image acquisition targeted at specific growing seasons. Semi-natural grassland, extensively used grassland, intensively used grassland and tilled grassland could be reliably differentiated at the management plot level in a study area in southern Germany. Various combinations of images from different observation dates have been tested as classification input and their overall classification accuracies were validated by field data. Best results were achieved using a combination of five multi-temporal scenes with an overall accuracy of 85.7%. A three-scene combination resulted in an overall accuracy of 82.2%. The analysis showed that seasonal aspects are very important when selecting adequate observation dates. Grassland use intensity was also assessed on peatlands using a peat soil map, since land use intensity significantly affects greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. The results demonstrate the potential of targeted multi-spectral, high spatial resolution remote sensing for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic habitats, which is of vital importance to support various environmental conservation schemes through improved monitoring and reporting capabilities.

J	Edirisinghe, A; Clark, D; Waugh, D				Edirisinghe, Asoka; Clark, Dave; Waugh, Deanne			Spatio-temporal modelling of biomass of intensively grazed perennial dairy pastures using multispectral remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Pasture biomass is a vital input for management of dairy systems in New Zealand. An accurate estimate of pasture biomass information is required for the calculation of feed budget, on which decisions are made for farm practices such as conservation, nitrogen use, rotational lengths and supplementary feeding leading to profitability and sustainable use of pasture resources. The traditional field based methods of measuring pasture biomass such as using rising plate metres (RPM) are largely inefficient in providing the timely information at the spatial extent and temporal frequency demanded by commercial environments. In recent times remote sensing has emerged as an alternative tool. In this paper we have examined the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from medium resolution imagery of SPOT-4 and SPOT-5 satellite sensors to predict pasture biomass of intensively grazed dairy pastures. In the space and time domain analysis we have found a significant dependency of time over the season and no dependency of space across the scene at a given time for the relationship between NDVI and field based pasture biomass. We have established a positive correlation (81%) between the two variables in a pixel scale analysis. The application of the model on 2 selected farms over 3 images and aggregation of the predicted biomass to paddock scale has produced paddock average pasture biomass values with a coefficient of determination of 0.71 and a standard error of 260 kg DM ha(-1) in the field observed range between 1500 and 3500 kg DM ha(-1). This result indicates a high potential for operational use of remotely sensed data to predict pasture biomass of intensively grazed dairy pastures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Sudhakar			Assessment of increasing threat of forest fires in Rajasthan, India using multi-temporal remote sensing data (2005-2010)	CURRENT SCIENCE												Rajasthan is the largest state of India experiencing recurrent forest fires. The present study determines forest burnt areas through remote sensing-based time series analysis. IRS P6 AWiFS satellite data covering March, April and May of six years (2005-2010) were used to cover all forest-fire events. The total forest burnt area was assessed as 53,023.5 ha in 2005; 44,681.5 ha in 2006; 57,689 ha in 2007; 89,655.2 ha in 2008; 199,837 ha in 2009 and 144,816 ha in 2010. Forest fires were observed only in the southern Aravallis. Of the total forest cover in southern Aravallis, burnt area proportionately represents 6.8% in 2005, 5.6% in 2006, 7.3% in 2007, 11.1% in 2008, 23.0% in 2009 and 17.6% in 2010. Forest fires were severe during 2009, which was the warmest year since 1901. Small sized (<25 ha) forest burnt area patches contributed to 44% of the total count during 2010. Among the vegetation types, fire prevalence in the dry deciduous forest was higher and it always contributed to >90% of the burnt area. GIS analysis demonstrated highest burnt area in occasional category (70%) followed by frequent fire area (24%). The abundance of fires in edge forests in relation to interior forests clearly indicates significant anthropogenic influence on the forest edges. The fires in Rajasthan are mainly attributed to ethnic culture, collection of non-timber forest produce and grazing pressure. The study provides critical spatial information of increased forest fire threat in Rajasthan. Long-term planning for forest fire management is necessary for effective conservation of biodiversity and bioresources.																	0011-3891					MAY 10	2012	102	9					1288	1297										WOS:000304181400019

The spatially explicit dynamic modeling is a technique that has been successfully used in evaluations of regional SOC stocks changes. Thus, this study aimed to use the Century 4.0 model associated with geoprocessing and remote sensing techniques to evaluate the effects of agricultural use and soil management changes on dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) on farms in Santana (Ijui, RS, Brazil). A geospatial database of the thematic plans: soil classes, land cover, landforms and beginning of agricultural use, were created in ARCGIS 9.x. After land use and soil management systems had been reconstituted from historical and current surveys, the model was initialized with local soil and climate data and calibrated in two steps. In the first calibration step, internal model parameters based on maize, wheat and soybean biomass C additions to the soil were adjusted, as well as SOC measured in 2007 (0-20 cm layer) of native forest (original condition) and an adjacent farm, where agriculture had been initiated between 1901 and 1930 (older plantation, area 1), sampling an Oxisol, on hilltops. Afterwards, the Century model was statistically validated based on data from 10 fields, initiated at different times, with the same soil type and landscape, sampled in 2007 (0-20 cm layer) divided into four homogeneous areas (Areas 1, 2, 3 and 4) within the district of Santana. In the calibration for generalization, four "subtropical forest " options were created to represent the native forest of each soil type in (Oxisol, Mollisol and two Entisol types) based on the tropical forest option generated in the primary calibration step; the adjustments of this step were maintained and only the parameter related to maximum gross monthly production of forest biomass was changed to stabilize the output variable SOMTC (simulated SOC), after running the model for 3000 years (equilibrium run), matching the measured SO C stocks of each soil type under native vegetation. After calibration, all possible combinations of soils, landforms, land use cover and land use change for the agricultural use of Santana ((1901 to 2007; 54 simulation units) were simulated by the i-Century interface. The model estimated the C dynamics adequately, reproducing the evolution of SOC stocks in the area. According to the estimates, the adoption of conservation management practices ensures the reduction of C losses caused by erosion and microbial decomposition, resulting in increases in SOC stocks.

Optimizing land cover classification accuracy for change detection, a combined pixel-based and object-based approach in a mountainous area in Mexico	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Inventories of past and present land cover changes form the basis of future conservation and landscape management strategies. Modern classification techniques can be applied to more efficiently extract information from traditional remote-sensing sources. Landsat ETM+ images of a mountainous area in Mexico form the input for a combined object-based and pixel-based land cover classification. The land cover categories with the highest individual classification accuracies determined based on these two methods are extracted and merged into combined land cover classifications. In total, seven common land cover categories were recognized and merged into single combined best-classification layers. A comparison of the overall classification accuracies for 1999 and 2006 of the pixel-based (0.74 and 0.81), object-based (0.77 and 0.71) and combined (0.88 and 0.87) classifications shows that the combination method produces the best results. These combined classifications then form the input for a change detection analysis between the two dates by applying post-classification, object-based change analysis using image differencing. It is concluded that the combined classification method together with the object-based change detection analysis leads to an improved classification accuracy and land cover change detection. This approach has the potential to be applied to land cover change analyses in similar mountainous areas using medium-resolution imagery. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The role of private lands for conservation: Land cover change analysis in the Caldenal savanna ecosystem, Argentina	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Protected areas are critical for conservation of the world's biodiversity; however, parks isolated from their surroundings will not assure the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. Private lands have the potential to achieve the dual role of conserving natural habitats while providing goods and services societies need. Therefore, understanding which land use practices on private land contribute to the maintenance of native habitats is important. In this study, a land use and land cover change analysis was developed for the Caldenal savanna ecosystem, Argentina, to determine the effect of private game reserves on landscape scale change. Game reserves were found preferentially located in the areas with highest proportion of forest cover. No differences were found in rates of conversion of native habitat to agriculture between game reserves and cattle ranches for 1987-1999 or 1999-2008. Rates of deforestation differed with landholding size between the first and second period. Deforestation stopped in the second period in the game reserves and big cattle ranches, but increased in intensity in small cattle ranches. Intensity of deforestation was more related to agricultural potential of the ranches, which are correlated with landholding size, than to the land use type. Deforestation was higher in areas with more productive soils and higher annual rainfall. These results suggest that, for the period analyzed, incorporation of game reserves as a land use did not significantly alter processes of land cover change, though if conversion to agriculture increases in marginal areas, game reserves potentially could be beneficial for maintenance of a significant portion of the Caldenal.

FORAGING-HABITAT SELECTION OF BLACK-BACKED WOODPECKERS IN FOREST BURNS OF SOUTHWESTERN IDAHO	CONDOR												We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years.																	0010-5422					MAY	2012	114	2					348	357		10.1525/cond.2012.110020								WOS:000305043000012

Assessment of soil erosion hazard in Kilie catchment, East Shoa, Ethiopia	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												This paper reports on a field study conducted in Kilie catchment, East Shoa Zone, Ethiopia to assess the rate of soil erosion by employing a soil loss prediction model (Universal Soil Loss Equation) integrated with in remote sensing and geographical information systems (RS/GIS), environment and gully measurement techniques. The final soil erosion risk map was produced after multiplication of the six factors involved in the USLE and RS/GIS. Gully measurement showed that the erosion rate is higher for the upland areas than the lowlands due to inappropriate soil and water conservation measures, free grazing by animals and conversion of hillside areas into farmlands. About 97.04 per cent of the study catchment falls within a range of 010?t?ha-1?yr-1 sheet/rill erosion rate. We found that 2.17 per cent of the study area in the uplands has a soil erosion rate falling between 10 and 20?t?ha-1?yr-1. About 0.8 per cent of the study area in the uplands is hit by severe sheet/rill erosion rate within the range of 20-60?t?ha-1?yr-1. Gully erosion extent in the study area was evaluated through gully measurement and quantification methods. Gully density of 67?m?ha-1 was recorded in the catchment. The gully to plot area ratio was found to be 0.14 on average. Hence, in the upland areas, sustainable land management practices are required in order to reduce the rate of soil erosion.

In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences). Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and Santalum insulare var. raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the causes of this discrepancy are strong anthropogenic disturbances that have impacted low- to mid-elevation forests in the past and present. There is an urgent need to set up conservation strategies for the endangered plants found in these shrinking habitats on the Pacific islands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

ET Mapping with High-Resolution Airborne Remote Sensing Data in an Advective Semiarid Environment	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING-ASCE												Accurate estimates of spatially distributed evapotranspiration (ET) are essential for managing water in irrigated regions and for hydrologic modeling. METRIC (Mapping ET at high Resolutions with Internal Calibration) energy balance algorithm was applied to derive ET from six high-resolution aircraft images (0.5-2.0 m pixels). Images were acquired over the USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) in the semiarid Southern High Plains. The remote sensing (RS) campaign occurred during the 2007 summer cropping season. Daily ET estimations were evaluated using measured ET data from five monolithic weighing lysimeters located in the CPRL. On average, errors in estimating hourly ET were -0.7 +/- 11.6%; for daily ET, errors were 2.4 +/- 9.3%. Results indicated that METRIC algorithm estimated ET values well when the surface roughness for momentum transfer considered heterogeneous surface conditions and when the grass reference ET fraction was used to extrapolate instantaneous estimates of ET. Results showed that it was possible to apply METRIC with airborne images in a semiarid environment. However, an appropriate (or combination of) surface roughness length and ET extrapolation methods have to be incorporated into the ET algorithm.

The reservoir water balance analysis is calculated by the daily irrigation reservoir operation model (DIROM) for simulating daily inflow and release rates for irrigation reservoirs. The reservoir capacity change for assessing the sediment flux is predicted using the universal soil loss equation (USLE), sediment delivery ratio (SDR), and trap efficiency. To analyze soil erosion changes according to land use changes, Landsat-5 images were selected. Spatial distribution of deposited sediment is estimated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) method and the hydrodynamic, sediment and contaminant transport model (HSCTM-2D), which is a finite-element model for simulating surface water flow and sediment transport. The model performance was verified by comparing simulated and observed data. The simulated results, which were validated using an internal mass balance method because of the scarce observed data, showed that the soil erosion of the Lake Asan watershed has increased at a rate of 2% per year from 1986 to 2000, and the storage capacity after 50 years will decrease by 65% without proper sediment conservation implementation. It is necessary to maintain stable irrigation water capacity by appropriate management of reservoir rehabilitation. The annual dredge amount was determined by various dredge scenarios according to the sediment removal volumes using frequency analysis. This approach will be useful for managers to identify the location and amount in which sediment dredging would be best for stable irrigation water supply maintenance.					​Jang, ​Taeil/0000-0002-7337-8165												0733-9437					MAY	2012	138	5					445	454		10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000420								WOS:000303931300006

Performance assessment of the cellulose absorption index method for estimating crop residue cover	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Accurate and quick field estimation of crop residues is important for carbon sequestration and biofuel production programs. Landscape-scale assessment of this vital information has resorted to the use of remote sensing technology The cellulose absorption index (CAI) technique has outperformed other indices for discriminating bare soil and crop residue in the Midwest, but has not been tested in the Pacific Northwest and the Central and Northern Great Plains regions of the United States. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of CAI in these regions. Malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), durum (Triticum turgidum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow following spring wheat and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) were used in the assessment. Using a portable ground-based spectroradiometer, as well as transect line and photo-grid methods, crop residue cover was measured after the 2009 harvest season. Samples were collected for laboratory analyses. Linear regression analysis showed CAI explained 41% to 55% of the variation in the residue cover. Field pea and fallow residue cover had better correlation with CAI than did small grain crop residues. Field and laboratory measurement of CAI showed that varying pea residue cover responded significantly different than other crop residues. The performance of CAI was affected by the type of crop rather than by location and soil type in the regions. Among other measured parameters, percentage crop residue cover, hemicellulose, and residue amount were most correlated with CAI. Results document that CAI can quickly and effectively estimate percentage of residue cover in the regions.																	0022-4561					MAY-JUN	2012	67	3					202	210		10.2489/jswc.67.3.202								WOS:000304185700010

FUNCTIONAL REGENERATION AND SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE OF TREES DURING SUCCESSION IN A HIGHLY DIVERSE TROPICAL DRY FOREST ECOSYSTEM	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: The function of most ecosystems has been altered by human activities. To asses the recovery of plant communities, we must evaluate the recovery of plant functional traits. The seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF), a highly threatened ecosystem, is assumed to recover relatively quickly from disturbance, but an integrated evaluation of recovery in floristic, structural, and functional terms has not been performed. In this study we aimed to (a) compare SDTF plant functional, floristic, and structural change along succession; (b) identify tree functional groups; and (c) explore the spectral properties of different successional stages. Methods: Across a SDTF successional gradient, we evaluated the change of species composition, vegetation structure, and leaf spectral reflectance and functional traits (related to water use, light acquisition, nutrient conservation, and CO2 acquisition) of 25 abundant tree species. Key results: A complete recovery of SDTF takes longer than the time period inferred from floristic or structural data. Plant functional traits changed along succession from those that maximize photoprotection and heat dissipation in early succession, where temperature is an environmental constraint, to those that enhance light acquisition in late succession, where light may be limiting. A spectral indicator of plant photosynthetic performance (photochemical reflectance index) discriminated between early and late succession. This constitutes a foundation for further exploration of remote sensing technologies for studying tropical succession. Conclusions: A functional approach should be incorporated as a regular descriptor of forest succession because it provides a richer understanding of vegetation dynamics than is offered by either the floristic or structural approach alone.

Recent Changes in Patch Characteristics and Plant Communities in the Jalca Grasslands of the Peruvian Andes	BIOTROPICA												Habitat loss and fragmentation are considered major threats to biodiversity, especially in tropical mountain ecosystems. Most studies focus on the relationships between biodiversity and patch characteristics such as patch size, connectivity or degree of contrast with the surrounding matrix, but leave the rate of change within these variables little explored. We analyzed the importance of changes in patch characteristics over time on species diversity and species composition in the paramo of northern Peru, a tropical grassland ecosystem, locally known as jalca. We obtained land use/cover maps for 1987 and 2007 spanning an area of 6300 km(2), and quantified land use change, jalca patch characteristics and their proportional changes over 20 yr. In 2009, 371 vascular plant species were recorded in 92 plots, each plot representative of single patches. Between 1987 and 2007, jalca cover decreased from 47 to 35 percent due to encroaching agriculture. This activity showed an upward shift probably favored by climate change. The number of jalca patches increased, mean patch size decreased, and the patches showed a higher contrast with the surrounding matrix. Multiple linear regression failed to show that species diversity relates to changes in patch characteristics. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that species composition relates to the degree of contrast between the patch and its surrounding matrix and its changes through time. We concluded that changes in patch characteristics are important only for species composition. This study highlights the importance of considering matrix management with a long term perspective for conservation efforts.

J	Dastorani, MT; Poormohammadi, S				Dastorani, Mohammad Taghi; Poormohammadi, Samaneh			Evaluation of Water Balance in a Mountainous Upland Catchment Using SEBAL Approach	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Scarcity of water is now the biggest threat in many parts of the world, specially in arid and semi arid regions. Establishing balance between water resources and the demands in a catchment scale basis could be one of the most important strategies to overcome this problem. In this regard, determination and analysis of water balance components (inputs and outputs) would be necessary. This study has focused on estimation of water balance components in arid-mountainous catchment of Manshad in Yazd province of Iran, during the year 2006-2007 using remote sensing and GIS techniques. To estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of the catchment, time series of MODIS images were obtained and used via Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) approach. Measured precipitation (P) and runoff (R) data of the catchment were also used to calculate water balance equation components. Results indicated that a large volume of catchment water (about 70%) is wasted through evapotranspiration, while the rainfall is not enough to compensate this volume of water during the year. It seems that the negative (descending) trend has become dominant to the water budget of the area and gradually moves to harsh conditions of water shortage in future decades. Therefore, some actions would be necessary to overcome the problem. Water conservation strategiesaEuroe improvement of water use efficiency, and control on agricultural field expansions are some solutions that could be advised for the studied catchment.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAY	2012	26	7					2069	2080		10.1007/s11269-012-9999-y								WOS:000303506900016

The effect of land use change and ecotourism on biodiversity: a case study of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, from 1985 to 2008	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Development in biodiversity rich areas is of global concern. While development may lead to socioeconomic benefits, this often comes concomitant with biodiversity loss and deforestation. Biodiversity rich areas present the opportunity for both improvements in socioeconomic conditions and conservation; however numerous challenges exist. Costa Rica's Manuel Antonio National Park presents an ideal case study to investigate the balance between alternative forms of development which have contrasting environmental impacts. The Manuel Antonio region is a highly dynamic landscape experiencing deforestation, from agriculture, cattle ranching and oil palm plantations; and also reforestation from abandonment of land holdings and nature oriented tourism. Landscape dynamics are closely intertwined with the livelihoods and perspectives on biodiversity conservation of local communities, determining ecological sustainability. We use an analysis combining multi-temporal remote sensing of land cover dynamics from 1985 to 2008 with questionnaire data from local families on their socioeconomic status, perspectives on conservation, and perceived changes in local wildlife populations. Our results show that, while regeneration occurred and forest fragmentation in the area decreased from 1985 to 2008, Manuel Antonio National Park is rapidly becoming isolated. Decreasing ecological connectivity is related to the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations adjacent to the park and throughout the lowland areas. Perceived decreases in wildlife abundance and compositional change are evident throughout the area, with local communities attributing this primarily to illegal hunting activities. Nature based tourism in the area presents an effective strategy for conservation, including reductions in hunting, through increased valuation of biodiversity and protected areas, and socioeconomic advantages. However, without urgent efforts to limit deforestation and preserve the remaining forested corridor connecting the park to core primary forest, the ability to maintain biodiversity in the park will be reduced.

We are now at the beginning of the international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to stratify biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24% increase in the overall biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii) distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions.				matin, shafique/F-2111-2015	matin, shafique/0000-0002-8533-2148; CHITALE, VISHWAS/0000-0001-8661-8204												0960-3115	1572-9710				MAY	2012	21	5			SI		1229	1250		10.1007/s10531-012-0233-2								WOS:000302570400006

Impact of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity richness in Nicobar Islands (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), India	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Occurrences of extreme events are likely to cause major decline in global biodiversity. In one such event, on December 26, 2004 tsunami caused extensive damage and irreparable losses to the ecology and biodiversity of low-lying areas of the countries located around the Indian Ocean region. Archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, one of the richest centre of endemism and biodiversity in the Indo-Malayan region, suffered great loss of forests and coastal biodiversity owing to its closeness to the epicenter of tsunami, i.e. just off the coast of Indonesia. There is little insight into the resilience and rate of recovery pattern of tropical coastal habitats consequent to catastrophic impacts of tsunami. It's important to study the impacts of tsunami on the forest and biodiversity in order to suggest mitigation, restoration measures and long-term conservation planning. Here we have assessed the immediate after-effects of December 26, 2004 tsunami on the forests and areas prioritized for biodiversity conservation analyzing pre and post tsunami satellite imageries. The effect of topographic patterns of Island's coastal areas and their distance from the epicenter of tsunami with respect to changes in the forests and different levels of biologically rich areas modeled for prioritization for different groups of Islands in Nicobar has been studied. Great Nicobar accounted for higher proportion of total forest area damaged and submerged in Nicobar, followed by Central Nicobar and Car Nicobar. Mangroves, littoral forest, beach forest and low land swamps and Syzygium swamps were most affected. Study brings out spatially explicit scenario of damaged, submerged and lost forest areas and corresponding area statistics, vital for understanding and mitigating medium and long term effects of tsunami an extreme event.																	0960-3115					MAY	2012	21	5			SI		1267	1287		10.1007/s10531-011-0214-x								WOS:000302570400008

Ian			Reconciling classifications of ecologically and biologically significant areas in the world's oceans	MARINE POLICY												The classification of marine habitats is a critical first step towards the protection of marine biodiversity and the sustainable management of the world's oceans. Recently, the topic has received heightened attention as the 2012 deadline for meeting international commitments under the convention on biological diversity (CBD) approaches. These commitments require the development of a unified approach to identifying high-seas areas in need of protection. To determine the best approach, criteria for identifying sensitive areas proposed by the CBD and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations were compared to the ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) criteria developed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The comparison demonstrates that, with some minor refinements, the EBSA criteria are parsimonious and encompass all other criteria proposed to date. To identify the most suitable approach for defining EBSAs, 16 classifications of the world's oceans, ranging from coastal regions to the high-seas, were reviewed for their suitability to define EBSAs. The classifications differed in substantive ways, including analytical methods (from quantitative analyses to subjective interpretations), data sources (either physical or biological), and the realm to which they were applied (high-seas, coastal, or deep-ocean). No method currently provides an integrated, whole-ecosystem approach to identifying a comprehensive set of important marine areas. To move to a singular, multi-attribute, description of EBSAs requires an explicit, reproducible methodology. Here, the EBSA approach is formalised as an adaptive method that integrates existing classifications in an efficient, holistic, and transparent manner, by explicitly considering important marine features (IMFs) and biologically sensitive areas (BSAs). The proposed approach directly addresses the EBSA criteria, and is applicable across the different realms of the world's oceans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

CURRENT SCIENCE												Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.) is a dominant tree species, whose natural range lies between 20-32 degrees N lat. and 75-95 degrees E long., is spread across 10 million ha in India. Species distribution models predict the species geographic ranges from occurrence records and site-specific environmental data. Here, we have (i) generated the 1960s scenario for sal species on the basis of the existing published literature; (ii) confirmed the species occurrence data using satellite imagery for the period of 1972-75; (iii) run the Maxent species distribution model to predict the distribution for the year 2020 under climate change scenario SRES A1-B and (iv) validated the prediction using more than double the amount of species occurrence data gathered during the last decade (1998-2008). The model identified moisture as the key player that would influence the distribution to shift towards northern and eastern India, with greater than 90% certainty.

India's plant diversity database at landscape level on geospatial platform: prospects and utility in today's changing climate	CURRENT SCIENCE												Characterization, quantification and monitoring of biodiversity have been among the major challenges in biodiversity conservation. Until recently, spatial ecological database in India was almost non-existent. There is need of a robust and quality database of the biological diversity at species, community, ecosystem and landscape levels for identification of vulnerable ecosystems and risk species. in order to have a national level database on the spatial distribution of biological diversity, a nationwide project on the biodiversity characterization at landscape level was implemented and studies were carried out between 1998 and 2010 to characterize and map the flowering plants richness in the forested landscapes. The spatial database on vegetation types generated from temporal IRS LISS-III satellite imagery, road/rail network and settlements from topomaps and high-resolution satellite images, and species richness from field sampling were used to generate the spatially explicit species distribution maps and statistics. This study has resulted in the creation of a large baseline spatial database on vegetation types, porosity, patchiness, interspersion, juxtaposition, fragmentation, disturbance regimes, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and biological richness.																	0011-3891					APR 25	2012	102	8					1136	1142										WOS:000304224300018

An ecological assessment of pasturelands in the Balkhash area of Kazakhstan with remote sensing and models	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The 187 million hectares of pasturelands in Kazakhstan play a key role in the nation's economy, as livestock production accounted for 54% of total agricultural production in 2010. However, more than half of these lands have been degraded as a result of unregulated grazing practices. Therefore, effective long term ecological monitoring of pasturelands in Kazakhstan is imperative to ensure sustainable pastureland management. As a case study in this research, we demonstrated how the ecological conditions could be assessed with remote sensing technologies and pastureland models. The example focuses on the southern Balkhash area with study sites on a foothill plain with Artemisia-ephemeral plants and a sandy plain with psammophilic vegetation in the Turan Desert. The assessment was based on remotely sensed imagery and meteorological data, a geobotanical archive and periodic ground sampling. The Pasture agrometeorological model was used to calculate biological, ecological and economic indicators to assess pastureland condition. The results showed that field surveys, meteorological observations, remote sensing and ecological models, such as Pasture, could be combined to effectively assess the ecological conditions of pasturelands and provide information about forage production that is critically important for balancing grazing and ecological conservation.																	1748-9326					APR-JUN	2012	7	2							025203	10.1088/1748-9326/7/2/025203								WOS:000307590300033

The burnt areas observed in six conservation units situated in north of the State of Minas Gerais were snapped in the period of September 3rd to October 5th, 2008, using semi-automatic segmentation of LandSat 5 TM images. A total of 190 burnt areas were mapped and the detections were verified using the satellites hotspots generated by the Brazilian National Space Research Institute - INPE. The burnt areas were also analyzed by size class in order to verify the hypothesis that the smallest areas are less liable to detection. The analysis of the hotspots distance to the limits of the burnt areas was done using buffers, with an increase of 1.00 km in every class, up to the limit of 9.00 km. Considering the investigated burnt areas, about 26.00% were detected, demonstrating limitations of the system to detect burnings smaller than 100.00 ha. In spite of that limitation, a great portion of the impacted area was detected, reaching a total of hits of about 71.00%. The results of location errors were considered satisfactory, considering the technical limitations of the spatial resolution of the utilized sensors. This infirmation may subside the technological advancement of orbital monitoring.																	0104-7760					APR-JUN	2012	18	2					335	343		10.1590/S0104-77602012000200019								WOS:000307369600019

In October 1983, a mangrove area of nearly 300 ha located on the southeastern coast of Brazil was impacted by a 3.5 million liter crude oil spill released by a broken pipeline. In order to assess the long-term effects of oil pollution on mangrove vegetation, we carried out a GIS-based multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs of the years 1962, 1994, 2000 and 2003. Photointerpretation, visual classification, class quantification, ground-truth and vegetation structure data were combined to evaluate the oil impact. Before the spill, the mangroves exhibited a homogeneous canopy and well-developed stands. More than ten years after the spill, the mangrove vegetation exhibited three distinct zones reflecting the long-term effects of the oil pollution. The most impacted zone (10.5 ha) presented dead trees, exposed substrate and recovering stands with reduced structural development. We suggest that the distinct impact and recovery zones reflect the spatial variability of oil removal rates in the mangrove forest. This study identifies the multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs as a useful tool for assessing a system's capacity for recovery and monitoring the long-term residual effects of pollutants on vegetation dynamics, thus giving support to mangrove forest management and conservation.

Examining protected area effectiveness in Sumatra: importance of regulations governing unprotected lands	CONSERVATION LETTERS												Several studies suggest that protected areas conserve forests because deforestation rates are lower inside than outside protected area boundaries. Such benefits may be overestimated when deforestation rates within protected areas are contrasted with rates in lands where forest conversion is sanctioned. Here, we reexamine protected area performance by disentangling the effects of land use regulations surrounding the 110,000 km(2) protected area network in Sumatra, Indonesia. We compared 1990-2000 deforestation rates across: (1) protected areas; (2) unprotected areas sanctioned for conversion; and (3) unprotected production areas where commercial logging is permitted but conversion is not. Deforestation rates were lower in protected areas than in conversion areas (Mean: -19.8%; 95% C.I.: -29.7-10.0%; P < 0.001), but did not differ from production areas (Mean: -3.3%; 95% C.I.: -9.6-2.6%; P = 0.273). The measured protection impact of Sumatran protected areas differs with land use regulations governing unprotected lands used for comparisons. If these regulations are not considered, protected areas will appear increasingly effective as larger unprotected forested areas are sanctioned for conversion and deforested. In the 1990s, production areas were as effective as protected areas at reducing deforestation. We discuss implications of these findings for carbon conservation.																	1755-263X					APR	2012	5	2					142	148		10.1111/j.1755-263X.2011.00220.x								WOS:000303872200008

REPRESENTATIVENESS OF LAND COVER COMPOSITION ALONG ROUTES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BREEDING BIRD SURVEY	AUK												The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is an annual transect point-count survey of >500 species and >3,500 survey routes (transects). Observers drive and record birds seen and heard within a radius of 400 m of 50 survey points ("stops") evenly spaced along a 39.4-km survey route. Thus, the land area along both sides of a route composes a linear or curvilinear landscape. Although BBS data have been used in many studies and conservation plans, there have been few attempts to determine how well the landscapes along BBS routes represent landscapes at larger spatial extents, particularly with regard to land-cover composition. Using data from the 2001 National Land Cover Database, we conducted a study of representativeness of 3,230 routes by comparing the differences in percent cover of 15 land-cover types in BBS landscapes (buffer width of 0.4 km surrounding a route) to larger local landscapes (10 km buffer width) and regions. At the local level, BBS landscapes were representative for most of the cover types except open water, which was underrepresented, and lightly developed open space, which was overrepresented. At the regional level, the collective composition of BBS landscapes was very similar to the composition within entire Bird Conservation Regions.

Remote sensing analysis reveals habitat, dispersal corridors and expanded distribution for the Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli	ORYX												Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the major threats to wildlife populations in tropical forests. Loss of habitat reduces the carrying capacity of the landscape and fragmentation disrupts biological processes and exposes wildlife populations to the effects of small population size, such as reduction of genetic diversity and increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli is threatened in particular by habitat disturbance because its population is small and it lives in an area where high human population density results in intense exploitation of natural resources. We used remotely-sensed data to assess the extent and distribution of gorilla habitat in the Cross River region and delineated potential dispersal corridors. Our analysis revealed >8,000 km(2) of tropical forest in the study region, 2,500 km(2) of which is in or adjacent to areas occupied by gorillas. We surveyed 12 areas of forest identified as potential gorilla habitat, 10 of which yielded new records of gorillas. The new records expand the known range of the Cross River gorilla by >50%, and support genetic analyses that suggest greater connectivity of the population than previously assumed. These findings demonstrate that considerable connected forest habitat remains and that the area could potentially support a much larger gorilla population if anthropogenic pressures such as hunting could be reduced.																	0030-6053					APR	2012	46	2					278	289		10.1017/S0030605310001857								WOS:000303837100025

Are Forest Disturbance Rates and Composition Influenced by Changing Ownerships, Conservation Easements, and Land Certification?	FOREST SCIENCE												This research examines the effect of recent landownership changes and new management stewardship mechanisms (e.g., forest certification and working forest conservation easements) on disturbance rates in Maine forests. We quantify forest disturbance rates between 2000 and 2007 and forest cover type composition in 2007, as detected by Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery, and relate these to possible influencing factors including landowner type, ownership stability, forest certification, and conservation easements. The cover type map was evaluated for agreement with US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis ground plot data and the change map was evaluated using visual interpretation of random sample locations on multiple years of Landsat data and aerial photos. Between 2000 and 2007, 1.6 million ha of commercial forestland changed ownership. Investment landowner types, timber investment management organizations and real estate investment trusts, were found to have the highest disturbance rates, significantly higher than those for public and conservation forest landowner groups. Forest lands that changed owners had disturbance rates similar to those with stable landowners. Disturbance rates on certified and easement forestlands, compared with those on noncertified and noneasement land, indicated no significant differences at the statewide scale. Public and conservation forestlands were found to have a higher proportion of coniferous forest and a lower component of deciduous forest compared with privately owned forests in the state. FOR.

Julian			Multi-scale marine biodiversity patterns inferred efficiently from habitat image processing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Cost-effective proxies of biodiversity and species abundance, applicable across a range of spatial scales, are needed for setting conservation priorities and planning action. We outline a rapid, efficient, and low-cost measure of spectral signal from digital habitat images that, being an effective proxy for habitat complexity, correlates with species diversity and requires little image processing or interpretation. We validated this method for coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, across a range of spatial scales (1 m to 10 km), using digital photographs of benthic communities at the transect scale and high-resolution Landsat satellite images at the reef scale. We calculated an index of image-derived spatial heterogeneity, the mean information gain (MIG), for each scale and related it to univariate (species richness and total abundance summed across species) and multivariate (species abundance matrix) measures of fish community structure, using two techniques that account for the hierarchical structure of the data: hierarchical (mixed-effect) linear models and distance-based partial redundancy analysis. Over the length and breadth of the GBR, MIG alone explained up to 29% of deviance in fish species richness, 33% in total fish abundance, and 25% in fish community structure at multiple scales, thus demonstrating the possibility of easily and rapidly exploiting spatial information contained in digital images to complement existing methods for inferring diversity and abundance patterns among fish communities. Thus, the spectral signal of unprocessed remotely sensed images provides an efficient and low-cost way to optimize the design of surveys used in conservation planning. In data-sparse situations, this simple approach also offers a viable method for rapid assessment of potential local biodiversity, particularly where there is little local capacity in terms of skills or resources for mounting in-depth biodiversity surveys.

Using imaging spectroscopy to estimate integrated measures of foliage nutritional quality	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Integrated measures of foliage nutritional quality that consider the influence of fibre and tannins on the digestibility of nitrogen (N) may provide a more meaningful estimate of forage quality than total foliar N for many herbivorous species. The ability to estimate available nitrogen (AvailN) on a landscape scale could have important applications for herbivore conservation and management. However, AvailN has never been modelled with imaging spectroscopy. 2. We collected hyperspectral remote sensing data (HyMap) over Eucalyptus trees in south-eastern Australia. Using a combination of laboratory near infrared spectrophotometry, a recently developed in vitro assay for AvailN and two powerful spectral transformation methods, continuum removal and derivative analysis, we developed linear regression models to scale concentrations of total foliar N, AvailN and digestible dry matter (DDM) fromleaf to canopy-level. 3. The model estimates achieved R 2 -values between 0 55 and 0 64 for AvailN, 0 54-0 60 for N and 0 75-0 78 for DDM. Ninety-five per cent of the wavebands selected by the models corresponded to known absorption features. This and the large contribution of a small number of wavebands suggest that it may be possible to develop prediction algorithms based on a few wavelengths that could be extrapolated to other landscape types. 4. This is the first time that integrated measures of foliage nutritional quality have been estimated with imaging spectroscopy. In combination with appropriate crown-delineation techniques, our methodology will enable users to map variations in these foliar constituents across forest canopies.

J	Redhead, J; Cuevas-Gonzales, M; Smith, G; Gerard, F; Pywell, R				Redhead, John; Cuevas-Gonzales, Maria; Smith, Geoffrey; Gerard, France; Pywell, Richard			Assessing the effectiveness of scrub management at the landscape scale using rapid field assessment and remote sensing	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Controlling scrub encroachment is a major challenge for conservation management on chalk grasslands. However, direct comparisons of scrub removal methods have seldom been investigated, particularly at the landscape scale. Effective monitoring of grassland scrub is problematic as it requires simultaneous information on large scale patterns in scrub cover and fine-scale changes in the grassland community. This study addressed this by combining analysis of aerial imagery with rapid field surveys in order to compare the effectiveness of four scrub management strategies on Defence Training Estate Salisbury Plain, UK. Study plots were sited within areas undergoing management and in unmanaged controls. Controls showed dramatic increases in scrub cover, with encroachment of a mean 1096 m(2) per hectare over ten years. Whilst all management strategies were effective in reducing scrub encroachment, they differed in their ability to influence regeneration of scrub and grassland quality. There was a general trend, evident in both the floral community and scrub levels, of increased effectiveness with increasing management intensity. The dual methodology proved highly effective, allowing rapid collection of data over a range of variables and spatial scales unavailable to each method individually. The methodology thus demonstrates potential for a useful monitoring tool. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zheng, YM; Zhang, HY; Niu, ZG; Gong, P				Zheng YaoMin; Zhang HaiYing; Niu ZhenGuo; Gong Peng			Protection efficacy of national wetland reserves in China	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Wetlands have the most abundant biodiversity, the highest carbon sequestration capacity, and the highest values for ecological services per unit area, of all the world's ecosystems. Practice has shown that establishing reserves is the most effective way of protecting typical ecosystems and their biodiversity, and saving rare or endangered wildlife. The Chinese government's policy is to protect wetland systems by establishing reserves that encompass a massive network of wetlands, including wetland nature reserves, internationally important wetlands, and wetland parks. Many are already established. The effect of protecting wetland nature reserves at the national level has not yet been reported. We used the latest database evaluating the protection value of wetland reserves, and remotely sensed wetland maps (1978-2008), developed by the same mapping specialists and based on the same classification system, and related environmental data, to evaluate the effects of protecting China's national wetland reserves over the last 30 years. We conclude that (i) the total area of wetland in the national wetland reserves has decreased over the last 30 years to 8152.47 km(2), and just 8% of China's net decrease in wetlands; (ii) about 79% of the 91 national wetland reserves are in a poor condition. These are generally located around the Yangtze River, Eastern Coast, the Three Rivers Source, and Southwest China. Protection measures should be undertaken urgently in these areas. Only 15% of national wetland reserves are under sound protection, and these are generally located in the upper reaches of the Songhua River; (iii) although 88% of national wetland reserves are primitive (relatively natural), implying that the site selection has been scientific, a high percentage of national wetland reserves show early warning signs of decline and require urgent attention; (iv) based on our evaluation of protection effects and pressures on ecology, we have made a priority list of national wetland reserves, and propose several protection strategies.

This study attempted to differentiate the impact of human activities on reductions in wetland vegetation in the Lixiahe wetlands, China, at multiple spatial scales. The reduction in wetland vegetation from 1988 to 2006 was quantified using Landsat data, and moving window analysis was used to detect hot spots of vegetation reduction in the wetlands at window sizes of 150, 1,000 and 2,500 m. Logistic regression was used to examine the influence on occurrence of the hot spots of landscape variables representing accessibility to human settlements and roads. Over the study period, wetland vegetation declined by 69%, which was largely attributable to aquaculture development. The hot spots of wetland vegetation reduction exhibited increasing patch size, but decreasing patch number with increasing window size. The occurrence probability of the hot spots rose significantly with increasing proximity to rural settlements and secondary roads, with only a minor response to the presence of towns. With increasing window size, however, the density of secondary roads and rural settlements were less influential, whereas the presence of major roads had more influence on hot spot occurrence. These trends are reasonable in that wetland use activities in the study area are directly associated with the settlements and roads in the rural areas at local scales, but are also indirectly associated with the major transportation network from a regional perspective. Overall, these results suggested that different human activities, as distinguished by their sources on the landscape, could have different environmental consequences at different scales for scale-dependent features.

SATEEC estimates soil loss and sediment yield within river catchments using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and a spatially distributed sediment delivery ratio. Vegetation cover in protected areas has a significant effect in curtailing soil loss. The effect of rainfall was noted as two pronged, higher rainfall amounts received in the escarpment promote vegetation growth and vigour in the Amatole mountain range which in turn positively provides a protective cover to shield the soil from soil loss. The negative aspect of high rainfall is that it increases the rainfall erosivity. The Keiskamma catchment is predisposed to excessive rates of soil loss due to high soil erodibility, steep slopes, poor conservation practices and low vegetation cover. This soil erosion risk assessment shows that 35% of the catchment is prone to high to extremely high soil losses higher than 25 ton ha(-1) year(-1) whilst 65% still experience very low to moderate levels of soil loss of less than 25 ton ha(-1) year(-1). Object based classification highlighted the occurrence of enriched valley infill which flourishes in sediment laden ephemeral stream channels. This occurrence increases gully erosion due to overgrazing within ephemeral stream channels. Measures to curb further degradation in the catchment should thrive to strengthen the role of local institutions in controlling conservation practice.

With its ability to penetrate tropical forest canopies and detect three-dimensional forest structure, LiDAR may prove to be a major component of international strategies to measure and account for carbon emissions from and uptake by tropical forests. To date, however, basic ecological information such as height-diameter allometry and stand-level wood density have not been mechanistically incorporated into methods for mapping forest carbon at regional and global scales. A better incorporation of these structural patterns in forests may reduce the considerable time needed to calibrate airborne data with ground-based forest inventory plots, which presently necessitate exhaustive measurements of tree diameters and heights, as well as tree identifications for wood density estimation. Here, we develop a new approach that can facilitate rapid LiDAR calibration with minimal field data. Throughout four tropical regions (Panama, Peru, Madagascar, and Hawaii), we were able to predict aboveground carbon density estimated in field inventory plots using a single universal LiDAR model (r (2) = 0.80, RMSE = 27.6 Mg C ha(-1)). This model is comparable in predictive power to locally calibrated models, but relies on limited inputs of basal area and wood density information for a given region, rather than on traditional plot inventories. With this approach, we propose to radically decrease the time required to calibrate airborne LiDAR data and thus increase the output of high-resolution carbon maps, supporting tropical forest conservation and climate mitigation policy.

Ferry; Zhang, Cui-Ping; Dai, Zhi-Cong			Rubber and pulp plantations represent a double threat to Hainan's natural tropical forests	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Hainan, the largest tropical island in China, belongs to the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot and harbors large areas of tropical forests, particularly in the uplands. The Changhua watershed is the cradle of Hainan's main river and a center of endemism for plants and birds. The watershed contains great habitat diversity and is an important conservation area. We analyzed the impact of rubber and pulp plantations on the distribution and area of tropical forest in the watershed, using remote sensing analysis of Landsat images from 1988, 1995 and 2005. From 1988 to 1995, natural forest increased in area (979-1040 sq km) but decreased rapidly (763 sq km) over the next decade. Rubber plantations increased steadily through the study period while pulp plantations appeared after 1995 but occupied 152 sq km by 2005. Rubber and pulp plantations displace different types of natural forest and do not replace one another. Because pulp is not as profitable as rubber and existing pulp processing capacity greatly exceeds local supply, considerable pressure exists on remaining upland forests. We recommend for future management that these plantation forests be reclassified as 'industrial', making a clear policy distinction between natural and industrial forestry. Additionally, the local government should work to enforce existing laws preventing forest conversion on marginal and protected areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wetlands of India: inventory and assessment at 1: 50,000 scale using geospatial techniques	CURRENT SCIENCE												Conservation and wise use of wetlands has been given priority world over. India harbours diverse types of wetlands. This study highlights the findings of the national-level inventory and assessment of wetlands carried out using RESOURCESAT-1 LISS-III data of 2006-07 at 1 : 50,000 scale. A hierarchical system comprising 19 classes based on Ramsar definition has been used to classify the wetlands of India. The extent of wetlands has been estimated to be 15.26 m ha. Inland wetlands account for 69.22% (10.564 m ha), whereas the coastal wetlands account for 27.13% (4.14 m ha). The high-altitude wetlands (situated > 3000 m asl) in the Himalayan states were also mapped, comprising 126,249 ha of areal extent. The status of wetlands in terms of water spread, turbidity of open water and aquatic vegetation has shown significant variation during pre- and post-monsoon seasons. This article highlights the detailed results at state level and the status of wetlands in terms of water spread, aquatic vegetation and turbidity of open water in the wetlands in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons.																	0011-3891					MAR 25	2012	102	6					852	856										WOS:000302386000014

The Imatong Central Forest Reserve (ICFR) in South Sudan together with the nearby Dongotana Hills and the Agoro-Agu Forest Reserve (AFR) in Northern Uganda share a boundary and encompass a biologically diverse montane ecosystem. This study used satellite data combined with general human population trends to examine the impact of armed conflict and its outcome on similar forest ecosystems both during and after hostilities have occurred. A Disturbance Index (DI) was used to investigate the location and extent of forest cover loss and gain in three areas for two key time periods from mid-1980s to 2001 and 2003 to 2010. Results indicate that the rate of forest recovery was significantly higher than the rate of disturbance both during and after wartime in and around the ICFR and the net rate of forest cover change remained largely unchanged for the two time periods. In contrast, the nearby Dongotana Hills experienced relatively high rates of disturbance during both periods; however, post war period losses were largely offset by some gains in forest cover. For the AFR in Uganda, the rate of forest recovery was much higher during the second period, coinciding with the time people began leaving overcrowded camps. The diversity and merging of floristic regions in a very narrow band around the lmatong Mountains makes this area biologically distinct and of outstanding conservation importance; therefore, any future loss in forest cover is important to monitor - particularly in South Sudan where large numbers of people continue to return following the 2005 peace agreement and the 2011 Referendum on Independence.

Potential Overestimation of Carbon Sequestration in the Forested Wild land-Urban Interface in Northern New England	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY												Forest area determined from remote sensing derived land cover maps alone at moderate resolution may not appropriately reflect dynamics of housing development in the forested wildland-urban interface (WUI). We conducted a study to quantify how housing development could affect estimates of forest carbon sequestration (F(S) in northern New England, where the percentage of WUI in relation to total land area is nearly double the national average. We found that housing development in the forested WUI could potentially reduce FCS by at least 4% for the region, ranging from 1.7 to 9.3% at the county level, compared with estimates without considering housing effects. This impact is expected to increase by 40% by 2030, based on predicted future increase in housing density within the study area. The majority of housing effect occurred in the intermix WUI where houses and forests intermingle. County-level differences between the approaches with and without considering housing effects decreased from coastal to inland areas because of a decrease in housing density. More than 99% of the difference on FCS estimation came from the low- and medium-density WUI. Although retaining the forest but allowing housing within it may be a good compromise for many reasons for local or regional planning, our results serve as a reminder that decisions related to such housing developments are not carbon neutral.

J	Godar, J; Tizado, EJ; Pokorny, B				Godar, Javier; Tizado, Emilio Jorge; Pokorny, Benno			Who is responsible for deforestation in the Amazon? A spatially explicit analysis along the Transamazon Highway in Brazil	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding actor-specific responsibility for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is key in adjusting policy and resource allocation in the face of current forest destruction. However, previous research shows that there is great variability in such assessments. To contribute to the ongoing discussions on forest conservation and rural development policies in the Amazon, this paper studies actor-specific deforestation and its environmental effects in four municipalities situated along the Transamazon Highway. We used spatially explicit methods that integrate a database of 8281 georeferenced properties with a time series of remote-sensing data covering four periods between 1986 and 2007. We also included landscape ecology metrics as improved indicators of the complex environmental effects of forest fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that smallholders (defined as colonists who own less than 100 ha of land) were responsible for 23% of total deforestation in the study region while accounting for 55% of the total properties. We also explored the relationship between property size and deforestation at the property level, finding that it closely follows a power distribution. Property deforestation increased with property size, while the percentage of property deforestation decreased. In spite of this, compliance with current legal requirements to maintain 50% of property forest cover was not statistically different between smallholders and largeholders. In comparison to municipalities dominated by medium- and large-scale ranchers, the smallholder-dominated municipality of Medicilandia showed better performance in all applied landscape metrics with well-established relationships with the provision of important environmental goods and services. Although all studied municipalities showed severe accumulated deforestation, Medicilandia experienced an abrupt decrease in municipal deforestation after 1999 to just 0.03% year(-1), while municipalities dominated by larger holders maintained or increased their previous deforestation rates to between 0.90% and 1.34% year(-1) in the same period. This indicates that the smallholders' productions schemes in our study area might present potential for agricultural frontier stabilization based on improved land-use efficiency. The policy implications of our findings are discussed, especially with regard to the role of smallholders in productive forest conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.				Tizado, E.

The need to quantify the amount of erosion, sediment delivery, and sediment yield in a spatially distributed form has become essential at the watershed scale and in the implementation of conservation efforts. In this study, an effort to predict potential annual soil loss and sediment yield is conducted by using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model with adaptation in a geographic information system (GIS). The rainfall erosivity, soil erosivity, slope length, steepness, plant cover, and management practice and conservation support practice factors are among the basic factors that are obtained from monthly and annual rainfall data, soil map of the region, 50-m digital elevation model, remote sensing (RS) techniques (with use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and GIS, respectively. The Ilam dam watershed which is located southeast part of Ilam province in western Iran is considered as study area. The study indicates that the slope length and steepness of the RUSLE model are the most effective factors controlling soil erosion in the region. The mean annual soil loss and sediment yield are also predicted. Moreover, the results indicated that 45.25%, 12.18%, 12.44%, 10.79%, and 19.34% of the study area are under minimal, low, moderate, high, and extreme actual erosion risks, respectively. Since 30.13% of the region is under high and extreme erosion risk, adoption of suitable conservation measures seems to be inevitable. So, the RUSLE model integrated with RS and GIS techniques has a great potential for producing accurate and inexpensive erosion and sediment yield risk maps in Iran.																	1866-7511					MAR	2012	5	2					285	296		10.1007/s12517-010-0220-4								WOS:000301181800009

Identification of hot spots and well managed areas of Pichavaram mangrove using Landsat TM and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV: an example of coastal resource conservation along Tamil Nadu Coast, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The present work is a multi-temporal satellite based study on the spatial dynamic of an important coastal habitat, the Pichavaram mangrove ecosystem, over a period of 15 years. The Pichavaram mangrove forest near Chidambaram, South India is the second largest mangrove forest in the world. Unsupervised classification, the Iterative Self Organising Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA), has been used to classify the mangrove cover into the open and dense classes. The status of the classes has been monitored using Landsat TM of 1991, 2001, and Resourcesat-1 LISS IV of 2006 satellite data. The study demonstrated that by classifying mangrove ecosystem into just the 3 classes using remote sensing data and by studying their temporal variations, it is possible to get a reasonably accurate picture of the extent and condition of the mangrove ecosystem. The total area of the Pichavaram mangrove showed a net increase of 2.51 km(2) within a span of 15 years (1991 to 2006). The hot spots that are at a risk of being degraded, and on the other hand, the mangrove areas that are well managed are identified using Geographical Information System (GIS) tools for the restoration and conservation measures.																	1400-0350					MAR	2012	16	1					1	12		10.1007/s11852-011-0162-3								WOS:000300888500001

This is expected to have negative effects on animal diversity. To counteract encroachment and develop structural heterogeneity grazing is a widely used management practice. Here, we aim to functionally interpret changes in vegetation composition and configuration following grazing management on habitat suitability for sand lizards. Aerial photographs taken over a period of 16 years were used to quantify changes in vegetation composition. A GIS-based method was developed to calculate habitat suitability for sand lizards in a spatially explicit manner, encompassing differences in vegetation structure and patch size. From 1987 to 2003 dune vegetation shifted from small patches of moss and sand to larger patches covered by shrubs and grasses. Grazing management did not have any significant effect on the overall level of heterogeneity, measured as habitat suitability for sand lizards. However, on a more local scale highly suitable patches in 1987 were deteriorating whereas unsuitable patches became more suitable in 2003. This inversion results from a broad shift with shrubs being a limiting habitat element in 1987 to sandy patches being the limiting element in 2003. Future changes are believed to negatively impact sand lizards. The habitat suitability model has proven to be a useful tool to functionally interpret changes in coastal dune vegetation heterogeneity from an animal's perspective. Further research should aim to include multiple species operating on different scale levels to fully capture the natural landscape dynamics.

J	Meager, JJ; Schlacher, TA; Nielsen, T				Meager, Justin J.; Schlacher, Thomas A.; Nielsen, Tara			Humans alter habitat selection of birds on ocean-exposed sandy beaches	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Resource-selection functions (RSFs) can quantify and predict the density of animal populations across heterogeneous landscapes and are important conservation tools in areas subject to human disturbance. Sandy beach ecosystems have comparatively low habitat heterogeneity and structural relief in the intertidal zone, but intense human use. We aimed to develop predictive RSFs for birds on ocean-exposed sandy beaches at two spatial scales, 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale), and to test whether habitat selection of birds that commonly use the surfbeachdune interface is influenced by the rates of human activities. Location Moreton and North Stradbroke Island, eastern Australia. Methods Avifauna and human activities were mapped on three sandy beaches covering 79 km of coastline for 15 months. Habitat characteristics of the surfbeach-dune interface were derived from remote sensing and ground surveys. RSFs were developed for 12 species of birds at two spatial scales: 25 ha (local scale) and 250 ha (landscape scale). Results At local (25 ha) and landscape scales (250 ha), dune dimensions and the extent and type of vegetation structure were important predictors of bird density. Adding the frequency of human activities improved the predictive power of RSFs, suggesting that habitat selection of birds on beaches is modified by human use of these environments. Human activities occurred mostly in the mid-to lower intertidal zone of the beach, overlapping closely with the preferred habitats of Silver Gulls (Larus novaehollandiae), Pied Oystercatchers (Haematopus longirostris), Red-capped Plovers (Charadrius ruficapillus) and endangered Little Terns (Sternula albifrons). Main conclusions In addition to demonstrating the appropriateness of RSFs to the surf-beach-dune interface, our results stress the need for systematic conservation planning for these ecosystems, where ecological values have traditionally been subsidiary to the maintenance of sand budgets and erosion control.

J	Liu, XP; Lao, CH; Li, X; Liu, YL; Chen, YM				Liu, Xiaoping; Lao, Chunhua; Li, Xia; Liu, Yilun; Chen, Yimin			An integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS and swarm intelligence for zoning protected ecological areas	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Interest in protecting ecological areas is increasing because of land uses conflicts and environmental pressures. The optimal zoning of protected ecological areas belongs to a NP-hard problem because it is subject to both box and spatial constraints. A challenge in solving area optimization problems emerges with the increasing size of a study region. In this article, an integrated approach of remote sensing, GIS and modified ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed for application in zoning protected ecological areas. Significant modifications have been made in the conventional ACO so that it can be further extended to solve zoning problems in large regions. An improved selection strategy is designed to accelerate the progress of sites selection for artificial ants. Another important modification in ACO is to incorporate the neighborhood diffusion strategy into pheromone updating. The optimal objective is to generate protected areas that maximize both ecological suitability and spatial compactness. The modified ACO model has been successfully applied to a case study involving an area of 25,483 cells in Dongguan, Guangdong, China. The experiments have demonstrated that the proposed model is an efficient and effective optimization technique for generating optimal protection. The modified ACO model only requires approximately 119 s for determining near-optimal solutions. Furthermore, the proposed method performs better than other methods, including simulated annealing, genetic algorithm, iterative relaxation, basic ACO, and density slicing.

Analyzing the agricultural transition in Mato Grosso, Brazil, using satellite-derived indices	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The Amazonian state of Mato Grosso is the main production area for soybeans in Brazil and contains 31.3% of the national production as of 2009. The rapid evolution of the agricultural systems in this area shows that the region is experiencing a rapid agricultural transition. In this paper, we broke down this transition process into three steps: crop expansion, agricultural intensification and ecological intensification. We used remote sensing products to develop and compute satellite-derived indices describing the main agricultural dynamics during the cropping years from 2000-2001 to 2006-2007. Our results indicated that Mato Grosso is continuing to expand its agricultural sector, with a 43% increase in the net cropped area during the study period. Although this expansion mainly occurred in the cerrado ecoregion until the early 2000s, the forest ecoregion is experiencing expansion at this time. We observed that 65% of the crop expansion in Mato Grosso from 2000 to 2006 occurred in this ecoregion. However, we did not identify this crop expansion as the major driver of deforestation in Mato Grosso because only 12.6% of the cleared areas were directly converted into croplands. Agricultural intensification also evolved rapidly, as the proportion of the net cropped area cultivated with double cropping systems harvesting two successive commercial crops (i.e., soybean and corn or soybean and cotton) increased from 6% to 30% during the study period. Finally, we found that ecological intensification occurred because the region's farmers planted a non-commercial crop (i.e., millet or sorghum) after the soybean harvest to prevent soil erosion, improve soil quality, break pest cycles, maintain soil moisture and set the conditions for high-quality no-tillage operations. In 2006-2007, 62% of the net cropped area was permanently covered by crops during the entire rainy season. This practice allowed the farmers to diversify their production, as shown by the positive evolution of the Area Diversity Index. Future scholars can use the method proposed in this paper to improve their understanding of the forces driving the agricultural dynamics in Mato Grosso. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using remote sensing technologies to enhance resource conservation and agricultural productivity in underutilized lands of South Asia	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Satisfying the food demands of an ever-increasing population, preserving the natural resource base, and improving livelihoods are major challenges for South Asia. A large area of land in the Middle and Lower Gangetic Plains of South Asia remains either uncultivated or underused following the rice harvest in the kharif (wet) season. The area includes "rice-fallow," estimated at 6.7 million ha, flood-prone riversides ("diara lands," 2.4 million ha), waterlogged areas (4.9 million ha), and salt-affected soils (2.3 million ha). Bringing these lands under production could substantially improve the food supply and enhance livelihoods in the region. This paper describes a methodological case study that targeted resource-conserving technologies in underused lands of the Ballia District of eastern Uttar Pradesh (India) using multispectral remote-sensing images. Classification of temporal satellite data IRS-P6 in combination with Spot VGT 2 permitted the identification of all major categories of underused land during the post-rainy rabi/winter season, with an average accuracy of 89%. Based on three-year averages of field demonstrations, farmers gained an additional income of $63 ha(-1) by introducing raised beds in salt-affected soils; $140 and $800 ha(-1) by introducing deepwater rice varieties (monsoon) and boro rice (winter) in waterlogged areas; and $581 ha(-1) by introducing zero-till lentil (winter) in rain-fed fallow lowland. Timely wheat planting through zero-tillage implies an additional income of $147 ha(-1) and could increase wheat production by 35,000-65,000 tons in the district. The methodologies and technologies suggested in the study are applicable to more than 15 million ha of underutilized lands of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia. If the technologies are precisely applied, they can result in more than 3000 million US $ of additional income every year to these poverty prone areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Monitoring degradation in arid and semi-arid forests and woodlands: The case of the argan woodlands (Morocco)	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Arid and semi-arid forests and woodlands (hereafter called "dryland forests"), in spite of their ecological and social importance, have received little attention in land change studies. Growing evidence shows that these forests have been receding at very high rates in many places, suggesting a need for a better understanding of the processes and causes of dryland forest degradation. Changes in the extent of dryland forests are debated in part because estimates of forest and woodland areas in drylands are uncertain. Causal explanations of the degradation tend to draw on the literature on desertification and tropical deforestation, and to emphasize either local or remote, and either social or biophysical drivers. This study contributes to a better understanding of dryland forest degradation as a basis for conservation policies. Firstly, we argue that monitoring arid and semi-arid forests and woodlands using area estimates may lead to an underestimation of the severity of change because tree density change often exceeds area change. Secondly, we argue that the analysis of degradation processes in these multifunctional landscapes should integrate both local and remote, and both social and biophysical factors. We use a case study of degradation in the argania woodlands in semi-arid to arid Southwest Morocco to test these two claims. We used gridded tree counts on aerial photographs and satellite images to estimate forest change between 1970 and 2007, and we tested several possible causes of change on the basis of original socioeconomic field surveys and climatic and topographic data. We found that forest density declined by 44.5% during this period, a figure that is significantly underestimated if forest area change is used as a measure of degradation. Increasing aridity and, to a lesser extent, fuelwood extraction were related to forest decline. No effect of grazing by local livestock was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goals were to assess the effectiveness of Romanian protected areas at stemming unsanctioned logging, and to assess post-socialist logging in their surrounding landscapes, during a time of massive socio-economic and institutional change. Our results suggest that forest cover remained fairly stable shortly before and after 1990, but forest disturbance rates increased sharply in two waves after 1995 and 2005. We found substantial disturbances inside protected areas, even within core reserve areas. Moreover, disturbances in the matrix surrounding protected areas were even lower than inside protected area boundaries. We suggest that these rates are largely the result of high logging rates, triggered by rapid ownership and institutional changes. These trends compromise the goals of Romania's protected area network, lead to an increasing loss of forest habitat, and more isolated and more fragmented protected areas. The effectiveness of Romania's protected area network in terms of its ability to safeguard biodiversity is therefore most likely decreasing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From an ecological perspective, this is light pollution, which causes changes in reproductive physiology, migration and foraging of many species and ultimately leads to loss of biodiversity. Some seabirds are intimately linked with the light features of their environments because they are nocturnally active. We report light-induced groundings of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) during a 2-year study (2008 and 2009) in Sao Miguel Island, in the Azores archipelago, and investigate the spatial correlation of locations of grounded birds with an annual composite of remotely sensed stable lights. Results indicate that 16.7% of fledglings are attracted to lights. The exposure of shearwater colonies in the study area to artificial night lighting is low overall. Four colonies account for 87% of the grounded birds. The distance each bird was found from the closest colony was best explained by the ratio of the satellite-measured light levels at the grounding spot to the light levels at the assigned colony of origin. These results demonstrate that satellite-observed nighttime lights are sufficient to assess risk to marine birds at the scale of oceanic islands and indicate their utility for monitoring the effectiveness of programs to manage lighting to reduce risk for these species and conducting global assessments of species vulnerability. To minimize the impact on Cory's shearwater and other marine birds, we recommend measures such as reduction and control of lighting intensity near colony locations, while continuing and re-enforcing rescue campaigns.

Measuring the Impacts of Community-based Grasslands Management in Mongolia's Gobi	PLOS ONE												We assessed a donor-funded grassland management project designed to create both conservation and livelihood benefits in the rangelands of Mongolia's Gobi desert. The project ran from 1995 to 2006, and we used remote sensing Normalized Differential Vegetation Index data from 1982 to 2009 to compare project grazing sites to matched control sites before and after the project's implementation. We found that the productivity of project grazing sites was on average within 1% of control sites for the 20 years before the project but generated 11% more biomass on average than the control areas from 2000 to 2009. To better understand the benefits of the improved grasslands to local people, we conducted 280 household interviews, 8 focus group discussions, and 31 key informant interviews across 6 districts. We found a 12% greater median annual income as well as a range of other socioeconomic benefits for project households compared to control households in the same areas. Overall, the project generated measurable benefits to both nature and people. The key factors underlying project achievements that may be replicable by other conservation projects include the community-driven approach of the project, knowledge exchanges within and between communities inside and outside the country, a project-supported local community organizer in each district, and strong community leadership.					van Beukering, Pieter/0000-0001-7146-4409												1932-6203					FEB 1	2012	7	2							e30991	10.1371/journal.pone.0030991								WOS:000301977500024	22312436

Via analyzing the area variations of various land use types and the historical statistics of Hulun Lake's water level during this period, the study found that the water use of the upstream by the population pressure and economy development might be related with the decline in Hulun Lake's water levels which caused the increase in the sandy area.

Ring-shaped velocity distribution functions in energy-dispersed structures formed at the boundaries of a proton stream injected into a transverse magnetic field: Test-kinetic results	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS												In this paper, we discuss the formation of ring-shaped and gyro-phase restricted velocity distribution functions (VDFs) at the edges of a cloud of protons injected into non-uniform distributions of the electromagnetic field. The velocity distribution function is reconstructed using the forward test-kinetic method. We consider two profiles of the electric field: (1) a non-uniform E-field obtained by solving the Laplace equation consistent with the conservation of the electric drift and (2) a constant and uniform E-field. In both cases, the magnetic field is similar to the solutions obtained for tangential discontinuities. The initial velocity distribution function is Liouville mapped along numerically integrated trajectories. The numerical results show the formation of an energy-dispersed structure due to the energy-dependent displacement of protons towards the edges of the cloud by the gradient-B drift. Another direct effect of the gradient-B drift is the formation of ring-shaped velocity distribution functions within the velocity-dispersed structure. Higher energy particles populate the edges of the proton beam, while smaller energies are located in the core. Non-gyrotropic velocity distribution functions form on the front-side and trailing edge of the cloud; this effect is due to remote sensing of energetic particles with guiding centers inside the beam. The kinetic features revealed by the test-kinetic solutions have features similar to in-situ velocity distribution functions observed by Cluster satellites in the magnetotail, close to the neutral sheet.

EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES AND ESTIMATION OF STAGE OF GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT IN A BASIN - A CASE STUDY	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Rapid industrial development, urbanization and increase in agricultural production have led to freshwater shortage in many parts of the world. For sustainable development of water resources, it is imperative to make quantitative estimations of the available water resources. The study area, the Kurmapalli Vagu Basin, is located in the semi-arid tropics of the Deccan Plateau and is a chronic drought-prone, backward and endemic fluoride area. Hence evaluation of groundwater resources and stage of groundwater development of the Kurmapalli Vagu Basin was carried out utilizing remote sensing and geographical information system techniques in conjunction with conventional methods. The arithmetic average method was used to compute the total quantity of water from precipitation received by the basin. The groundwater resources were evaluated based on Groundwater Resource Estimation Committee norms. Groundwater recharge from rainfall, canals, return flow of irrigation, minor irrigation tanks and water conservation structures were also estimated. The total groundwater recharge and annual utilizable groundwater resources from various sources were computed. The net annual groundwater draft was estimated based on the number and type of wells and unit draft. The groundwater balance of the basin works out to be 1.95 MCM. The stage of groundwater development for the Kurmapalli Vagu Basin as on date works out to be 80.6% which falls in the semi-critical category. Suggestions have been made for proper augmentation of groundwater resources. Further, to ensure sustainable development of the basin water-harvesting structures have been proposed.

Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 x 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.																	0921-2973					FEB	2012	27	2			SI		159	169		10.1007/s10980-011-9651-x								WOS:000300088700002

Spectral heterogeneity of QuickBird satellite data is related to fine-scale plant species spatial turnover in semi-natural grasslands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Can satellite data be related to fine-scale species diversity and does the integrated use of field and satellite data provide information that can be used in the estimation of fine-scale species diversity in semi-natural grassland sites? Location: The Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden). Methods: Field work including the on-site description of 62 semi-natural grassland sites (represented by three 0.5 m x 0.5 m plots per site) was performed to record response variables (total species richness, mean species richness and species spatial turnover) and field-measured explanatory variables (field-layer height and distance between plots). Within each site, QuickBird satellite data were extracted from a standardized sample area by associating each field plot with a 3 x 3 pixel window (1 pixel = 2.4 m x 2.4 m). Explanatory variables (the normalized difference vegetation index and spectral heterogeneity) were generated from the satellite data. Correlation tests, univariate regressions, variance partitioning and multivariate linear regressions were used to analyse the associations between response and explanatory variables. Results: There was a significant association between the spectral heterogeneity of the near-infrared band and the field-measured spatial turnover of species. The most parsimonious explanatory model for each response variable included both field-measured and satellite-generated explanatory variables. The models explained 30-35% of the variation in species diversity (total richness 36%, mean richness 31%, species turnover 33%). Conclusions: High spatial resolution satellite data are capable of supplying fine-scale habitat information that is relevant for the monitoring and conservation management of fine-scale plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands.

In loess hilly and gully regions, to prevent soil loss and achieve better ecological environments, soil conservation measures have been taken during the past decades. The main objective of this study is to quantify the spatio-temporal variability of land use/cover change spatial patterns and make preliminary estimation of the role of human activity in the environmental change in Xihe watershed, Gansu Province, China. To achieve this objective, the methodology was developed in two different aspects, that is, (1) analysis of change patterns by binary image of change trajectories overlaid with different natural geographic factors, in which Relative Change Intensity (RCI) metric was established and used to make comparisons, and (2) analysis based on pattern metrics of main trajectories in the study area. Multi-source and multi-temporal Remote Sensing (RS) images (including Landsat ETM+ (30 June 2001), SPOT imagery (21 November 2003 and 5 May 2008) and CBERS02 CCD (5 June 2006)) were used due to the constraints of the availability of remotely sensed data. First, they were used to extract land use/cover types of each time node by object-oriented classification method. Classification results were then utilized in the trajectory analysis of land use/cover changes through the given four time nodes. Trajectories at every pixel were acquired to trace the history of land use/cover change for every location in the study area. Landscape metrics of trajectories were then analyzed to detect the change characteristics in time and space through the given time series. Analysis showed that most land use/cover changes were caused by human activities, most of which, under the direction of local government, had mainly led to virtuous change on the ecological environments. While, on the contrary, about one quarter of human-induced changes were vicious ones. Analysis through overlaying binary image of change trajectories with natural factors can efficiently show the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of land use/cover change patterns. It is found that in the study area RCI of land use/cover changes is related to the distance to the river line. And there is a certain correlation between RCI and slope grades. However, no obvious correlation exists between RCI and aspect grades. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

G.; Skidmore, Andrew			The significance of using satellite imagery data only in Ecological Niche Modelling of Iberian herps	ACTA HERPETOLOGICA												The environmental data used to calculate ecological niche models (ENM) are obtained mainly from ground-based maps (e.g., climatic interpolated surfaces). These data are often not available for less developed areas, or may be at an inappropriate scale, and thus to obtain this information requires fieldwork. An alternative source of eco-geographical data comes from satellite imagery. Three sets of ENM were calculated exclusively with variables obtained (1) from optical and radar images only and (2) from climatic and altitude maps obtained by ground-based methods. These models were compared to evaluate whether satellite imagery can accurately generate ENM. These comparisons must be made in areas with well-known species distribution and with available satellite imagery and ground-based data. Thus, the study area was the south-western part of Salamanca (Spain), using amphibian and reptiles as species models. Models' discrimination capacity was measured with ROC plots. Models' covariation was measured with a Spatial Spearman correlation. Four modelling techniques were used (Bioclim, Mahalanobis distance, GARP and Maxent). The results of this comparison showed that there were no significant differences between models generated using remotely sensed imagery or ground-based data. However, the models built with satellite imagery data exhibited a larger diversity of values, probably related to the higher spatial resolution of the satellite imagery. Satellite imagery can produce accurate ENM, independently of the modelling technique or the dataset used. Therefore, biogeographical analysis of species distribution in remote areas can be accurately developed only with variables from satellite imagery.

Landscape ecology and wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) habitat modeling in the Mediterranean region	ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Landscape ecology and wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) habitat modeling in the Mediterranean region.-Landscape modification is one of the reasons for the decrease in rabbit populations. The objective of this study was to model wild rabbit habitat using landscape ecology to create a diagnosis method able to assess habitat quality at a large scale. Rabbit presence/absence was recorded on 536 plots of 1 ha. Spotlight transect counts indicated a low relative abundance (KIA = 2.3 rabbits/km). We produced a land use map with metric precision using remote sensing. Water, bare soil, herbaceous, shrubs and trees were identified. Landscape structure and diversity were evaluated using variables available in FRAGSTATS. A logistic regression was performed to assess the link between rabbit presence/absence and landscape structure. Our results indicate that a suitable habitat has a high diversity, a medium number of patches and a small proportion of shrubs. These results could be used to diagnose the landscape prior to any management action to enhance rabbit populations and conversely be helpful as a tool of integrated control in the cases of local outbreaks with agricultural damages.																	1578-665X						2012	35	2					277	283										WOS:000313998400014

Estimation of antecedent wetness conditions for flood modelling in northern Morocco	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In northern Morocco are located most of the dams and reservoirs of the country, while this region is affected by severe rainfall events causing floods. To improve the management of the water regulation structures, there is a need to develop rainfall-runoff models to both maximize the storage capacity and reduce the risks caused by floods. In this study, a model is developed to reproduce the flood events for a 655 km(2) catchment located upstream of the 6th largest dam in Morocco. Constrained by data availability, a standard event-based model combining a SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service Curve Number) loss model and a Clark unit hydrograph was developed for hourly discharge simulation using 16 flood events that occurred between 1984 and 2008. The model was found satisfactory to reproduce the runoff and the temporal evolution of floods, even with limited rainfall data. Several antecedent wetness conditions estimators for the catchment were compared with the initial condition of the model. Theses estimators include an antecedent discharge index, an antecedent precipitation index and a continuous daily soil moisture accounting model (SMA), based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The SMA model performed the best to estimate the initial conditions of the event-based hydrological model (R-2 = 0.9). Its daily output has been compared with ASCAT and AMSR-E remote sensing data products, which were both able to reproduce with accuracy the daily simulated soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. This same approach could be implemented in other catchments of this region for operational purposes. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing data are potentially useful to estimate the soil moisture conditions in the case of ungauged catchments in Northern Africa.

This study was conducted to evaluate the temporal-spatial variations in soil erosion on the Loess Plateau (taking the Gushanchuan basin as an example) in the past three decades by combining Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE), remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. The results showed that the temporal variation in soil erosion of the past three decades (1975 to 2006) could be divided into two stages. The first stage was from 1975 to 1986, and soil erosion was intensified and eroded area increased by 138.13 km(2), particularly in the southeast part of the basin. The second stage was from 1986 to 2006, and erosion weakened. The eroded area decreased by 163.09 km(2), and the reduction in soil erosion distributed in the entire basin. Soil erosion above the medium degree mainly occurred in the elevation ranging from 1070 to 1300 m, with the slope ranging from 18 degrees to 35 degrees, correspondingly. The erosion above the medium degree had a rainfall erosivity range of 900 to 1150 MJ.mm.hm(-2).h(-1) in 1975 and 2006. The erosion above the medium degree in 1986 and 1997 had a rainfall erosivity ranging from 1300 and 1800 MJ.mm.hm(-2).h(-1). The area with serious soil erosion corresponded to the area distributed with high rainfall erosivity. Soil erosion predominantly occurred in farmlands. In the period from 1975 to 2006, the farmland area decreased while the woodland and pasture areas increased, and soil erosion weakened obviously as a result of land use adjustment. The results of this study would provide references for benefit assessment of soil and water conservation on the Loess Plateau.																	1459-0255	1459-0263					2012	10	3-4					1285	1293										WOS:000312083200001						
J	Kosicki, JZ; Chylarecki, P				Kosicki, Jakub Z.; Chylarecki, Przemyslaw			Effect of climate, topography and habitat on species-richness of breeding birds in Poland	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												We developed predictive maps of farmland and forest species richness which are based on the "focal species concept" and remote sensing data. We explored environmental preferences of 17 farmland and 33 forest species in Poland, using data from the Pan-European Monitoring Scheme. The largest number of farmland species was noted in the central and eastern parts, while the opposite trend was observed in the case of forest species, where the preferred areas were in the north and south-east. The most important environmental component affecting the bird faunas of farmland and forest was a gradient from arable fields to forest. This relationship is unimodal, which means that on a meso-geographical scale the highest species richness occurred in heterogeneous landscapes where fields are interspersed with forest. Our results also indicate that the geographical gradient in Poland's bird fauna can simply be attributed to the habitat-based distinction: western and central parts are dominated by large agricultural habitats and coniferous forest, while in other areas predominate mixed forests and extensively used farmland. Among the climatic factors, only rainfall influenced the farmland bird species. Its effect is non-linear, but positive, which means that in areas with higher rainfall more species are recorded. Our predictive maps are complementary to research on population trends, and can be an essential tool for effective management and conservation of species populations on a trans-national scale.

Dawn of drone ecology: low-cost autonomous aerial vehicles for conservation	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Tropical deforestation continues to be a major driver of biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Remote sensing technology is increasingly used to assess changes in forest cover, species distributions and carbon stocks. However, satellite and airborne sensors can be prohibitively costly and inaccessible for researchers in developing countries. Here, we describe the development and use of an inexpensive (<$2,000) unmanned aerial vehicle for surveying and mapping forests and biodiversity (referred to as 'Conservation Drone' hereafter). Our prototype drone is able to fly pre-programmed missions autonomously for a total flight time of similar to 25 minutes and over a distance of similar to 15 km. Non-technical operators can program each mission by defining waypoints along a flight path using an open-source software. This drone can record videos at up to 1080 pixel resolution (high definition), and acquire aerial photographs of <10 cm pixel resolution. Aerial photographs can be stitched together to produce real-time geo-referenced land use/cover maps of surveyed areas. We evaluate the performance of this prototype Conservation Drone based on a series of test flights in Aras Napal, Sumatra, Indonesia. We discuss the further development of Conservation Drone 2.0, which will have a bigger payload and longer range. Initial tests suggest a flight time of similar to 50 minutes and a range of similar to 25 km. Finally, we highlight the potential of this system for environmental and conservation applications, which include near real-time mapping of local land cover, monitoring of illegal forest activities, and surveying of large animal species.

The pattern is being strengthened by high population growth and the migration of populations towards these newly deforested pioneer fronts. These trends are causing space to be appropriated to the detriment of forested areas. It has become essential to be able to locate areas on the pioneer front quickly and systematically in order to characterize new phases in advancing deforestation as they occur. However, satellite tools with high spatial resolution are not suited to monitoring of this type, as their temporal resolution is too broad and data processing is characteristically complex. Although low resolution satellite images therefore seem more appropriate to these analyses, they can raise major problems when the target areas are very specific. In order to use imagery with low spatial resolution, such as SPOT-VEGETATION images, this study proposes a monitoring methodology based on a deforestation front of very small size. The method could be extrapolated to other deforestation fronts to investigate new areas to be monitored and thus establish diagnoses of the temporal dynamics of landscape transformation.																	0006-579X						2012		312					77	83										WOS:000308569800008

The impacts on native flora and fauna habitats have been identified as a key threatening process in Australia. Identifying and mapping diseased vegetation and the rate of spread of the disease is required for management; however, this is often difficult and costly. This study investigated the ability of using a time series of orthophotos (1953-2008) in combination with Landsat satellite imagery, including trend analysis, and GIS to identify the presence of vegetation impacted by P. cinnamomi at four sites in Banksia woodlands in Western Australia. Further, the historical extent and rate of spread of P. cinnamomi was assessed at one site between 1953 and 2008. Our assessment identified that three of the four sites were affected by P. cinnamomi, results that are consistent with on-ground surveys. Investigation of disease progression at one site found a large increase in the area impacted between 1974 and 1988 and the rate of spread was highest between 1953 and 1963 (1.286 m year(-1)) and lowest between 1997 and 2008 (0.526 m year(-1)). The techniques presented provide a cost-effective tool to monitor broad-scale vegetation dynamics over time for management of this plant pathogen.																	0067-1924						2012	60	6					495	505		10.1071/BT11305								WOS:000308930400003

We classified residential landscapes of New Mexico's largest city, Albuquerque, to explore the spatial distribution of residential greenspace and its composition among zip codes and median incomes. Geographic Information System (GIS) vector files including parcels, city limits, zip codes and land-use maps, were integrated with ownership information. The database was stratified by Albuquerque's 16 zip codes. Four hundred eighty residential landscapes were selected randomly for study. Very high spatial resolution (0.15 m) 2008 true color aerial photographs and the object-oriented supervised classification module in ENVI EX were used to identify residential features. Spatial and textural variables, created by image segmentation, were classified using the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm embedded in ENVI EX. Classification accuracy was 89%. Larger greenspace, tree, shrub, and grass areas were in larger parcels. Landscapes in lower income groups and older zip codes include larger greenspace and tree cover because of mature tree sizes, while grass dominated landscapes of higher income groups and newer zip codes. This knowledge of residential vegetation distribution could serve as a basis for policy makers, planners, and water conservation officers wishing to enact ordinances and regulations that govern the urban residential landscape.

Blanding's Turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) Potential Habitat Mapping Using Aerial Orthophotographic Imagery and Object Based Classification	REMOTE SENSING												Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) is a threatened species under Canada's Species at Risk Act. In southern Quebec, field based inventories are ongoing to determine its abundance and potential habitat. The goal of this research was to develop means for mapping of potential habitat based on primary habitat attributes that can be detected with high-resolution remotely sensed imagery. Using existing spring leaf-off 20 cm resolution aerial orthophotos of a portion of Gatineau Park where some Blanding's turtle observations had been made, habitat attributes were mapped at two scales: (1) whole wetlands; (2) within wetland habitat features of open water, vegetation (used for camouflage and thermoregulation), and logs (used for spring sun-basking). The processing steps involved initial pixel-based classification to eliminate most areas of non-wetland, followed by object-based segmentations and classifications using a customized rule sequence to refine the wetland map and to map the within wetland habitat features. Variables used as inputs to the classifications were derived from the orthophotos and included image brightness, texture, and segmented object shape and area. Independent validation using field data and visual interpretation showed classification accuracy for all habitat attributes to be generally over 90% with a minimum of 81.5% for the producer's accuracy of logs. The maps for each attribute were combined to produce a habitat suitability map for Blanding's turtle. Of the 115 existing turtle observations, 92.3% were closest to a wetland of the two highest suitability classes. High-resolution imagery combined with object-based classification and habitat suitability mapping methods such as those presented provide a much more spatially explicit representation of detailed habitat attributes than can be obtained through field work alone. They can complement field efforts to document and track turtle activities and can contribute to species inventory planning, conservation, and management.

Spatial modelling of benthic cover using remote sensing data in the Aldabra lagoon, western Indian Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Spatially explicit ecological modelling was used to predict the distribution of 4 benthic components (live coral, carbonate sand, macroalgae and dead coral) inside the Aldabra lagoon, southern Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. Both classic ordinary least-squares and spatial autoregression techniques were carried out on a field data set of 774 spatially referenced records and 3 satellite remote sensing images to define an empirical relationship between local environmental conditions (water depth and water level variation) and benthic cover. This relationship was then used to generate a synoptic model of the spatial cover and distribution of each benthic component at the landscape (i.e. whole lagoon) scale. Environmental conditions were estimated from satellite remote sensing data (water depth) and using GIS techniques (water level variation). By drawing on species-environment relationships applicable to many lagoons, continuous records of percentage benthic cover were derived for the extensive lagoon (174 km(2)) at a high measurement level (ratio) for use in conservation and resource management applications. The transition from the ordinary least-squares model to the spatially lagged model was accompanied by a marked growth in predictive power (R-2 = 0.25 to 0.79), indicating that neighbourhood context interactions play an important role in determining benthic cover of the Aldabra lagoon.

J	Berthier, E; Vincent, C				Berthier, Etienne; Vincent, Christian			Relative contribution of surface mass-balance and ice-flux changes to the accelerated thinning of Mer de Glace, French Alps, over 1979-2008	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												By subtracting surface topographies from 1979, 1994, 2000 and 2008, we measured ice-thinning rates increasing from 1 m a(-1) (1979-94) to >4 m a(-1) (2000-08) on the tongue of Mer de Glace, French Alps. The relative contributions of changes in surface mass balance and ice fluxes to this acceleration in the thinning are estimated using field and remote-sensing measurements. Between 1979-94 and 2000-08, surface mass balance diminished by 1.2 m w.e. a(-1), mainly because of atmospheric warming. Mass-balance changes induced by the growing debris-covered area and the evolving glacier hypsometry compensated each other. Meanwhile, Mer de Glace slowed down and the ice fluxes through two cross sections at 2200 and 2050 m a.s.l. decreased by 60%. Between 1979-94 and 2000-08, two-thirds of the increase in the thinning rates was caused by reduced ice fluxes and one-third by rising surface ablation. However, these numbers need to be interpreted cautiously given our inability to respect mass conservation below our upper cross section. An important implication is that large errors would occur if one term of the continuity equation (e.g. surface mass balance) were deduced from the two others (e.g. elevation and ice-flux changes).

J	Andrefouet, S; Hamel, MA; Dalleau, M				Andrefouet, Serge; Hamel, Melanie A.; Dalleau, Mayeul			Distinction between effective pattern-based and selection-based biodiversity surrogates is essential: caveats for managers	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ecological concepts and data may justify the selection of biodiversity conservation plans among different options, but can also lead to poor conservation guidelines if not properly used. The use and meaning of the 'surrogate' concept in ecology and conservation planning contexts is a typical example. Surrogates are entities such as species, environmental variables or habitats, which are used to represent a target entity such as genes, species, ecosystems or related metrics. 'Pattern-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates using statistical congruence, while 'selection-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates through a notional conservation plan or prioritization analysis where sites are added to a set of protected areas, often using a complementarity criterion between sites. With this clear framework in mind, an investigation of the coral reef literature revealed that most published studies on surrogates of reef biodiversity refer in fact to pattern-based surrogates. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with both approaches. However, efficient pattern-based surrogates are often recommended for conservation planning, implying that they could be efficient selection-based surrogates. In fact, efficient pattern-based surrogates are not necessarily efficient selection-based surrogates and vice versa. The reason is the complementarity rules used by selection algorithms. We call for more clarity from authors on the context in which effective surrogates have to be used, and more caution from managers when surrogates are to be used in conservation plans.

Use of airborne LiDAR to delineate canopy degradation and encroachment along the Guatemala-Belize border	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Tropical rainforest clearing and degradation significantly reduces carbon sequestration and increases the rate of biodiversity loss. There has been a concerted international effort to develop remote sensing techniques to monitor broad-scale patterns of forest canopy disturbance. In addition to loss of natural resources, recent deforestation in Mesoamerica threatens historic cultural resources that for centuries lay hidden below the protective canopy. Here, we compare satellite-derived measures of canopy disturbance that occurred over a three decade period since 1980 to those derived from a 2009 airborne LiDAR campaign over the Caracol Archaeological Reserve in western Belize. Scaling up fine-resolution canopy height measures to the 30 m resolution of Landsat Thematic Mapper, we found LiDAR revealed a >58% increase in the extent of canopy disturbance where there was an overlap of the remotely sensed data sources. For the entire archaeological reserve, with the addition of LiDAR, there was a 2.5% increase of degraded canopy than estimated with Landsat alone, indicating that 11.3% of the reserve has been subjected to illegal selective logging and deforestation. Incursions into the reserve from the Guatemala border, represented by LiDAR-detected canopy disturbance, extended 1 km deeper (to 3.5 km) into Belize than were derived with Landsat. Thus, while LiDAR enables a synoptic, never-seen-before, below-canopy view of the Maya city of Caracol, it also reveals the degree of canopy disturbance and potential looting of areas yet to be documented by archaeologists on the ground.																	1940-0829						2012	5	1					12	24		10.1177/194008291200500103								WOS:000303355700003

Assessing REDD plus performance of countries with low monitoring capacities: the matrix approach	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Estimating emissions from deforestation and degradation of forests in many developing countries is so uncertain that the effects of changes in forest management could remain within error ranges (i.e. undetectable) for several years. Meanwhile UNFCCC Parties need consistent time series of meaningful performance indicators to set credible benchmarks and allocate REDD+ incentives to the countries, programs and activities that actually reduce emissions, while providing social and environmental benefits. Introducing widespread measuring of carbon in forest land (which would be required to estimate more accurately changes in emissions from degradation and forest management) will take time and considerable resources. To ensure the overall credibility and effectiveness of REDD+, parties must consider the design of cost-effective systems which can provide reliable and comparable data on anthropogenic forest emissions. Remote sensing can provide consistent time series of land cover maps for most non-Annex-I countries, retrospectively. These maps can be analyzed to identify the forests that are intact (i.e. beyond significant human influence), and whose fragmentation could be a proxy for degradation. This binary stratification of forests biomes (intact/non-intact), a transition matrix and the use of default carbon stock change factors can then be used to provide initial estimates of trends in emission changes. A proof-of-concept is provided for one biome of the Democratic Republic of the Congo over a virtual commitment period (2005-2010). This approach could allow assessment of the performance of the five REDD+ activities (deforestation, degradation, conservation, management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) in a spatially explicit, verifiable manner. Incentives could then be tailored to prioritize activities depending on the national context and objectives.																	1748-9326					JAN-MAR	2012	7	1							014031	10.1088/1748-9326/7/1/014031								WOS:000302580600042						
J	Yang, XH; Guo, XL; Fitzsimmons, M				Yang, Xiaohui; Guo, Xulin; Fitzsimmons, Michael			Assessing light to moderate grazing effects on grassland production using satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Understanding the influences of grazing intensity on grassland production is essential for grassland conservation and management improvement. Grazing at light to moderate intensity theoretically enhances grassland production, thus benefiting grassland ecosystems. However, inconsistent results of the beneficial effects of light to moderate grazing on grassland production were reported due to the lack of accurate and repeatable techniques for discriminating grazing effects from other abiotic factors. Advanced remote-sensing techniques provide a promising tool for filling this gap in grazing effects research due to their high spatial and temporal resolution. In this article, the influences of light to moderate grazing on grassland production in mixed grasslands were investigated for the period 1986-2005, using spectral data derived from satellite images. The effects of precipitation on the detection of grazing-induced production change were also analysed. The results revealed that the normalized canopy index (NCI) showed superior performance in quantifying grassland production in mixed grasslands. Significant differences in grassland production between grazed and ungrazed treatments occurred in the three years with above-average and average growing-season precipitations (April-August), but not in the dry years. Most of the variation in production (75%) was explained by growing-season precipitation for both grazed and ungrazed sites. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using remote-sensing data to monitor long-term light to moderate grazing effects and the important role of precipitation, especially growing-season precipitation, in modulating production in mixed-grassland ecosystems.																	0143-1161						2012	33	16					5087	5104		10.1080/01431161.2012.657372								WOS:000302169400014

In this study, a timely and reliable procedure was examined using remote-sensing (RS) techniques. Linear regression analysis between field survey data and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) data showed that among 17 vegetation indices (VIs) evaluated, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was the best VI to simulate forage dry biomass and cover in the Gannan region. The results of precision estimation of the models showed that power and logarithm regression satisfactorily simulated grassland dry biomass and grassland cover, respectively. The index of classification management of grasslands (ICGs) was used to subdivide grasslands into conservation grasslands and moderately productive grasslands in the Gannan region, where no grasslands fell into intensively productive grasslands. Conservation grasslands accounted for 2.04% of the available grasslands, whereas moderately productive grasslands were 97.96% of the available grasslands, and this is related to the history of the grasslands' use and the per capita income in the Gannan region. This study proposes that the area of conservation grasslands and that of moderately productive grasslands are determined by increases in per capita income and changes in the human use of grasslands.																	0143-1161						2012	33	10					3156	3175		10.1080/01431161.2011.634861								WOS:000302163200009

Mitigating soil erosion through farm-level adoption of soil and water conservation measures in Samanalawewa Watershed, Sri Lanka	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Soil erosion by water is currently one of the most notable types of land degradation in Samanalawewa Watershed in Sri Lanka, creating copious environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Thus, with the aim of detecting and mapping the rates of human-induced soil erosion in the watershed, remote sensing and geographic information system based modelling and field experiments were carried out. The results of the assessment disclosed that the present rate of human-induced soil erosion varies from 0 to 289 t ha(-1) yr(-1) with the majority of the area exceeding the natural rate of soil erosion by 14 to 33 times at present. However, the average rate of human-induced soil erosion has declined dramatically from 19.8 to 4.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1) from 1986 to 2008. In order to analyse the significant determinants of farm-level adoption of soil and water conservation measures, binary logistic regression procedure was applied using the data collected through a household survey (n = 201). The most significant (p < 0.01) variables of the study were the farmers' perceptions of soil erosion problems, gender of the household head, training on soil and water conservation, and ascertained advice from agricultural extension officers while the variables regarding past awareness about soil conservation technologies and off-farm income were significant at p < 0.05. Furthermore, the study revealed that the majority (60.2%) of the farmers in the study area had been adopting different types of soil and water conservation measures for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, owing to the current decreasing rate of soil erosion, the soil and water conservation costs and the ratios of human-induced soil erosion vs natural soil erosion had declined significantly while the productivity of their lands had gone up.																	0906-4710						2012	62	3					273	285		10.1080/09064710.2011.608708								WOS:000301337100010

Environmental filtering and land-use history drive patterns in biomass accumulation in a mediterranean-type landscape	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Aboveground biomass (AGB) reflects multiple and often undetermined ecological and land-use processes, yet detailed landscape-level studies of AGB are uncommon due to the difficulty in making consistent measurements at ecologically relevant scales. Working in a protected mediterranean-type landscape (Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, California, USA), we combined field measurements with remotely sensed data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory's light detection and ranging (lidar) system to create a detailed AGB Map. We then developed a predictive model using a maximum of 56 explanatory variables derived from geologic and historic-ownership maps, a digital elevation model, and geographic coordinates to evaluate possible controls over currently observed AGB patterns. We tested both ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) and autoregressive approaches. OLS explained 44% of the variation in AGB, and simultaneous autoregression with a 100-m neighborhood improved the fit to an r(2) = 0.72, while reducing the number of significant predictor variables from 27 variables in the OLS model to 11 variables in the autoregressive model. We also compared the results from these approaches to a more typical field-derived data set; we randomly sampled 5% of the data 1000 times and used the same OLS approach each time. Environmental filters including incident solar radiation, substrate type, and topographic position were significant predictors of AGB in all models. Past ownership was a minor but significant predictor, despite the long history of conservation at the site. The weak predictive power of these environmental variables, and the Significant improvement when spatial autocorrelation was incorporated, highlight the importance of land-use history, disturbance regime, and population dynamics as controllers of AGB.

The missing wetlands: using local ecological knowledge to find cryptic ecosystems	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Small, temporally dynamic, biologically diverse isolated wetlands are among the most imperiled ecosystems, yet their conservation is hindered by lack of protective legislation and mapping. As part of an effort to better understand isolated wetland ecology in an area undergoing dramatic land use change, we mapped isolated wetlands in South Carolina's Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions using remote sensing and local ecological knowledge (LEK). Remote detection of isolated wetlands was limited by digital resource resolution, topography, and wetland size. LEK was the most useful tool for locating small isolated wetlands. We sampled 10% of the study area using LEK and discovered 44 wetlands with "isolated" characteristics, none of which had been identified by remote sensing. Only 8 of 44 wetlands found through LEK could be identified using remote sensing after their discovery. LEK fills a gap in cryptic ecosystem detection when adequate remotely sensed data are not available. Though effective, using LEK is neither as rapid nor as repeatable as remote sensing. We suggest a two-pronged approach for finding cryptic ecosystems: remote sensing coupled with LEK where data resolution is inadequate. For remote detection of isolated wetlands, we suggest a minimum resolution of 0.33 m for Color Infrared, leaf-off, high-water photography. Despite great advances in remote sensing, data are not uniformly available worldwide and LEK may serve as an effective tool for locating cryptic resources for biodiversity conservation. Mapping cryptic resources will allow for more accurate resource and biodiversity conservation planning under current and future climate scenarios.

Here we present a spatially explicit prediction for coral reef fish diversity index, as well as habitat classification according to reef fish diversity index values in Chinchorro Bank Biosphere Reserve, one of the most important plain/atoll type reef systems in the Caribbean. We have used extensive ecological data on depth, fish and habitat characteristics to perform such prediction. Fish species assemblages and different biotic variables of benthic organisms were characterized using visual censuses and video-transects, respectively at 119 sampling stations. The information was integrated in a GIS, along with satellite imagery (LANSDAT 7 ETM+) and a digital bathymetric model. From the recorded data and a hierarchical classification procedure, we obtained nine different classes of habitats. We used a generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction methodology to create predictive maps (GIS layers) of the different reef benthic components, and a second modeling run produced predictive maps of coral reef fish diversity index. Predictive accuracy of the diversity index map presented a good correlation coefficient (r = 0.87), with maximum diversity index values en reefscapes composed of aggregation of coral colonies with seagrass beds. The implementation of our application was successful for the prediction of fish diversity hot spots and surrogate habitats.

Soil erosion assessment and its correlation with landslide events using remote sensing data and GIS: a case study at Penang Island, Malaysia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In this paper, an attempt has been made to assess, prognosis and observe dynamism of soil erosion by universal soil loss equation (USLE) method at Penang Island, Malaysia. Multi-source (map-, space- and ground-based) datasets were used to obtain both static and dynamic factors of USLE, and an integrated analysis was carried out in raster format of GIS. A landslide location map was generated on the basis of image elements interpretation from aerial photos, satellite data and field observations and was used to validate soil erosion intensity in the study area. Further, a statistical-based frequency ratio analysis was carried out in the study area for correlation purposes. The results of the statistical correlation showed a satisfactory agreement between the prepared USLE-based soil erosion map and landslide events/locations, and are directly proportional to each other. Prognosis analysis on soil erosion helps the user agencies/decision makers to design proper conservation planning program to reduce soil erosion. Temporal statistics on soil erosion in these dynamic and rapid developments in Penang Island indicate the co-existence and balance of ecosystem.

In a novel approach, we used a long-term time series including historical map data to predict the influence of one century of tropical forest change on keystone species or indicator groups in the Kakamega-Nandi forests, western Kenya. Four time steps of land cover data between 1912/13 and 2003, derived from Landsat satellite imagery, aerial photography and old topographic maps, formed the basis for extrapolating species abundance data on the army ant Dorylus wilverthi, the guild of ant-following birds and three habitat guilds of birds differing in forest dependency. To predict the species' spatio-temporal distribution, we combined spatially explicit geographical information system (GIS)-based modelling with statistical modelling, that is, ordinary least square (OLS) regression models for D. wilverthi and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models for ant-following birds. We directly related bird habitat guilds to five forest classes as distinguished in the land cover time series. Extrapolation results over time predict dramatic losses in abundance for D. wilverthi (56%), ant-following birds (58%) and forest bird individuals in general (47%) due to a forest loss of 31% and small-scale fragmentation within the past century. Extrapolations based on a scenario of further deforestation revealed the negative consequences of clearing and splitting up continuous forest into isolated patches, whereas a reforestation scenario suggests the positive impact of natural forest regrowth and indigenous-tree planting. This study demonstrates the high potential of integrating remotesensing and field-based faunal data for landscape-scale quantitative assessments over time. In addition, it shows the suitability of extrapolation studies for evaluating measures of forest conservation.

Mapping coffee plantations with Landsat imagery: an example from El Salvador	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Considering the potential of shaded coffee plantations mixed with natural vegetation for promoting biodiversity conservation, this project assessed the utility of multi-date Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery for the characterization of natural vegetation versus coffee plantations in western El Salvador. For assembling a multi-temporal Landsat TM data set, we applied a regression analysis model to remove cloud cover and cloud shadows. Then, through a hybrid classification approach, a nine-class land use/land cover (LULC) map was generated. We identified two types of coffee plantations ('open-canopy' and 'close-canopy') along with natural forest/shrubland, mangrove, water bodies, sandy coastal soils, bare soil, urban areas and agriculture. Notwithstanding the small sample size of the accuracy data, our assessment revealed an overall accuracy of 76.7% (Kappa coefficient = 0.68), considering only the four classes with independent field data. The overall classification accuracy for distinguishing coffee plantations from non-mangrove natural forest was 81.6% and the classification accuracy for distinguishing 'open-canopy' from 'close-canopy' coffee plantations was 85.7%. We are encouraged by the results of this prototype study. They indicate that remote-sensing techniques can be used to distinguish different classes of coffee production systems and to differentiate coffee from natural forest.																	0143-1161						2012	33	1					220	242		10.1080/01431161.2011.591442								WOS:000298946600013

These episodic and often spatially limited events provide important forage and preformed water resources that may be important drivers of animal movement and habitat use. Habitat-use models that incorporate forage phenology would broaden our understanding of desert bighorn ecology and have considerable potential to inform conservation efforts for the species. Field-based methods are of limited utility to characterize vegetation phenology across large areas. Vegetation indices (VI) derived from satellite imagery are a viable alternative, but may be confounded by areas of high relief and shadow effects that can degrade VI values. The varying spatial and temporal resolutions of readily available satellite sensors, such as the Landsat thematic mapper (TM) and moderate-resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS), present additional challenges. In this study, we sought to minimize degrading effects of terrain on TM- and MODIS-based estimates of vegetation phenology. We compared effects of high topographic relief on time series MODIS- and TM-based VI such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) using VI departures from average (DA) in shaded and unshaded areas. Sun elevation angle negatively impacted TM-derived NDVI and EVI values in areas of steep terrain. In contrast, MODIS-derived NDVI values were insensitive to sun elevation and terrain effects, whereas MODIS-derived EVI was degraded in areas of steep terrain. Time series MODIS NDVI and EVI DA values differed significantly during months of low sun elevation angle. Average MODIS EVI departure values were >= 20% lower than NDVI under these conditions, confounding time series estimates of plant phenology. Our best results were obtained from MODIS 16-day composited NDVI. These remote-sensing-based VI estimates of seasonal plant phenology and productivity can be used to inform models of habitat use and movements of desert bighorn over large areas.																	0143-1161						2012	33	1					276	286		10.1080/01431161.2011.592865								WOS:000298946600016

Urbanization and green space dynamics in Greater Dhaka, Bangladesh	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Green space is particularly indispensable for proper functioning of the ecosystem in an urban environment. This study was an attempt to dynamically map and monitor green spaces in Greater Dhaka of Bangladesh. Both primary and secondary data were acquired to document the spatial-temporal dynamics of green spaces in the study area. Using a supervised classification algorithm, multi-temporal land use/cover data were extracted from a set of satellite images. A number of spatial metrics were employed to understand the landscape condition in a multi-temporal manner. In addition, 50 key informants along with focus group discussion and observation techniques were used to document existing management aspects of green spaces and their conservation policies. The analysis revealed that green spaces in Greater Dhaka are rapidly disappearing over the course of time even though they provide a number of natural, economic and social benefits. The disappearance of green spaces was primarily attributed to a rapid increase in the urban population, mainly driven by rural-urban migration. As a result, the landscape became highly fragmented and less connected. A substantial reduction of green patches is also leading to deterioration of the ecological condition of the landscape. The drastic reduction of green spaces in Greater Dhaka has been attributed to a lack of policy, low political motivation, and poor management. In order to ensure sustainability of green spaces and proper functioning of the city's ecosystem, there is an urgent need for strategic green space planning.

Striking a Balance: Socioeconomic Development and Conservation in Grassland through Community-Based Zoning	PLOS ONE												The goal of preserving nature is often in conflict with economic development and the aspirations of the rural poor. Nowhere is this more striking than in native grasslands, which have been extensively converted until a mere fraction of their original extent remains. This is not surprising; grasslands flourish in places coveted by humans, primed for agriculture, plantations, and settlements that nearly always trump conservation efforts. The Umgano grassland conservation and poverty reduction project in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa uses community-based spatial planning to balance the conversion of its lower-conservation value grasslands to a timber plantation, while conserving higher-value grasslands for heritage purposes and managed livestock grazing. Ten years after project launch, we measured the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of the project using Normalized Differential Vegetation Index remote sensing data and over 500 household interviews, as compared with similar non-conserved areas. Zoned management of the Umgano area had resulted in between 9% and 17% greater average peak production in the grassland areas compared to control sites. There was also a 21% gain in incomes for the roughly one hundred people employed by the forestry efforts, when compared to others in their village. Community-based spatial zoning is an overlooked tool for balancing conservation and development but may require, as we found in Umgano, certain critical factors including strong local leadership, an accountable financial management mechanism to distribute income, outside technical expertise for the zoning design, and community support.

We applied object-based image analysis and supervised classification to four 32-m Beijing-1 microsatellite images to examine broad-scale surface cover composition and its change during November 2007-March 2008 low water season at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland system in China (>4000 km(2)). we proposed a novel method for semi-automated selection of training objects in this heterogeneous landscape using extreme values of spectral indices (SIs) estimated from satellite data. Dynamics of the major wetland cover types (Water, Mudflat, Vegetation and Sand) were investigated both as transitions among primary classes based on maximum membership value, and as changes in memberships to all classes even under no change in a primary class. Fuzzy classification accuracy was evaluated as match frequencies between classification outcome and a) the best reference candidate class (MAX function) and b) any acceptable reference class (RIGHT function). MAX-based accuracy was relatively high for Vegetation (>= 90%), Water (>= 82%), Mudflat (>= 76%) and the smallest-area Sand (>= 75%) in all scenes; these scores improved with the RIGHT function to 87-100%. Classification uncertainty assessed as the proportion of fuzzy object area within a class at a given fuzzy threshold value was the highest for all classes in November 2007, and consistently higher for Mudflat than for other classes in all scenes. Vegetation was the dominant class in all scenes, occupying 41.2-49.3% of the study area. Object memberships to Vegetation mostly declined from November 2007 to February 2008 and increased substantially only in February-March 2008, possibly reflecting growing season conditions and grazing. Spatial extent of Water both declined and increased during the study period, reflecting precipitation and hydrological events. The "fuzziest" Mudflat class was involved in major detected transitions among classes and declined in classification accuracy by March 2008, representing a key target for finer-scale research. Future work should introduce Vegetation sub-classes reflecting differences in phenology and alternative methods to discriminate Mudflat from other classes.

J	Cord, A; Rodder, D				Cord, Anna; Roedder, Dennis			Inclusion of habitat availability in species distribution models through multi-temporal remote-sensing data?	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In times of anthropogenic climate change and increasing rates of habitat loss in many areas of the world, spatially explicit predictions of species' ranges using species distribution models (SDMs) have become of central interest in conservation biology. Such predictions can be derived using species records from museum collections or field surveys combined with, for example, climate and/or land cover data stored in geographic information systems (GIS). Although much attention has been paid to the application of bioclimatic data for SDMs development, the inclusion of land cover information derived from remote sensing is still at the beginning. Herein, we tested for the first time whether SDMs can be improved by inclusion of seasonality information derived from multi-temporal remote-sensing data. We compared models computed for eight Mexican anurans using five different sets of predictors comprising either bioclimatic or remote-sensing data or combinations thereof. Our results suggested that the appropriate set of predictor variables is very much dependent on the species-specific habitat preferences and the patchiness/spatial fragmentation of the suitable habitat types. For species occupying spatially fragmented habitats, spatial predictions based on pure bioclimatic data were less detailed. On the contrary, especially for rather generalist species, SDMs using only remote-sensing data for model development tended to overpredict the species' ranges. For most species, the best strategy for SDM development was a combined model design using both climate and remote-sensing data, while the best methodology of combining the two data sets varied between species. This combined model design allowed us to incorporate the advantages of both approaches, i.e., inclusion of habitat availability using only remote-sensing data and high spatial definition by using bioclimatic variables, by avoidance of the drawbacks of each of them.																	1051-0761					DEC	2011	21	8					3285	3298		10.1890/11-0114.1								WOS:000299166300031

Patterns of protection and threats along productivity gradients in Canada	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Productivity is an important driver of broad-scale diversity gradients and community composition. Surprisingly, it is rarely used as a biodiversity proxy in protected area network assessments. In this research, we evaluate if biases exist in the locations of Canada's protected areas with respect to productivity and assess the distribution of anthropogenic threats to protection along productivity and topographic axes. Productivity was expressed as the annual minimum and integrated fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and related seasonality (defined as variation in fPAR over a year), as acquired by remote sensing. Results indicate that, overall, protected areas are slightly biased to lower productivities (higher seasonalities), but are relatively unbiased along elevation. Sites at high elevations, high seasonalities, or low productivities are extremely well represented, but they account for a very small proportion of Canada's area overall and under protection. However, the productivity characteristics of protected areas are heterogeneous across reserve characteristics and space; biases are greater and more variable when considering individual International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories, protected area size classes, or ecozones. The spatial and environmental correlates of anthropogenic pressures (proximity of roads and settlements in the greater park ecosystem) to protected areas in the forested ecozones were evaluated with partial linear regression models. Threats were strongly spatially structured. Reserve characteristics (productivity, elevation, size, IUCN category) shared about half of this spatial structure, explaining similar to 25% of the variation in threat distributions. Small and productive protected areas tended to occur closer to human populations and roads, respectively, and are thus expected to face greater threats to biodiversity. High-elevation protected areas generally occurred farther from both roads and settlements. Systematic patterns between productivity, reserve size and management goals, and anthropogenic disturbances suggest that the most productive, biodiverse areas may not yet be sufficiently protected. These analyses highlight considerations for the management of existing parks and the expansion of Canada's protected area network. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Building on qualitative datasets and participatory processes to simulate land use change in a mountain watershed of Northwest Vietnam	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												In this article we investigate if qualitative soil fertility datasets derived during participatory processes can be combined with a corresponding land use change model (i) to improve the understanding of the social-ecological complexity of land use change and (ii) to allow testing of alternative scenarios even in data-poor environments. To test this hypothesis, a participatory assessment approach was combined with the spatially explicit, soil fertility driven FALLOW (Forest, Agroforest, Low-value Landscape Or Wasteland?) model. For a case study village in Northwest Vietnam, participatory evaluations with two age groups of farmers were employed in an iterative way to derive qualitative and quantitative model input data to test scenarios of current and improved management on upland soil fertility evolution with FALLOW. The indigenous colour-based soil quality classification was successfully integrated into the Trenbath FALLOW soil module. The model baseline scenario was validated by calculating the goodness-of-fit of model outputs with land cover maps (F(t) 0.78) from remote sensing. Model scenario analysis suggested a masking effect of ongoing soil fertility decline by use of fertilizers and hybrid crop varieties, indicating a resource overuse that becomes increasingly irreversible without external interventions. Simulations further suggest that success of introduction of improved cropping management methods becomes less effective with increasing soil degradation and cannot fully restore initial soil fertility. We conclude that the coupled semi-quantitative approach is useful at the village level as it generated meaningful insights into local land use change dynamics without the need for long-term and data-intensive studies.

Viability status of biosphere reserves in Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA												Viability refers to the ability of a species to persist for many generations or a community / ecological system to persist over some specified time period. The natural vegetation is the matrix in which the biological diversity at ecosystem, species and genetic levels is developed and sustained, and therefore the viability of the natural vegetation is critical for biodiversity conservation and management. There are 29 sites listed as Biosphere Reserves in Sri Lanka, including four International Biosphere Reserves (IBR), while two more sites are in the process of being proposed as IBRs. During the recently conducted Protected Area Gap Analysis in Sri Lanka exercise, the viability status for all natural vegetation sites was assessed using condition, area and landscape criteria, viz, habitat condition, area, wilderness, shape and isolation. One of the most significant challenges in the application of these criteria is factoring in the large-scale changes brought about to those communities and ecological systems by anthropogenic disturbance that has occurred in the past. Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS (RS/GIS) techniques were used to assess and characterize the site viability. The sites were ranked for viability into four categories, viz. Very Good, Good, Fair and Poor, and colour-coded for easy reference by the conservation authorities and managers. Using RS/GIS technology, the biosphere reserves were separated from other protected areas and overlaid with the viability status map of the Gap Analysis to determine their viability. Thus, a map showing biosphere reserves that also indicates the individual viability status in four-coloured categories was generated. The final product is expected to be useful to the conservation managers for planning, prioritizing and formulating management plans for biosphere reserves in Sri Lanka.																	1391-4588	2362-0161				DEC	2011	39	4					303	319										WOS:000298725200003

Evaluating the environmental impact of payments for ecosystem services in Coatepec (Mexico) using remote sensing and on-site interviews	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Over the last decade, hundreds of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been initiated around the world, but evidence of their environmental benefits remains limited. In this study, two PES programmes operating in the municipality of Coatepec (Mexico) were evaluated to assess their effectiveness in protecting the region's endangered upland forests. Landsat satellite data were analysed to assess changes in forest cover before and after programme implementation using a difference-indifferences estimator. Additionally, surveys and interviews were conducted with local residents and a subset of PES programme participants to evaluate the programmes' social and environmental impacts, particularly the effect of the programmes on landowner behaviour. The remote-sensing data show that deforestation was substantially lower on properties receiving PES payments compared to properties not enrolled in the programmes, but the programmes did not prevent the net loss of forests within Coatepec. Moreover, the on-site interviews suggest that the payments may have had little impact on deforestation rates, and that other factors contributed to the conservation of forests in PES properties. These findings suggest that risk-targeted payments, robust monitoring and enforcement programmes, and additional conservation initiatives should be included in all PES schemes to ensure environmental effectiveness.																	0376-8929					DEC	2011	38	4					426	434		10.1017/S037689291100052X								WOS:000297926400007

Soil Resource Database at Village Level for Developmental Planning	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												A study was carried out in village Mohammadabad, Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh to demonstrate the potential of high-resolution remote sensing data in generating soil resource database at village level that would facilitate natural resource developmental planning. For this study, detail soil resource database was generated by interpreting IRS Resourcesat-1 LISS-IV + Cartosat-1 merged data and by undertaking soil survey and soil analysis. This database was integrated with cadastral map and was analysed for preparation of an action plan for the village that included recommendation on suitable crops, soil and water conservation measures and distribution of soil health card to farmers. The study indicates that the LISS-IV + Cartosat-1 merged satellite data helps in mapping soils at phase level and in delineation of more number of pure soil mapping units i.e. consociations at 1:10.000 scale. The plot-wise resource potential and constraints reveals that significant inter and intra-field soil variability exists. Soil fertility assessment indicates that the soils of the village are low to medium in fertility (available NPK Content) and micronutrients like copper, manganese and iron content is above the critical level for optimum growth of crops while zinc content is less than the critical level.																	0255-660X					DEC	2011	39	4					529	536		10.1007/s12524-011-0095-1								WOS:000297857300010

L.; Sharma, Narpati			Assessing the Priorities for Sustainable Forest Management in the Sikkim Himalaya, India: A Remote Sensing Based Approach	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Sikkim is a small, mountainous, Indian state (7,096 km(2)) located in the eastern Himalayan region. Though a global biodiversity hotspot, it has been relatively less studied. A detailed forest type, density and change dynamics study was undertaken, using SATELLITE remote sensing data and intensive field verification. The landscape was found to be dominated by alpine and nival ecosystems, with a large portion above the tree line, considerable snow cover, and a sizeable area under forest cover (72%, 5,094 km(2)). A total of 18 landscape components including 14 vegetation classes were delineated, with the major ones being oak forest, alpine meadow, alpine scrub, conifer forest and alder-cardamom agro-forestry. Of the 3,154 km(2) of forests below the tree line, 40% were found to be dense (> 40% tree canopy cover). A sizeable portion of the non dense forests below the tree line was contributed by the degradation of oak forests, which was confirmed by change detection analysis. However on a positive front over the past decade, ban on grazing and felling of trees in forests has been implemented. In order to expand the extent of dense forests, further efforts are needed for the restoration of oak forests such as fire protection, providing alternatives to firewood use, promotion of alder-cardamom agro-forestry in the private lands and protection of the small-sized, fragmented forest patches in the subtropical belt.																	0255-660X					DEC	2011	39	4					555	564		10.1007/s12524-011-0110-6								WOS:000297857300013						
J	Vemu, S; Pinnamaneni, UB				Vemu, Sreenivasulu; Pinnamaneni, Udaya Bhaskar			Estimation of spatial patterns of soil erosion using remote sensing and GIS: a case study of Indravati catchment	NATURAL HAZARDS												Soil erosion is a serious environmental problem in Indravati catchment. It carries the highest amount of sediments compared with other catchments in India. This catchment spreading an area of 41,285 km(2) is drained by river Indravati, which is one of the northern tributaries of the river Godavari in its lower reach. In the present study, USLE is used to estimate potential soil erosion from river Indravati catchment. Both magnitude and spatial distribution of potential soil erosion in the catchment is determined. The derived soil loss map from USLE model is classified into six categories ranging from slight to very severe risk depending on the calculated soil erosion amount. The soil erosion map is linked to elevation and slope maps to identify the area for conservation practice in order to reduce the soil loss. From the model output predictions, it is found that average erosion rate predicted is 18.00 tons/ha/year and sediment yield at the out let of the catchment is 22.30 Million tons per annum. The predicted sediment yield verified with the observed data.																	0921-030X					DEC	2011	59	3					1299	1315		10.1007/s11069-011-9832-6								WOS:000296475400005						
J	Arekhi, S				Arekhi, Saleh			Modeling spatial pattern of deforestation using GIS and logistic regression: A case study of northern Ilam forests, Ilam province, Iran	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												This study aimed to predict spatial distribution of deforestation and detects factors influencing forest degradation of Northern forests of Ilam province. For this purpose, effects of six factors including distance from road and settlement areas, forest fragmentation index, elevation, slope and distance from the forest edge on the forest deforestation were studied. In order to evaluate the changes in forest, images related to TM1988, ETM(+)2001 and ETM(+)2007 were processed and classified. There are two classes as, forest and non-forest in order to assess deforestation factors. The logistic regression method is used for modeling and estimating the spatial distribution of deforestation. The results show that about 19,294 ha from forest areas are deforested in the 19 years. Modeling results also indicate that more deforestation occurred in the fragmented forest cover and in the areas of proximity to forest/non forest edge. Furthermore, slope and distance from road and settlement areas had negative relationships with deforestation rates. Meanwhile, deforestation rate is decreased with increase in elevation. Finally, a simple spatial model is presented that is able to predict the location of deforestation by using logistic regression. The validation was also tested using ROC approach which was found to be 0.96.																	1684-5315					NOV 16	2011	10	72					16236	16249		10.5897/AJB11.1122								WOS:000298557500017						
J	Amici, V				Amici, Valerio			Dealing with vagueness in complex forest landscapes: A soft classification approach through a niche-based distribution model	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The increasing interest in biodiversity conservation has led to the development of new approaches to facilitate ecologically based conservation policies and management plans. in this context, the development of effective methods for the classification of forest types constitutes a crucial issue as forests represent the most widespread vegetation structure and play a key role in ecosystem functioning. In this study a maximum entropy approach (Maxent) to forest type classification in a complex Mediterranean area, has been investigated. Maxent, a niche-based model of species/habitat distribution, allowed researchers to estimate the potential distribution of four forest types: Holm oak, Mixed oak, Mixed broadleaved and Riparian forests. The Maxent model's internal tests have proved a powerful tool for estimating the model's accuracy and analyzing the effects of the most important variables in the produced models. Moreover the comparison with a spectral response-based fuzzy classification, showed a higher accuracy in the Maxent outputs, demonstrating how the use of environmental variables, combined with spectral information in the classification of natural or semi-natural land cover classes, improves map accuracies. The modeling approach followed by this study, taking into account the uncertainty proper of the natural ecosystems and the use of environmental variables in land cover classification, can represent a useful approach to making more efficient and effective field inventories and to developing effective conservation policies.

Unfortunately, there was almost no attention to integrating the conservation of cultural heritage (both archaeological and landscape) into the planning of the pipeline, though the Altai is well-known for its rich cultural heritage. Hitherto, no assessment has been made of the potential impact of the project, nor did Gazprom release detailed information about the exact course of the route. The present article aims to illustrate the potential impact of the pipeline based on a detailed study of a small segment of the route, using remote sensing images and data gathered during fieldwork. This assessment underlines the need for a well-thought-out strategy, which is required if sustainable integration of heritage conservation into the construction plan is to be realized. If such a balance is not found, thousands of archaeological monuments could disappear, which would result in a huge cultural and scientific loss. As a possible solution, an integrative strategy founded on a desk-based study of remote sensing images and a well-directed field survey is suggested.

Narendra			Assessment of aquaculture impact on mangroves of Mahanadi delta (Orissa), East coast of India using remote sensing and GIS	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food industries. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture worldwide has resulted in growing concerns about its impact on important ecosystems. The expansion of aquaculture farms in the coastal areas has led to conversion of mangroves, more rapidly. To assess the impact of aquaculture on mangroves, the present study has been undertaken in Mahanadi delta of Orissa, East coast of India which is famous for its distinctive mangrove ecosystem. It has undergone tremendous changes due to the development of aquaculture and agriculture activities during last two decades. For this, satellite data of different time periods (Landsat MSS of 1973, Landsat TM of 1990 and IRS P6 LISS III of 2006) were used. It was found that the delta was occupied by dense mangrove (12.6%), open mangrove (3.3%), aquaculture (12.9%) and agriculture (30.9%) in 2006. A loss of 2606 ha mangrove area and an increase of 3657 ha aquaculture area was observed from 1973 to 2006 clearly depicts the augment of aquaculture industry. It is suggested that, regular monitoring of the mangroves and effective implementation of coastal management laws be strictly undertaken to prevent the further loss mangroves in Mahanadi delta.

We investigate this topic by examining changes in forest cover on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua from 1978 to 1993, a period covering their civil war. We predict an increase in forest cover between pre- and post-conflict periods as residents abandoned agriculture plots and migrated from conflict areas. We used a remote sensing approach to detect changes in forest cover area and fragmentation at two study sites. Results confirmed that in the first 5-7 years of the conflict, reforestation was greater than deforestation, but in the latter years of the conflict deforested land almost doubled that which was reforested. Although some forest loss was due to Category 4 Hurricane Joan, several conflict-related factors were partially responsible for these results, such as mass human migration and land reform. Understanding how and why forest cover changes during periods of conflict can help conservationists protect resources both during war and in the tumultuous period following the cessation of violence when nascent governments lack the power to effectively govern and community institutions are fractured by war. In areas where the livelihoods of people are directly dependent on local resources, anticipating ecological and social impacts can help improve future conservation efforts.																	0960-3115					NOV	2011	20	12					2597	2613		10.1007/s10531-011-0093-1								WOS:000297200000004

Regional Scale Erosion Assessment of a Sub-tropical Highland Segment in the Western Ghats of Kerala, South India	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been used in combination with remote sensing and GIS techniques to assess the spatial pattern and annual rate of soil erosion in the Munnar Forest Division in Western Ghats, Kerala, India. The RUSLE takes into account several factors such as rainfall, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, land cover and erosion control practice for soil erosion prediction. Maximum soil loss of 109.31 t h(-1)y(-1) and the areas with extreme erosion (erosion is higher than 50 t h(-1)y(-1)) are confined to 11.46% of the total area, while the area occupied by severe erosion (erosion rate between 25 and 50 t h(-1)y(-1)) is 27.53%. The high rate of annual soil erosion is associated with areas of high terrain alteration from the plantation activities and highly elevated hills/plateau margins with steep side slopes. Such an output is highly useful in decision making context to avoid land acquisition in erosion risk areas, or, alternatively, to recommend soil conservation measures to reduce soil loss, if developmental activities are to be continued at high soil erosion risk areas.

A time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analyzed from data acquired by the multispectral Aqua/Terra sensors aboard the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite are used to monitor areal extent and density of the aquatic plants. We related the NDVI derived from MODIS imagery to data on El Nio South Oscillation (ENSO) events that were obtained from NOAA and rainfall data from the study site. Our results from the 11-year time-series data show a statistically significant positive correlation (R = 0.6, P = 0.021) between the occurrence of El Nio events and water hyacinth blooms in Winam Gulf. The proliferation of water hyacinth rafts in Winam Gulf may be a response to dramatic environmental and water quality changes in Lake Victoria. The patterns of impact of ENSO events and rainfall show spatial and temporal variation patterns in the region, depending on the time and space evolution of each individual ENSO event that could explain the differences in general patterns of water hyacinth cover in Lake Victoria during different El Nio events. Although the problems eutrophication and water hyacinth are severe in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria some of the solutions to the problem are located several hundreds of kilometers away in the rich agricultural farmlands of the Lake Victoria catchment area. These include better land management practices and strategies aimed at limiting pollution and soil erosion within the lake's drainage basin.																	0920-4741					NOV	2011	25	14					3931	3945		10.1007/s11269-011-9895-x								WOS:000296474900021

Methodological contributions involved acquiring airborne multispectral digital images over two urban cities which were processed, classified, and imported into a GIS environment where landscaped areas were extracted and combined with property and water billing data and local evapotranspiration rates to calculate landscape irrigation applications exceeding estimated water needs. Additional analyses were conducted to compare classified aerial images to ground-measured landscaped areas, landscaped areas to total parcel size, water use on residential and commercial properties, and turf areas under trees when they were leafed out and bare. Results verified the accuracy and value of this approach for municipal water management, showed inure commercial properties applied water in excess of estimated needs compared to residential ones, and that small percentages of users accounted for most of the excess irrigation.

How, and how much, natural cover loss increases species richness	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The species-area relationship has been applied in the conservation context to predict monotonic species richness declines as natural area is converted to human-dominated land covers. However, some conversion of natural cover could introduce new habitat types and allow new open habitat species to occur. Moreover, decelerating richness-area relationships suggest that, as natural area is converted to human-dominated covers, more species will be added to the rare habitat than are lost from the common one. Area effects and increased habitat diversity could each lead to a peaked relationship between species richness and the relative amount of natural area. The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect on avian species richness of conversion of natural area to human-dominated land cover. Location Ontario, Canada. Methods We evaluated the responses of total avian richness, forest bird richness and open habitat bird richness to remaining natural area within 993 quadrats, each of 100 km(2). We quantified the amount of natural land cover and land-cover heterogeneity using remote sensing data. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to disentangle the relationships among avian richness, natural area and land-cover heterogeneity. Results Spatial variation in avian richness was a peaked function of remaining natural area, such that losses of up to 44% of the natural area increased avian richness. This partly reflects increased variety of land cover; however, SEM suggests that much of the increase in richness is due to pure area effects. Richness of forest species declined by two species over this range of natural cover loss while open habitat bird richness increased by approximately 20 species. The effect of natural area on species richness is consistent with the sum of species-area curves for natural habitat species and human-dominated habitat species. Main conclusions At least in northern temperate forests, almost half of the natural land cover can be converted to human-dominated forms before avian richness declines. Conversion of < 50% of regional natural area to human-dominated land cover can benefit open-area species richness with relatively few losses of forest obligate species. However, with > 50% natural area conversion, species begin to drop out of regional assemblages.

The results indicate that historically ESVs for this karst region decreased from 1985 (109.652 billion Yuan) to 1990 (88.789 billion Yuan) and then increased at the turn of the twenty-first century. However, the ESVs in both 2000 (103.384 billion Yuan) and 2005 (106.257 billion Yuan) never achieved the level recorded in 1985. The total of nutrient cycling, organic production and gas regulation combined were 72.69, 64.57, 70.18 and 72.10% of ESVs in 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2005, respectively. In contrast, the ESVs of water conservation, soil reservation, recreation and culture were determined to be relatively low contributing only 17.44, 23.82, 19.26 and 24.76% of total ESVs, respectively, during these four years. With regards to the spatial distribution of ESVs, larger values were recorded in the west and smaller ones recorded in the east. The most significant factors that were deemed to influence ESVs are annual rainfall, per capita cropland, slope and vegetation coverage. Annual rainfall and slope exert a negative force, whereas per capita cropland and vegetation coverage exert a positive force on ESVs. The results of the study would suggest that ecosystem conditions of this important karst region have been improved as the result of the implementation of rocky desertification control policies.

Monitoring land degradation using remote sensing and GIS techniques in an area of the middle Nile Delta, Egypt	CATENA												Detecting soil degradation and recognizing its various types is a necessity to take the practical measures for combating it as well as conserving and keeping the agricultural soil healthy. The present study aims at monitoring soil degradation process within the last four decades in the middle part of Nile Delta. To fulfill this objective, Landsat ETM images and digital elevation model (DEM) are used to produce the physiographic map of the studied area at the landform level. Land degradation rate, causative factors, degree, and land degradation status in the study area were assessed using GIS techniques. The results indicate that the most active land degradation factors in the studied area are; water logging, salinization, alkalinization and compaction. The main causative factors of human induced land degradation types in the area are excessive irrigation, human intervention in natural drainage, improperly time use of heavy machinery and the absence of conservation measurements.

However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities.

In particular, the consequences of urban growth and land cover change on terrestrial carbon budgets is a growing issue for our rapidly urbanizing planet. Using the lowland Seattle Statistical Metropolitan Area (MSA) region as a case study, this paper explores the consequences of the past land cover changes on vegetative carbon stocks with a combination of direct field measurements and a time series of remote sensing data. Between 1986 and 2007, the amount of urban land cover within the lowland Seattle MSA more than doubled, from 1316 km(2) to 2798 km(2), respectively. Virtually all of the urban expansion was at the expense of forests with the forested area declining from 4472 km(2) in 1986 to 2878 km(2) in 2007. The annual mean rate of urban land cover expansion was 1 +/- 0.6% year(-1). We estimate that the impact of these regional land cover changes on aboveground carbon stocks was an average loss of 1.2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in vegetative carbon stocks. These carbon losses from urban expansion correspond to nearly 15% of the lowland regional fossil fuel emissions making it an important, albeit typically overlooked, term in regional carbon emissions budgets. As we plan for future urban growth and strive for more ecologically sustainable cities, it is critical that we understand the past patterns and consequences of urban development to inform future land development and conservation strategies.

Using satellite and field data, we assessed the area deforested by industrial-scale high-yield oil palm expansion in the Peruvian Amazon from 2000 to 2010, finding that 72% of new plantations expanded into forested areas. In a focus area in the Ucayali region, we assessed deforestation for high-and smallholder low-yield oil palm plantations. Low-yield plantations accounted for most expansion overall (80%), but only 30% of their expansion involved forest conversion, contrasting with 75% for high-yield expansion. High-yield expansion minimized the total area required to achieve production but counter-intuitively at higher expense to forests than low-yield plantations. The results show that high-yield agriculture is an important but insufficient strategy to reduce pressure on forests. We suggest that high-yield agriculture can be effective in sparing forests only if coupled with incentives for agricultural expansion into already cleared lands.

Tlierefore one of what required of us is to deduce as much hidden signs as possible from observable changes of landforms. Though serious, damage caused by the October 23rd 2004, Mid-Niigata Prefecture Earthquake has given us a rare opportunity to study the landform changes in mountainous terrain hit by this earthquake. An attempt was made to convert; changes in elevation in Eulerian description for images obtained from remote-sensing technologies to Lagrangian displacements, because Lagrangian displacements can directly describe behaviors of soils, which are typically history-dependent.

In this study, we coupled the Xinanjiang model and SWAT to a new model, EcoHAT, to assess the non-point source pollution in Hainan. The study site is located around the Songtao reservoir, Hainan Island, China, which is regarding as the most important water source system for Hainan. EcoHAT, including algorithms for the hydrological cycle, nutrient cycle, and plant growth cycle, simulated the non-point source pollution for the watershed in calculated grid cell units based on remote sensing data. Remote sensing data were used to interpret the spatial land surface information and derive the model parameters. Besides the remote sensing data, other essential databases such as the meteorological databases, soil chemical and physical databases, and plant nutrients databases were also used in this study. The EcoHAT model was calibrated and validated with 5 years of monitored water quantity and quality data in the Songtao reservoir watershed. The study results indicated that the EcoHAT model has simulated the hydrologic pollutant adequately. After the calibration and validation, the parameters were applied to simulate the nutrient and sediment transport in the Songtao watershed during 2003-2007. In the end, the effects of several specific scenarios of changes in the land covers or management practices on the local watershed nutrients transport were also simulated. The results revealed that: (1) the model has predicted the runoff volume within a range of acceptable accuracy which was reflected by a large coefficient of determination; (2) regression analysis between the observed and simulated values resulted in high values of coefficient of determination (R(2)) during the calibration and validation period. The high values of Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency were achieved with a close agreement between the observed and simulated pollutants concentrations in the runoff. It also indicated that the model simulated the NO(3)-N, NH(4+)-N, and P concentrations in the runoff for the Songtao watershed with considerable accuracy; (3) the sediment loads, TN, and TP, experienced temporal and spatial variations, with strong correlations existing between the parameters and the land use as well as the precipitation; (4) the scenario analysis showed that with 40% fertilization reduction, 7.51% and 7.76% reduction on TN and TP loads respectively could be reached. Besides, the conservation measures are more effective in the study area to reduce the sediment loads than in other areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ORYX												Human-elephant conflict in India, driven by habitat loss and an expanding human population, is a complex challenge for biodiversity conservation. Determining if, how and why this conflict has changed over time will be an important step towards managing landscapes where people and elephants Elephas maxim us coexist. This study combines social surveys and remote sensing data to analyse patterns in human-elephant conflict and land-use change over time. The reported experience of conflict increased dramatically in the early 1980s, with 85% of those surveyed indicating that conflict began after 1980. The expansion of conflict showed a significant southward trend and was associated with forest cover dropping below 30-40%. Based on our results we propose that a critical habitat threshold for human-elephant conflict may exist at 30-40% forest cover. Below this level, conflict expanded across the landscape. The existence of such a deforestation threshold may have important implications for landscape management in elephant range states that seek to avoid or mitigate further conflict. Maintenance of remaining forest areas, reforestation, and the creation of habitat corridors are strategies that could help prevent further expansion of conflict.

Spatial prediction of soil erosion risk by remote sensing, GIS and RUSLE approach: a case study of Siruvani river watershed in Attapady valley, Kerala, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Siruvani watershed with a surface area of 205.54 km(2) (20,554 hectare), forming a part of the Western Ghats in Attapady valley, Kerala, was chosen for testing RUSLE methodology in conjunction with remote sensing and GIS for soil loss prediction and identifying areas with high erosion potential. The RUSLE factors (R, K, LS, C and P) were computed from local rainfall, topographic, soil classification and remote sensing data. This study proved that the integration of soil erosion models with GIS and remote sensing is a simple and effective tool for mapping and quantifying areas and rates of soil erosion for the development of better soil conservation plans. The resultant map of annual soil erosion shows a maximum soil loss of 14.917 t h(-1) year(-1) and the computations suggest that about only 5.76% (1,184 hectares) of the area comes under the severe soil erosion zone followed by the high-erosion zone (11.50% of the total area). The dominant high soil erosion areas are located in the central and southern portion of the watershed and it is attributed to the shifting cultivation, and forest degradation along with the combined effect of K, LS and C factor. The RUSLE model in combination with GIS and remote sensing techniques also enables the assessment of pixel based soil erosion rate.

Predictive distribution modeling with enhanced remote sensing and multiple validation techniques to support mountain bongo antelope recovery	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												Understanding endangered species' spatial ecologies is fundamental to designing effective recovery strategies. Transferable predictive distribution models (PDMs), based on predictors describing the ranges and scales of relevant environmental gradients, can provide this understanding. Using such models for rare species such as the mountain bongo Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci, an endangered antelope being restored within its endemic range in Kenyan montane forests, is difficult because the species' rarity and challenging terrain complicate data collection. To help overcome data limitations, we used advanced remote sensing (RS) and multiple validation techniques to improve bongo PDMs, which were developed using logistic regression and the information-theoretic approach. We derived predictors using RS, including a new technique for measuring micro-scale vegetation structure, and assessed predictive performance using bootstrapping and independent observations. Terrain ruggedness was the strongest habitat-use predictor, followed by soil moisture availability, distance from law enforcement outposts, vegetation structural complexity, and vegetation edge density. Prediction accuracy generally ranged between 73 and 89%, but terrain ruggedness limited model transferability. The more direct RS-based vegetation predictor improved model transferability. Bongo restoration efforts should focus on high probability areas delineated via a composite of all tested models. The techniques used particularly RS - enhanced inference quality and the transferability of distribution models, and can be applied to other critical species and ecosystems.

However, a lack of reliable wetland data limits the efficacy of wetland management in remote mountainous areas. To optimize the management of wetlands in the vicinity of Mount Everest we created a new classification system for high alpine wetlands. Object-oriented image classifications and geographical information systems were used to extract wetland information for 1976, 1988, and 2006 from remote sensing data and field surveys. The results show that total area of wetlands in the vicinity of Mount Everest in 2006 was 1663.5 km(2) mainly found 4100-4800 m above sea level. Wetlands had changed, and the changing area (expansion and contraction) added up to 94.5 km(2) or 5.6% from 1976-2006. Temporal-spatial variation in wetlands and land cover imply that regressive succession has occurred in some areas. Natural driving forces are key factors. Data suggest that creation of the Mount Qomolangma (Everest) National Nature Preserve in 1988 positively impacted wetland conservation.																	0277-5212					OCT	2011	31	5					875	884		10.1007/s13157-011-0202-7								WOS:000296695200006

Due to specific factors, such as high rainfall intensity, steep slopes and vegetation scarcity, Tunisia is prone to soil erosion. Taking this into account, the main objective of this study was to estimate the soil erosion risk in the Batta watershed in Tunisia using qualitative and quantitative erosion model with remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS). Moreover, a developed method that deals with evaluating the impact of vegetation on soil erosion by water is also applied. This method used multi-temporal satellite images with seasonal variability and the transformed soil adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI) which is appropriate in arid and semi-arid areas. For both erosion models, the results show that a large area of the Batta watershed is seriously affected by erosion. This potentially high risk is due especially to severe slopes, poor vegetation coverage and high soil erodibility in this watershed. Furthermore, the use of multi-temporal satellite images and vegetation index show that the effect of vegetation is a significant factor to protect the soil against erosion. The risk is especially serious in the summer season, but it decreases with the growth of vegetation cover in spring. Erosion model, combined with a GIS and remote sensing, is an adequate method to evaluate the soil erosion risk by water. The findings can be used by decision makers as a guideline to plan appropriate strategies for soil and water conservation practices.

J	Bahadur, KCK				Bahadur, Krishna K. C.			Linking physical, economic and institutional constraints of land use change and forest conservation in the hills of Nepal	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS												This paper analyses the changes in spatial patterns of agricultural land use during the period 1976-2000 along the altitudinal gradients in a watershed in Nepal. land change patterns during this period were examined using information on land use derived from satellite images from 1976,1990 and 2000. During the 24-year period from 1976 to 2000 agricultural land use increased by 35% at a cost of loss of forestland. Agricultural expansion was most conspicuous at higher elevations (1150-2000-m). About 36%, 18% and 6% of forestland was converted into agricultural activities from higher, middle and lower elevations respectively in the period from 1990 to 2000. Spatial distribution of living standard parameters, including farm family income and, food availability obtained from family surveys, shows a decreasing trend as the elevation increases whereas percentage of food bought shows an increasing trend. In this way it was found that, lost forest areas were smaller when located around high-income areas with good quality agricultural land and near an administrative centre as compared to areas located around low-income areas with low quality agricultural land and far from an administrative centre. Additionally, a regression model is constructed, to link the socioeconomic variables with the conversion of forestland into agricultural activities, breaking the study area into smaller zones. The spatial trajectories of these zones are then contrasted, paying particular attention to the socioeconomic conditions and institutional arrangements governing access to land resources. The study finds that while overall land change patterns in the region are largely explained by elevation and the socioeconomic conditions of people living adjacent to the forestland, more specifically, in sub-regional areas, trajectories reflect the signatures of institutions governing access to land. As sustainability of the watershed is dependent on forests, continued depletion of forest resources will result in poor economic returns from agriculture for local people together with loss of ecosystem services.

Molecular ecology meets remote sensing: environmental drivers to population structure of humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean	HEREDITY												Genetic analyses of population structure can be placed in explicit environmental contexts if appropriate environmental data are available. Here, we use high-coverage and high-resolution oceanographic and genetic sequence data to assess population structure patterns and their potential environmental influences for humpback dolphins in the Western Indian Ocean. We analyzed mitochondrial DNA data from 94 dolphins from the coasts of South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania and Oman, employing frequency-based and maximum-likelihood algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. The genetic data were combined with 13 years of remote sensing oceanographic data of variables known to influence cetacean dispersal and population structure. Our analyses show strong and highly significant genetic structure between all putative populations, except for those in South Africa and Mozambique. Interestingly, the oceanographic data display marked environmental heterogeneity between all sampling areas and a degree of overlap between South Africa and Mozambique. Our combined analyses therefore suggest the occurrence of genetically isolated populations of humpback dolphins in areas that are environmentally distinct. This study highlights the utility of molecular tools in combination with high-resolution and high-coverage environmental data to address questions not only pertaining to genetic population structure, but also to relevant ecological processes in marine species.

J	Ometto, JP; Aguiar, APD; Martinelli, LA				Ometto, Jean Pierre; Dutra Aguiar, Ana Paula; Martinelli, Luiz Antonio			Amazon deforestation in Brazil: effects, drivers and challenges	CARBON MANAGEMENT												Jean Pierre Ometto(dagger 1), Ana Paula Dutra Aguiar(1) & Luiz Antonio Martinelli(2) The concept of global ecosystem services has become a powerful paradigm for understanding the link between ecosystem processes and related human activities, which is expressed by the economic and ecological quantification of the services in regards to sustainable development. The role of tropical forests in the global climate system and the uncertainty of the exact magnitude of this complex interaction has become a major concern to the scientific community. In this paper we review and synthesize the global effects of Amazon deforestation in Brazil, as well as drivers and challenges related to this process. To this end, we provide data on carbon emissions from combined annual maps of clear cutting of primary forests and spatial information on biomass distribution for different vegetation types and secondary vegetation growth, as well as the temporal dynamic related to the deforestation process and its interregional heterogeneity, the social and institutional drivers. In 2009, during the Conference of Parties, of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (Copenhagen, Denmark), Brazil announced a voluntary commitment to reduce the national GHG emissions by 2020 and, to this end, such commitment requires reducing Amazon rainforest deforestation by 80% over a decade. To achieve this target, a set of consolidated remote sensing techniques have served to monitor and calculate the extent of deforestation, which became indispensable auditing tools for conservation, forest restoration and implementing climate change mitigation schemes.

Tiger landscapes often support considerable human population in proximity of the PA, sometimes within the core itself, and thus are subject to various land use activities (such as agricultural expansion and road development) driving habitat loss and fragmentation. We synthesize information from 27 journal articles in 24 tiger landscapes to assess forest-cover dynamics in tiger-range countries. Although 29% of the PAs considered in this study have negligible change in overall forest cover, approximately 71% are undergoing deforestation and fragmentation. Approximately 58% of the total case studies have human settlements within the core area. Most changes-including agricultural expansion, plantation, and farming (52%), fuelwood and fodder collection (43%), logging (38%), grazing (38%), and tourism and development (10%)-can be attributed to human impacts largely linked to the nature of the management regime. This study highlights the need for incorporating new perspectives, ideas, and lessons learned locally and across borders into management plans to ensure tiger conservation in landscapes dominated by human activities. Given the increasing isolation of most parks due to agricultural, infrastructural, and commercial developments at the periphery, it is imperative to conduct planning and evaluation at the landscape level, as well as incorporate multiple actors and institutions in planning, instead of focusing solely on conservation within the PAs as is currently the case in most tiger parks.

Decadal trends in net ecosystem production and net ecosystem carbon balance for a regional socioecological system	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Carbon sequestration is increasingly recognized as an ecosystem service, and forest management has a large potential to alter regional carbon fluxes - notably by way of harvest removals and related impacts on net ecosystem production (NEP). In the Pacific Northwest region of the US, the implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in 1993 established a regional socioecological system focused on forest management. The NWFP resulted in a large (82%) decrease in the rate of harvest removals on public forest land, thus significantly impacting the regional carbon balance. Here we use a combination of remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to examine the trends in NEP and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) in this region over the 1985-2007 period, with particular attention to land ownership since management now differs widely between public and private forestland. In the late 1980s, forestland in both ownership classes was subject to high rates of harvesting, and consequently the land was a carbon source (i.e. had a negative NECB). After the policy driven reduction in the harvest level, public forestland became a large carbon sink - driven in part by increasing NEP - whereas private forestland was close to carbon neutral. In the 2003-2007 period, the trend towards carbon accumulation on public lands continued despite a moderate increase in the extent of wildfire. The NWFP was originally implemented in the context of biodiversity conservation, but its consequences in terms of carbon sequestration are also of societal interest. Ultimately, management within the NWFP socioecological system will have to consider trade-offs among these and other ecosystem services. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Predictive model for sustaining biodiversity in tropical countryside	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Growing demand for food, fuel, and fiber is driving the intensification and expansion of agricultural land through a corresponding displacement of native woodland, savanna, and shrubland. In the wake of this displacement, it is clear that farmland can support biodiversity through preservation of important ecosystem elements at a fine scale. However, how much biodiversity can be sustained and with what tradeoffs for production are open questions. Using a well-studied tropical ecosystem in Costa Rica, we develop an empirically based model for quantifying the "wildlife-friendliness" of farmland for native birds. Some 80% of the 166 mist-netted species depend on fine-scale countryside forest elements (<= 60-m-wide clusters of trees, typically of variable length and width) that weave through farmland along hilltops, valleys, rivers, roads, and property borders. Our model predicts with similar to 75% accuracy the bird community composition of any part of the landscape. We find conservation value in small (<= 20 m wide) clusters of trees and somewhat larger (<= 60 m wide) forest remnants to provide substantial support for biodiversity beyond the borders of tropical forest reserves. Within the study area, forest elements on farms nearly double the effective size of the local forest reserve, providing seminatural habitats for bird species typically associated with the forest. Our findings provide a basis for estimating and sustaining biodiversity in farming systems through managing fine-scale ecosystem elements and, more broadly, informing ecosystem service analyses, biodiversity action plans, and regional land use strategies.

Mapping urbanization dynamics at regional and global scales using multi-temporal DMSP/OLS nighttime light data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Urban areas concentrate people, economic activity, and the built environment. As such, urbanization is simultaneously a demographic, economic, and land-use change phenomenon. Historically, the remote sensing community has used optical remote sensing data to map urban areas and the expansion of urban land-cover for individual cities, with little research focused on regional and global scale patterns of urban change. However, recent research indicates that urbanization at regional scales is growing in importance for economics, policy, land use planning, and conservation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand and monitor urbanization dynamics at regional and global scales. Here, we illustrate the use of multi-temporal nighttime light (NTL) data from the U.S Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellites Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) to monitor urban change at regional and global scales. We use independently derived data on population, land use and land cover to test the ability of multi-temporal NTL data to measure regional and global urban growth over time. We apply an iterative unsupervised classification method on multi-temporal NTL data from 1992 to 2008 to map urbanization dynamics in India, China, Japan, and the United States. For two-year intervals between 1992 and 2000, India consistently experienced higher rates of urban growth than China, and both countries exceeded the urban growth rates of the United States and Japan. This is not surprising given that the populations of India and China were growing faster than those of the U.S. and Japan during those periods. For two-year intervals between 2000 and 2008, China experienced higher rates of urban growth than India. Results show that the multi-temporal NTL provides a regional and potentially global measure of the spatial and temporal changes in urbanization dynamics for countries at certain levels of GDP and population-driven growth.

J	Anemone, R; Emerson, C; Conroy, G				Anemone, Robert; Emerson, Charles; Conroy, Glenn			Finding Fossils in New Ways: An Artificial Neural Network Approach to Predicting the Location of Productive Fossil Localities	EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY												Chance and serendipity have long played a role in the location of productive fossil localities by vertebrate paleontologists and paleoanthropologists. We offer an alternative approach, informed by methods borrowed from the geographic information sciences and using recent advances in computer science, to more efficiently predict where fossil localities might be found. Our model uses an artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained to recognize the spectral characteristics of known productive localities and other land cover classes, such as forest, wet-lands, and scrubland, within a study area based on the analysis of remotely sensed (RS) imagery. Using these spectral signatures, the model then classifies other pixels throughout the study area. The results of the neural network classification can be examined and further manipulated within a geographic information systems (GIS) software package. While we have developed and tested this model on fossil mammal localities in deposits of Paleocene and Eocene age in the Great Divide Basin of southwestern Wyoming, a similar analytical approach can be easily applied to fossil-bearing sedimentary deposits of any age in any part of the world. We suggest that new analytical tools and methods of the geographic sciences, including remote sensing and geographic information systems, are poised to greatly enrich paleoanthropological investigations, and that these new methods should be embraced by field workers in the search for, and geospatial analysis of, fossil primates and hominins.																	1060-1538	1520-6505				SEP-OCT	2011	20	5					169	180		10.1002/evan20324								WOS:000296389400003	22034235					
J	Mantelli, LR; Barbosa, JM; Bitencourt, MD				Mantelli, Luiz Rogerio; Barbosa, Jomar Magalhaes; Bitencourt, Marisa Dantas			Assessing ecological risk through automated drainage extraction and watershed delineation	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Decision makers are frequently involved in projects requiring ecological risk definition, which are inherent to biological conservation process. It is important to recognize these risks in order to invest wisely in the management and protection of biological resources. In this matter, Geographic Information System tools and remote sensing data have been used frequently as important components in planning and management of conservation units, Rabus et al. (2003), Valeriano et al. (2009) and Valeriano et al. (2010) stressed the advantages of using data that were gathered during the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) for biological and geomorphologic purposes. For Brazil's national territory, the SRTM data were refined (Valeriano, 2008) and offered as free access on the TOPODATA Project website (http://www.dsr.inpe.br/topodata) where geomorphometric information (including elevation data) at a resolution of 30 m are provided. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate an example of how TOPODATA products have been applied in order to determine the ecological risk of the border of a Conservation Unit, located in the State of Sao Paulo Brazil, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, using automated drainage network and watershed extraction. A comparison between SRTM. TOPODATA, and ASTER OEM was carried out, showing an advantage of TOPODATA drainage network product. The vectors generated using this data are more similar to the official drainage network vectors than the drainage network extracted using ASTER-DEM or SRTM. The network product generated using ASTER-OEM produced many commission errors and the one generated using SRTM produced a poor network, with generalized vectors, less detailed than the others. The results showed that using the TOPODATA Project's Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can provide important data for ecological analysis and significant additional information for decision making, regarding drainage networks and watershed features. The produced map for border ecological risk showed to fit perfectly to the field work analyses, produced in other works. Furthermore, the extracted watershed polygons might furnish important information unrevealing best conservation unit boundaries, which means more efficient management and best biological conservation results.

Harman			Relating nutrient and herbicide fate with landscape features and characteristics of 15 subwatersheds in the Choptank River watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Excess nutrients and agrochemicals from non-point sources contribute to water quality impairment in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and their loading rates are related to land use, agricultural practices, hydrology, and pollutant fate and transport processes. In this study, monthly baseflow stream samples from 15 agricultural subwatersheds of the Choptank River in Maryland USA (2005 to 2007) were characterized for nutrients, herbicides, and herbicide transformation products. High-resolution digital maps of land use and forested wetlands were derived from remote sensing imagery. Examination of landscape metrics and water quality data, partitioned according to hydrogeomorphic class, provided insight into the fate, delivery, and transport mechanisms associated with agricultural pollutants. Mean Nitrate-N concentrations (4.9 mg/L) were correlated positively with percent agriculture (R-2 = 0.56) and negatively with percent forest (R-2 = 0.60). Concentrations were greater (p = 0.0001) in the well-drained upland (WDU) hydrogeomorphic region than in poorly drained upland (PDU), reflecting increased denitrification and reduced agricultural land use intensity in the PDU landscape due to the prevalence of hydric soils. Atrazine and metolachlor concentrations (mean 029 mu g/L and 0.19 mu g/L) were also greater (p = 0.0001) in WDU subwatersheds than in PDU subwatersheds. Springtime herbicide concentrations exhibited a strong, positive correlation (R-2 = 0.90) with percent forest in the WDU subwatersheds but not in the PDU subwatersheds. In addition, forested riparian stream buffers in the WDU were more prevalent than in the PDU where forested patches are typically not located near streams, suggesting an alternative delivery mechanism whereby volatilized herbicides are captured by the riparian forest canopy and subsequently washed off during rainfall. Orthophosphate, CIAT (6-chloro-N-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine), CEAT (6-chloro-N-ethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine), and MESA (2-[(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl) (2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)amino]-2-oxoethanesulfonic acid) were also analyzed. These findings will assist efforts in targeting implementation of conservation practices to the most environmentally-critical areas within watersheds to achieve water quality improvements in a cost-effective manner.

Remote analysis of biological invasion and the impact of enemy release	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Escape from natural enemies is a widely held generalization for the success of exotic plants. We conducted a large-scale experiment in Hawaii (USA) to quantify impacts of ungulate removal on plant growth and performance, and to test whether elimination of an exotic generalist herbivore facilitated exotic success. Assessment of impacted and control sites before and after ungulate exclusion using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR, time series satellite observations, and ground-based field studies over nine years indicated that removal of generalist herbivores facilitated exotic success, but the abundance of native species was unchanged. Vegetation cover,1 m in height increased in ungulate-free areas from 48.7% +/- 1.5% to 74.3% +/- 1.8% over 8.4 years, corresponding to an annualized growth rate of lambda = 1.05 +/- 0.01 yr(-1) (median +/- SD). Most of the change was attributable to exotic plant species, which increased from 24.4% +/- 1.4% to 49.1% +/- 2.0%, (lambda = 1.08 +/- 0.01 yr(-1)). Native plants experienced no significant change in cover (23.0% +/- 1.3% to 24.2% +/- 1.8%, lambda = 1.01 +/- 0.01 yr(-1)). Time series of satellite phenology were indistinguishable between the treatment and a 3.0-km(2) control site for four years prior to ungulate removal, but they diverged immediately following exclusion of ungulates. Comparison of monthly EVI means before and after ungulate exclusion and between the managed and control areas indicates that EVI strongly increased in the managed area after ungulate exclusion. Field studies and airborne analyses show that the dominant invader was Senecio madagascariensis, an invasive annual forb that increased from <0.01% to 14.7% fractional cover in ungulate-free areas (lambda -1.89 +/- 0.34 yr(-1)), but which was nearly absent from the control site. A combination of canopy LAI, water, and fractional cover were expressed in satellite EVI time series and indicate that the invaded region maintained greenness during drought conditions. These findings demonstrate that enemy release from generalist herbivores can facilitate exotic success and suggest a plausible mechanism by which invasion occurred. They also show how novel remote-sensing technology can be integrated with conservation and management to help address exotic plant invasions.

Epipelagic fish distributions in relation to thermal fronts in a coastal upwelling system using high-resolution remote-sensing techniques	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Coastal upwelling systems are characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variability with respect to surface conditions, with fauna patchily distributed and high abundances in localized areas. Examining habitat associations on finer spatial scales than previous studies have been able to achieve would advance the understanding of important marine coastal ecosystems. This study evaluates the spatial and temporal relationships of single fish and fish schools with sea surface temperature (SST) fronts in the northern California Current upwelling system, using lidar (light detection and ranging) from an aircraft to sample surface waters over the continental shelf. High-resolution data were collected on the distribution of surface nekton and SST, then the locations of fish were analysed with respect to their proximity to SST fronts using GIS spatial analyses. Both fish schools and solitary fish were located significantly closer to fronts than would be expected by chance. The association of fish to fronts varied with the progression of the upwelling season such that fish associated less with fronts under stronger upwelling conditions. The relationships observed indicate the importance of thermal features to fish as a habitat component in a variable upwelling environment and have implications for management and conservation.

These forests provide an informative case study of mountain deforestation in South America. They are surrounded by tropical lowland forests, and they host most of the country's human population. This study evaluates the relative importance of human and natural variables in deforestation of the Colombian Andes between 1985 and 2005 using remote sensing methods, geographic information system (GIS) technology and general linear models (GLM). The following factors affected the annual deforestation in the region positively: forced population migration, unsatisfied basic needs, economic activity, crops, pastures, illicit crops, protected areas and slope. Factors having a negative effect were tenure of small land parcels, road density, water scarcity and mean temperature. The results of this study also provide insight into the differences between the dynamics of lowland forests and those of montane forests. Montane forests had a lower annual rate of deforestation than did forests in the lowlands. Socio-economic, demographic and biophysical factors explain overall deforestation rates for the region. However, when altitude variation is taken into account, intraregional differences in the Andes become evident. Deforestation processes differ between those areas adjacent to the high Andean valleys where most of the country's population concentrates and those areas in the tropical lowlands north, west and east of the Andean chain. Differences between lowland and montane forest dynamics are due partly to the accessibility of forests and differences in wealth and economic activities. In montane forests, deforestation is positively influenced by economic activity, the presence of protected areas and higher slopes. Deforestation in montane forests is negatively affected by tenure of small land parcels, road density, water scarcity and mean temperature. Lowland deforestation rates are more closely related to rural population, pasture percentage, crops, protected areas and temperature. Our results suggest that montane forests appear to be in a more advanced stage of colonisation and economic development, whereas lowland forests are closer to the colonisation frontier and to rapidly growing colonist populations. This study reinforces the idea that although the most common tropical drivers of deforestation are found in the Andes, these drivers operate differently when intraregional differences are considered.

How landscape dynamics link individual- to population-level movement patterns: a multispecies comparison of ungulate relocation data	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To demonstrate how the interrelations of individual movements form large-scale population-level movement patterns and how these patterns are associated with the underlying landscape dynamics by comparing ungulate movements across species. Locations Arctic tundra in Alaska and Canada, temperate forests in Massachusetts, Patagonian Steppes in Argentina, Eastern Steppes in Mongolia. Methods We used relocation data from four ungulate species (barren-ground caribou, Mongolian gazelle, guanaco and moose) to examine individual movements and the interrelation of movements among individuals. We applied and developed a suite of spatial metrics that measure variation in movement among individuals as population dispersion, movement coordination and realized mobility. Taken together, these metrics allowed us to quantify and distinguish among different large-scale population-level movement patterns such as migration, range residency and nomadism. We then related the population-level movement patterns to the underlying landscape vegetation dynamics via long-term remote sensing measurements of the temporal variability, spatial variability and unpredictability of vegetation productivity. Results Moose, which remained in sedentary home ranges, and guanacos, which were partially migratory, exhibited relatively short annual movements associated with landscapes having very little broad-scale variability in vegetation. Caribou and gazelle performed extreme long-distance movements that were associated with broad-scale variability in vegetation productivity during the peak of the growing season. Caribou exhibited regular seasonal migration in which individuals were clustered for most of the year and exhibited coordinated movements. In contrast, gazelle were nomadic, as individuals were independently distributed and moved in an uncoordinated manner that relates to the comparatively unpredictable (yet broad-scale) vegetation dynamics of their landscape. Main conclusions We show how broad-scale landscape unpredictability may lead to nomadism, an understudied type of long-distance movement. In contrast to classical migration where landscapes may vary at broad scales but in a predictable manner, long-distance movements of nomadic individuals are uncoordinated and independent from other such individuals. Landscapes with little broad-scale variability in vegetation productivity feature smaller-scale movements and allow for range residency. Nomadism requires distinct integrative conservation strategies that facilitate long-distance movements across the entire landscape and are not limited to certain migration corridors.

J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Gallardo-Cruz, JA; Meave, JA; Dupuy, JM				Luis Hernandez-Stefanoni, J.; Alberto Gallardo-Cruz, J.; Meave, Jorge A.; Manuel Dupuy, Juan			Combining geostatistical models and remotely sensed data to improve tropical tree richness mapping	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Information on the spatial distribution and composition of biological communities is essential in designing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. Reliable maps of species richness across the landscape can be useful tools for these purposes. Acquiring such information through traditional survey techniques is costly and logistically difficult. The kriging interpolation method has been widely used as an alternative to predict spatial distributions of species richness, as long as the data are spatially dependent. However, even when this requirement is met, researchers often have few sampled sites in relation to the area to be mapped. Remote sensing provides an inexpensive means to derive complete spatial coverage for large areas and can be extremely useful for estimating biodiversity. The aim of this study was to combine remotely sensed data with kriging estimates (hybrid procedures) to evaluate the possibility of improving the accuracy of tree species richness maps. We did this through the comparison of the predictive performance of three hybrid geostatistical procedures, based on tree species density recorded in 141 sampling quadrats: co-kriging (COK), kriging with external drift (KED), and regression kriging (RK). Reflectance values of spectral bands, computed NDVI and texture measurements of Landsat 7 TM imagery were used as ancillary variables in all methods. The R(2) values of the models increased from 0.35 for ordinary kriging to 0.41 for COK, and from 0.39 for simple regression estimates to 0.52 and 0.53 when using simple KED and RK, respectively. The R(2) values of the models also increased from 0.60 for multiple regression estimates to 0.62 and 0.66 when using multiple KED and RK, respectively. Overall, our results demonstrate that these procedures are capable of greatly improving estimation accuracy, with multivariate RK being clearly superior, because it produces the most accurate predictions, and because of its flexibility in modeling multivariate relationships between tree richness and remotely sensed data. We conclude that this is a valuable tool for guiding future efforts aimed at conservation and management of highly diverse tropical forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The effect of a protected area on the tradeoffs between short-run and long-run benefits from mangrove ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Protected areas are used to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, protected areas can create tradeoffs spatially and temporally among ecosystem services, which can affect the welfare of dependent local communities. This study examines the effect of a protected area on the tradeoff between two extractive ecosystem services from mangrove forests: cutting mangroves (fuelwood) and harvesting the shrimp and fish that thrive if mangroves are not cut. We demonstrate the effect in the context of Saadani National Park (SANAPA) in Tanzania, where enforcement of prohibition of mangrove harvesting was strengthened to preserve biodiversity. Remote sensing data of mangrove cover over time are integrated with georeferenced household survey data in an econometric framework to identify the causal effect of mangrove protection on income components directly linked to mangrove ecosystem services. Our findings suggest that many households experienced an immediate loss in the consumption of mangrove firewood, with the loss most prevalent in richer households. However, all wealth classes appear to benefit from long-term sustainability gains in shrimping and fishing that result from mangrove protection. On average, we find that a 10% increase in the mangrove cover within SANAPA boundaries in a 5-km(2) radius of the subvillage increases shrimping income by approximately twofold. The creation of SANAPA shifted the future trajectory of the area from one in which mangroves were experiencing uncontrolled cutting to one in which mangrove conservation is providing gains in income for the local villages as a result of the preservation of nursery habitat and biodiversity.																	0027-8424					AUG 23	2011	108	34					13945	13950		10.1073/pnas.1101825108								WOS:000294163500023	21873182					
J	Onojeghuo, AO; Blackburn, GA				Onojeghuo, Alex Okiemute; Blackburn, George Alan			Optimising the use of hyperspectral and LiDAR data for mapping reedbed habitats	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Reedbeds are important habitats for supporting biodiversity and delivering a range of ecosystem services, yet reedbeds in the UK are under threat from intensified agriculture, changing land use and pollution. To develop appropriate conservation strategies, information on the distribution of reedbeds is required. Field surveys of these wetland environments are difficult, time consuming and expensive to execute for large areas. Remote sensing has the potential to replace or complement such field surveys, yet the specific application to reedbed habitats has not been fully investigated. In the present study, airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery were acquired for two sites in Cumbria, UK. The research aimed to determine the most effective means of analysing hyperspectral data covering the visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions for mapping reedbeds and to investigate the effects of incorporating image textural information and LiDAR-derived measures of canopy structure on the accuracy of reedbed delineation. Due to the high dimensionality of the hyperspectral data, three image compression algorithms were evaluated: principal component analysis (PCA), spectrally segmented PCA (SSPCA) and minimum noise fraction (MNF). The LiDAR-derived measures tested were the canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM) and the DSM-derived slope map. The SSPCA-compressed data produced the highest reedbed accuracy and processing efficiency. The optimal SSPCA dataset incorporated 12 PCs comprised of the first 3 PCs derived from each of the spectral segments: visible (392700 nm), NIR (701972 nm), SWIR-1 (9731366 nm) and SWIR-2 (15302240 nm). Incorporating image textural measures produced a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when using MNF-compressed data, but had no impact when using the SSPCA-compressed imagery. A significant improvement (+ 11%) in the accuracy of reedbed delineation was achieved when a mask generated by applying a 3 m threshold to the LiDAR-derived CHM was used to filter the reedbed map derived from the optimal SSPCA dataset. This paper demonstrates the value in combining appropriately compressed hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR data for the effective mapping of reedbed habitats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, in addition to habitat conversion to crop production or urban uses, ecosystem alteration (e.g., from logging, conversion to plantations, biological invasion, or fire suppression) is a large source of conservation risk. We add data quantifying ecosystem alteration on unconverted lands to arrive at a more accurate depiction of conservation risk for the conterminous United States. We quantify ecosystem alteration using a recent national assessment based on remote sensing of current vegetation compared with modeled reference natural vegetation conditions. Highly altered (but not converted) ecosystems comprise 23% of the conterminous United States, such that the number of critically endangered ecoregions in the United States is 156% higher than when calculated using habitat conversion data alone. Increased attention to natural resource management will be essential to address widespread ecosystem alteration and reduce conservation risk.																	1932-6203					AUG 5	2011	6	8							e23002	10.1371/journal.pone.0023002								WOS:000293563300033	21850248					
J	Torontow, V; King, D				Torontow, Valerie; King, Douglas			Forest complexity modelling and mapping with remote sensing and topographic data: a comparison of three methods	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The concept of forest complexity has been recently adopted to represent the multiple horizontal and vertical forest structure and composition attributes that support ecological functions in a single measure or index. The index variables are often selected based on known associations with types of habitat and biodiversity potential. In modelling and mapping of forest complexity using geospatial data, three multivariate methods have been evaluated in previous studies: (i) defining an additive complexity index by manual a priori selection and combination of a set of field variables followed by regression-based modelling of the index against geospatial data; (ii) as the previous method, but where a complexity index is defined a priori using principal components analysis (PCA) of the field data; and (iii) direct modelling of a set of field variables against a set of geospatial variables using techniques such as redundancy analysis (RDA). The objective of this study was to compare these methods through an assessment of model quality and their relative merits and limitations in implementation. In the rural municipality of Chelsea, Quebec, 70 field plots were established, and 24 forest structure and composition variables were measured that had between-variable correlations of less than 0.8. Spectral and spatial Quickbird imagery information and topographic data were used to derive complexity models using the three methods. The manual additive index and the RDA-derived index had similar validation errors relative to their index means (24.3% and 22.3%, respectively). However, the RDA index was based on the full set of 24 field variables, which had a total structure-composition variance greater than the manual additive index comprised of a subset of 10 of those variables. Thus, the RDA index was deemed to more comprehensively represent forest structure and composition than the additive index. RDA also produced outputs that were richer in information content, showing associations between individual variables and plots, as well as forest-environmental gradients. The PCA method was useful for evaluating environmental gradients in the field data, but dimensionality was too high to provide a single useful complexity index for modelling with geospatial data. The additive and RDA index models were used to produce maps of predicted forest complexity to aid in biodiversity survey planning and habitat conservation efforts within the municipality.

Protection of wintering sites may be crucial for the conservation of the species. Previous studies have identified extensive areas of north-western sub-Saharan Africa that could potentially be occupied by the species during winter. However, these studies have not necessarily differentiated between potentially suitable and unsuitable habitat types at a spatial resolution appropriate for targeting field surveys. To identify specific sites that could be occupied by non-breeding Aquatic Warblers at a scale appropriate for targeted field surveys, we adopted a modelling approach that combined recent sightings from Djoudj, Senegal, with land cover and climate data. We produced maps of potential distribution using three maximum entropy models. While a paucity of sightings prevented a full test of these maps on independent records, the areas that were predicted to be potentially occupied included areas around which there are historical records. We suggest field surveys should be targeted towards sites in the Inner Niger Delta and a number of marshes along and away from the Niger River in Mali, and to sites in southern Mauritania.

J	Niemann, JD; Lehman, BM; Gates, TK; Hallberg, NU; Elhaddad, A				Niemann, Jeffrey D.; Lehman, Brandon M.; Gates, Timothy K.; Hallberg, Niklas U.; Elhaddad, Aymn			Impact of Shallow Groundwater on Evapotranspiration Losses from Uncultivated Land in an Irrigated River Valley	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												In many agricultural regions of the West, decades of intensive irrigation have produced shallow water tables under not only cultivated fields but also the nearby uncultivated land. It is possible that the high water tables under the uncultivated lands are substantially increasing evapotranspiration (ET) rates, which would represent an unnatural and potentially nonbeneficial consumptive use. The objective of this paper is to quantify loss of water that occurs from uncultivated lands in a semiarid irrigated river valley (the Lower Arkansas River Valley in southeastern Colorado). A remote-sensing algorithm is used to estimate actual ET rates on 16 dates on the basis of Landsat satellite images. On the same dates, water table depths, soil moisture values, and soil water salinities are measured at up to 84 wells distributed across three study sites. On the basis of a water balance of the root zone, it is estimated that 78% of the ET is supplied by groundwater upflux at these sites. It is also observed that the ET and groundwater upflux decrease with increasing water table depth. A regression analysis indicates that the spatial variations in ET are most closely related to variations in vegetation-related attributes, whereas soil moisture and water table depths also explain substantial amounts of the variation. Valley-wide implications for reducing nonbeneficial ET through water table control also are discussed. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000356.

J	Masoud, AA				Masoud, Alaa A.			Runoff modeling of the wadi systems for estimating flash flood and groundwater recharge potential in Southern Sinai, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Evaluating the likelihood of a flash flood as well as flood water resource is vital for establishing properly sustainable developments in arid environments. However, the high degree of spatial and temporal variability in hydrometeorological processes and the general lack of suitable data limit these efforts. In the present work, a runoff model, adopting the simple Soil Conservation Service method, was built for 13 ungauged catchments in Southern Sinai, Egypt. Runoff modeling was conducted as a function of the descriptive parameters of the catchments, and the maximum average rainfall occurred in 1 day in the period 1960-1990, designed according to a storm event recorded at the outlet of one of the studied catchments on the 2nd of November 1994. The catchments' descriptive parameters were extracted from available remote sensing data and field investigations. Land covers including road networks and 83 rock-soil types were also extracted from the maximum likelihood classification of the Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. The catchments were then subdivided into 103 smaller subcatchments, which were then placed into different terrain types according to hydrologically relevant surface characteristics. Hydrologic characteristics and soil type(s) in the subcatchments were estimated during on-site visits. Morphometric parameters of the wadi catchments and the channel networks were derived from the analysis of the SRTM3 digital elevation model (DEM). Hydrographs were drawn and routed to the main catchment outlets based on appropriate wadi dimensions and roughness using the Muskingum's method. The runoff and infiltration volumes were quantified. The resulting models have been used to investigate the relative potential for flooding and the groundwater recharge in the catchments. Further, in order to determine specific sites with a high potential for flood risk and groundwater recharge, decision-ruled integrated analysis of the generated GIS layers describing relative stream power and wetness indices were applied. Due to the lack of flow data, the results of the hydrological models were validated against the DEM-derived relative stream power and the wetness indices as well as against field checks and available reports as an alternative. The results of this study could help to prioritize areas where flood control measures should be directed, as well as effectively augment management plans for the appropriate development of water resources.

Studies of landscape ecology focus on understanding the dynamics of ecological patterns and processes, and highlight the integration of multiple disciplines. In this paper, we discussed the problems and challenges that landscape ecology is currently facing, emphasizing the limitations of current methods used to describe dynamic landscape patterns and processes. We suggested that the focus should be on the integration of ground-based observation, mobile monitoring, transect survey, and remote-sensing monitoring, as well as improved coupling of experimental and model simulations. In addition, we outlined the research frontiers in landscape ecology, including scaling, integrated pattern and process modeling, and regional synthesis. Lastly, a brief review of pattern-process-scale coupling studies in China was provided. We concluded by pointing out that pattern-process-scale interactions, correlations between natural, economic, and social processes, and the coupling of human and natural systems will be major research areas in landscape ecology in the future.

The Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (PECBM) has been launched by the BirdLife Partnership in Europe, where the European Bird Census Council has been collecting data from 20 independent breeding bird survey programs across Europe over the last 25 years. These data show dramatic declines in European farmland birds. We suggest that seasonal characteristics of vegetation cover derived from high temporal resolution remote sensing images could facilitate the monitoring the suitability of farmland bird habitats, and that these indicators may be a better choice for monitoring than climate data. We used redundancy analysis to link the PECBM data of the estimated number of farmland birds in Europe to a set of phenological and climatic indicators and to the biogeographic regions of Europe. Variance partitioning was used to account for the variation explained by the phenological and climate variables and by the area of the environmental strata individually, to define the pure effect of the variables, and to extract the total explained variance. The analysis revealed high statistical significance (p < 0.001) of the correlations between species and environment. Phenological indices explained 38% of the variance in community composition of the 23 farmland bird species, whereas climate explained 30% of the variance. After partitioning the other variables as covariables, the pure effect of phenology, climate, and environmental strata were 16%, 8%, and 16%, respectively. Based on the probability results, we suggest that phenological indicators derived from remote sensing may supply better indicators for continental scale biodiversity studies than climate only. In addition, these indicators are cost and time effective, are on continuous scale, and are readily repeatable on a large spatial coverage while supplying standardized results.																	1420-2026					AUG	2011	16	4					385	399		10.1007/s10666-011-9251-9								WOS:000293243800006

Taking Jiangsu Province, China, as a representative wetland region subject to extensive human activities, the aim of this study is to understand the conversion trajectory and spatial differentiation in wetland change from a multi-scale perspective. Based on multi-temporal Landsat images, it was found that the natural wetlands decreased by 11.2% from 1990 to 2006 in Jiangsu Province. Transition matrices showed that the conversion of natural wetlands to human-made wetlands (mostly aquaculture ponds) was the major form of natural wetland reduction, accounting for over 60% of the reduction. Percentage reduction and area reduc tion of natural wetlands were respectively quantified within different wetland cover zones using a moving window analysis. Average percentage reduction showed a decreasing tendency with increasing wetland cover. The high-cover and mid-cover zone presented the largest area reduction at the scales of 1-2 km and 4-8 km, respectively. Local hotspots of natural wetland reduction were mapped using the equal-interval and quantile classification schemes. The hotspots were mostly concentrated in the Lixiahe marshes and the coastal wetland areas. For the area reduction hotspots, the quantile classification presented larger area and more patches than the equal-interval classification; while an opposite result was shown for the percentage reduction hotspots. With respect to the discontinuous distribution of the natural wetlands, area reduction could be more appropriate to represent reduction hotspots than percentage reduction in the study area. These findings could have useful implications to wetland conservation.

Characterization of Solang valley watershed in western Himalaya for bio-resource conservation using remote sensing techniques	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The development activities in mountainous region though provide comfort to the human being and enhance the socioeconomic status of the people but create pressure on the bio-resources. In this paper, the current status of land use/landcover and the vegetation communities of the Solang valley watershed in Himachal Pradesh of Indian western Himalaya has been mapped and presented using remote sensing. This watershed area was dominated by alpine and sub-alpine pastures (30.34%) followed by scree slopes (22.34%) and forests (21.06%). Many tree, shrub, and herb species identified in the study area are among the prioritized species for conservation in the Indian Himalayan Region. Thus, scientific interventions and preparation of action plans based on ecological survey are required for conservation of the Solang valley watershed.

This paper applied the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to investigate the spatial distribution of annual soil loss over the upper basin of Miyun reservoir in China. Among the soil erosion factors, which are rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length (L), slope steepness (S), vegetation cover (C), and support practice factor (P), the vegetative cover or C factor, which represents the effects of vegetation canopy and ground covers in reducing soil loss, has been one of the most difficult to estimate over broad geographic areas. In this paper, the C factor was estimated based on back propagation neural network and the results were compared with the values measured in the field. The correlation coefficient (r) obtained was 0.929. Then the C factor and the other factors were used as the input to RUSLE model. By integrating the six factor maps in geographical information system (GIS) through pixel-based computing, the spatial distribution of soil loss over the upper basin of Miyun reservoir was obtained. The results showed that the annual average soil loss for the upper basin of Miyun reservoir was 9.86 t ha (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) ya (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) in 2005, and the area of 46.61 km(2) (0.3%) experiences extremely severe erosion risk, which needs suitable conservation measures to be adopted on a priority basis. The spatial distribution of erosion risk classes was 66.9% very low, 21.89% low, 6.18% moderate, 2.89% severe, and 1.84% very severe. Thus, by using RUSLE in a GIS environment, the spatial distribution of water erosion can be obtained and the regions which susceptible to water erosion and need immediate soil conservation planning and application over the upper watershed of Miyun reservoir in China can be identified.					chen, tao/0000-0001-6965-1256												0167-6369					AUG	2011	179	1-4					605	617		10.1007/s10661-010-1766-z								WOS:000292745000045	21058050

While the combination of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling provides a useful tool for habitat monitoring, the effect of incorporating remotely sensed data on model transferability is unclear. Therefore, our objectives were to assess how different satellite-derived variables affect temporal transferability of habitat models and their usefulness for habitat monitoring. Location Wolong Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Methods We modelled giant panda habitat with the maximum entropy algorithm using panda presence data collected in two time periods and four different sets of predictor variables representing land surface phenology. Each predictor variable set contained either a time series of smoothed wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) or 11 phenology metrics, both derived from single-year or multi-year (i.e. 3-year) remotely sensed imagery acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the ability of models obtained with these four variable sets to predict giant panda habitat within and across time periods by using threshold-independent and threshold-dependent evaluation methods and five indices of temporal transferability. Results Our results showed that models developed with the four variable sets were all useful for characterizing and monitoring giant panda habitat. However, the models developed using multi-year data exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed using single-year data. In addition, models developed with phenology metrics, especially when using multi-year data, exhibited significantly higher temporal transferability than those developed with the time series. Main conclusions The integration of land surface phenology, captured by high temporal resolution remotely sensed imagery, with habitat modelling constitutes a suitable tool for characterizing wildlife habitat and monitoring its temporal dynamics. Using multi-year phenology metrics reduces model complexity, multicollinearity among predictor variables and variability caused by inter-annual climatic fluctuations, thereby increasing the temporal transferability of models. This study provides useful guidance for habitat monitoring through the integration of remote sensing technology and habitat modelling, which may be useful for the conservation of the giant panda and many other species.

Recent developments in remote sensing technology have greatly enriched the availability of geospatial data that can be used in hydrological modeling to assess the potential hydrological response of conservation practices over larger areas. A methodology was developed using the object-based image analysis approach with Landsat-5 TM imagery of the year 2005 and thematic layers of streams to quantify conservation buffers and grasslands (OBIA-2005). The OBIA-2005 land cover data was used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model to assess the impacts of vegetative conservation practices on total phosphorus (TP) loads. The model was calibrated and validated for discharge and TP loads in the Cedar Creek Watershed (CCW) in northeast Indiana. In general model efficiency for streamflow values was within acceptable statistical ranges. While calibration of TP loads was satisfactory for the total contributing area of two nested catchments within the upper CCW. Vegetative buffers of 30.5 m and 61 m combined with conservation grasslands generated from the OBIA-2005 resulted in a large reduction of TP loads as compared to no practices. The results also showed that including conservation grassland alone reduced TP loads by less than 2%. However, the combination of these practices with the width of edge-of-field buffer strips module of the SWAT model achieved the largest TP loads reduction. These findings demonstrate that improved representation of vegetative conservation practices in geospatial land cover data sets are more effective in assessing the impacts of conservation buffers and grasslands on water quality through hydrologic modeling.

The impact of precipitation on the vegetation coverage of Beijing's mountainous areas is qualitatively analyzed using multi-temporal Landsat images obtained during the last 20 years. Firstly, the influence of external factors, such as phenology and relative radiometric correction, on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are removed by the normalization of remote sensing images for different periods. Then, the vegetation coverage is calculated using the method of the dimidiate pixel model. Finally, based on that, the relationship between precipitation in different seasons and change of vegetation coverage is discussed. The results indicate that the mean vegetation coverage has the same change trends with winter and summer precipitation, but an opposite change trend with spring precipitation. The paper provides a theoretical basis and data support for further research on driving models of natural vegetation restoration in Beijing's mountainous areas. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the distribution of the White-backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) in Poland was used to assess the usefulness of a demographic model compared to an area-based model for predicting the occurrence of breeding pairs in local landscapes. The models were applied to the European Forest Map and to CORINE land cover data, two spatial databases derived from remote sensing. We tested the performance of the models by comparing predicted occurrence of the species with actual occurrence in 10 km x 10 km of the Polish Ornithological Atlas Database (POAD). Both models proved useful for identifying areas with high potential for hosting breeding woodpeckers. However, the demographic model performed consistently better at predicting the presence of at least one breeding pair in local landscapes. In north-eastern and south-eastern Poland, expected occurrences coincided with the actual occurrence of the species according to POAD. In north-western Poland, however, occurrence was predicted but not confirmed by the atlas data. The eastern regions are situated at the border to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. These countries hold large areas of high conservation value forests and large populations of White-backed Woodpecker. This pattern evokes the need for cross-border governance, and planning with an eco-regional perspective that considers both EU and non-EU countries. Moreover, the results stress the need to incorporate population requirements when assessing the distribution of forests with high conservation value. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ecohydrological consequences of non-native riparian vegetation in the southwestern United States: A review from an ecophysiological perspective	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Protecting water resources for expanding human enterprise while conserving valued natural habitat is among the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Global change processes such as climate change and intensive land use pose significant threats to water resources, particularly in arid regions where potential evapotranspiration far exceeds annual rainfall. Potentially compounding these shortages is the progressive expansion of non-native plant species in riparian areas along streams, canals and rivers in geographically arid regions. This paper sets out to identify when and where non-native riparian plant species are likely to have the highest potential impact on hydrologic fluxes of arid and semiarid river systems. We develop an ecophysiological framework that focuses on two main criteria: (1) examination of the physiological traits that promote non-native species establishment and persistence across environmental gradients, and (2) assessment of where and to what extent hydrologic fluxes are potentially altered by the establishment of introduced species at varying scales from individual plants, to small river reaches, to entire river basins. We highlight three non-native plant species that currently dominate southwestern United States riparian forests. These include tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), Russian olive (Eleagnus angustifolia), and Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens). As with other recent reviews, we suspect that in many cases the removal of these, and other non-native species will have little or no impact on either streamflow volume or groundwater levels. However, we identify potential exceptions where the expansion of non-native plant species could have significant impact on ecohydrologic processes associated with southwestern United States river systems. Future research needs are outlined that will ultimately assist land managers and policy makers with restoration and conservation priorities to preserve water resources and valued riparian habitat given limited economic resources.																	0043-1397					JUL 22	2011	47								W07542	10.1029/2010WR010317								WOS:000293090200002

The drainage network is dendritic to sub- dendritic pattern however parallel to sub- parallel has also developed locally. The Jaggar watershed has been divided into fourteen sub- watersheds, designated as SW1 to SW14, for prioritization purpose. The prioritization of the sub- watersheds has been done on the basis of morphometric analysis and land use/land cover categories. Various morphometric parameters (linear and shape) have been determined for each sub- watershed and assigned rank on the basis of value/relationship with erodibility so as to arrive at a compound value for final ranking of the sub- watersheds. Land use/land cover mapping has been carried out using IRS LISS III data of 1998. Based on morphometric and land use/land cover analysis and their ranks, the sub-watersheds have been classified into four categories as very high, high, medium and low in terms of priority for conservation and management of natural resources. The prioritization results based on morphometry reveal that only SW7 and SW10 fall under very high priority, whereas SW6, SW11 and SW13 fall under very high priority on the basis of land use/land cover analysis. However on the integration of morphometry and land use/land cover only SW14 show common priority whereas rest have little or no correlation.																	0016-7622					JUL	2011	78	1					63	75		10.1007/s12594-011-0068-6								WOS:000295167800008

Giovanni in Firenze (Italy). The measurement has been carried out to assess the structure oscillations reduction after the ordinance issued by the Major of Florence forbidding all kind of vehicular traffic in the square around the Baptistery starting from October 25, 2009. A simplified preliminary finite element model of the structure, using average literature mechanical parameters, has been used to determine the best instrument installation position and the structure area to be surveyed. Subsequently, the dome oscillations have been recorded for two consecutive weeks starting one week before the traffic block. A spectral analysis on the acquired data has been then performed and a more complex FEM model has been built to interpret the physical meaning of the acquired data. The material mechanical parameters have been finely tuned to reproduce the lowest spectral component found which was very close to the main mode oscillation frequency predicted by the simplified model. The obtained values of mechanical parameters are reasonable for the monument materials and slightly different from average. Measurement results indicate that the traffic block caused a reduction of the daytime maximum oscillations power of around 50 divided by 60% and a decrease by approximately 33% has been observed in the peak component particle velocity. The residual measured oscillations are attributable to human activities around the square. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Dalle, SP; Pulido, MT; de Blois, S				Dalle, Sarah Paule; Pulido, Maria T.; de Blois, Sylvie			Balancing shifting cultivation and forest conservation: lessons from a "sustainable landscape" in southeastern Mexico	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Shifting cultivation is often perceived to be a threat to forests, but it is also central to the culture and livelihoods of millions of people worldwide. Balancing agriculture and forest conservation requires knowledge of how agricultural land uses evolve in landscapes with forest conservation initiatives. Based on a case study from Quintana Roo, Mexico, and remote sensing data, we investigated land use and land cover change (LUCC) in relation to accessibility (from main settlement and road) in search of evidence for agricultural expansion and/or intensification after the initiation of a community forestry program in 1986. Intensification was through a shortening of the fallow period. Defining the sampling space as a function of human needs and accessibility to agricultural resources was critical to ensure a user-centered perspective of the landscape. The composition of the accessible landscape changed substantially between 1976 and 1997. Over the 21-year period studied, the local population saw the accessible landscape transformed from a heterogeneous array of different successional stages including mature forests to a landscape dominated by young fallows. We detected a dynamic characterized by intensification of shifting cultivation in the most accessible areas with milpas being felled more and more from young fallows in spite of a preference for felling secondary forests. We argue that the resulting landscape provides a poorer resource base for sustaining agricultural livelihoods and discuss ways in which agricultural change could be better addressed through participatory land use planning. Balancing agricultural production and forest conservation will become even more important in a context of intense negotiations for carbon credits, an emerging market that is likely to drive future land changes worldwide.

Remote sensing based indicators of changes in a mountain rural landscape of Northeast Portugal	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Landscape metrics were used to analyze landscape changes and related driving forces in a mountain rural landscape of Northeast Portugal over three decades. This landscape has great heterogeneity, which favors high levels of diversity and provides for a variety of habitats. The landscape metrics were obtained from land cover maps derived from Landsat images of 1979, 1989 and 2002. Results indicate a trend for increased landscape fragmentation, decrease of annual crop fields (-43%) and, mainly, increase of meadows (+60%). Results relate with decline and aging of the rural population, and to several measures and policies of subsidies implemented in the region in application of the Common Agriculture Policy, which contributed to the replacement of annual crops by meadows. Results are potentially useful to base appropriate policies for landscape management and conservation planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Linking multi-temporal analysis and community consultation to evaluate the response to the impact of Hurricane Stan in coffee areas of Chiapas, Mexico	NATURAL HAZARDS												This paper analyses the responses related to land use of coffee growers in Chiapas, Mexico to the impact of Hurricane Stan (October 2005). A multi-temporal analysis of the effect on land cover was performed through the combination of unsupervised classification of SPOT multispectral images and visual interpretation of panchromatic images (8 months previous to the hurricane, and 2, 14, and 40 months after the hurricane). The information provided by this geographic analysis was interpreted in light of information gathered though household surveys. Although the hurricane wrecked havoc across the region, the main impact in the study area was in the riparian zones where the extent of the loss experienced in terms of coffee harvest and soil was such that, even 14 months after the event, households with land in those areas were struggling to recover. Nevertheless, after 40 months, the zones that had suffered total soil loss began to support soil and vegetation, indicating the possibility of replanting coffee in those areas. Although the hurricane occurred when the coffee sector was particularly fragile as a result of the preceding several years of poor prices, the impact did not trigger extensive land use change. The surveys showed, however, that people are now more informed of the risk of living and farming on the river margins and are now performing soil conservation practices and planting trees to reduce risk.

At the European scale, remote sensing tools for NATURA 2000 habitat monitoring have been requested by the European Commission to fulfill the obligations of the EU Habitats Directive. This paper introduces a method by which swath events in semi-natural grasslands can be detected from multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data. The investigated study sites represent rare and endangered habitats (NATURA 2000 codes 6410, 6510), located in the Doberitzer Heide nature conservation area west of Berlin. We analyzed a time series of 11 stripmap images (HH-polarization) covering the vegetation period affected by swath (June to September 2010) at a constant 11-day acquisition rate. A swath detection rule was established to extract the swath events for the NATURA 2000 habitats as well as for six contrasting pasture sites not affected by swath. All swath events observed in the field were correctly allocated. The results indicate the potential to allocate semi-natural grassland swath events to 11-day-periods using TerraSAR-X time series. Since the conservation of semi-natural grassland habitats requires compliance with specific swath management rules, the detection of swath events may thus provide new parameters for the monitoring of NATURA 2000 grassland habitats.

In contrast, the political breakdown in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union triggered rapid and widespread farmland abandonment, but the spatial patterns of abandonment and its drivers are not well understood. Our goal was to map post-socialist farmland abandonment in Western Ukraine using Landsat images from 1986 to 2008, and to identify spatial determinants of abandonment using a combination of best-subsets linear regression models and hierarchical partitioning. Our results suggest that farmland abandonment was widespread in the study region, with abandonment rates of up to 56%. In total, 6600 km(2) (30%) of the farmland used during socialism was abandoned after 1991. Topography, soil type, and population variables were the most important predictors to explain substantial spatial variation in abandonment rates. However, many of our a priori hypotheses about the direction of variable influence were rejected. Most importantly, abandonment rates were higher in the plains and lower in marginal areas. The growing importance of subsistence farming in the transition period, as well as off-farm income and remittances likely explain these patterns. The breakdown of socialism appears to have resulted in fundamentally different abandonment patterns in the Western Ukraine, where abandonment was a result of the institutional and economic shock, compared to those in Europe's West, where abandonment resulted from long-term socio-economic transformation such as urbanization and industrialization.

J	Chen, W				Chen, Wei			Nonlinear inverse model for velocity estimation from an image sequence	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Velocity estimation from an image sequence is one of the most challenging inverse problems in computer vision, geosciences, and remote sensing applications. In this paper a nonlinear model has been created for estimating motion field under the constraint of conservation of intensity. A linear differential form of heat or optical flow equation is replaced by a nonlinear temporal integral form of the intensity conservation constraint equation. Iterative equations with Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marguardt algorithms are formulated based on the nonlinear equations, velocity field modeling, and a nonlinear least squares model. An algorithm with progressive relaxation of the overconstraint to improve the performance of the velocity estimation is also proposed. The new estimator is benchmarked using a numerical simulation model. Both angular and magnitude error measurements based on the synthetic surface heat flow from the numerical model demonstrate that the performance of the new approach with the nonlinear model is much better than the results of using a linear model of heat or optical flow equation. Four sequences of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images taken in the New York Bight fields is also used to demonstrate the performance of the nonlinear inverse model, and the estimated velocity fields are compared with those measured with the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Radar array. The experimental results indicate that the nonlinear inverse model provides significant improvement over the linear inverse model for real AVHRR data sets.																	0148-0227					JUN 22	2011	116								C06015	10.1029/2010JC006924								WOS:000292113000001						
J	He, CY; Tian, J; Shi, PJ; Hu, D				He, Chunyang; Tian, Jie; Shi, Peijun; Hu, Dan			Simulation of the spatial stress due to urban expansion on the wetlands in Beijing, China using a GIS-based assessment model	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Based on the existing Urban Expansion Dynamic (UED) model, this paper develops a geographic information system (GIS)-based model that can be used to assess the current and potential spatial stress on a regional wetland ecosystem due to urban expansion. Synthetically utilizing the simulation capability of the UED model and the spatial analysis power of a GIS, this new model takes into account the present disturbance by ongoing urban expansion, the potential disturbance by future urban expansion, the accessibility via the transportation network, and the neighborhood stability. The model is used in particular to simulate the spatial stress on the major wetlands in Beijing from 1991 to 2004. The simulation results are found to be consistent with the actual remote sensing observations: a relatively high spatial stress normally leads to an eventual conversion into urban use. With the future urban lands predicted by the UED model, this model is used to further assess the potential spatial stress of urban expansion on the major wetlands in Beijing by 2015. Moreover, the spatially stressed wetland fringe areas in Beijing are identified based on the total spatial stress combining the current and the potential. These areas are found to be mainly distributed in downtown Beijing and the plains areas that have relatively easy accessibility via the transportation network. Effective measures should be taken to protect such areas from being further disturbed in order to achieve the goal of a more effective conservation of the wetland ecosystems in Beijing.

Remote sensing techniques were used to construct spatial datasets of ecological environments and field observations were carried out to determine the distribution of macrobenthos. Habitat potential mapping was achieved for two polychaeta species, Prionospio japonica and Prionospio pulchra, and eight control factors relating to the tidal macrobenthos distribution were selected. These included the intertidal digital elevation model (DEM), slope, aspect, tidal exposure duration, distance from tidal channels, tidal channel density, spectral reflectance of the near infrared (NIR) bands and surface sedimentary facies from satellite imagery. The spatial relationships between the polychaeta species and each control factor were calculated using a frequency ratio and weights-of-evidence combined with geographic information system (GIS) data. The species were randomly divided into a training set (70%) to analyze habitat potential using frequency ratio and weights-of-evidence, and a test set (30%) to verify the predicted habitat potential map. The relationships were overlaid to produce a habitat potential map with a polychaeta habitat potential (PHP) index value. These maps were verified by comparing them to surveyed habitat locations such as the verification data set. For the verification results, the frequency ratio model showed prediction accuracies of 77.71% and 74.87% for P. japonica and P. pulchra, respectively, while those for the weights-of-evidence model were 64.05% and 62.95%. Thus, the frequency ratio model provided a more accurate prediction than the weights-of-evidence model. Our data demonstrate that the frequency ratio and weights-of-evidence models based upon GIS analysis are effective for generating habitat potential maps of polychaeta species in a tidal flat. The results of this study can be applied towards conservation and management initiatives for the macrofauna of tidal flats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus estimation of soil loss and identification of critical area for implementation of best management practice is central to success of soil conservation programme. The present study focuses application of most widely used Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to determine soil erosion and prioritization of micro-watersheds of Upper Damodar Valley Catchment (UDVC) of India. Annual average soil loss for the entire basin is 23.17 t/ha/yr; for micro-watersheds. High soil loss is observed in 345 micro-watersheds, medium in 159 micro-watersheds and low soil loss is observed in 201 micro-watersheds. It is found that, out of 705 micro-watersheds of UDVC, 453 micro-watersheds are in agreement with AISLUS suggested priority which is based on observed sediment yield, 116 micro-watersheds under predict and 136 micro-watersheds over predict the priority. Geographic Information System (GIS) is applied to prepare various layers of USLE parameters which interactively estimate soil erosion at micro-watershed level. The main advantage of the GIS methodology is in providing quick information on the estimated value of soil loss for any part of the investigated area.																	0255-660X					JUN	2011	39	2					181	192		10.1007/s12524-011-0064-8								WOS:000293960200006

Although ET may have large variations over a big basin, it is commonly estimated using a few point measurements and this makes the estimation error prone. Satellite based remote sensing data provides few parameters for estimation of energy fluxes, at the land surface and atmosphere interaction in a distributed manner using the meteorological parameters. These parameters through surface energy balance equation have been used for the estimation of ET in this study. Various spatially distributed variables required for ET estimation; viz. NDVI, surface albedo, surface temperature etc. have been derived using remote sensing and ancillary data for Tapi basin located in western India. Beside this field data such as rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours etc. have been used. For computation of runoff, Soil Conservation Services (SCS) approach has been considered. Tapi basin up to Ukai dam has been selected as the study area. Satellite data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which carries the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), have been used for preparation of various maps required for runoff and ET analysis. The results of runoff and ET have been compared with observed data for 2 years, 2002-2003 and the results have been found in good agreement with observed data.																	0255-660X					JUN	2011	39	2					259	270		10.1007/s12524-011-0078-2								WOS:000293960200014						
J	Rokitnicki-Wojcik, D; Wei, AH; Chow-Fraser, P				Rokitnicki-Wojcik, Daniel; Wei, Anhua; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Transferability of object-based rule sets for mapping coastal high marsh habitat among different regions in Georgian Bay, Canada	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Coastal wetlands of eastern and northern Georgian Bay, Canada provide critical habitat for a variety of biota yet few have been delineated and mapped because of their widespread distribution and remoteness. This is an impediment to conservation efforts aimed at identifying significant habitat in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We propose to address this deficiency by developing an approach that relies on use of high-resolution remote sensing imagery to map wetland habitat. In this study, we use IKONOS satellite imagery to classify coastal high marsh vegetation (seasonally inundated) and assess the transferability of object-based rule sets among different regions in eastern Georgian Bay. We classified 24 wetlands in three separate satellite scenes and developed an object-based approach to map four habitat classes: emergent, meadow/shrub, senescent vegetation and rock. Independent rule sets were created for each scene and applied to the other images to empirically examine transferability at broad spatial scales. For a given habitat feature, the internally derived rule sets based on field data collected from the same scene provided significantly greater accuracy than those derived from a different scene (80.0 and 74.3%, respectively). Although we present a significant effect of ruleset origin on accuracy, the difference in accuracy is minimal at 5.7%. We argue that this should not detract from its transferability on a regional scale. We conclude that locally derived and object-based rule sets developed from IKONOS imagery can successfully classify complex vegetation classes and be applied to different regions without much loss of accuracy. This indicates that large-scale mapping automation may be feasible with images with similar spectral, spatial, contextual, and textural properties.																	0923-4861					JUN	2011	19	3					223	236		10.1007/s11273-011-9213-7								WOS:000292967000002

We link economic, geographical and environmental models by using spatially explicit common units of analysis and use remote sensing crop cover maps and digitized soils data as inputs. Land use changes are predicted via economic analysis of crop rotation choice and tillage under alternative crop prices, and the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is used to predict corresponding environmental impacts. The study focuses on Iowa, which is the leading biofuels hotspot in the U.S. due to intensive corn production and the high concentration of ethanol plants that comprise 28% of total U.S. production. We consider the impact of the biofuels industry both on current cropland and on land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a land set-aside program. We find that substantial shifts in rotations favoring continuous corn rotations are likely if high corn prices are sustained. This is consistent with larger scale analyses which show a shift of the current soybean production out of the Corn Belt. We find that sediment losses increase substantially on the intensive margin, while nitrogen losses increase less. Returning CRP land into production has a vastly disproportionate environmental impact, as non-cropped land shows much higher negative marginal environmental effects when brought back to row crop production. This illustrates the importance of differentiating between the intensive and extensive margin when assessing the expansion of biofuel production. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Advanced Spectral Imaging for Noninvasive Microanalysis of Cultural Heritage Materials: Review of Application to Documents in the US Library of Congress	APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY												Hyperspectral imaging was originally developed for remote sensing and astronomical applications, but adaptations of this technology have been of great benefit to the preservation of cultural heritage. Developments in noninvasive analytical techniques have advanced the preservation of cultural heritage materials by enabling the identification and analysis of a range of materials, utilizing their unique spectral response to nondestructively determine chemical composition, and determining states of deterioration and change due to environmental conditions. When used as a tool for noninvasive characterization of cultural heritage, these spectral imaging systems allow the collection of chemical identification information about materials without sampling, which is a critical factor for cultural heritage materials. The United States Library of Congress has been developing the application of hyperspectral imaging to the preservation and analysis of cultural heritage materials as a powerful noncontact technique. It allows noninvasive characterization of materials, by identifying and characterizing colorants, inks, and substrates with narrow-band illumination to protect the object while also monitoring deterioration or changes due to exhibit and other environmental conditions. Contiguous illumination from the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectral regions allows the capture of lost, obscured, and deteriorated information. The resulting image cube allows greater capabilities for mapping and coordinating a range of complementary chemical and spectral analyses. The capabilities of this technique are illustrated by a review of results from analysis of the Waldseemuller World Map, the L'Enfant plan for Washington, D.C., and the first draft of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.																	0003-7028					JUN	2011	65	6					565	574		10.1366/11-06295								WOS:000291232100002	21639977					
J	Acevedo, MF				Acevedo, Miguel F.			Interdisciplinary progress in food production, food security and environment research	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												This review examines contributions of interdisciplinary (ID) research to understanding interactions between environmental quality, food production and food security. Global patterns of food insecurity and crop production are reviewed in relation to climate, land use and economic changes, as well as potential productivity increases compatible with environmental conservation. Interactions between food production and global processes make food insecurity a complex problem that requires ID analysis at local to global scales. Census and satellite data contribute to understanding of global cropland distribution. Analysis of land-use change exemplifies research between natural and social sciences. Quantitative modelling of global climate change impacts indicates relatively greater potential food insecurity in developing countries. International food security is increasingly interconnected through economic globalization and incentives for increased food production are required. Societies may not be able to expand available cropland without significant environmental risks; enhanced land and water productivity are the major opportunities available to increase food production. This requires renewed efforts in ID work to design and implement sound and efficient agricultural management practices. Models need to be informed by data from field experiments, long-term measurements and watershed monitoring by ground and remote sensing methods. Agricultural intensification may spare natural land but lead to increased pollution and water demand; reconciling conservation and productivity is a critical need. ID work provides many opportunities for synergies including conservation agriculture at the local level, efficient use of inputs, smarter land use taking into account spatial patterns and landscape ecology principles, and improved water management at field, system, watershed and basin levels. Goal-directed ID research is crucial, since producers, practitioners and policy makers should be involved. Geospatial, biotechnological and precision agriculture technologies linked with models can help inform strategies to achieve sustainable food production increases that maintain environmental quality. Implementation also requires ID work to overcome impediments due to human factors and facilitate adoption by farmers.																	0376-8929	1469-4387				JUN	2011	38	2			SI		151	171		10.1017/S0376892911000257								WOS:000291114200005

Use of Remote Sensing to Support Forest and Wetlands Policies in the USA	REMOTE SENSING												The use of remote sensing for environmental policy development is now quite common and well-documented, as images from remote sensing platforms are often used to focus attention on emerging environmental issues and spur debate on potential policy solutions. However, its use in policy implementation and evaluation has not been examined in much detail. Here we examine the use of remote sensing to support the implementation and enforcement of policies regarding the conservation of forests and wetlands in the USA. Specifically, we focus on the "Roadless Rule" and "Travel Management Rules" as enforced by the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service on national forests, and the "No Net Loss" policy and Clean Water Act for wetlands on public and private lands, as enforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Army Corps of Engineers. We discuss several national and regional examples of how remote sensing for forest and wetland conservation has been effectively integrated with policy decisions, along with barriers to further integration. Some of these barriers are financial and technical (such as the lack of data at scales appropriate to policy enforcement), while others are political.

Assessment of Acacia Koa Forest Health across Environmental Gradients in Hawai'i Using Fine Resolution Remote Sensing and GIS	SENSORS												Koa (Acacia koa) forests are found across broad environmental gradients in the Hawai'ian Islands. Previous studies have identified koa forest health problems and dieback at the plot level, but landscape level patterns remain unstudied. The availability of high-resolution satellite images from the new GeoEye1 satellite offers the opportunity to conduct landscape-level assessments of forest health. The goal of this study was to develop integrated remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) methodologies to characterize the health of koa forests and model the spatial distribution and variability of koa forest dieback patterns across an elevation range of 600-1,000 m asl in the island of Kaua'i, which correspond to gradients of temperature and rainfall ranging from 17-20 degrees C mean annual temperature and 750-1,500 mm mean annual precipitation. GeoEye1 satellite imagery of koa stands was analyzed using supervised classification techniques based on the analysis of 0.5-m pixel multispectral bands. There was clear differentiation of native koa forest from areas dominated by introduced tree species and differentiation of healthy koa stands from those exhibiting dieback symptoms. The area ratio of healthy koa to koa dieback corresponded linearly to changes in temperature across the environmental gradient, with koa dieback at higher relative abundance in warmer areas. A landscape-scale map of healthy koa forest and dieback distribution demonstrated both the general trend with elevation and the small-scale heterogeneity that exists within particular elevations. The application of these classification techniques with fine spatial resolution imagery can improve the accuracy of koa forest inventory and mapping across the islands of Hawai'i. Such findings should also improve ecological restoration, conservation and silviculture of this important native tree species.																	1424-8220					JUN	2011	11	6					5677	5694		10.3390/s110605677								WOS:000292026400009	22163920

The soil erosion parameters were evaluated in different ways: the R factor map was developed from the rainfall data, the K factor map was obtained from the soil map, the C factor map was generated based on a back propagation (BP) neural network method of Landsat ETM+ data with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.929 to the field collected data, and a digital elevation model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m was derived from topographical map at the scale of 1:50,000 to develop the LS factor map. P factor map was assumed as 1 for the watershed because only a very small area has conservation practices. By integrating the six factor maps in GIS through pixel-based computing, the spatial distribution of soil loss in the upper watershed of Miyun reservoir was obtained by the RUSLE model. The results showed that the annual average soil loss for the upper watershed of Miyun reservoir was 9.86 t ha(-1) ya(-1) in 2005, and the area of 47.5 km(2) (0.3%) experiences extremely severe erosion risk, which needs suitable conservation measures to be adopted on a priority basis. The spatial distribution of erosion risk classes was 66.88% very low, 21.90% low, 6.19% moderate, 2.90% severe, and 1.84% very severe. Among all counties and cities in the study area, Huairou County is in the extremely severe level of soil erosion risk, about 39.6% of land suffer from soil erosion, while Guyuan County in the very low level of soil erosion risk suffered from 17.79% of soil erosion in 2005. Therefore, the areas which are in the extremely severe level of soil erosion risk need immediate attention from soil conservation point of view.					chen, tao/0000-0001-6965-1256												1866-6280					JUN	2011	63	3					533	541		10.1007/s12665-010-0715-z								WOS:000290494100008

Although several countries do possess their own, more or less detailed land-cover map, these are based on classifications that appear largely discordant from a country to another. Up to now, continental scale remote sensing studies failed to fill this gap. They mostly result in crude representations of the rainforest biome as a single, uniform vegetation class, in contrast with open vegetations. A few studies identified broad scale spatial patterns, but only when they managed to map a particular forest characteristic such as biomass. The main objective of this study is to identify, characterize and map distinct forest landscape types within the evergreen lowland rainforest at the sub-continental scale of the Guiana Shield (north-east tropical South-America 10 degrees North-2 degrees South; 66 degrees West-50 degrees West). This study is based on the analysis of a 1-year daily data set (from January 1st to December 31st, 2000) from the VEGETATION sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite (1-km spatial resolution). We interpreted remotely sensed landscape classes (RSLC) from field and high resolution remote sensing data of 21 sites in French Guiana. We cross-analyzed remote sensing data, field observations and environmental data using multivariate analysis. We obtained 33 remotely sensed landscape classes (RSLC) among which five forest-RSLC representing 78% of the forested area. The latter were classified as different broad forest landscape types according to a gradient of canopy openness. Their mapping revealed a new and meaningful broad-scale spatial pattern of forest landscape types. At the scale of the Guiana Shield, we observed a spatial patterns similarity between climatic and forest landscape types. The two most open forest-RSLCs were observed mainly within the north-west to south-east dry belt. The three other forest-RSLCs were observed in wetter and less anthropized areas, particularly in the newly recognized "Guianan dense forest arch". Better management and conservation policies, as well as improvement of biological and ecological knowledge, require accurate and stable representations of the geographical components of ecosystems. Our results represent a decisive step in this way for the Guiana Shield area and contribute to fill one of the major shortfall in the knowledge of tropical forests. 0 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is also a growing recognition of the potential beneficial impact that secondary forests may have on the global environment: providing crucial ecosystem services such as soil conservation, stabilization of hydrological cycles, carbon sequestration, and support for forest dependent communities. Consequently, there is a growing awareness of the need to recognize that landscapes are complex shifting mosaics wherein forest clearing and reforestation take place. In this study, the rates of reforestation, deforestation, forest regrowth and degradation were measured using multi-temporal Landsat images of Danjiangkou, China. Landsat data from 1990, 1999 and 2007 were (1) classified as dense forest, open forest and non-forest areas and (2) compared between years to identify forest cutting, regeneration and degradation. The results showed that there was a net gain of 29,315 ha of forest area (including dense and open forest) from 1990 to 2007, showing a clear trend of reforestation in the study area. Forest modification (degradation and regrowth) and change categories (deforestation and reforestation) occurred simultaneously during the observation time period. Socioeconomic data from public statistics and environmental attributes allowed the assessment of the socioeconomic factors and the environmental conditions that caused these changes using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The research showed that the socioeconomic factors due to different policies were major driving forces of forest transition, whereas environmental attributes of the underlying landscape constrained forest cover changes. These findings have led to a better understanding of forest transition at a local scale in our study region. Comprehensive knowledge of these relationships may be useful to reconstruct past forest transitions and predict future changes, and may help to enhance sustainable management practices aimed at preserving essential ecological functions.

J	Pittman, SJ; Brown, KA				Pittman, Simon J.; Brown, Kerry A.			Multi-Scale Approach for Predicting Fish Species Distributions across Coral Reef Seascapes	PLOS ONE												Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.																	1932-6203					MAY 26	2011	6	5							e20583	10.1371/journal.pone.0020583								WOS:000291052200079	21637787

Potential of a national monitoring program for forests to assess change in high-latitude ecosystems	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Broad-scale monitoring in Alaska has become of increasing interest due to uncertainty about the potential impacts of changing climate on high-latitude ecosystems. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program is a national monitoring program for all public and private forestlands in the US, but the program is not currently implemented in the boreal region of Alaska. We provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the FIA system for monitoring the potential impact of climate change on Alaska's species, communities, and ecosystems. The primary strength of the system is a scientifically rigorous design-based statistical estimation method that produces estimates of forest attributes with known sampling error and quantifiable measurement error. The weaknesses of the system include low power for small area estimates, lack of spatial context and contiguity, and difficulty in inferring causality of factors when changes in monitored attributes are detected. Climate change is expected to impact many components of boreal ecosystems, but for most indicators the direction and magnitude of change are difficult to predict because of complex interactions among system components. Status and trend information provided by FIA monitoring that could be helpful to conservation decisions includes abundance and rarity of vascular plants, invasive species, biomass and carbon content of vegetation, shifting vegetation species distribution, disturbance frequency, type, and impact, and wildlife habitat characteristics. Because of unique factors such as the low level of infrastructure, modifications to the HA monitoring system used in the conterminous US have been proposed for Alaska. Remote sensing data would play a greater role in meeting monitoring objectives, and sampling intensity of field plots would be reduced. Coordination with other national, regional, and local monitoring efforts provides potential for increased understanding of change in boreal ecosystems at multiple scales.

REMOTE SENSING AND GIS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE SITES FOR SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION STRUCTURES	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Formulation of a proper watershed management plan requires reliable and up-to-date information about various factors such as morphologic (size and shape of the watershed, drainage parameters, topography), soil and their characteristics, land use, and land cover, etc. that affect the behavior of a watershed. Satellite based remote sensing technology and GIS meets both the requirements of reliability and speed and are ideal tools for generating spatial information needs. In this study, a locale-specific watershed development plan was generated for the case study area of a small agricultural watershed of Karso, Hazaribagh, India using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1C), Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS-III) satellite data along with other datasets, e. g. existing maps and field observation data have been utilized for generating a land use/land cover map and to extract information on morphological parameters (bifurcation ratio, elongation ratio, drainage density, ruggedness number, relief ratio, and circulatory ratio) and other thematic maps which are an essential prerequisites for watershed development. Morphological parameters of subwatersheds were derived to understand its usefulness for surface water development. The conceptual framework for plan and site suitability mapping for soil and water conservation structures is developed and subsequently, these parameters were integrated with other thematic information viz., land use/cover, drainage, slope, and soil in the GIS environment to arrive at a decision regarding a suitable site for having soil and water conservation structures (nala bund, check dam, and percolation tank) in its place adopting a holistic approach.

Using remotely sensed imagery to monitor savanna rangeland deterioration through woody plant proliferation: a case study from communal and biodiversity conservation rangeland sites in Mokopane, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Healthy rangelands are of economic and biodiversity conservation importance in the savannas of northern South Africa. The proliferation of woody plant species on the rangelands, known as bush encroachment, constitutes a degradation of rangeland quality, given the non-palatability of the encroaching species. Though the causes are not fully understood, heavy grazing and fire suppression are thought to be primary causes of bush encroachment. This study utilised multitemporal (1994, 2000 and 2008) SPOT images of two rangeland sites in Mokopane, South Africa in monitoring and assessing bush encroachment. The study sites were a fenced biodiversity conservation rangeland with game species in which fire is suppressed and an open access communal rangeland grazed by livestock. Field plot-derived encroachment categories of heavy encroachment, moderate encroachment, low encroachment and non-encroached were used in hybrid classification of the images, following radiometric normalisation and geometric registration. GIS overlay analysis using the non-encroached category enabled the quantification and mapping of change in the preferable open grass rangeland typifying savannas. The biodiversity conservation area was undergoing a trend of reduction in open grass rangeland, whereas the communal rangelands were getting more opened up by livestock trampling. Rangeland management practices of fire utilisation, stocking levels and stock concentration account for the differing trends. Lightly grazed and heavily grazed wild game-utilised rangelands under a fire suppression rangeland management regime had bush encroachment rates of approximately 34% and 56%, respectively, in 6 years. Multitemporal remote sensing proved to be useful for monitoring bush encroachment as indicator of state of savanna rangelands.																	0167-6369					MAY	2011	176	1-4					293	311		10.1007/s10661-010-1583-4								WOS:000289255100022	20628812					
J	Kuenzer, C; Bluemel, A; Gebhardt, S; Quoc, TV; Dech, S				Kuenzer, Claudia; Bluemel, Andrea; Gebhardt, Steffen; Tuan Vo Quoc; Dech, Stefan			Remote Sensing of Mangrove Ecosystems: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												Mangrove ecosystems dominate the coastal wetlands of tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They provide various ecological and economical ecosystem services contributing to coastal erosion protection, water filtration, provision of areas for fish and shrimp breeding, provision of building material and medicinal ingredients, and the attraction of tourists, amongst many other factors. At the same time, mangroves belong to the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide and experienced a dramatic decline during the last half century. International programs, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands or the Kyoto Protocol, underscore the importance of immediate protection measures and conservation activities to prevent the further loss of mangroves. In this context, remote sensing is the tool of choice to provide spatio-temporal information on mangrove ecosystem distribution, species differentiation, health status, and ongoing changes of mangrove populations. Such studies can be based on various sensors, ranging from aerial photography to high- and medium-resolution optical imagery and from hyperspectral data to active microwave (SAR) data. Remote-sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and changes during the last two decades, which is reflected by the large number of scientific papers published on this topic. To our knowledge, a recent review paper on the remote sensing of mangroves does not exist, although mangrove ecosystems have become the focus of attention in the context of current climate change and discussions of the services provided by these ecosystems. Also, climate change-related remote-sensing studies in coastal zones have increased drastically in recent years. The aim of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview and sound summary of all of the work undertaken, addressing the variety of remotely sensed data applied for mangrove ecosystem mapping, as well as the numerous methods and techniques used for data analyses, and to further discuss their potential and limitations.																	2072-4292					MAY	2011	3	5					878	928		10.3390/rs3050878								WOS:000306749500004

Location United States. Methods We review the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing for detecting, mapping and predicting the spatial spread of invasive species. We cover a range of topics including the trade-off between spatial and spectral resolutions and classification accuracy, the benefits of using time series to incorporate phenology in mapping species distribution, the potential of biochemical and physiological properties in hyperspectral spectral reflectance for tracking ecosystem changes caused by invasions, and the capacity of hyperspectral data as a valuable input for quantitative models developed for assessing the future spread of invasive species. Results Hyperspectral remote sensing holds great promise for invasion research. Spectral information provided by hyperspectral sensors can detect invaders at the species level across a range of community and ecosystem types. Furthermore, hyperspectral data can be used to assess habitat suitability and model the future spread of invasive species, thus providing timely information for invasion risk analysis. Main conclusions Our review suggests that hyperspectral remote sensing can effectively provide a baseline of invasive species distributions for future monitoring and control efforts. Furthermore, information on the spatial distribution of invasive species can help land managers to make long-term constructive conservation plans for protecting and maintaining natural ecosystems.

Where land use and resource extraction is severely limited, local people turn to resource pools outside parks. Kibale National Park in western Uganda is a remnant of a previously larger, mid-altitude forest region surrounded by dense agricultural settlement. We combine remote sensing techniques and household surveys to examine landscape change and fragmentation and the implications for securing rural livelihoods. Forests and wetlands outside the park provide important resources such as fuelwood, building poles, and water, but they are also problematic for local farmers since crop raids by primates and elephants emanate from these fragments. Our analysis shows that since 1984 forests and wetlands have decreased in size and number and those that remain have become increasingly isolated within the agricultural mosaic. Farmers have adapted to resource shortages and human-wildlife conflict in different ways. Our results suggest that wealth, ethnicity, and distance from the park are important factors in determining responses to these issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Integrating remote sensing in Natura 2000 habitat monitoring: Prospects on the way forward	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Monitoring and reporting on the state of nature gained increasing importance in the European Union with the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. Reporting habitat conservation status requires detailed knowledge on many aspects of habitats at different spatial levels. Remote sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for Natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited. One reason for this appears to be the knowledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community. We conducted a review of legal monitoring and reporting requirements on Natura 2000 habitats, looked into the current use of remote sensing in habitat reporting, and consulted monitoring experts in nature conservation administrations to find out about their attitude and expectations towards remote sensing. In this paper, we disclose and summarise the real data needs behind the legal requirements for Natura 2000 habitat monitoring and reporting, analyse opportunities and constraints for remote sensing, and highlight bottlenecks and pathways to resolve them. Monitoring experts are not unwilling to use remote sensing data, but they are unsure of whether remote sensing can suit their needs in a cost-effective way. They look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation. Based on our findings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into Natura 2000 habitat monitoring could benefit from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved.

Quantifying the amount and the spatial distribution of erosion over large areas is essential for the effective implementation of conservation efforts. This study integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with remote sensing and GIS to estimate soil loss and identify risk erosion areas in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The average soil erosion rate in the TGRA estimated by RUSLE is 32.80 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and the total amount of actual soil loss amounts to 1.891x10(8) t yr(-1). According to the Chinese standard classification and gradation of soil erosion, zones experiencing slight, low, medium, high, very high and extreme erosion potential, respectively, constitute 38.70%, 29.48%, 12.77%, 7.49%, 7.14% and 4.42% of surveyed area. About 76.75% of the total soil loss is concentrated in 19.05% of the total area, which represents zones of high to extreme erosion potential. The most severe erosion risk typically occurs in critical regions such as ridges and steep slopes. Consequently, there is an urgent need for intervention strategies in order to effectively reduce soil erosion in these specific areas.

Historical carbon emissions and uptake from the agricultural frontier of the Brazilian Amazon	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Tropical ecosystems play a large and complex role in the global carbon cycle. Clearing of natural ecosystems for agriculture leads to large pulses of CO(2) to the atmosphere from terrestrial biomass. Concurrently, the remaining intact ecosystems, especially tropical forests, may be sequestering a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere in response to global environmental changes including climate changes and an increase in atmospheric CO(2). Here we use an approach that integrates census-based historical land use reconstructions, remote-sensing-based contemporary land use change analyses, and simulation modeling of terrestrial biogeochemistry to estimate the net carbon balance over the period 1901-2006 for the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, which is one of the most rapidly changing agricultural frontiers in the world. By the end of this period, we estimate that of the state's 925 225 km(2), 221 092 km(2) have been converted to pastures and 89 533 km(2) have been converted to croplands, with forest-to-pasture conversions being the dominant land use trajectory but with recent transitions to croplands increasing rapidly in the last decade. These conversions have led to a cumulative release of 4.8 Pg C to the atmosphere, with similar to 80% from forest clearing and 20% from the clearing of cerrado. Over the same period, we estimate that the residual undisturbed ecosystems accumulated 0.3 Pg C in response to CO2 fertilization. Therefore, the net emissions of carbon from Mato Grosso over this period were 4.5 Pg C. Net carbon emissions from Mato Grosso since 2000 averaged 146 Tg C/yr, on the order of Brazil's fossil fuel emissions during this period. These emissions were associated with the expansion of croplands to grow soybeans. While alternative management regimes in croplands, including tillage, fertilization, and cropping patterns promote carbon storage in ecosystems, they remain a small portion of the net carbon balance for the region. This detailed accounting of a region's carbon balance is the type of foundation analysis needed by the new United Nations Collaborative Programmme for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD).

CONSERVATION LETTERS												Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) is a policy mechanism now agreed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries through the sustainable management of forests, while providing co-benefits of biodiversity conservation and livelihood support. Implementation challenges include linking remote sensing and national forest inventories of carbon stocks, to local implementation and measuring carbon loss from forest degradation. Community-based forest monitoring can help overcome some of these challenges. We show that local people can collect forest condition data of comparable quality to trained scientists, at half the cost. We draw on our experience to propose how and where local REDD+ monitoring can be established. Empowering communities to own and monitor carbon stocks could provide a rapid and cost-effective way of absorbing carbon dioxide emissions, while potentially contributing to local livelihoods and forest biodiversity conservation.				publist, CMEC/C-3010-2012; publicationpage, cmec/B-4405-2017; Sorensen, Marten/L-7484-2014; Jensen, Per/J-8182-2012	Sorensen, Marten/0000-0001-6921-5366; Jensen, Per/0000-0001-8792-7711												1755-263X					APR	2011	4	2					158	167		10.1111/j.1755-263X.2010.00159.x								WOS:000289301900009

Estimation of the Distribution of Tabebuia guayacan (Bignoniaceae) Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery	SENSORS												Species identification and characterization in tropical environments is an emerging field in tropical remote sensing. Significant efforts are currently aimed at the detection of tree species, of levels of forest successional stages, and the extent of liana occurrence at the top of canopies. In this paper we describe our use of high resolution imagery from the Quickbird Satellite to estimate the flowering population of Tabebuia guayacan trees at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), in Panama. The imagery was acquired on 29 April 2002 and 21 March 2004. Spectral Angle Mapping via a One-Class Support Vector machine was used to detect the presence of 422 and 557 flowering tress in the April 2002 and March 2004 imagery. Of these, 273 flowering trees are common to both dates. This study presents a new perspective on the effectiveness of high resolution remote sensing for monitoring a phenological response and its use as a tool for potential conservation and management of natural resources in tropical environments.

J	Reistetter, JA; Russell, M				Reistetter, Joseph A.; Russell, Marc			High-resolution land cover datasets, composite curve numbers, and storm water retention in the Tampa Bay, FL region	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Policy makers need to understand how land cover change alters storm water regimes, yet existing methods do not fully utilize newly available datasets to quantify storm water changes at a landscape-scale. Here, we use high-resolution, remotely-sensed land cover, imperviousness, and tree canopy density data to calculate modified Soil Conservation Service (SCS) composite curve numbers. Policy makers can interpret composite curve numbers as a continuous, relative index of storm water mitigation ecosystem services provided by the landscape, allowing for better comprehension of the implications of land use decisions than current discrete methods. We also compare composite curve number calculations from regional land cover/land use data to calculations from national land cover data and show that they differ significantly in each of the watersheds that drain into Tampa Bay. The use of discrete urban classes to determine curve numbers is also explored. We show that, for the Tampa Bay region, assumed urban imperviousness values published in Technical Release 55 (a document that provides curve numbers for soil/land cover complexes) overestimate the actual imperviousness as reported by the national and regional datasets. This error in estimation caused composite curve numbers calculated using remotely-sensed data to be lower than they would have been if curve numbers had been assigned solely by discrete SCS classes. Furthermore, the average imperviousness for all urban classes increased from 1995 to 2005, reflecting region-wide increases in imperviousness reported by the regional dataset. Our comparison illustrates that using a constant imperviousness value for urban classes over time, a method used in numerous studies and models, leads to inaccurate estimation of temporal changes in storm water runoff. Average imperviousness for urban classes also differed significantly between the regional and national datasets, signifying that the two datasets cannot be used interchangeably.

The objective of the study was to generate spatially and temporally quantified information on land cover dynamics, providing the basis for policy/decision makers and resource managers to facilitate biodiversity conservation, including wild animals. Two satellite images (Landsat TM of 1984 and Landsat ETM+ of 2003) were acquired and supervised classification was used to categorize LC types. Ground Control Points were obtained in field condition for georeferencing and accuracy assessment. The results showed an increase in the areas of pure forest (Erica species dominated) and shrubland but a decrease in the area of agricultural land over the 20 years. The overall accuracy and the Kappa value of classification results were 88 and 85%, respectively. The spatial setting of the LC classes was heterogeneous and resulted from the biophysical nature of SMNP and anthropogenic activities. Further studies are suggested to evaluate the existing LC and LCC in connection with wildlife habitat, conservation and management of SMNP.

J	Mizukami, N; Perica, S; Hatch, D				Mizukami, Naoki; Perica, Sanja; Hatch, David			Regional approach for mapping climatological snow water equivalent over the mountainous regions of the western United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This paper presents that a simple regional regression-based approach with readily available geographic and meteorological parameters as predictors could be a viable method for mapping snow water equivalent (SWE) climatology in the mountainous areas of the western United States. Such climatological information is potentially useful for several hydrologic applications, including estimation of real-time SWE grids and calibration and evaluation of SWE estimates obtained from remote sensing or through various snow models. Regional delineation for the mountainous regions of the western United States was done through cluster analysis in consideration of the characteristics of seasonal snow pack accumulation and ablation processes. Various geographic and meteorological parameters were further investigated through stepwise regression as potential predictors of monthly changes in climatological SWE in each delineated region. In-situ measurements of SWE, obtained from the Natural Resources Conservation Service's Snow Telemetry network for the period from 1980 to 2004, were used to calibrate regional equations. The spatial and temporal resolution of the analysis was based on the resolution of available meteorological data - 4 km and 1 month, respectively. For a monthly time step, the reliability of the SWE estimates did not significantly increase when the number of regions was more than five. The performance of the developed regional equations was evaluated via a jack-knife technique. The regional equations developed using monthly resolution and large regions provided reliable estimates for the majority of regions from October to March, but not in April, especially in the North Pacific and Southwest regions. Sub-regionalization, a finer time step for the analysis and/or inclusion of additional SWE predictor variables may increase the reliability of SWE climatological estimates for warmer months.

J	Park, S; Oh, C; Jeon, S; Jung, H; Choi, C				Park, Soyoung; Oh, Cheyoung; Jeon, Seongwoo; Jung, Huicheul; Choi, Chuluong			Soil erosion risk in Korean watersheds, assessed using the revised universal soil loss equation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Soil erosion reduces crop productivity and water storage capacity, and, both directly and indirectly, causes water pollution. Loss of soil has become a problem worldwide, and as concerns about the environment grow, active research has begun regarding soil erosion and soil-preservation policies. This study analyzed the amount of soil loss in South Korea over a recent 20-year period and estimated future soil loss in 2020 using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). Digital elevation (DEM) data, detailed soil maps, and land cover maps were used as primary data, and geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques were applied to produce thematic maps, based on RUSLE factors. Using the frequency ratio (FR), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and logistic regression (LR) approaches, land suitability index (LSI) maps were developed for 2020, considering the already established Environmental Conservation Value Assessment Map (ECVAM) for Korea. Assuming a similar urban growth trend and 10-, 50-, and 100-year rainfall frequencies, soil loss in 2020 was predicted by analyzing changes in the cover-management factor and rainfall-runoff erosivity factor. In the period 1985-2005, soil loss showed an increasing trend, from 17.1 Mg/ha in 1985 to 17.4 Mg/ha in 1995, and to 20.0 Mg/ha in 2005; the 2005 value represents a 2.8 Mg/ha (16.6%) increase, compared with 1985 and is attributable to the increased area of grassland and bare land. In 2020, the estimated soil loss, considering the ECVAM, was 19.2-19.3 Mg/ha for the 10-year rainfall frequency, 36.4-36.6 Mg/ha for the 50-year rainfall frequency, and 45.7-46.0 Mg/ha for the 100-year rainfall frequency. Without considering the ECVAM, the amount of soil loss was about 0.4-1.6 Mg/ha larger than estimates that did consider the ECVAM; specifically, the values were 19.6-19.9 Mg/ha for the 10-year rainfall frequency, 37.1-37.8 Mg/ha for the 50-year frequency, and 46.7-47.5 Mg/ha for the 100-year frequency. In 2010, without considering the ECVAM, the soil loss was 0.3-1.8 Mg/ha more than that estimated when considering the ECVAM. These results indicate that if urban areas are developed such that they damage areas of high value, as defined environmentally and legislatively, the amount of soil loss will increase, whereas if such areas are preserved, erosion will decrease slightly. Thus, when planning urban development, the environmental and legislative value of preservation should be considered to minimize erosion and allow for more sustainable development.

Previous studies have focused on the temporal analysis of biocapacity at broad geographical scales, but lacked the systematic spatial realization at fine scales. An improvement is proposed of this conventional methodology of the ecological footprint by incorporating land-use data derived from high-resolution remote-sensing images into the calculation of biocapacity supply at regional, provincial and county levels in Northwestern China in 2000. The spatial heterogeneity and its effect on the biocapacity supply were systematically revealed for this region. First, the biocapacity supply declined from the east (the Guanzhong Basin and the Loess Plateau) to the middle (the Qaidam Basin and the Turpan Basin), and turned to rise from the middle to the west (the northwest of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomy). Second. although the gap between biocapacity supply and demand resulted in a small ecological deficit at the regional level, a large ecological deficit was observed at the provincial and county levels, highlighting an unsustainable situation for some of the sub-regions. Importantly, a power law relationship was unveiled between the biocapacity supply and population density, suggesting that (i) the biocapacity supply as a critical indicator could reflect the intensity of human exploitation on local biophysical resources and (ii) humans tend to have a preference to inhabit those areas with high biological productivity. These results provide opportunities to enhance policy development by central and local governments as part of the long-term Great Western Development Strategy of China. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Current surrogates for approximating the distribution of biodiversity are habitats mapped within a number of national and international frameworks (e.g., Natura 2000), even though conventional habitat mapping is time consuming and requires well-trained personnel. Here we evaluated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to map forest habitat types to simplify the process. We used available data of habitat types for the Bavarian Forest National Park as a basis to predict habitat types with LiDAR-derived variables. Furthermore, we compared these results with predictions based on extensive ground-based climate, soil and vegetation data. Using linear and flexible discriminant analyses, we found that LiDAR is able to predict forest habitat types with the same overall accuracy as the extensive ground data for climate, soil and vegetation composition. Subtle differences in the vegetation structure between habitat types, particularly in the vertical and horizontal vegetation profiles, were captured by LiDAR. These differences in the physiognomy were in part caused by changes in altitude, which also influence tree species composition. We propose that the most-efficient way to identify forest habitat types according Natura 2000 is to combine remote-sensing LiDAR data with well-directed field surveys.

Study on the utility of IRS 1D LISS-III data and the classification techniques for mapping of Sunderban mangroves	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Mangrove conservation and management is a stupendous task chiefly due to the inaccessibility and the hostile substrate conditions. Remote sensing technology serves as an important tool in providing fast, accurate and up-to-date baseline information on the status of mangroves. It is almost impossible to carry out conventional field surveys in these swampy areas. The present study aims at the classification and mapping of the mangroves in Sunderban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in the West Bengal province of India using IRS 1D LISS-III satellite data. Different classification approaches, viz., on-screen visual interpretation, supervised and unsupervised classifications were tried. The study showed that four mangroves classes, viz., Avicennia, Phoenix, mixed mangroves, and mangrove scrub and eight non-mangrove classes could be delineated using all the three approaches. All the mangrove and non-mangrove classes were field verified and the overall accuracy as well as user's and producer's accuracies for each category were determined. It was observed that among the three approaches, on-screen visual interpretation yielded higher classification accuracy (91.67%) compared to supervised (79.90%) and unsupervised classifications (71.08%). The results obtained through on-screen visual interpretation showed that all mangrove categories together cover 23.21% of the total geographical area of SBR, of which the mixed mangrove category covers maximum area (18.31%). Among the non-mangrove classes, the waterbody occupies largest area (35.36%) followed by agriculture (34.51%).

Natural environmental driving factors and excessive anthropogenic activities play important roles in coastal wetland change. Many studies have used remote sensing images to map and assess coastal wetland change on local or regional scales. This paper aims to provide insight into coastal wetland change in the Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) using remote sensing technology and landscape metrics analysis. The results reveal that grass flat and reed areas have significantly decreased, whereas agriculture fields, aquaculture ponds and built-up areas have continuously increased from 1988 to 2006. The spatial pattern of the coastal landscape has become fragmented and heterogeneous under great pressure from rapid economic development and population growth. The wetland changes have important impacts on natural habitat of the red-crowned cranes.

Modelling semi-natural habitat area on lowland farms in western Ireland	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A significant policy objective is the need for protection of biodiversity not just within designated Natura 2000 sites, but also in areas that occur outside of these sites. However there is a lack of information on existing semi-natural habitat cover on EU farms, making it difficult to assess whether targets for halting the loss of agricultural biodiversity are being met. To achieve these targets, reliable yet easy-to-use methods are needed for accurately identifying priority areas for conservation actions and monitoring biodiversity on a large spatial scale. Remote sensing, farmland statistics and species data have been used in some EU countries to create maps to estimate the extent of semi-natural habitat cover but these are acknowledged as being too broad scale. In this study, we examined a method of fine-scale prediction of the spatial coverage of semi-natural habitats in lowland farms. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to investigate the relationships between landscape and farm management variables and the lowland farmland habitat biodiversity on 32 farms outside of conservation designations, in a region of western Ireland. Semi-natural habitat cover on lowland farms could be predicted with a model using stocking density, soil diversity and river and stream length. It is proposed that this model could be used to predict the coverage of semi-natural habitats on farms in other regions of Ireland with similar land-use and landscape. A similar modelling approach could be adapted for application in other regions of Ireland and across Europe with different landscapes to predict semi-natural habitat coverage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Mass With the Use of Satellite Imagery	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) is an aggressively spreading native species in Oklahoma grasslands. It decreases rangeland forage production, and has been implicated in reducing stream flow and groundwater recharge. Industrial-scale plans to use redcedar as a biofuel source are being considered. Optimal placement of redcedar-based industries requires determination of redcedar availability. Such large-area inventories of redcedar mass can be practically addressed via aircraft or satellite remote sensing. Therefore, we conducted a study in central and western Oklahoma to develop and test a remote-sensing based allometric equation relating redcedar canopy area to aboveground dry mass (AGM). We used automated methods to measure tree canopy area from georectified, pan-sharpened, multispectral QuickBird images having a spatial resolution of 0.45 m(2) per pixel ground sample area. We also measured the canopy area and fresh and dry mass of these trees with the use of destructive sampling techniques. Regression analysis showed that satellite-derived measurements of canopy coverage explained about 85% of field-measured redcedar dry AGM in the study plots. The resulting allometric equation was applied to an independent data set, yielding dry AGM of 38.2 metric tons . ha(-1), which was well within the field-measured range of 36-43 metric tons . ha(-1). The allometric equation was then applied to Natural Resources Conservation Service measurements of redcedar canopy coverage for 17 counties in Oklahoma, to determine that the area of interest contains a median value of about 11.5 million metric tons of redcedar AGM. These results indicate that 0.45-m(2) spatial resolution multispectral imagery can be a useful tool for rapid and reliable measurement of redcedar dry AGM.																	1550-7424					MAR	2011	64	2					178	186		10.2111/REM-D-10-00057.1								WOS:000288733400008

JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The Llanos de Moxos (LM), Beni, Bolivia, with its impressive number of pre-Columbian earthworks, is an ideal region for studying past human-environment interactions in the Amazonia. Agricultural raised fields are among the most striking of those earthworks. They can offer us valuable information about the region's agricultural carrying capacity and the nature and extent of human occupation in pre-Columbian times and, therefore, help adopt better informed conservation and development strategies for Amazonia in the future. However, before tackling these issues we need to further our understanding of why pre-Columbian raised fields were built and how they were managed in the past. Published data on raised fields in the LM is contrasted with new data gathered from field and remote sensing images. Raised fields have been analysed in relation to the hydrology, soil, topography and paleoclimate of the areas where they are found. In light of this new data we believe that there are grounds to question the current model that suggests raised field agriculture provided high yields without the need of fallow periods, representing a kind of pre-Columbian green revolution. Our alternative proposal suggests that raised field agriculture allowed pre-Columbian peoples to mitigate the risk of more intense and frequent flooding than is experienced today in the LM. We show that raised fields were built only in those areas where there were no alternatives, which do not coincide with those areas where pre-Columbian societies seem to have flourished and reached high levels of social complexity.

In the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM), global, daily, systematic, high-resolution images obtained from satellites provide a good data source for incorporating habitat considerations into marine fish population dynamics. An overview of the most common SRS datasets available to fishery scientists and state-of-the-art data-processing methods is presented, focusing on recently developed techniques for detecting mesoscale features such as eddies, fronts, filaments, and river plumes of major importance in productivity enhancement and associated fish aggregation. A comprehensive review of remotely sensed data applications in fisheries over the past three decades for investigating the relationships between oceanographic conditions and marine resources is provided, emphasizing how synoptic and information-rich SRS data have become instrumental in ecological analyses at community and ecosystem scales. Finally, SRS data, in conjunction with automated in situ data-acquisition systems, can provide the scientific community with a major source of information for ecosystem modelling, a key tool for implementing an EAFM.

Spinning a laser web: predicting spider distributions using LiDAR	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												LiDAR remote sensing has been used to examine relationships between vertebrate diversity and environmental characteristics, but its application to invertebrates has been limited. Our objectives were to determine whether LiDAR-derived variables could be used to accurately describe single-species distributions and community characteristics of spiders in remote forested and mountainous terrain. We collected over 5300 spiders across multiple transects in the Bavarian National Park (Germany) using pitfall traps. We examined spider community characteristics (species richness, the Shannon index, the Simpson index, community composition, mean body size, and abundance) and single-species distribution and abundance with LiDAR variables and ground-based measurements. We used the R(2) and partial R(2) provided by variance partitioning to evaluate the predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables compared to ground measurements for each of the community characteristics. The total adjusted R(2) for species richness, the Shannon index, community species composition, and body size had a range of 25-57%. LiDAR variables and ground measurements both contributed >80% to the total predictive power. For species composition, the explained variance was similar to 32%, which was significantly greater than expected by chance. The predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables was comparable or superior to that of the ground-based variables for examinations of single-species distributions, and it explained up to 55% of the variance. The predictability of species distributions was higher for species that had strong associations with shade in open-forest habitats, and this niche position has been well documented across the European continent for spider species. The similar statistical performance between LiDAR and ground-based measures at our field sites indicated that deriving spider community and species distribution information using LiDAR data can provide not only high predictive power at relatively low cost, but may also allow unprecedented mapping of community-and species-level spider information at scales ranging from stands to landscapes. Therefore, LiDAR is a viable tool to assist species-specific conservation as well as broader biodiversity planning efforts not only for a growing list of vertebrates, but for invertebrates as well.

Forest degradation assessment in the upper catchment of the river Tons using remote sensing and GIS	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The present study investigates the status of forest degradation in the upper catchment of the river Tons in the Uttarakhand state of India, including Govind Wildlife Sanctuary and the National Park by the same name using remote sensing and the geographic information system (GIS). The study revealed that more than 50% of the study area is covered with snow and the alpine grasslands while 8.1% area is under agriculture. Degraded forest covers maximum area (53 km(2)), followed by moderately (30.4 km(2)) and severely degraded (26.8 km(2)) forests. The lower and middle slopes showed higher degradation than upper slopes due to multiple uses for agriculture, horticulture, agroforestry and grazing by the local people. Over time, the degradation and deforestation, without adequate protection, have led to severe soil erosion. biodiversity and the habitat depletion for a large number of rare and endemic species including loss of livelihood to the local people.

Soil Loss Mapping for Sustainable Development and Management of Land Resources in Warora Tehsil of Chandrapur District of Maharashtra: An Integrated Approach Using Remote Sensing and GIS	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The study area is characterized by low and fluctuating rainfall pattern, thin soil cover, predominantly rain-fed farming with low productivity coupled with intensive mining activities, urbanization, deforestation, wastelands and unwise utilization of natural resources causing human induced environmental degradation and ecological imbalances, that warrant sustainable development and optimum management of land resources. Spatial information related to existing geology, land use/land cover, physiography, slope and soils has been derived through remote sensing, collateral data and field survey and used as inputs in a widely used erosion model (Universal Soil Loss Equation) in India to compute soil loss (t/ha/yr) in GIS. The study area has been delineated into very slight (< 5 t/ha/yr), slight (5-10 t/ha/yr), moderate (10-15 t/ha/yr), moderately severe (15-20 t/ha/yr), severe (20-40 t/ha/yr) and very severe (> 40 t/ha/yr) soil erosion classes. The study indicate that 45.4 thousand ha. (13.7% of TGA) is under moderate, moderately severe, severe and very severe soil erosion categories. The physiographic unit wise analysis of soil loss in different landscapes have indicated the sensitive areas, that has helped to prioritize development and management plans for soil and water conservation measures and suitable interventions like afforestation, agro-forestry, agri-horticulture, silvipasture systems which will result in the improvement of productivity of these lands, protect the environment from further degradation and for the ecological sustenance.																	0255-660X					MAR	2011	39	1					51	61		10.1007/s12524-010-0055-1								WOS:000291952500004

Comprehensive maps of marine resources, including those important for local fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, provide a crucial foundation of information for the planning process. Using a combination of field and high spatial resolution satellite data, we use an empirical procedure to create a bathymetric map (RMSE 1.76 m) and object-based image analysis to produce accurate maps of geomorphic and benthic coral reef classes (Kappa values of 0.80 and 0.63; 9 and 33 classes, respectively) covering a large (>260 km(2)) traditional fisheries management area in Fiji. From these maps, we derive per-pixel information on habitat richness, structural complexity, coral cover and the distance from land, and use these variables as input in models to predict fish species richness, diversity and biomass. We show that random forest models outperform five other model types, and that all three fish community variables can be satisfactorily predicted from the high spatial resolution satellite data. We also show geomorphic zone to be the most important predictor on average, with secondary contributions from a range of other variables including benthic class, depth, distance from land, and live coral cover mapped at coarse spatial scales, suggesting that data with lower spatial resolution and lower cost may be sufficient for spatial predictions of the three fish community variables.

Adapting a global stratified random sample for regional estimation of forest cover change derived from satellite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A desirable feature of a global sampling design for estimating forest cover change based on satellite imagery is the ability to adapt the design to obtain precise regional estimates, where a region may be a country, state, province, or conservation area. A sampling design stratified by an auxiliary variable correlated with forest cover change has this adaptability. A global stratified random sample can be augmented by additional sample units within a region selected by the same stratified protocol and the resulting sample constitutes a stratified random sample of the region. Stratified sampling allows increasing the sample size in a region by a few to many additional sample units. The additional sample units can be effectively allocated to strata to reduce the standard errors of the regional estimates, even though these strata were not initially constructed for the objective of regional estimation. A complete coverage map of deforestation within the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is used as a population to evaluate precision of regional estimates obtained by augmenting a global stratified random sample. The standard errors of the regional estimates for the BLA and states within the BLA obtained from the augmented stratified design were generally smaller than those attained by simple random sampling and systematic sampling.

Reddy			Assessment of spatial and temporal dynamics of tropical forest cover: A case study in Malkangiri district of Orissa, India	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Tropical forests have been recognized as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Regular monitoring of forests is necessary for an adaptive management approach and the successful implementation of ecosystem management. The present study analyses the temporal changes in forest ecosystem structure in tribal dominated Malkangiri district of Orissa, India, during 1973-2004 period based on digitized forest cover maps using geographic information system (GIS) and interpretation of satellite data. Three satellite images Landsat MSS (1973), Landsat TM (1990) and IRS P6 LISS III (2004) were used to determine changes. Six land cover types were delineated which includes dense forest, open forest, scrub land, agriculture, barren land and water body. Different forest types were also demarcated within forest class for better understanding the degradation pattern in each forest types. The results showed that there was a net decrease of 475.7 km(2) forest cover (rate of deforestation = 2.34) from 1973 to 1990 and 402.3 km(2) (rate of deforestation = 2.27) from 1990 to 2004. Forest cover has changed over time depending on a few factors such as large-scale deforestation, shifting cultivation, dam and road construction, unregulated management actions, and social pressure. A significant increase of 1222.8 km(2) agriculture area (1973-2004) clearly indicated the conversion of forest cover to agricultural land. These alterations had resulted in significant environmental consequences, including decline in forest cover, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. There is an urgent need for rational management of the remaining forest for it to be able to survive beyond next decades. Particular attention must be paid to tropical forests, which are rapidly being deforested.																	1009-637X					FEB	2011	21	1					176	192		10.1007/s11442-011-0837-6								WOS:000285985800013

Furthermore, recent statistical advances mean that such data can be used to test ecological hypotheses and estimate species' distributions. Black-browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys are highly mobile marine predators with a circumpolar breeding and foraging distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Although they remain relatively abundant, increased fisheries bycatch has led to their listing as endangered by conservation bodies. We satellite-tracked 163 breeding Black-browed Albatrosses and eight closely related Campbell Albatrosses T. impavida from nine colonies. We then quantified habitat usage, and modeled population-level spatial distribution at spatiotemporal scales >50 km and 1 month, as a function of habitat accessibility, habitat preference, and intraspecific competition, using mixed-effects generalized additive models (GAMM). During incubation, birds foraged over a wider area than in the post-brood chick-rearing period, when they are more time constrained. Throughout breeding, the order of habitat preference of Black-browed Albatrosses was for neritic (0-500 m), shelf-break and upper shelf-slope (500 1000 m), and then oceanic (>1000 m) waters. Black-browed Albatrosses also preferred areas with steeper (>3 degrees) bathymetric relief and, in addition, during incubation, warmer sea surface temperatures (peak preference similar to 16 degrees C). Although this suggests specialization in neritic habitats, incubation-stage Black-browed Albatrosses from South Georgia also foraged extensively in oceanic waters, preferring areas with high eddy kinetic energy (>250 cm(2)/s(2)), especially the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, a region of intense mesoscale turbulence. During chick-rearing, this species had a more southerly distribution, and following the seasonal retreat of sea ice, birds from some populations utilized neritic polar waters. Campbell Albatrosses showed similar bathymetric preferences but also preferred positive sea level anomalies. Black-browed Albatross foraging areas were partially spatially segregated with respect to colony and region, with birds preferring locations distant from neighboring colonies, presumably in order to reduce competition between parapatric conspecifics. At the global scale, the greatest concentrations of breeding Black-browed Albatrosses are in southern South American neritic, shelf-break, and shelf-slope waters. These regions also hold large fisheries and should therefore be a priority for introduction of bycatch mitigation measures.

Use of Multi-Sensor Data to Identify and Map Tropical Coastal Wetlands in the Amazon of Northern Brazil	WETLANDS												Recognizing and mapping wetlands in the Amazon coastal from optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is critical to understand coastal evolution. Multispectral optical images are obtained only during the dry season, while SAR images can be acquired throughout the year, but present low spectral resolution. The aim of this paper was to investigate the use of remote sensing images, which allowed the accurate identification and mapping of coastal environments based on the complementary information provided by the synergism of multisensory data and supervised classifications with statistical validation from the overall accuracy and Kappa index. The mapping of these environments was based on the supervised classification of Landsat ETM+ images and ETM+-SAR product, which permitted the identification of eight classes: coastal plateau, mangroves, floodplain + freshwater marshes, tidal sandflats + sandbars + ebb-tidal delta, macrotidal beaches, water, frontal dunes + paleodunes + interdunes + mobile dunes, and salt marshes. Overall accuracy and Kappa indices for the classification maps of the wetland study area were 93.3% and 0.909 for Landsat ETM+ and 93.8% and 0.917 for the ETM+-SAR product. This indicates that the integrated product provides additional information, which permits the more efficient identification and mapping of tropical coastal wetlands.

Conservation and management implications of nest-site selection of the sympatric crocodilians Melanosuchus niger and Caiman crocodilus in Central Amazonia, Brazil	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Management of crocodilians is often based on source-sink dynamics, protecting breeding habitat and concentrating hunting in other areas. Nest distributions shed light on habitat use by breeding populations, which might be used as a basis for monitoring and management. The heterogeneous spatial distribution of Melanosuchus niger and adman crocodilus in Amazonia has been suggested to reflect past hunting pressure, often underestimating the natural ecological peculiarities of these species. Ground nest surveys combined with satellite imagery allowed us to evaluate whether nest-site use by M. niger and C. crocodilus reflects environmental constraints or is a result of hunting pressure. Our results indicate that there is little evidence that hunting pressure shapes nest-site use of these species in our study areas. M. niger nests mainly on the shores of stable, temporally impounded floodplain lakes isolated from the early stages of the annual rising water of main rivers. This behavior facilitates the identification of suitable nesting sites using moderate-resolution remote-sensing tools and should guide monitoring efforts and the protection of these areas. In contrast, C. crocodilus is a generalist species, able to nest hundreds of meters inside the forest far from permanent water. This makes the occurrence and distribution of nesting-sites unpredictable using Landsat images. Although nests of this species can be found around lakes where nests of M. niger also occur, the protection of these sites might help to preserve only a small portion of C. crocodilus nesting females. Thus, conservation strategies for C crocodilus should probably be based on different approaches. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Remote Sensing for Mapping RAMSAR Heritage Site at Sungai Pulai Mangrove Forest Reserve, Johor, Malaysia	SAINS MALAYSIANA												The Sungai Pulai Mangrove Forest Reserve (SPMFR) is the largest riverine mangrove system in Johore. In 2003 about 9,126 ha of the Sungai Pulai mangrove was designated as a RAMSAR site. RAMSAR sites are wetland areas that are deemed to have international importance and are included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance. The,SPMFR plays a significant socio-economic role to the adjacent 38 villages. Satellite remote sensing is a useful source of information where it provides timely and complete coverage for vegetation mapping especially in mangroves where the accessibility is difficult. This study was carried out to identify and map land cover types using SPOT-4 imagery at the Sungai Pulai-RAMSAR site and its surrounding areas. Through unsupervised classification technique a total of seven classes of land cover type were mapped, where about 90% mapping accuracy was gained from the accuracy assessment. Later, vegetation densities were classified into five levels namely very high, high, medium, low and very low based on crown density scale using vegetation indices model such as NDVI, AVI and OSAVI. Results from NDVI and OSAVI model were almost similar but AVI model detected more on medium vegetation which did not show the real ground condition. The study concludes that SPOT-4 imagery was able to discriminate mangrove area clearly from other land covers type. Vegetation indices model can be used as a tool for mapping vegetation density level in the SPMFR and its surrounding area. Therefore VI's models from remote sensing are useful to monitor and manage the mangrove forest for sustainable management and preserve the SPMFR as a RAMSAR site in Peninsular Malaysia.																	0126-6039					FEB	2011	40	2					83	88										WOS:000287821400001

Unfortunately, scientific data regarding the actual status of populations is lacking. We combined satellite image analysis, species-specific habitat assessment, and a field survey technique using playback to focus conservation efforts for this species. First, we identified remaining forest via a LANDSAT mosaic and then applied species-specific criteria to delineate remaining forest with potential to hold populations. By combining this with the historical distribution from ecological niche modeling and predicted hunting intensity we generated a species-specific landscape map. Within our study area, forest capable of sustaining Ateles fusciceps covers 5872 km(2), of which 2172 km(2) (40%) is protected. Unprotected forest considered suitable for Ateles fusciceps extends to 3700 km(2) but within this only 989 km(2) (23%) is under low hunting pressure and likely to maintain healthy populations of Ateles fusciceps. To overcome problems of sampling at low primate density and in difficult mountain terrain we developed a field survey technique to determine presence and estimate abundance using acoustic sampling. For sites under low hunting pressure density of primates varied with altitude. Densities decreased from 7.49 individuals/km(2) at 332 masl to 0.9 individuals/km(2) at 1570 masl. Based on combining data sets in a gap analysis, we recommend conservation action focus on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve where hunting pressure is low and population densities of Ateles fusciceps are greatest.

This was applied to the EPA of Lageado stream, one of the main surface water sources in Campo Grande, Brazil. Several referenced information plans were overlapped and the total area was divided into five zones with different land use profiles, which were determined according to the conservation and preservation of native vegetation, occurrence of wet areas and springs, land use and management, eroded area recovery and occurrence of permanently preserved areas. The methodology proposed was suitable for environmental zoning of protected areas. This protocol can be applied to other areas by including additional variables such as social and economic parameters.

Investigating RADARSAT-2 as a tool for monitoring grassland in western Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Native grasslands play an important role in ecosystem function, biodiversity, climate change, and economics, yet quantifiable estimates of the rate and location of native grassland change in western Canada are not readily available. To date, optical remote sensing has been explored for grassland mapping, but cloud cover limits the availability of timely data for the discrimination of improved, as opposed to native, grassland. In this study we investigated the utility of RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery to map native grassland, improved grassland, and agricultural crops. Fine quad-polarisation mode RADARSAT-2 data were acquired at two incidence angles over a test site in southern Alberta every 24 days from 1 April to 31 October 2009 and were processed using the Freeman-Durden decomposition. Double-bounce, volumetric, and surface scattering properties suggest that native grasslands can be distinguished from cultivated cropping, especially using a mid-to late-season image. However, discriminating native grasslands from improved grasslands was more difficult. Land cover classification of a single RADARSAT-2 image from July 2009 provided reasonable but slightly less accurate results compared with a single Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image (Kappa value of 0.65 compared with 0.81).																	1712-7971					FEB	2011	37	1			SI		93	102		10.5589/m11-027								WOS:000305249300010

A better understanding of these supplies and their imprint on the water consumption of those inflow dependent ecosystems (IDEs) across arid regions is critical to manage agricultural outputs and ecosystem conservation, and the hydrological trade-offs that emerge among them. Actual operative satellite and physically-based algorithms able to map evapotranspiration (ET) rates at regional scales still fail when they are applied in ungauged regions because of their high parameterization and meteorological data requirements. We introduce an ecological and satellite-based approach to explore the impacts of external water supplies on arid ecosystems, focusing on the Central Monte desert and its water supplies from the Andean Cordillera, in Argentina. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODIS imagery, used as a surrogate of ET, were the input variables of our empirical model. Two related biophysical indexes were generated for the whole territory of interest based on a MAP-EVI regional function calibrated for the region: the EVI Anomaly (i.e. deviation from a reference with similar MAP) and the ET Anomaly (i.e. additional water consumption besides MAP). These indexes allowed us to identify IDEs and to quantify the impact of remote lateral inflows as well as local constrains on the water balance of rangelands, and irrigated and natural oases. The performance of this satellite-based approach was evaluated through comparisons with independent ET estimates based on plot (known crop coefficients) and basin (measured water budgets) scale approaches. Relative errors in the 2-18% range at plot and basin scale are in agreement with those uncertainties reported by other satellite and physically-based approaches. Our approach provides a simple yet robust diagnostic tool to characterize water balance in arid regions, aimed to improve the identification of inflow dependent ecosystems and their management under the demanding pressures of land use and climate change.

Land use and land cover changes over a century (1914-2007) in the Neyyar River Basin, Kerala: a remote sensing and GIS approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												Land use and land cover change, perhaps the most significant anthropogenic disturbance to the environment, mainly due to rapid urbanization/industrialization and large scale agricultural activities. In this paper, an attempt has been made to appraise land use/land cover changes over a century (1914-2007) in the Neyyar River Basin (L=56 km; Area = 483.4 km2) in southern Kerala - a biodiversity hot spot in Peninsular India. In this study, digital remote sensing data of the Indian Remote Sensing satellite series I-D (LISS III, 2006-2007) on 1:50,000 scale, Survey of India (SOI) toposheet of 1914 (1:63,360) and 1967 (1:50,000) have been utilized to map various land use/land cover changes. Maps of different periods have been registered and resampled to similar geographic coordinates using ERDAS Imagine 9.0. The most notable changes include decreases in areas of paddy cultivation, mixed crops, scrub lands and evergreen forests, and increases in built-up areas, rubber plantations, dense mixed forests, and water bodies. Further, large scale exploitation of flood plain mud and river sand have reached menacing proportions leading to bank caving and cut offs at channel bends. Conservation of land and water resources forms an important aspect of ecosystem management in the basin.

In particular, data were gathered to assess the effects of management strategies on the physiological status of reed beds and to collect information for defining further conservation programs. Results point to the central role played by water levels both on reed plot re-growth efficiency and on reed health; cutting back the reeds, however, (which is done exclusively in winter) seems to have a negligible impact on common reed beds while removing detritus from their midst appears to have a positive effects on reed health and in general on the quality of the littoral zone in question.

Creating a catchment scale perspective for river restoration	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												One of the major challenges in river restoration is to identify the natural fluvial landscape in catchments with a long history of river control. Intensive land use on valley floors often predates the earliest remote sensing: levees, dikes, dams, and other structures alter valley-floor morphology, river channels and flow regimes. Consequently, morphological patterns indicative of the fluvial landscape including multiple channels, extensive floodplains, wetlands, and fluvial-riparian and tributary-confluence dynamics can be obscured, and information to develop appropriate and cost effective river restoration strategies can be unavailable. This is the case in the Pas River catchment in northern Spain (650 km(2)), in which land use and development have obscured the natural fluvial landscape in many parts of the basin. To address this issue we used computer tools to examine the spatial patterns of fluvial landscapes that are associated with five domains of hydro-geomorphic processes and landforms. Using a 5-m digital elevation model, valley-floor surfaces were mapped according to elevation above the channel and proximity to key geomorphic processes. The predicted fluvial landscape is patchily distributed according to hillslope and valley topography, river network structure, and channel elevation profiles. The vast majority of the fluvial landscape in the main segments of the Pas River catchment is presently masked by human infrastructure, with only 15% not impacted by river control structures and development. The reconstructed fluvial landscape provides a catchment scale context to support restoration planning, in which areas of potential ecological productivity and diversity could be targeted for in-channel, floodplain and riparian restoration projects.

Hyperspectral remote sensing of salinity stress on red (Rhizophora mangle) and white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves on Galapagos Islands	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Mangroves are an assemblage of salt-tolerant woody hydrophytes that are the foundational species along tropical and subtropical coastlines, estuaries, lagoons and rivers. Once covering 75% of the world's tropical and subtropical coastlines, mangrove forests have been declining rapidly throughout the world in the last few decades. Monitoring and modelling mangrove forest growth are critical for their conservation. Salinity is one of the primary limiting factors for mangrove forest growth. In this letter, we report the potential of using hyperspectral remotely sensed data collected in the field for monitoring the photosynthesis rate of red (Rhizophora mangle) and white (Laguncularia racemosa) mangroves with regard to salinity gradient. Using photochemical reflectance index (PRI) as proxy for photosynthetic rate, PRI for both species are strongly related to salinity gradient, indicating the potential of monitoring mangrove forest growth on a regional scale using hyperspectral remote sensing.

Toward an Integrated GIScience and Energy Research Agenda	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												The growing evidence indicating that climate change is real and accelerating, coupled with a host of interrelated energy sustainability questions, has fostered increased interdisciplinary research on improving energy efficiency and reducing per capita energy consumption, as well as better understanding the sources of pollution emissions and possible policy options for limiting permanent environmental damage. Increasingly, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and other spatial technologies are being leveraged by researchers when analyzing these problems. There is, however, limited discourse regarding the possible synergies that could result from sustained engagement between those interested in geographic information science (GIScience) and researchers tackling energy issues. In this article, we outline an integrated research agenda for GIScience and energy studies that focuses on the prospects for making new contributions to the growing literature on energy sustainability. We identify three critical issues that offer substantial opportunities for new synergistic research at the nexus of GIScience and energy sustainability, including (1) the problem of carbon estimation and inventory, (2) questions of new energy infrastructure placement and transition, and (3) household energy conservation and efficiency. We lay out substantive energy considerations within each problem area and discuss possible new contributions involving GIScience. Our analysis suggests that issues of scale, representation, complexity, and several other core GIScience themes underpin these energy research needs. This article is intended to foster new dialogue between GIScience and energy studies.

J	Wedding, LM; Lepczyk, CA; Pittman, SJ; Friedlander, AM; Jorgensen, S				Wedding, Lisa M.; Lepczyk, Christopher A.; Pittman, Simon J.; Friedlander, Alan M.; Jorgensen, Stacy			Quantifying seascape structure: extending terrestrial spatial pattern metrics to the marine realm	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Spatial pattern metrics have routinely been applied to characterize and quantify structural features of terrestrial landscapes and have demonstrated great utility in landscape ecology and conservation planning. The important role of spatial structure in ecology and management is now commonly recognized, and recent advances in marine remote sensing technology have facilitated the application of spatial pattern metrics to the marine environment. However, it is not yet clear whether concepts, metrics, and statistical techniques developed for terrestrial ecosystems are relevant for marine species and seascapes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we reviewed, synthesized, and evaluated the utility and application of spatial pattern metrics in the marine science literature over the past 30 yr (1980 to 2010). In total, 23 studies characterized seascape structure, of which 17 quantified spatial patterns using a 2-dimensional patch-mosaic model and 5 used a continuously varying 3-dimensional surface model. Most seascape studies followed terrestrial-based studies in their search for ecological patterns and applied or modified existing metrics. Only 1 truly unique metric was found (hydrodynamic aperture applied to Pacific atolls). While there are still relatively few studies using spatial pattern metrics in the marine environment, they have suffered from similar misuse as reported for terrestrial studies, such as the lack of a priori considerations or the problem of collinearity between metrics. Spatial pattern metrics offer great potential for ecological research and environmental management in marine systems, and future studies should focus on (1) the dynamic boundary between the land and sea; (2) quantifying 3-dimensional spatial patterns; and (3) assessing and monitoring seascape change.																	0171-8630						2011	427						219	232		10.3354/meps09119								WOS:000289489800017

The aim of our research was to analyze and interpret annual trends of forest cover loss for different sub-regions of the study area. We mapped forest cover loss for 2000-2008 using multi-resolution remote sensing data from the Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors and analyzed annual trends per island, province, and official land allocation zone. The total forest cover loss for Sumatera and Kalimantan 2000-2008 was 5.39 Mha, which represents 5.3% of the land area and 9.2% of the year 2000 forest cover of these two islands. At least 6.5% of all mapped forest cover loss occurred in land allocation zones prohibiting clearing. An additional 13.6% of forest cover loss occurred where clearing is legally restricted. The overall trend of forest cover loss increased until 2006 and decreased thereafter. The trends for Sumatera and Kalimantan were distinctly different, driven primarily by the trends of Riau and Central Kalimantan provinces, respectively. This analysis shows that annual mapping of forest cover change yields a clearer picture than a one-time overall national estimate. Monitoring forest dynamics is important for national policy makers, especially given the commitment of Indonesia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries initiative (REDD+). The improved spatio-temporal detail of forest change monitoring products will make it possible to target policies and projects in meeting this commitment. Accurate, annual forest cover loss maps will be integral to many REDD+ objectives, including policy formulation, definition of baselines, detection of displacement, and the evaluation of the permanence of emission reduction.																	1748-9326					JAN-MAR	2011	6	1							014010	10.1088/1748-9326/6/1/014010								WOS:000289263600011

Vertical and horizontal habitat preferences of post-nesting leatherback turtles in the South Pacific Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Leatherback turtles are the largest and widest ranging turtle species, and spend much of their time in the offshore pelagic environment. However, the high seas have thus far received little management attention to protect their ecosystems and biodiversity. We tagged 46 female leatherback turtles with satellite transmitters at Playa Grande, Costa Rica from 2004 to 2007. In the present study, we analyzed the vertical and horizontal habitat preferences of these leatherback turtles in the South Pacific Ocean. The turtles exhibited short, shallow dives during their migration southward (mean depth: 45 m; mean duration: 23.6 min), followed by deeper, longer dives (mean depth: 56.7 m; mean duration: 26.4 min) in the South Pacific Gyre that probably indicated searching for prey. We integrated the horizontal movements with remotely sensed oceanographic data to determine the turtles' response to the environment, and applied this information to recommendations for conservation in the pelagic environment. A generalized additive mixed model applied to the daily turtle travel rates confirmed that slower travel rates occurred at cooler sea surface temperatures, higher chlorophyll a concentration and stronger vertical Ekman upwelling, all of which are considered favorable foraging conditions. The southern terminus (35 to 37 degrees S) of the leatherback tracks was also in an area of increased mesoscale activity that might act as a physical mechanism to aggregate their prey, gelatinous zooplankton. However, this could also act as a thermal limit to their distribution. This characterization of leatherback habitat use could aid the development of management efforts within the South Pacific Ocean to reduce mortality of leatherback turtles from fisheries interactions.

EXPLORATORY ANALYSES OF FORAGING HABITAT SELECTION OF THE RED-FOOTED FALCON (FALCO VESPERTINUS)	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												The foraging habitat selection of Red-footed Falcons (Falco vespertinus) was investigated in a characteristic Hungarian habitat between 2006-2008. Potentially available habitat types were assessed within a 10 km(2) study site with remote sensing technologies. Altogether 18 adult birds were equipped with tail-mount VHF radio-tags and individually followed until visual contact to record location and foraging behaviour. Foraging areas were assessed with 100% Minimum Convex Polygons (MCP), global Manly's selectivity measures were used to detect population level habitat preference, and the eigenanalysis of selection ratios was carried out to partition the variability in individual habitat preference. We found large individual variability in the extent of foraging areas. Females had significantly smaller foraging areas compared to males, while males at the largest colony had significantly larger foraging areas compared to males of the smaller colonies. Global Manley's selectivity measures showed that birds significantly avoided intertilled crops, water surface, woods and artificial surfaces. The eigenanalysis of selection ratios partitioned individual habitat selection rates into two distinct groups; the first using grasslands and alfalfa while the second group of birds preferring grasslands and cereals. Positive habitat preference towards arable habitat types, indicate that species specific conservation efforts of this declining raptor should also focus on agricultural land use practices.

Integrating field sampling, geostatistics and remote sensing to map wetland vegetation in the Pantanal, Brazil	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Development of efficient methodologies for mapping wetland vegetation is of key importance to wetland conservation. Here we propose the integration of a number of statistical techniques, in particular cluster analysis, universal kriging and error propagation modelling, to integrate observations from remote sensing and field sampling for mapping vegetation communities and estimating uncertainty. The approach results in seven vegetation communities with a known floral composition that can be mapped over large areas using remotely sensed data. The relationship between remotely sensed data and vegetation patterns, captured in four factorial axes, were described using multiple linear regression models. There were then used in a universal kriging procedure to reduce the mapping uncertainty. Cross-validation procedures and Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting map. Cross-validation showed that accuracy in classification varies according with the community type, as a result of sampling density and configuration. A map of uncertainty derived from Monte Carlo simulations revealed significant spatial variation in classification, but this had little impact on the proportion and arrangement of the communities observed. These results suggested that mapping improvement could be achieved by increasing the number of field observations of those communities with a scattered and small patch size distribution; or by including a larger number of digital images as explanatory variables in the model. Comparison of the resulting plant community map with a flood duration map, revealed that flooding duration is an important driver of vegetation zonation. This mapping approach is able to integrate field point data and high-resolution remote-sensing images, providing a new basis to map wetland vegetation and allow its future application in habitat management, conservation assessment and long-term ecological monitoring in wetland landscapes.

Background for regional energy planning	BOSQUE												Land planning comprises a stage of land management whose aim is to generate proposals from analyzing the information of the territory, which represents multiple variables of the geographic space. Some of the most recent lines of planning are renewable energies and particularly residual forest biomass since this is a non used environmental element but with a high growth potential. For this task, using technological tools like geographic information systems or remote sensing permits to handle these topics and express them in a spatial zoning for decision making. According to this, a prospective work was made in the watershed of Ranco Lake, where optimum spaces were defined to obtain residual forest biomass in four vegetational units (coigue-rauli-tepa, roble-rauli-coigue, evergreen and forest plantations). The results showed that there exists an overall potential surface to handle of 45,555 hectares, from which the forest type coigue-rauli-tepa highlights with a 62.4 % of the surface. Under the assumption of availability of residual forest biomass in the watershed and a scene of energetic crisis, the importance of prioritizing regional policies and research concerning the development of non conventional renewable energies is recognized.

J	Ostendorf, B				Ostendorf, Bertram			Overview: Spatial information and indicators for sustainable management of natural resources	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Natural resource management (NRM) is becoming increasingly important at all scales, local, regional. national and global, because of an increasing human population and increasing per capita use of resources and space. Conflicts are intensifying between different interest groups. Production and conservation aspects are particularly debated because conservation often conflicts with economic and social sustainability. There is public demand for objective decision based NRM but limitations are all pervasive due to the spatial and temporal complexity and interdisciplinary nature. This special issue explores the use of spatial data and models to overcome some limitations of NRM decision making. The papers in this issue show modern approaches of natural resources management with a particular focus on spatial data collection, analysis and the development of spatial indicators. This issue presents a balanced mix of review and research papers that give examples of how to find or improve the spatial information base for evidence-based decision making. This overview makes the argument that understanding complex spatial pattern and processes, and the development of spatial indicators, is an essential aspect of evidence-based NRM. If spatial and temporal patterns are complex, ecological evidence from field data or experiments may have limited value for NRM and observational study designs become more appropriate for understanding complex spatial pattern and processes. Data quality should be documented as a combination of accuracy and spatio-temporal representativeness in order to be useful in the NRM decision process. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We applied a systematic qualitative social research design and carried out in-depth interviews with local, sub-national, and national authorities. Data collected through the interviews were used to interpret satellite images: (1) spatially, that is, forest cover change in the buffer zone versus the core area and, (2) over time, that is, forest cover change as a response to changing management regimes and socio-economic processes in the region. For this purpose a time series of LANDSAT scenes from 1972 to 2007 was used to classify homogeneous areas of forest cover to detect deforestation. According to the satellite image analysis, the buffer zone in Lore Lindu was ineffective at reducing forest cover clearing in the core area between 1972 and 2007. Since management establishment in 1998, the deforestation rate within the core area even increased fourfold. The gathered data suggest that there are three main institutional drivers to account for this ineffectiveness: (1) Low awareness of boundary demarcation among the villagers due to the lack of participation during management and boundary establishment, (2) The fall of the national president Suharto in 1998, which subsequently triggered deforestation activities in the core area, as the park was perceived to be the local branch of the national, suppressive regime, and (3) The lack of implementation of the biosphere reserve concept at the national level, which leads to unclear responsibilities in the buffer zone as the legal backing for any cooperation in the buffer zone is lacking. Although it appears that the forest status in Lore Lindu is still good compared to other regions in Indonesia, attention must be given to the protection of the core area. We thus conclude that the biosphere reserve concept needs to be strengthened in Indonesia. Its implementation at the national level, including adoption of clearly defined regulations, would substantially contribute to reducing negative impacts on biosphere reserve management through, for example, carefully designed awareness raising programs.																	1708-3087						2011	16	4							3	10.5751/ES-04349-160403								WOS:000298841900012

Use of object-oriented classification and fragmentation analysis (1985-2008) to identify important areas for conservation in Cockpit Country, Jamaica	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Forest fragmentation is one of the most important threats to global biodiversity, particularly in tropical developing countries. Identifying priority areas for conservation within these forests is essential to their effective management. However, this requires current, accurate environmental information that is often lacking in developing countries. The Cockpit Country, Jamaica, contains forests of international importance in terms of levels of endemism and overall diversity. These forests are under severe threat from the prospect of bauxite mining and other anthropogenic disturbances. In the absence of adequate, up-to-date ecological information, we used satellite remote sensing data and fragmentation analysis to identify interior forested areas that have experienced little or no change as priority conservation sites. We classified Landsat images from 1985, 1989, 1995, 2002, and 2008, using an object-oriented method, which allowed for the inclusion of roads. We conducted our fragmentation analysis using metrics to quantify changes in forest patch number, area, shape, and aggregation. Deforestation and fragmentation fluctuated within the 23-year period but were mostly confined to the periphery of the forest, close to roads and access trails. An area of core forest that remained intact over the period of study was identified within the largest forest patch, most of which was located within the boundaries of a forest reserve and included the last remaining patches of closed-broadleaf forest. These areas should be given highest priority for conservation, as they constitute important refuges for endemic or threatened biodiversity. Minimizing and controlling access will be important in maintaining this core.																	0167-6369					JAN	2011	172	1-4					391	406		10.1007/s10661-010-1342-6								WOS:000284959400029	20145994

Applying systematic conservation planning principles to palustrine and inland saline wetlands of New Zealand	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Previous attempts to identify nationally important wetlands for biodiversity in New Zealand were based on expert panel opinions because quantitative approaches were hampered by a lack of data. We apply principles of systematic conservation planning to remote sensing data within a geographical information system (GIS) to identify nationally important palustrine and inland saline wetlands. 2. A catchment-based classification was used to divide New Zealand into 29 biogeographic units. To meet representation goals, all wetland classes need to be protected within each unit. 3. We mapped current and historic wetlands down to a minimum size of 0.5 ha. Over 7000 current wetlands were mapped using standardised satellite imagery and a collection of point or polygon data. Historical extent was estimated from soil information refined using a digital elevation model. The current extent of wetlands is 10% of the historic extent, which is consistent with previous estimates. 4. A classification was produced using fuzzy expert rules within a GIS to identify seven wetland classes: bog, fen, swamp, marsh, pakihi/gumland, seepage and inland saline. Swamps and pakihi/gumland are the most common, but the former has sustained the greatest reduction in area with only 6% of its historical extent remaining. A preliminary field assessment of classification accuracy in the Otago region found only 60% agreement, mainly because of the misclassification of marshes into swamps. 5. Wetland condition was estimated using six measures of human disturbance (natural cover, human-made impervious cover, introduced fish, woody weeds, artificial drainage and nitrate leaching risk) applied at three spatial scales: the wetland's catchment, a 30-m buffer around the wetland and the wetland itself. Measures were transformed and combined into a single condition index. More than 60% of remaining wetlands had condition indices < 0.5, probably indicating moderate to severe degradation and loss of native biodiversity. 6. Sites were ranked within each biogeographic unit using the wetland classification to ensure a representative set of wetland diversity. Rankings were determined by combining condition and complementarity to calculate conservation effectiveness that was then weighted by irreplaceability. Highest ranked sites in each biogeographic unit were usually the largest remaining wetlands that contained multiple wetland classes. This reflects their potential to protect a diverse range of wetland classes and a high proportion of the remaining habitat.

Estimating east Mediterranean forest parameters using Landsat ETM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The conservation of Jordan's Mediterranean forest requires the use of remote sensing. Among the most important parameters needed are the crown-cover percentage (C) and above-ground biomass (A). This study aims to: (1) identify the best predictor(s) of C using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) bands and the derived transformed normalized difference vegetation index (TNDVI); (2) determine if C is a good predictor of A, volume (V), Shannon diversity index (S) and basal area (B); and (3) generate maps of all these parameters. A Landsat ETM image, aerial photographs and ground surveys are used to model C using multiple regression. C is then modelled to A, V, S and B using linear regression. The relationship between C and Landsat ETM bands (1 and 7) plus the TNDVI is significantly high (coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.8) and is used to produce the C map. The generated C map is used to predict A (R-2 = 0.56), V (R-2 = 0.58), S (R-2 = 0.50) and B (R-2 = 0.43). Cross validation for the predicted C map (cross-validation error = 5.3%) and for the predicted forest-parameter maps (cross-validation error 13.7%-19.9%) shows acceptable error levels. Results indicate that Jordan's east Mediterranean forest parameters can be mapped and monitored for biomass accumulation and carbon dioxide (CO2) flux using Landsat ETM images.																	0143-1161						2011	32	6					1561	1574		10.1080/01431160903573235								WOS:000288782500004

Using object-based analysis of image data to count birds: mapping of Lesser Flamingos at Kamfers Dam, Northern Cape, South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Knowing instantaneous locations and numbers of individuals in animal populations is a major requirement for wildlife and conservation ecology. Recent advances in very high spatial resolution digital-imaging systems and in object-based image-analysis methods offer great potential for developing remote sensing in new application arenas, including direct mapping and counting of birds, mammals and other larger organisms. We present the successful application of an automated object-based image-mapping strategy that has been applied to total mapping, using aerial image data, of Phoeniconaias minor (Lesser Flamingo) individuals at Kamfers Dam, a large perennial lake in central South Africa. The object-based method used quadtree image segmentation and sequential object-brightness thresholding to identify individual birds with high accuracy (>99% compared to human visual interpretation). Accuracy-assessment results are presented, with discussion of the error factors related to the object-based method and the reference data. An under-estimation by the object-based method of less than 0.5% is indicated. The automated procedure mapped 81 664 Lesser Flamingos at this one site, which is 30% above the most recent estimated size of the entire southern Africa Lesser Flamingo population, indicating a need for further work to reassess this population's size.

J	Gong, CF; Chen, JQ; Yu, SX				Gong, Chongfeng; Chen, Jiquan; Yu, Shixiao			Spatiotemporal dynamics of urban forest conversion through model urbanization in Shenzhen, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In southern coastal China, Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) was established as a model city by the government of mainland China in 1979 to demonstrate the competitive edge over Hong Kong across the straight. In less than three decades, Shenzhen has become a symbolic model city and changed from an agriculture-dominated landscape to a modern industrialization urban setting. The remote sensing approach for exploring historical land-cover change and landscape conversion paralleling a functional zone-based grid cellular analysis were used to examine the spatial-temporal changes of urban forest in Shenzhen from 1973 to 2009. Urban forest cover has been widely believed to decrease linearly and inversely to urban land regardless of spatial and temporal drivers, while our study demonstrated, in fact, that it presented as the nonlinear change with the development of the city and the transformations of underlying human demands and government's policy. Meanwhile, forest conversions over time also showed the spatial heterogeneity, which was caused by the discrepancy of urbanization range or intensity and related to both the geographical settings and socio-economic zonings of land use. In conclusion, this study revealed urbanization and its underlying biophysical and socio-economic factors could bring about the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban forest conversion (loss or gain), which affected ecosystem health and sustainable development, and reflected on the conservation management and the balance check on policy impacts on a society.

Contemporary fire regimes in a fragmented and an unfragmented landscape: implications for vegetation structure and persistence of the fire-sensitive malleefowl	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Habitat fragmentation alters fire regimes by changing the spatial and temporal context in which fire operates, potentially altering ecosystem state and threatening taxa. In the fragmented wheatbelt of Western Australia, spatial patterns of contemporary fire and their effects on biodiversity conservation are poorly understood. We addressed this by: (1) determining if fire regimes differed between vegetation remnants of differing sizes and uncleared vegetation, using analysis of satellite imagery; (2) determining vegetation structural responses to time since fire in three habitats: mallee-shrub, Acacia shrublands and mallee-heath; and (3) exploring the consequences of these differences, using the fire-sensitive malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) as a case study. Fire was infrequent in small remnants, more frequent in large remnants, and most frequent in uncleared areas. Key vegetation structural attributes for malleefowl, such as canopy and litter cover, increased beyond 45 years post-fire in mallee-shrub, reached a plateau in mallee-heath after 30-40 years, and declined in Acacia shrublands after 25-40 years. Senescence in long-unburnt vegetation, combined with rare contemporary fires, suggest progressive decline in habitat quality of Acacia shrublands for malleefowl in the wheatbelt. In the adjacent, continuously vegetated landscapes, more frequent (and extensive) fires in structurally developing mallee-shrub communities are of concern for malleefowl conservation.

Marine Geomorphology in the Design of Marine Reserve Networks	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Marine environments, key life-support systems for the earth, are under severe threat. Issues associated with managing these common property resources are complex and interrelated. Networks of marine reserves can be valuable for mitigating threats to marine systems, yet the successful design and implementation of such networks has been limited. Efficient ways to conserve marine environments are urgently needed. This Focus Section of The Professional Geographer explores the development of marine reserve networks based on geomorphology, fish biology, ecological connectivity, and appropriate governance. The articles in this Focus Section offer examples of the following: (1) distinctive reef geomorphology dictating the spawning locations of reef fishes, which in turn serve as critical source sites for the replenishment of distant reefs by means of larval transport; (2) an example of a simplified oceanographic model that predicts larval transport from fish breeding sites to important nursery areas; and (3) a case study of the development of a marine reserve network that illustrates key elements of a successful strategy. In sum, this Focus Section offers case studies that show the value of marine geomorphology, oceanographic connectivity, and stakeholder involvement as key elements of multidisciplinary geographic studies applied to the design of marine reserve networks. Geographers can further contribute to the conservation and management of coastal and marine ecosystems in many ways that involve subdisciplines of remote sensing and geographic information systems, political and economic geography, political ecology, and ethnography.

We explored the importance of different variables to predict habitat suitability for the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos Bechstein), a proposed umbrella species in deciduous forest. Specifically, we tested whether biophysical proxy variables indicating management intensity and the occurrence of natural processes constituted a useful complement to traditional remotely sensed data on tree species composition and forest stand age for modelling the woodpecker's habitat. Presence-absence of the woodpecker during the study period (1986-2006) in southwestern Sweden was explained by the area of edge habitats (forest bordering water or farmland) and wetland forest, and location relative to the historical marine limit. The number of years with occurrence of the woodpecker in a territory was explained by the area of forest bordering water and wetland forest. Among traditional forest variables, the area of deciduous forest had a strong positive effect on both woodpecker presence-absence and the number of years with occurrence. The results support the hypothesis that edge habitats and forest types subject to natural processes favouring deciduous trees and dead wood creation are valuable to the woodpecker and should be prioritised in conservation planning.

In this paper, from Huygens' principle and the extinction theorem, the SPM is used to derive the transmitted field to the second order, and expressions for the bidirectional transmission coefficient and the total surface transmittance to the second order are developed for the random rough surface. The refined expressions can be applied to the situations where the transmission characteristics of a random rough surface need to be more accurately calculated. For example, to calculate the brightness temperature of stratified rough media by the incoherent method, we have to know the bidirectional transmission coefficient or transmittance of random rough surface as accurately as possible. The accuracy of the presented expressions is verified through the conservation of energy. It is shown that the transmission characteristics calculated by SPM to the first order violate conservation of energy, whereas solutions to the second order conform to energy conservation much better. This is particularly important for the calculation of transmittance or emissivity.																	1745-5030						2011	21	4					668	689		10.1080/17455030.2011.626809								WOS:000299924300009

According to our data, the Comoro islands are inhabited by two amphibian species and at least 28 species of reptiles although ongoing genetic studies and unconfirmed historical records suggest an even higher species diversity. 14 of the 28 currently recognized species of terrestrial reptiles (50%) and the two amphibians are endemic to a single island or to the Comoro archipelago. The majority of species are most abundant at low elevation. However, a few endemic species, like the gekkonid lizards Paroedura sanctijohannis and Phelsuma nigristriata, are more common in or even confined to higher altitudes. We created habitat maps from remotely sensed data in combination with detailed species distribution maps produced using comprehensive data from field surveys between 2000 and 2010, literature, and historical locality records based on specimens in zoological collections. Using these data, we assessed the conservation status of the endemic terrestrial reptiles and amphibians according to the IUCN Red List criteria. Our results show that although little area of natural forest remains on the Comoros, many species are abundant in degraded forest or plantations. Competition and predation by invasive species appears to be the most important threat factor for the endemic herpetofauna, together with habitat degradation and destruction, which further favours invasive species. We propose the status Endangered for three species, Vulnerable for one species, Near Threatened for six species, Least Concern for four and Data Deficient for two species. The endemic subspecies Oplurus cuvieri comorensis is proposed for the status Critically Endangered. Based on the results of this study, seven areas of importance for reptile and amphibian conservation on the Comoros are identified. This study shows how remote sensing data can contribute to increasing accuracy and objectiveness of conservation assessments.																	1313-2989	1313-2970					2011		144					21	79		10.3897/zookeys.144.1648								WOS:000299592100002	22207785

A tool for rapid assessment of erosion risk to support decision-making and policy development at the Ngenge watershed in Uganda	GEODERMA												This study tests a rapid, user-friendly method for assessing changes in erosion risk, which yields information to aid policy development and decision-making for sustainable natural resources management. There is currently a lack of timely, up-to-date and current information to support policy development on sustainable natural resources management in Uganda. The study was carried out in the Ngenge watershed, a typical catchment in the Ugandan Highlands, characterised by deforestation in favour of subsistence agriculture without adequate soil and water conservation measures. The watershed is experiencing soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding problems which are threatening agricultural productivity and food security. Sustainable management of environmental resources is needed to ensure a livelihood for the rural population which is dependent on the land. Historical erosion risk was evaluated in three steps using multi-temporal satellite data. First, current erosion risk was assessed by combining slope and vegetation cover during periods of high intensity rainfall. The data used for the assessment was obtained from public (free) satellite images. Erosion risk was then linked to land use and finally to the change in vegetation cover over the years 1980-2000. The analysis of erosion risk using rainfall, slope and NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetative Index) as a proxy for vegetation cover gives an indication of the current erosion risk in the area. The results of historical vegetation cover change analysis indicate an overall increase in areas under erosion risk in the study area from 1980 to 2000. This method of erosion risk mapping provides a quick and straightforward means for identifying priority areas for interventions for soil and water resource management. Considering that resources are limited, the interventions to be appropriate have to be focused mainly on areas affected by degradation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of Fragmentation and Disturbance Patterns in Eastern Ghats: A Case Study in RV Nagar Range, Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												At present the biodiversity in Eastern Ghats is threatened by loss of habitats, exploitation and unscientific management of natural resources, forest fire, biological invasion and other anthropogenic pressures. In this context, we have assessed the forest cover changes, fragmentation and disturbance in the R.V. Nagar Range of Eastern Ghats region, Andhra Pradesh using satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques. Satellite data of IRS-1A LISS II of 1988 and IRS-P6 LISS III of 2006 were assessed for forest cover changes in 1 sq.km grid and generated as Sensitivity Index map. Further the road and settlement buffer of 1000 m was generated to represent Threat Index map. From 1988 to 2006, the forest cover had a total cover loss of 35.2 sq.km and increase in scrub cover by 7.2%. Over all change analysis from 1988 to 2006 with reference to forest cover indicates, negative changes (loss of forest area) accounted for 48.1 sq.km area and positive changes (gain of forest) for an area of 12.1 sq.km of area. The results of the change detection using multi-date satellite imagery suggest degradation in forest cover over two decades, which necessitates the conservation measures in this range with high priority.																	0255-660X					DEC	2010	38	4					633	639		10.1007/s12524-011-0077-3								WOS:000288560900007

People's perception and socioeconomic determinants of soil erosion: A case study of Samanalawewa watershed, Sri Lanka	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Though soil erosion is an important concern in Sri Lanka, there is a dearth of baseline information on soil erosion in many of its watersheds, which obstructs monitoring of soil erosion and mitigating its effects. In order to assess soil erosion in a critical watershed and to identify its determinants, the Samanalawewa watershed, which contains one of the main hydropower generating reservoirs in Sri Lanka, was selected for this study. Remote-sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) based modeling as well as field experiments were employed to assess and map soil erosion rates. Results indicated that the current rate of soil erosion ranges from 0 to 289 t/ha/yr, and that the average rate of soil erosion has been declining from 20 to 4 t/ha/yr over a period from 1986 to 2008. The current rate of soil erosion is, however, still about 14 to 33 times greater than the natural soil generation rate. Socioeconomic factors and peoples' perception of soil erosion and soil conservation measures were examined using data collected through a household survey. Multiple regression analysis with eighteen covariates of socioeconomic characteristics yielded eleven socioeconomic variables, viz. household size, farm labor, education, land tenure, conservation cost, training, committee membership, professional competencies, income, distance, and financial capital as the predictor variables of soil erosion. Farmers identified improper soil and crop management practices as the major causes of erosion. The adoption of conservation measures, their effectiveness, and their impact on ecosystem services were also examined.																	1001-6279					DEC	2010	25	4					323	339		10.1016/S1001-6279(11)60001-2								WOS:000286068100001						
J	DeFries, R; Karanth, KK; Pareeth, S				DeFries, Ruth; Karanth, Krithi K.; Pareeth, Sajid			Interactions between protected areas and their surroundings in human-dominated tropical landscapes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Protected areas (PAs) often depend on landscapes surrounding them to maintain flows of organisms, water, nutrients, and energy. Park managers have little authority over the surrounding landscape although land use change and infrastructure development can have major impacts on the integrity of a PA. The need for scientifically-based regional-scale land use planning around protected areas is acute in human-dominated landscapes to balance conservation goals with livelihood needs for fuelwood, fodder, and other ecosystem services. As a first step, we propose the designation of a "zone of interaction" (ZOI) around PAs that encompasses hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions between a PA and the surrounding landscape. We illustrate the concept by delineating the ZOI in three Indian PAs - Kanha, Ranthambore, and Nagarahole - using remote sensing, population census, and field data. The ZOI in Ranthambore is three times the size of the park and is largely defined by the socioeconomic interactions with surrounding villages. Ranthambore is located in headwaters and wildlife corridors are largely severed. In Nagarahole, the ZOI is more than seven times larger than the park and includes upstream watershed and elephant corridors. Kanha's ZOI is approximately four times larger than the park and is mostly defined by contiguous surrounding forest. The three examples highlight the differing extents of ZOIs when applying equivalent criteria, even though all are located in densely-populated landscapes. Quantitative understanding of which activities (e.g. collection of forest products, grazing, road construction, tourism development) and which locations within the ZOI are most crucial to conservation goals will enable improved land use planning around PAs in human-dominated landscapes.

Landscape-level effects on avifauna within tropical agriculture in the Western Ghats: Insights for management and conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A critical handicap to tropical biodiversity conservation efforts in agroecosystems is the unknowns regarding the influence of landscape-scale factors on the persistence of species. To address these uncertainties, we explored two essential landscape-scale questions, within India's biologically-rich Western Ghats, examining two nearby human-dominated landscapes that dramatically differed in their pattern of land cover. First, how does the proximity of intact forest patches affect bird community composition within agricultural landscapes? Second, can simple remote sensing-derived measures (brightness, wetness, and NDVI) be used to estimate native bird species composition within those landscapes? In both landscapes, as distance to intact forest decreased, the similarity in bird community composition between agricultural areas and intact forest increased. This suggests that the retention of tropical forest bird communities within human-dominated landscapes critically depends on the maintenance of nearby intact forest. In an answer to the second question, the remote sensing measures correlated with forest-affiliated avian species richness in only one of the two landscapes, reflecting an ecological difference between the two in the response of forest bird species to local agricultural conditions. In the landscape where a correlation was found, there was high variation in vegetative structure, which strongly impacted both the remote sensing measures and forest bird species richness. In the other landscape, forest species richness strongly correlated with changes in tree species composition in the agriculture, a factor that could not be detected by the remote sensing metrics. In order to successfully conserve biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes, our findings show that it is essential to conserve intact forest within those landscapes and to understand the effect of local agricultural practices on species.

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In India, conservation of biodiversity goes hand in hand with human welfare, as millions of people live adjacent or within protected areas and depend upon forests products. The high density and biomass requirements of these households could result in the degradation of forests and loss of biodiversity. We assessed the collection of forest products among households in five sites in the Western and Eastern Ghats of peninsular India: the Kogar region of the Central Western Ghats, the Bandipur and Sigur regions of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of the southern Western Ghats and Similipal Tiger Reserve of the northern Eastern Ghats, and tested whether extraction pressure on forests was associated with the proportion of agricultural households, wage labour and population density. We also examined whether data on loss of cover as stated by the State of the Forest Reports was supported by field data. The regions differed in land use: Kogar, KMTR and Similipal were primarily agricultural regions, whereas households engaged in wage labour or in running small businesses were predominant in Sigur and Bandipur. Fuel-wood was collected ubiquitously for household use in all sites, used mainly for domestic requirements and secondarily for generating income. Green leaves for making fertilizer and fodder were collected for household use and did not enter the market. Cattle manure for the global organic coffee industry was a major forest product in Bandipur and Sigur. Extraction pressure on forests was positively associated with the availability of wage labour and was negatively with the proportion of agricultural households. Data from official sources seem inadequate to measure forest degradation in protected forests. Accurate estimation of forest condition through field assessments and remote sensing, and understanding the socio-economic variables associated with forest loss and degradation are needed for the sustainable management of Indian protected areas.

Cryptic destruction of India's native forests	CONSERVATION LETTERS												India sustains some of the world's most imperiled forests. The Forest Survey of India recently announced that forest cover in India had expanded by nearly 5% over the past decade. This result, while technically accurate, is misleading. The Forest Survey estimates forest cover by using automated algorithms to analyze satellite imagery-an approach that fails to distinguish native forests from tree plantations, which are often monocultures of exotic species that have limited value for endangered biodiversity. Since the early 1990s, tree plantations have expanded in India at an estimated rate of roughly 15,400 km2/year. Subtracting plantations from total forest cover shows that native forests in India have declined by 1.5%-2.7% per year. The limited precision of our estimate highlights a paucity of data on native forest cover in India-a problem requiring urgent attention. Forest cutting for fuelwood has been the biggest driver of forest loss and thinning in India. Like India, many nations now rely on satellite imagery to discern changes in vegetation cover, and these frequently lump native, exotic, and degraded forest types. Without sufficiently high-resolution imagery and adequate safeguards, such approaches could paint a misleading picture of the fate of the world's native forests.

Multifractals, with which more detailed information can be obtained from a distribution than mono-fractal does, is especially suited to the description of complex patterns. In our paper, three sites (256 x 256 cells per site, 100 m per cell) from the upper, middle and lower reaches of Yanhe watershed in the Loess Plateau were selected to test the scaling properties of agricultural landscape patterns in 1980, 2000 and 2006 using multifractal Renyi dimensions analysis. We found that: (1) the distributions of cropland, grassland and woodland patterns are multiscaling over nearly four orders of magnitude in scale, whereas water bodies and residential areas are not multifractally distributed, which may result from the resolution of Landsat TM remote sensing images; (2) spatially, the multifractal techniques are capable to uncover subtle differences in land use patterns between different reaches of the watershed that could correspond to their distinct, underlying abiotic and biotic processes; and (3) temporally, the multifractal spectra demonstrate little difference between 1980 and 2000 but a sharp change in 2006, the former depicting the land use patterns in an equilibrium state and the latter the effect of government policies such as large-scale eco-environment conservation programmes starting in the late 20th century. The fact that scaling behaviors exist across a heterogeneous landscape suggests that there may be some simple mechanism that governs agricultural landscape change. Further work on this problem may improve our understanding of the mechanism and enhance our capability to more effectively manage land use. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In long-lived species with deferred sexual maturity this period may last several years, making this process crucial for their survival and conservation. Here we present a large-scale outline of juvenile Bonelli's eagle's dispersal areas in the Iberian Peninsula. We describe the ranging and movement patterns of 14 juvenile Bonelli's eagles during their dispersal period, studied by satellite telemetry. Three distinct phases during the juveniles' first year of life were detected, namely, the dependence period, the departure from the parental territory, and the settlement in dispersal areas. In general, between-sex differences in relation to ranging behavior were not significant. Interestingly, there seems not to be a few, clearly delimited, overlapping Bonelli's eagle's juvenile dispersal areas within the Iberian Peninsula. A total of 17 dispersal areas were detected, with some animals using more than one. These areas were located in eight autonomous communities (Spanish administrative units), being the most important Castilla-La Mancha and Andalucia. Juveniles were more frequently located in cultivated man-managed areas, with non-irrigated herbaceous crops. This is probably due to higher prey availability and higher efficiency in prey capture in these open areas, as well as to the absence of breeding pairs. This has important management implications, suggesting that conservation efforts should focus on the whole landscape matrix of man-managed ecosystems rather than in a few clearly delimited geographic areas.

A logistic radial basis function regression method for discrimination of cover crops in olive orchards	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Olive (Olea europaea L.) is the main perennial Spanish crop. Soil management in olive orchards is mainly based on intensive and tillage operations, which have a great relevancy in terms of negative environmental impacts. Due to this reason, the European Union (EU) only subsidizes cropping systems which require the implementation of conservation agro-environmental techniques such as cover crops between the rows. Remotely sensed data could offer the possibility of a precise follow-up of presence of cover crops to control these agrarian policy actions, but firstly, it is crucial to explore the potential for classifying variations in spectral signatures of olive trees, bare soil and cover crops using field spectroscopy. In this paper, we used hyperspectral signatures of bare soil, olive trees, and sown and dead cover crops taken in spring and summer in two locations to evaluate the potential of two methods (MultiLogistic regression with Initial and Radial Basis Function covariates, MLIRBF; and SimpleLogistic regression with Initial and Radial Basis Function covariates, SLIRBF) for classifying them in the 400-900 nm spectrum. These methods are based on a MultiLogistic regression model formed by a combination of linear and radial basis function neural network models. The estimation of the coefficients of the model is carried out basically in two phases. First, the number of radial basis functions and the radii and centres' vector are determined by means of an evolutionary neural network algorithm. A maximum likelihood optimization method determines the rest of the coefficients of a MultiLogistic regression with a set of covariates that include the initial variables and the radial basis functions previously estimated. Finally, we apply forward step-wise techniques of structural simplification. We compare the performance of these methods with robust classification methods: Logistic Regression without covariate selection, MLogistic; Logistic Regression with covariate selection, SLogistic; Logistic Model Trees algorithm (LMT); the C4.5 induction tree; Naive Bayesian tree algorithm (NBTree); and boosted C4.5 trees using AdaBoost.M1 with 10 and 100 boosting iterations. MLIRBF and SLIRBF models were the best discriminant functions in classifying sown or dead cover crops from olive trees and bare soil in both locations and seasons by using a seven-dimensional vector with green (575 nm), red (600, 625, 650 and 675 nm), and near-infrared (700 and 725 nm) wavelengths as input variables. These models showed a correct classification rate between 95.56% and 100% in both locations and seasons. These results suggest that mapping covers crops in olive trees could be feasible by the analysis of high resolution airborne imagery acquired in spring or summer for monitoring the presence or absence of cover crops by the EU or local administrations in order to make the decision on conceding or not the subsidy.

Large-Area Classification and Mapping of Forest and Land Cover in the Brazilian Amazon: A Comparative Analysis of ALOS/PALSAR and Landsat Data Sources	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Information on the distribution of tropical forests is critical to decision-making on a host of globally significant issues ranging from climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation to poverty reduction and human health. The majority of tropical nations need high-resolution, satellite-based maps of their forests as the international community now works to craft an incentive-based mechanism to compensate tropical nations for maintaining their forests intact. The effectiveness of such a mechanism will depend in large part on the capacity of current and near-future Earth observation satellites to provide information that meets the requirements of international monitoring protocols now being discussed. Here we assess the ability of a state-of-the-art satellite radar sensor, the ALOS/PALSAR, to support large-area land cover classification as well as high-resolution baseline mapping of tropical forest cover. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis involving twenty separate PALSAR-and Landsat-based classifications, we confirm the potential of PALSAR as an accurate (>90%) source for spatially explicit estimates of forest cover based on data and analyses from a large and diverse region encompassing the Xingu River headwaters in southeastern Amazonia. Pair-wise spatial comparisons among maps derived from PALSAR, Landsat, and PRODES, the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring program, revealed a high degree of spatial similarity. Given that a long-term data record consisting of current and future spaceborne radar sensors is now expected, our results point to the important role that spaceborne imaging radar can play in complementing optical remote sensing to enable the design of robust forest monitoring systems.																	1939-1404					DEC	2010	3	4	2				594	604		10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2076398								WOS:000285357400005

Inundation and resettlement have induced far-reaching land use and land cover change (LUCC). The areas that are affected by measures of resettlement are in a tense situation between the implementation of various governmental tasks addressing sustainable land use and water retention and the fulfilment of the population's economic needs, which primarily depend on agricultural production. Destabilization of slopes and soil erosion are immediate hazards induced by the impoundment. Farming is a very important source of income and has to persist on the one hand to assure the income of the rural population. On the other hand, the environment has to be protected from runoff, soil erosion and instabilities connected to relief, geology and hydraulic influences. In this study, supervised classifications are performed using Landsat-TM (1987 and 2007) and ASTER (2007) images. LUCC is assessed by post-classification change analysis. On the catchment scale, arable land has decreased significantly, while garden land (citrus orchards) and woodland have increased. LUCC mainly affects the area surrounding the reservoir ("backwater") of the Xiangxi (e broken vertical bar (TM) ae(0a)) River, driven by local resettlement, newly built infrastructure, relocation of land cultivation, and conversion of arable land to garden land. In the hinterland, LUCC occurs in form of abandonment of land cultivation as a consequence of the Grain-for-Green programme.

Combining remote sensing and household level data for regional scale analysis of land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Land cover change in the Brazilian Amazon depends on the spatial variability of political, socioeconomic and biophysical factors, as well as on the land use history and its actors. A regional scale analysis was made in Rondnia State to identify possible differences in land cover change connected to spatial policies of land occupation, size and year of establishment of properties, accessibility measures and soil fertility. The analysis was made based on remote sensing data and household level data gathered with a questionnaire. Both types of analyses indicate that the highest level of total deforestation is found inside agrarian projects, especially in those established more than 20 years ago. Even though deforestation rates are similar inside and outside official settlements, inside agrarian projects forest depletion can exceed 50% at the property level within 10-14 years after establishment. The data indicate that both small-scale and medium to large-scale farmers contribute to deforestation processes in Rondnia State encouraged by spatial policies of land occupation, which provide better accessibility to forest fringes where soil fertility and forest resources are important determinants of location choice.

Use of high-resolution satellite imagery in an integrated model to predict the distribution of shade coffee tree hybrid zones	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In New Caledonia (21 S, 165 E), shade-grown coffee plantations were abandoned for economic reasons in the middle of the 20th century. Coffee species (Coffee arabica, C canephora and C liberica) were introduced from Africa in the late 19th century, they survived in the wild and spontaneously cross-hybridized. Coffee species were originally planted in native forest in association with leguminous trees (mostly introduced species) to improve their growth. Thus the canopy cover over rustic shade coffee plantations is heterogeneous with a majority of large crowns, attributed to leguminous trees. The aim of this study was to identify suitable areas for coffee inter-specific hybridization in New Caledonia using field based environmental parameters and remotely sensed predictors. Due to the complex structure of tropical vegetation, remote sensing imagery needs to be spatially accurate and to have the appropriate bands for monitoring vegetation cover. Quickbird panchromatic (black and white) imagery at 0.6 to 0.7 m spatial resolutions and multispectral imagery at 2.4 m spatial resolution were pansharpened and used for this study. The two most suitable remotely sensed indicators, canopy heterogeneity and tree crown size, were acquired by the sequential use of tree crown detection (neural network), image processing (such as textural analysis) and classification. All models were supervised and trained on learning data determined by human expertise. The final model has two remotely sensed indicators and three physical parameters based on the Digital Elevation Model: elevation, slope and water flow accumulation. Using these five predictive variables as inputs, two modelling methods, a decision tree and a neural network, were implemented. The decision tree, which showed 96.9% accuracy on the test set, revealed the involvement of ecological parameters in the hybridization of Coffea species. We showed that hybrid zones could be characterized by combinations of modalities, underlining the complexity of the environment concerned. For instance, forest heterogeneity and large crown size, steep slopes (>53.5%) and elevation between 194 and 429 m asl, are favourable factors for Coffea inter-specific hybridization. The application of the neural network on the whole area gave a predictive map that distinguished the most suitable areas by means of a nonlinear continuous indicator. The map provides a confidence level for each area. The most favourable areas were geographically localized, providing a clue for the detection and conservation of favourable areas for Coffea species neo-diversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

An original non-parametric image interpretation methodology was applied on late summer images. The combined GIS and statistical analysis of 217 coastal sections showed that the helophytic macrophyte belt, dominated by common reed (Phragmites australis), has rapidly widened during the last two decades, with an average expansion rate of 2.2 m per year. Statistical model revealed that the vicinity of large inflows had the strongest positive effect on the expansion of macrophytes, on average 1.6 times. In some sub-regions of the lake shore, we found the suppressing effect of the presence of small inflows on the change of helophytic belt width. This effect, however, was probably interconnected with the presence of human activity at the shoreline, which itself had statistically near-marginal suppressing effect on the widening of the reed belt. We showed that medium resolution satellite images can successfully be used for the retrospective monitoring of macrophyte vegetation in the littoral zone of large water bodies by applying very simple image classification methodology. As the lake coastal areas showed a tendency to become overgrown with reed and other macrophytes even in conditions of generally reduced agricultural intensity in the catchment area, we hypothesize that the clonal expansion of reed is probably triggered by the complex of drivers: large seasonal fluctuations in the water level create specific low water conditions in estuaries in combination with nutrients supply resolved from lake bottom or brought by rivers. Estuary areas are characterised by mineral sediments suitable for anchoring and protection-provision against destructive wave- and ice-action. Probably the most efficient biodiversity conservation policy to revealed macrophytic expansion is the reactivation of disrupted management activities along the coastline. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.

The importance of fine-scale savanna heterogeneity for reptiles and small mammals	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Tropical savannas are an important reservoir of global biodiversity. Australia's extensive savannas, although still largely intact, are experiencing substantial declines in terrestrial biodiversity due to a variety of interrelated effects of altered fire regimes, grazing and increases in invasive species. These disturbance processes are spatially variable, combine to increase landscape to local-scale landscape heterogeneity, but rarely result in well-defined patch boundaries. We quantified the importance of this heterogeneity for native reptile and small mammal species in a tropical savanna landscape of Queensland, Australia. We used high resolution remote sensing imagery (IKONOS) to map habitat pattern at a 4 m spatial resolution and at variable extents. We found that landscapes dominated by grass or bare ground had low reptile and small mammal diversity, while landscapes with a heterogeneous mix of grass, bare ground and trees had high species diversity and relative abundance of most species. Landscape heterogeneity may increase reptile and small mammal species richness by: (i) increasing the variety and abundance of foraging resources such as seeds and invertebrates; (ii) providing cover from predators and high summer temperatures; and (iii) increasing functional connectivity and dispersal success. The importance of these resources and processes varies among individual species and at different spatial scales, reiterating the need to consider habitat requirements of multiple species in landscape management and conservation planning.

Habitat fragmentation and the desiccation of forest canopies: A case study from eastern Amazonia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Across the deforestation frontier in eastern Amazonia, we examined the relationship between edge-related forest desiccation and deforestation patterns using remote-sensing techniques. Canopy-moisture levels were estimated over an eight-year period in three study sites that encompassed similar to 100,000 km(2) in area. We found four main effects of deforestation on dry-season canopy desiccation. First, intact forests showed no detectable change in canopy water content whereas forests adjacent to clearings showed significant water loss. Second, the distance to which edge-related desiccation penetrated into forest interiors varied among landscapes with differing forest loss and fragmentation. In moderately fragmented landscapes (with 65% and 51% remaining forest cover), canopy desiccation extended 1-1.5 km into forest interiors, whereas in heavily fragmented landscapes (20% forest cover) desiccation penetrated up to 2.7 km into forests. Third, the magnitude of edge-related desiccation varied among landscapes with differing fragmentation. Moderately fragmented landscapes exhibited a greater magnitude of change in canopy-water loss over the first 1 km from an edge than did heavily fragmented landscapes. Finally, forest desiccation penetrated further into forests over time in the moderately fragmented landscapes, but not in the heavily fragmented landscape, where edge-related desiccation had evidently 'saturated' remaining forests. We conclude that protracted dry seasons will have far more serious effects on fragmented than intact rainforests, with the former becoming highly vulnerable to destructive fires.

Ecotourism Impacts in the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH												Ecotourism promotes responsible travel to natural areas, environmental conservation and the well-being of local communities. Eco-lodges are an important component of ecotourism ventures but an infrequently researched component of this field. Considering their influence on the natural environment (design and operation) and local communities (employment practices and purchases), the success of ecotourism depends, in part, on the performance of eco-lodges. This project studies the effects of the Punta Islita (PI) eco-lodge on the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. An interdisciplinary nested-scale analysis, combining guest and household interviews with multi-temporal remote sensing analysis of forest cover change of the lodge and surrounding areas, is used to evaluate the environmental, economic and social impacts of ecotourism in the region. Our results show significant positive contributions of the PI eco-lodge on forest cover, environmental conservation, and local economic incomes within the surrounding communities. For local livelihoods, the PI eco-lodge was seen as having positive social, cultural and economic impacts for nearly all societal variables for both employees and their neighbours. The PI eco-lodge was also perceived as reducing alcoholism, drug addiction and prostitution, where conventional tourism on the Peninsula was shown to increase these 'societal ills'. Land value and product pricing were the few variables believed to have increased as a result of tourism on the Peninsula. For conservation, the PI eco-lodge property had the highest rates of reforestation within the Nicoya Peninsula and remains the scale most reforested in both forest cover change and total forest cover. In fact, at the landscape scale, we find that the Pacific coast of the Nicoya, where the bulk of ecotourism occurs, has undergone reforestation, whereas forest interiors have been deforested. Historically, reforestation occurred as cattle ranching credit programs were halted by the government and households in the area left to find better job opportunities. The PI eco-lodge, as a source of good employment, resulted in worker migration back to the surrounding area, resulting, in some cases, in increased deforestation. Overall, we feel that the PI eco-lodge serves as an example of successful ecotourism. However, increasing development in the region, in particular by standard hotel operations and large condo developments, seeks to capitalise on the region's natural beauty and may reverse land cover trends if they are not accompanied by adequate forest conservation strategies and stresses the importance of monitoring and assessing the impacts of accommodations tied to nature-based tourism operations.

These deficiencies were addressed in a multidisciplinary study of cyclone impacts on Abore Reef, New-Caledonia. Local knowledge, high thematic-resolution maps, and time-series satellite imagery complemented classical in situ monitoring methods. Field survey stations were selected from examination of pre- and post-cyclone images and their post-cyclone coral communities documented in terms of substrata, coral morphologies, live coral cover, and taxonomy. Time-series maps of hierarchically defined coral communities created at spatial scales documenting the variability among communities (29-45 classes) and suggesting the processes that affected them. The increased spatial coverage and repeatability of this approach significantly improved the recognition and interpretation of coral communities' spatio-temporal variability. It identified precise locations of impacted areas and those exhibiting coral recovery and resilience. The approach provides a comprehensive suite of information on which to base reef-scale conservation actions. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several quality review papers have contributed to this field. However, these papers often discuss the issues from the standpoint of an ecologist or a biodiversity specialist. This review focuses on the spaceborne remote sensing of EBC from the perspective of remote sensing specialists, i.e., it is organized in the context of state-of-the-art remote sensing technology, including instruments and techniques. Herein, the instruments to be discussed consist of high spatial resolution, hyperspectral, thermal infrared, small-satellite constellation, and LIDAR sensors; and the techniques refer to image classification, vegetation index (VI), inversion algorithm, data fusion, and the integration of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS).																	1424-8220					NOV	2010	10	11					9647	9667		10.3390/s101109647								WOS:000284578200008	22163432					
J	Mondal, P; Southworth, J				Mondal, Pinki; Southworth, Jane			Evaluation of conservation interventions using a cellular automata-Markov model	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The field of biodiversity conservation increasingly recognizes the need for empirical evaluations of conservation interventions. While the amount of money invested into conservation and the number of protected areas across the globe have been increasing in the past few decades, few well-designed empirical studies try to show what could have happened in the absence of the conservation efforts. In this paper, we propose an empirical method to evaluate such conservation intervention. We integrate a cellular automata-Markov modeling approach and a counterfactual approach showing what may have happened in the absence of a certain conservation intervention. We test this method in a human-dominated tropical landscape in Central India; however, our method is transferable to any other socio-ecological setting. The study area is located in the tropical forests of Central India and has witnessed several management strategies since its declaration as a protected area in the mid-1970s. However, landscape practitioners have identified the revised forest policy of 1988 to play a vital role in this landscape. We chose this particular forest policy as the conservation intervention in our study and tested our method using this landscape as a template. We used remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze multi-sensor satellite data from the last 30 years to monitor forest transitions and compare them with the counterfactual scenario. Our findings not only shed light on the importance of national-level policies in governing forest dynamics, but also established our proposed method as an effective tool for empirical evaluation of conservation intervention, particularly in developing countries.

However, only a current erosion status or a relative index cannot exactly identify priority area for conservation. The objective of this paper is to identify conservation priorities by a specific multicriteria evaluation method. Trends in erosion risk indicate regions of increasing erosion risk and are also chosen as one of the evaluation criteria to identify the priorities based on the instability of soil erosion in the Yongding river basin In this paper, vegetation cover, land-use. and slope gradient are used to assess erosion risk and trends in erosion risk are obtained by comparing the results of erosion risk between 2000 and 2006. Using this information, the priority conservation areas are graded into six levels The two highest priority levels cover the regions with severe erosion or a substantial recent increase in erosion risk (4722 56 km(2). or 11 82% of the study area), and are recommended as erosion control regions with appropriate conservation strategies. The middle two levels cover the regions with stable erosion status or slight change, needing only minor measures.

Dynamics of Moroccan High Atlas Mountain forests using remote sensing and vegetation analysis	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												On the south shore of the western Mediterranean Basin, mountain forest ecosystems are degraded, mainly due to their overexploitation. Topographic, edaphic and climatic conditions create stressful growing conditions and sensitive ecosystems. Nonetheless, in these ecosystems, forests remain an important resource for the subsistence of local populations. Historically the vulnerability of this resource has prompted mankind to establish traditional control forms of forest and pastoral areas. These common resource management systems are still functioning in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains under the name of agdal which refers to the territory, the resources and access rules laid down by the local population in order to manage the territory. The estimation of land cover changes was a suitable method to evaluate the effectiveness of these community-based systems for forest conservation. In this paper we highlight the impact of this traditional management on woodland dynamics in a mountainous area (Nit Bouguemez Valley) through the use of remote sensing approaches, associated with forest structure characterisation and the analysis of social mechanisms. A diachronic analysis based on the comparison of aerial photographs (dated 1964) with a recent Spot 5 satellite image (from 2002, 2.5 m resolution) was performed. Estimation of changes in canopy cover percentage was achieved using a graphic chart as a base for the photo-interpretation, and a subsequent validation by field sampling. A map of canopy cover changes between 1964 and 2002 was produced. Ecological measurements of trees were also achieved on field plots. The results indicate that in the past 38 years, forest ecosystems have been affected by a relative decrease of 20.7% of the total forest area, and 8.7% for the mean canopy cover percentage. However, strong disparities in forest dynamics arose according to the agdal or non-agdal status of the forest. Significant progression in canopy cover is noted in controlled agdal areas but large degradation has occurred outside. Regarding the stand ecological conditions, we observed significant differences in the stand structure, according to the management mode. We suggest through this study increased recognition of customary forest regulations, which may be adapted and extrapolated to other communities. However, from an ecological point of view, the agdal system alone is not sufficient to reach a viable management mode in the long term. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pacheco, A; McNairn, H				Pacheco, Anna; McNairn, Heather			Evaluating multispectral remote sensing and spectral unmixing analysis for crop residue mapping	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Tillage practices can affect the long term sustainability of agricultural soils as well as a variety of soil processes that impact the environment. Crop residue retention is considered a soil conservation practice given that it reduces soil losses from water and wind erosion and promotes sequestration of carbon in the soil. Spectral unmixing estimates the fractional abundances of surface targets at a sub-pixel level and this technique could be helpful in mapping and monitoring residue cover. This study evaluated the accuracy with which spectral unmixing estimated percent crop residue cover using multispectral Landsat and SPOT data. Spectral unmixing produced crop residue estimates with root mean square errors of 17.29% and 20.74%, where errors varied based on residue type. The model performed best when estimating corn and small grain residue. Errors were higher on soybean fields, due to the lower spectral contrast between soil and soybean residue. Endmember extraction is a critical step to successful unmixing. Small gains in accuracy were achieved when using the purest crop residue- and soil-specific endmembers as inputs to the spectral unmixing model. To assist with operational implementation of crop residue monitoring, a simple endmember extraction technique is described.

Rural property size drives patterns of upland and riparian forest retention in a tropical deforestation frontier	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia accounts for a disproportionate global scale fraction of both carbon emissions from biomass burning and biodiversity erosion through habitat loss. Here we use field- and remote-sensing data to examine the effects of private landholding size on the amount and type of forest cover retained within economically active rural properties in an aging southern Amazonian deforestation frontier. Data on both upland and riparian forest cover from a survey of 300 rural properties indicated that 49.4% (SD = 29.0%) of the total forest cover was maintained as of 2007. and that property size is a key regional-scale determinant of patterns of deforestation and land-use change. Small properties (<= 150 ha) retained a lower proportion of forest (20.7%, SD = 17.6) than did large properties (>150 ha; 55.6%, SD = 27.2). Generalized linear models showed that property size had a positive effect on remaining areas of both upland and total forest cover. Using a Landsat time-series, the age of first clear-cutting that could be mapped within the boundaries of each property had a negative effect on the proportion of upland, riparian, and total forest cover retained. Based on these data, we show contrasts in land-use strategies between smallholders and largeholders, as well as differences in compliance with legal requirements in relation to minimum forest cover set-asides within private landholdings. This suggests that property size structure must be explicitly considered in landscape-scale conservation planning initiatives guiding agro-pastoral frontier expansion into remaining areas of tropical forest.

In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.

Statistical modelling of habitat suitability is an important tool for planning conservation interventions, particularly for areas where species distribution data are expensive or hard to collect. Sometimes however the predictor variables typically used in habitat suitability modelling are themselves difficult to obtain or not meaningful at the geographical extent of the study, as is the case for the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis, a critically endangered lemur confined to the marshes of Lake Alaotra in Madagascar. 2. We developed a habitat suitability model where all predictor variables, including vegetation indices and image texture measures at different scales (as surrogates for habitat structure), were derived from Landsat7 satellite imagery. Using relatively few presence records, the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach and AUC were used to assess the performance of candidate predictor variables, for studying the effect of scale, model selection and mapping suitable habitat. 3. This study demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery as a single source of predictor variables for a Maxent habitat suitability model at the landscape level, within a restricted geographical extent and with a fine grain, in a case where predictor variables typically used at the macro-scale level (e.g. climatic and topographic) were not applicable. 4. In the case of H. alaotrensis, the methodology generated a habitat suitability map to inform conservation management in Lake Alaotra and a replicable protocol to allow rapid updates to habitat suitability maps in the future. The exploration of candidate predictor variables allowed the identification of scales that appear ecologically relevant for the species. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study presents a cost-effective combination of maximum entropy habitat suitability modelling and satellite imagery, where all predictor variables are derived solely from Landsat7 images. With a habitat modelling method like Maxent that shows good performance with few presence samples and Landsat images now freely available, the methodology can play an important role in rapid assessments of the status of species at the landscape level in data-poor regions, when typical macro-scale environmental predictors are of little use or difficult to obtain.

Their protection and restoration have been one of the top environmental management priorities across the US over the last several years. Despite the level of concern, visibility and management effort, little is known about trends in riparian habitats. Moreover, little is known about whether or not cumulative efforts to restore and protect riparian zones and floodplains are affecting the rates of riparian habitat change nationwide. To address these issues, we analyzed riparian land cover change between the early 1970s and the late 1990s/early 2000s using existing spatial data on hydrography and land cover. This included an analysis of land cover changes within 180 m riparian buffer zones, and at catchment scales, for 42,363 catchments across 63 ecoregions of the continental US. The total amount of forest and natural land cover (forests, shrublands, wetlands) in riparian buffers declined by 0.7 and 0.9%, respectively across the entire study period. Gains in grassland/shrubland accounted for the 0.2% lower percentage of total natural land cover loss relative to forests. Conversely, urban and developed land cover (urban, agriculture, and mechanically disturbed lands) increased by more than 1.3% within riparian buffers across the entire study period. Despite these changes, we documented an opposite trend of increasing proportions of natural and forest land cover in riparian buffers versus the catchment scale. We surmise that this trend might reflect a combination of natural recovery and cumulative efforts to protect riparian ecosystems across the US. However, existing models limit our ability to assess the impacts of these changes on specific ecosystem services. We discuss the implications of changes observed in this study on the sustainability of ecosystem services. We also recommend opportunties for future riparian change assessments.																	0921-2973					OCT	2010	25	8					1261	1275		10.1007/s10980-010-9510-1								WOS:000281725700010

Motion analysis in oceanographic satellite images using multiscale methods and the energy cascade	PATTERN RECOGNITION												Motion analysis of complex signals is a particularly important and difficult topic, as classical Computer Vision and Image Processing methodologies, either based on some extended conservation hypothesis or regularity conditions, may show their inherent limitations. An important example of such signals are those coming from the remote sensing of the oceans. In those signals, the inherent complexities of the acquired phenomenon (a fluid in the regime of fully developed turbulence-FDT) are made even more fraught through the alterations coming from the acquisition process (sun glint, haze, missing data etc.). The importance of understanding and computing vector fields associated to motion in the oceans or in the atmosphere (e.g.: cloud motion) raises some fundamental questions and the need for derivating motion analysis and understanding algorithms that match the physical characteristics of the acquired signals. Among these questions, one of the most fundamental is to understand what classical methodologies (e.g.: such as the various implementations of the optical flow) are missing, and how their drawbacks can be mitigated. In this paper, we show that the fundamental problem of motion evaluation in complex and turbulent acquisitions can be tackled using new multiscale characterizations of transition fronts. The use of appropriate paradigms coming from Statistical Physics can be combined with some specific Signal Processing evaluation of the microcanonical cascade associated to turbulence. This leads to radically new methods for computing motion fields in these signals. These methods are first assessed on the results of a 3D oceanic circulation model, and then applied on real data.

A framework for mapping vegetation over broad spatial extents: A technique to aid land management across jurisdictional boundaries	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Mismatches in boundaries between natural ecosystems and land governance units often complicate an ecosystem approach to management and conservation. For example, information used to guide management, such as vegetation maps, may not be available or consistent across entire ecosystems. This study was undertaken within a single biogeographic region (the Murray Mallee) spanning three Australian states. Existing vegetation maps could not be used as vegetation classifications differed between states. Our aim was to describe and map 'tree mallee' vegetation consistently across a 104 000 km(2) area of this region. Hierarchical cluster analyses, incorporating floristic data from 713 sites, were employed to identify distinct vegetation types. Neural network classification models were used to map these vegetation types across the region, with additional data from 634 validation sites providing a measure of map accuracy. Four distinct vegetation types were recognised: Triodia Mallee, Heathy Mallee, Chenopod Mallee and Shrubby Mallee. Neural network models predicted the occurrence of three of them with 79% accuracy. Validation results identified that map accuracy was 67% (kappa = 0.42) when using independent data. The framework employed provides a simple approach to describing and mapping vegetation consistently across broad spatial extents. Specific outcomes include: (1) a system of vegetation classification suitable for use across this biogeographic region; (2) a consistent vegetation map to inform land-use planning and biodiversity management at local and regional scales; and (3) a quantification of map accuracy using independent data. This approach is applicable to other regions facing similar challenges associated with integrating vegetation data across jurisdictional boundaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, widespread and consistent data on the productivity of species-specific and total salmon stocks in a river are almost nonexistent. Ranking rivers based on physical complexity derived from remote sensing allows rivers to be objectively compared. Our approach considered rivers with great geomorphic complexity (e.g. having expansive, multichanneled floodplains and/or on-channel lakes) as likely to have greater productivity of salmon than rivers flowing in constrained or canyon-bound channels. Our objective was to develop a database of landscape metrics that could be used to rank the rivers in relation to potential salmon productivity. We then examined the rankings in relation to existing empirical (monitoring) data describing productivity of salmon stocks. To extract the metrics for each river basin we used a digital elevation model and multispectral satellite imagery. We developed procedures to extract channel networks, floodplains, on-channel lakes and other catchment features; variables such as catchment area, channel elevation, main channel length, floodplain area, and density of hydrojunctions (nodes) were measured. We processed 1509 catchments in the North Pacific Rim including the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia and western North America. Overall, catchments were most physically complex in western Kamchatka and western Alaska, and particularly on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska. We could not directly examine coherence between potential and measured productivity except for a few rivers, but the expected relationship generally held. The resulting database and systematic ranking are objective tools that can be used to address questions about landscape structure and biological productivity at regional to continental extents, and provide a way to begin to efficiently prioritize the allocation of funding and resources towards salmon management and conservation.

Application of Landscape Ecology and Remote Sensing for Assessment, Monitoring and Conservation of Biodiversity	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Landscape ecology, inter alia, addresses the question as to how altered landscape patterns affect the distribution, persistence, and abundance of a species. Landscape ecology plays an important role in integrating the different scales of biodiversity from habitat patch to biome level. Satellite remote sensing technology with multi-sensor capabilities offers multi-scale information on landscape composition and configuration. Advances in geospatial analytical tools and spatial statistics have improved the capability to quantify spatial heterogeneity. Globally, landscape level characterization of biodiversity has become an important discipline of science. Considering the vast extent, heterogeneity, and ecological and economic importance of forest landscapes, significant efforts have been made in India during the past decade to strengthen landscape level biodiversity characterization. The generic frame work of studies comprises preparation of national databases providing information on composition and configuration of different landscapes using multi-scale remote sensing techniques, understanding the landscape patterns using geospatial models to elicit disturbance and diversity patterns and application of this information for bioprospecting and conservation purposes. Studies on hierarchical linkage of multi-scale information to study the processes of change, landscape function, dynamics of habitat fragmentation, invasion, development of network of conservation areas based on the understanding of multi-species responses to landscape mosaics, macro-ecological studies to understand environment and species richness, habitat and species transitions and losses, landscape level solutions to adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change are a few of the future challenges. The paper presents the current experiences and, analyses in conjunction with international scenario and identifies future challenges of Indian landscape level biodiversity studies.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					365	385		10.1007/s12524-010-0033-7								WOS:000288426800001

Patterns of Fragmentation and Identification of Possible Corridors in North Western Ghats	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Fragmentation leads to the loss of connectivity among forested landscapes, which is important for biological conservation and biodiversity maintenance. Fragmentation analysis carried out on 20 years time interval in northern-Western Ghats revealed that, losses under moderate and high fragmented forests have decreased from 1985-87 to 2005; however, it is not enough to compensate the loss of intact forests (not fragmented). The area of dense forests in intact forests has decreased from 1985-87 to 2005, this essentially means the loss of quality habitat in the area. While investigating connectivity between fragmented patches by taking different topographical and ecological parameters into the consideration, it was observed that potential connectivity exists between protected areas present in northern and southern areas.

Assessment and Validation of Biological Richness at Landscape Level in part of the Himalayas and Indo-Burma Hotspots using Geospatial Modeling Approach	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Validation is a necessary step for model acceptance and is defined as a comparison of the model's predictions with real world to determine whether the model is suitable for its intended purpose. We have validated the biological richness index for three states generated in 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level' project under the aegis of Department of Biotechnology and Department of Space of the Government of India. Biological Richness (BR) index, described elsewhere as a cumulative property of ecological habitats and surroundings; was analyzed as an integrated 'three-tier modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis. For validation, we categorized the field plots into 10-groups corresponding to 10-levels of BR using data splitting technique using their GPS-recorded positional information. In general, the number of tree, shrub and liana species and mean BA demonstrated a decreasing trend with lowering of BR for all three states falling under both the hotspots. However, the number of endemic species increased with decrease in BR levels for Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh; and decreased for the state of Assam. The study validates the BR index derived using geospatial modeling approach, thereby provides confidence in its acceptance for ecological conservation purposes.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					415	429		10.1007/s12524-010-0044-4								WOS:000288426800004

Geospatial Analysis of Tamil Nadu Eastern Ghats Forest Types at Landscape level with reference to Fragmentation and Species Diversity	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The present study has generated spatial databases on the vegetation type with plant biodiversity, forest fragmentation and disturbance regimes in Tamilnadu parts of Eastern Ghats (EG), India. These databases have been analysed geospatially with landscape ecology approach. The study also includes ground inventory of plant species based on Remote Sensing (RS) data stratification. The vegetation type map was generated from the visual interpretation of two season IRS LISS III data. The spatial landscape analysis of the remotely sensed interpreted images was carried out using customized software, SPLAM. This is first such study in Tamilnadu Eastern Ghats that provides a comprehensive spatial database on vegetation types, disturbance regime and plant species diversity. The study has shown that the dry deciduous and thorn forests have shown better resistance to disturbance compared to the most disturbed evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. The study outputs are being utilized by forest department and biodiversity boards for conservation action planning and compliance to Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					453	463		10.1007/s12524-010-0047-1								WOS:000288426800007

Influences of Fragmentation on Plant Diversity: An Observation in Eastern Himalayan Tropical Forest	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Tropical forest fragmentation has been a major concern towards biodiversity conservation. Indices to determine the community structure and their relationship with forest fragmentation have been a matter of investigation. Here, I investigated the plant diversity across a fragmentation gradient in a typical human-influenced forested landscape in eastern Himalaya. The stratification for guiding field sampling was done using satellite remote sensing derived forest type map at 1: 50,000 scale. The results of 49 sample plots (nested quadrant of 20x20 m size) following stratified random sampling method were analysed. It was observed that high fragmented forests have fewer plant species, reduced anthropogenic use evidence and newer community types than medium and low fragment forests. In general, species diversity and species dominance were observed to be inversely proportional and directly proportional to forest fragmentation. Basal area followed a decreasing trend along fragmentation gradient. These results revealed that higher level of fragmentation permits low diversity in the eastern Himalayan tropical forests.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					465	475		10.1007/s12524-010-0048-0								WOS:000288426800008

Modeling distribution of species using remote sensing and geographic information has already proved its potentials to get such information with less effort. Pittosporum eriocarpum Royle is an endemic and threatened tree species of Uttarakhand, yet till now its regional distribution is poorly known. This study using geospatial modelling tools indentified several localities of potential occurrence of this species in the Mussoorie hills and Doon valley, and also provides information on its habitat specificity. The main objective of the study is to predict the suitable habitats for endangered plant species in Himalayan region using logistic regression model where availability of sufficient data on species presence-absence is a major limitation for larger areas.																	0255-660X					SEP	2010	38	3					513	521		10.1007/s12524-010-0036-4								WOS:000288426800012

At the global scale, there need to be more coordinated efforts to acquire, process, analyze, and make available these observation data across all disciplines, particularly since many applications use the same primary and derived data. Towards that end, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is implementing the Global Earth Observing System of Systems. The purpose of this article is to provide information on GEO's goals and activities relevant to biodiversity and ecosystems. The article also describes the data that would best serve as a year 2010 baseline in order to support the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as well as many other international agreements, programs, and activities. Indeed, an assessment of existing biodiversity observations with a concomitant recognition of the remaining gaps will promote the establishment of an integrated framework for biodiversity observations in support of the CBD's efforts.																	0912-3814					SEP	2010	25	5			SI		937	946		10.1007/s11284-010-0756-5								WOS:000284430800006

We investigated the efficiency of MODIS fire products to account for the variability of fire regimes in relation to changes in land cover and savanna vegetation. The specificity and complementarities of both MODIS active fire (MOD14A2 and MYD14A2) and burnt area (MCD45A1) products were assessed in order to characterize fire regimes and to relate them with land cover. In addition the distribution of plant species among landscape units characterised by specific fire regimes was assessed. The calculation of the mutual information made it possible to set apart species more frequent in landscapes little or not at all subject to fire and species more frequent in burnt areas. The first group is the expression of the nature of the unburnt land-cover units, made up mainly of the agricultural areas dominated by fields and fallows. It consists of more potential threats (weeds, encroachers, invasive species etc.) than the second group, which is more typical of sudanian savannas, where fire provides the long-term stability needed to preserve the ecosystem.

Unfortunately, limited federal funding and a lack of specific enforcement of existing regulations has resulted in a lack of effectiveness monitoring (monitoring that provides information on the successes and impacts of the activity or project) after forest restoration activities on federal lands, thus inhibiting learning about, and improving the success of, restoration efforts. Monitoring could potentially be conducted on limited federal budgets through use of (1) multiparty teams composed of volunteers on a portion of restoration sites, (2) a statistical sampling strategy on a limited set of sites for intensive monitoring by federal monitoring teams, and (3) remote sensing to monitor a select set of variables across a broad portion of the affected landscape.

Following the emergence and routine availability of commercial very high spatial resolution (0.6-10 m) multispectral satellite images, we reviewed the use of these new high-quality remote sensing data and products for coral reef fisheries management. The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements.

Spatial modelling and landscape-level approaches for visualizing intra-specific variation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Spatial analytical methods have been used by biologists for decades, but with new modelling approaches and data availability their application is accelerating. While early approaches were purely spatial in nature, it is now possible to explore the underlying causes of spatial heterogeneity of biological variation using a wealth of environmental data, especially from satellite remote sensing. Recent methods can not only make inferences regarding spatial relationships and the causes of spatial heterogeneity, but also create predictive maps of patterns of biological variation under changing environmental conditions. Here, we review the methods involved in making continuous spatial predictions from biological variation using spatial and environmental predictor variables, provide examples of their use and critically evaluate the advantages and limitations.

Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of understory vegetation is essential for management and conservation. Nevertheless, detailed information on the distribution of understory vegetation across large spatial extents is usually unavailable, due to the interference of overstory canopy on the remote detection of understory vegetation. While many efforts have been made to overcome this challenge, mapping understory vegetation across large spatial extents is still limited due to a lack of generality of the developed methods and limited availability of required remotely sensed data. In this study, we used understory bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve, China as a case study to develop and test an effective and practical remote sensing approach for mapping understory vegetation. Using phenology metrics generated from a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we characterized the phenological features of forests with understory bamboo. Using maximum entropy modeling together with these phenology metrics, we successfully mapped the spatial distribution of understory bamboo (kappa: 0.59: AUC: 0.85). In addition, by incorporating elevation information we further mapped the distribution of two individual bamboo species, Bashania faberi and Fargesia robusta (kappa: 0.68 and 0.70; AUC: 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). Due to its generality, flexibility and extensibility, this approach constitutes an improvement to the remote detection of understory vegetation, making it suitable for mapping different understory species in different geographic settings. Both biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat management may benefit from the detailed information on understory vegetation across large areas through the applications of this approach.

Hyperspectral Analysis of Columbia Spotted Frog Habitat	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Wildlife managers increasingly are using remotely sensed imagery to improve habitat delineations and sampling strategies. Advances in remote sensing technology, such as hyperspectral imagery, provide more information than previously was available with multispectral sensors. We evaluated accuracy of high-resolution hyperspectral image classifications to identify wetlands and wetland habitat features important for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and compared the results to multispectral image classification and United States Geological Survey topographic maps. The study area spanned 3 lake basins in the Salmon River Mountains, Idaho, USA. Hyperspectral data were collected with an airborne sensor on 30 June 2002 and on 8 July 2006. A 12-year comprehensive ground survey of the study area for Columbia spotted frog reproduction served as validation for image classifications. Hyperspectral image classification accuracy of wetlands was high, with a producer's accuracy of 96% (44 wetlands) correctly classified with the 2002 data and 89% (41 wetlands) correctly classified with the 2006 data. We applied habitat-based rules to delineate breeding habitat from other wetlands, and successfully predicted 74% (14 wetlands) of known breeding wetlands for the Columbia spotted frog. Emergent sedge microhabitat classification showed promise for directly predicting Columbia spotted frog egg mass locations within a wetland by correctly identifying 72% (23 of 32) of known locations. Our study indicates hyperspectral imagery can be an effective tool for mapping spotted frog breeding habitat in the selected mountain basins. We conclude that this technique has potential for improving site selection for inventory and monitoring programs conducted across similar wetland habitat and can be a useful tool for delineating wildlife habitats.

J	Parks, KE; Mulligan, M				Parks, K. E.; Mulligan, M.			On the relationship between a resource based measure of geodiversity and broad scale biodiversity patterns	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Geodiversity, (diversity of the geosphere) incorporates many of the environmental patterns and processes that are considered drivers of biodiversity. Components of geodiversity (climate, topography, geology and hydrology) can be considered in terms of their resource giving potential, where resources are taken as energy, water, space and nutrients. The total amount of these resources, along with their spatial and temporal variation, is herein proposed as a compound index of geodiversity that has the potential to model broad scale biodiversity patterns. This paper outlines potential datasets that could be used to represent geodiversity, and then reviews the theoretical links between each element of the proposed compound index of geodiversity (overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources) and broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. Support for the influence of each of the elements of geodiversity on overall biodiversity patterns was found in the literature, although the majority of relevant research focuses on resource availability, particularly available energy. The links between temporal and spatial variation in resources and biodiversity have been less thoroughly investigated in the literature. For the most part, it was reported that overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources do not act in isolation in terms of controlling biodiversity. Overall there are sufficient datasets to calculate the proposed compound index of geodiversity, and evidence in the literature for links between the geographical distribution of biodiversity and each of the elements of the compound index defined. Since data for measuring geodiversity is more spatially consistent and widely available (thanks to satellite remote sensing) geodiversity has potential as a conservation planning tool, especially where biological data are not available or sparsely distributed.

Land use patterns and urbanization in the holy city of Varanasi, India: a scenario	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Rapid urbanization and increasing land use changes due to population and economic growth in selected landscapes is being witnessed of late in India and other developing countries. The cities are expanding in all directions resulting in large-scale urban sprawl and changes in urban land use. The spatial pattern of such changes is clearly noticed on the urban fringes or city peripheral rural areas than in the city center. In fact, this is reflected in changing urban land use patterns. There is an urgent need to accurately describe land use changes for planning and sustainable management. In the recent times, remote sensing is gaining importance as vital tool in the analysis and integration of spatial data. This study intends to estimate land use pattern in a planned and unplanned urban setup and also to analyze the impact of change in land use pattern in the Varanasi urban environment. The results indicate that the planned urban setup had a higher tree cover to that of unplanned area in the Varanasi City, although a considerable disparity existed within the planned urban setups. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts of urban planning and give more consideration to the preservation and management of urban tree cover/greenspace.																	0167-6369					AUG	2010	167	1-4			SI		417	422		10.1007/s10661-009-1060-0								WOS:000279683100034	19562495					
J	Munyati, C; Ratshibvumo, T				Munyati, Christopher; Ratshibvumo, Thihanedzwi			Differentiating geological fertility derived vegetation zones in Kruger National Park, South Africa, using Landsat and MODIS imagery	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Spatial technologies present possibilities for producing frequently updated and accurate habitat maps, which are important in biodiversity conservation. Assemblages of vegetation are equivalent to habitats. This study examined the use of satellite imagery in vegetation differentiation in South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP). A vegetation classification scheme based on dominant tree species but also related to the park's geology was tested, the geology generally consisting of high and low fertility lithology. Currently available multispectral satellite imagery is broadly either of high spatial but low temporal resolution or low spatial but high temporal resolution. Landsat TM/ETM+ and MODIS images were used to represent these broad categories. Rain season dates were selected as the period when discrimination between key habitats in KNP is most likely to be successful. Principal Component Analysis enhanced vegetated areas on the Lands at images, while NDVI vegetation enhancement was employed on the MODIS image. The images were classified into six field sampling derived classes depicting a vegetation density and phenology gradient, with high (about 89%) indicative classification accuracy. The results indicate that, using image processing procedures that enhance vegetation density, image classification can be used to map the park's vegetation at the high versus low geological fertility zone level, to accuracies above 80% on high spatial resolution imagery and slightly lower accuracy on lower spatial resolution imagery. Rainfall just prior to the image date influences herbaceous vegetation and, therefore, success at image scene vegetation mapping, while cloud cover limits image availability. Small scale habitat differentiation using multispectral satellite imagery for large protected savanna areas appears feasible, indicating the potential for use of remote sensing in savanna habitat monitoring. However, factors affecting successful habitat mapping need to be considered. Therefore, adoption of remote sensing in vegetation mapping and monitoring for large protected savanna areas merits consideration by conservation agencies. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Environmental monitoring by thin film nanocomposite sensors for cultural heritage preservation	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS					16th International Symposium on Metastable, Amorphous and Nanostructured Materials	JUL 05-09, 2009	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Environmental control is a crucial issue in cultural heritage preservation as it especially relates to sensitive artwork and antique object conservation. Storage and transport of artworks and antiques are operations requiring precise control of the environment. Current technology trends lead to miniaturization of environmental sensor devices in which low power dissipation and advanced non-contact or remote monitoring methods appear to offer significant advantages. In the above context, nanocomposite materials represent innovative alternative solutions for high sensitivity temperature and relative humidity (RH) sensing. The control of both of these parameters, together with the exposure to ultraviolet radiation, is important in minimizing aging and deterioration of art and antique objects. New schemes reported here consider the classes of CN(x) and CoCl(2) nanocomposites. First, CN(x) thin films are synthesized on Si substrates by reactive pulsed laser ablation of graphite targets in N(2) atmosphere to form capacitive sensors. On the other hand, CoCl(2) polymer matrix composite films are produced by spin coating or casting of the composite polymer/CoCl(2) on planar glass substrates. These latter systems present a new class of optically interrogated photonic sensors featuring powerless sensing head and remote monitoring capabilities. The prototype devices proposed for use in art conservation and museum applications have been tested under controlled environmental conditions and their performance is seen to be comparable, and in some cases superior, to conventional monitoring solutions.

Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DV1, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R(2) = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2. ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R(2)=0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Modeling social and land-use/land-cover change data to assess drivers of smallholder deforestation in Belize	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study integrated remote sensing, household survey data, and spatial modeling to assess drivers of deforestation within the Community Baboon Sanctuary (CBS), Belize, an IUCN category IV protected area for the black howler monkey (Alouatta pigra) established in 1985. We contrasted land-cover trends within the CBS, as well as a 120 m river buffer running within and outside the CBS (the focus of conservation). Additionally, we assessed the relative influence of selected household economic activity and demographic data, participation in two conservation initiatives, locational context, and land tenure on the probability of deforestation using binomial logit models. Social survey and land-cover change data was incorporated from 33 smallholder parcels from the years 2000-2004. Deforestation rates within the CBS totaled 30% between 1989 and 2004, following similar trends in Belize. Riparian areas were more likely to be deforested, as were areas closer to roads. Although cattle correlated with the leading driver of deforestation in the model, land tenure was not influential, despite its importance within the literature. Although involvement with conservation initiatives is correlated with decreased deforestation, other drivers are more influential, stressing the influence of other competing factors on forest preservation that must be considered with conservation development.

J	Geri, F; Amici, V; Rocchini, D				Geri, Francesco; Amici, Valerio; Rocchini, Duccio			Human activity impact on the heterogeneity of a Mediterranean landscape	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The Mediterranean area is one of the most significantly altered hotspots on Earth, since it has been intensively affected by human activity for millennia. As a result, only 4.7% of its primary vegetation remained unaltered and the landscape has been repeatedly transformed. In this paper, we aimed at detecting both the direction and the rate of landscape change focusing on the effects of human activity on the environmental heterogeneity of the Mediterranean landscape under study. In particular, we carried out an analysis of landscape changes occurred in a Mediterranean area from 1954 to 2000, by means of a comparative examination of a historical and a recent land use map. Land use changes have been quantified by landscape metrics coupled with topographical information. Results underline: i) a general homogenisation of the landscape, ii) modification of the arrangements for exploitation of the territory, particularly in the plain areas, iii) a trend of recovery of the territory by the forest to the detriment of semi-natural and agricultural areas in hilly and mountain parts. The analysis of the complex phenomena related to land use changes can be a useful tool to define effective strategies for natural resources management and biodiversity conservation.

In Mediterranean regions, natural landscapes mostly covered by evergreen vegetation have been to a large extent transformed into cultural landscapes since long time ago. We investigated land cover changes in Central Chile using multi-temporal satellite imagery taken in 1975, 1985, 1999 and 2008. The major trends in this highly dynamic landscape were reduction of dryland forest and conversion of shrubland to intensive land uses such as farmland. The average net annual deforestation rate was -1.7%, and shrubland reduction occurred at an annual rate of -0.7%; agriculture, urban areas and timber plantations increased at annual rates of 1.1%, 2.7% and 3.2%, respectively, during the 1975-2008 period. Total forest and shrubland loss rates were partly offset by passive revegetation. However, most of the areas that were passively revegetated remained as shrubland and did not turn into forests due to a low capacity of forest recovery. This resulted in a progressive loss and degradation of dryland forest over the entire region. Overall, the documented land cover changes increase provisioning services such as crops, cattle, and timber that are characteristic of cultural landscapes in the area but may cause an irreversible loss of biodiversity and a depletion of other ecological services provided by forests and shrubland. The implications for conservation of this area and the need for territorial planning and adapted land-use strategies are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ecker, K; Waser, LT; Kuchler, M				Ecker, Klaus; Waser, Lars T.; Kuechler, Meinrad			Contribution of multi-source remote sensing data to predictive mapping of plant-indicator gradients within Swiss mire habitats	BOTANICA HELVETICA												Remote-sensing plays an important role in wetland monitoring on the regional and global scale. In this study we assessed the potential of different optical sensors to map floristic indicator gradients across complex mire habitats at the stand level. We compared traditional CIR photographs from RC30 cameras with modern digital ADS40 data and SPOT5 satellite images as well as fine-scale topo-structure derived from LIDAR data. We derived about 70 spectral and 30 topo-structural variables and evaluated their ability to predict the mean ecological indicator values of the vegetation across a sample of 7 mire objects. The airborne images (RC30, ADS40) and the LIDAR data were found to have a high potential for use in vegetation mapping; they explained on average 50% of the variation in observed ecological indicator values. The RC30 data slightly outperformed the less optimally collected ADS40 data. The LIDAR topo-structural variables showed equal overall predictive power as the airborne images, but they performed clearly better in predicting soil moisture, soil dispersion and light. Combining both airborne images and topo-structural data improved the predictions of all indicator values considerably. The combined use of these data sources is therefore recommended for use in fine-scale monitoring of priority habitats in nature conservation.

Due to historical reasons and lack of advanced technologies, construction resources and conservation status of Ming Great Wall have not been investigated in any systematic manner; indeed, the extent of the Great Wall has not even been measured. This has resulted in a shortage of reliable first-hand scientific information on actual size, spatially resource distribution and preservation status of this World Heritage site. Driven by the urgent need to establish protection, research, renovation and management of Ming Great Wall, a comprehensive investigation and spatial mapping was jointly organized and completed by the State Bureau of Survey and Mapping and State Administration of Culture Heritage. High resolution digital stereo models at 1:10000 map scale covering the whole length of the Ming Great Wall have been created by photogrammetric reconstruction using nearly ten thousand aerial images. Spatial distribution and attributes of the wall sections, trenches and various subsidiary facilities in the surroundings of the Great Wall were measured with the help of digital photogrammetry workstations and results from field studies. Reliable and precise information about the Ming Great Wall has now been obtained and documented, including surface lengths, resource distribution, and preservation status. For example, the total length of Ming Great Wall is 8851.8 km, of which 6259.6 km is of actual wall, 2232.5 km of natural terrain, and 359.7 km of trenches. In category lengths, 1828.8 km is constructed of stone, 3411.3 km of earth, 249.6 km in brick, 197.5 km of cliff wall and the rest 572.4 km of other means. Such information provides the scientific basis and strong platform in helping to delineate areas needing protection, in planning conservation and renovation programs, as well as digital archiving for posterity and web-based applications for modern promotions of one of the world's great attractions, the Ming Great Wall.																	1001-6538					JUL	2010	55	21					2290	2294		10.1007/s11434-010-4295-9								WOS:000280481600015						
J	Wright, CK				Wright, Christopher K.			Spatiotemporal dynamics of prairie wetland networks: power-law scaling and implications for conservation planning	ECOLOGY												Although habitat networks show promise for conservation planning at regional scales, their spatiotemporal dynamics have not been well studied, especially in climate-sensitive landscapes. Here I use satellite remote sensing to compile wetland habitat networks from the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America. An ensemble of networks assembled across a hydrologic gradient from deluge to drought and a range of representative dispersal distances exhibits power-law scaling of important topological parameters. Prairie wetland networks are "meso-worlds" with mean topological distance increasing faster with network size than small-world networks, but slower than a regular lattice (or "large world"). This scaling implies rapid dispersal through wetland networks without some of the risks associated with "small worlds" (e. g., extremely rapid propagation of disease or disturbance). Retrospective analysis of wetland networks establishes a climatic envelope for landscape connectivity in the PPR, where I show that a changing climate might severely impact metapopulation viability and restrict long-distance dispersal and range shifts. More generally, this study demonstrates an efficient approach to conservation planning at a level of abstraction addressing key drivers of the global biodiversity crisis: habitat fragmentation and climatic change.																	0012-9658					JUL	2010	91	7					1924	1930		10.1890/09-0865.1								WOS:000279563700007	20715611					
J	Bassler, C; Muller, J; Dziock, F; Brandl, R				Baessler, Claus; Mueller, Joerg; Dziock, Frank; Brandl, Roland			Effects of resource availability and climate on the diversity of wood-decaying fungi	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P>1. Wood-decaying fungi are crucial for the functioning of forest ecosystems. We tested the hypotheses that on coarse woody debris (CWD), the abundance, diversity and composition of fungi depend more on the amount of available resource than on macro- or microclimate, and that on fine woody debris (FWD) more on the microclimate because of the rapid desiccation of thin woody debris. 2. We sampled 7183 dead wood objects with 10 818 fungal samples on 290 plots along four transects, from 650 to 1450 m a.s.l., in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, Overall, we recorded 263 species (54 only on FWD and 71 only on CWD). 3. For each plot, we characterized the macroclimate using field data and a terrain model. Microclimate variables were extracted from remote-sensing and ground surveys. Resource availability was characterized by measuring the amount, tree species composition, diameter and rotting stage of all dead wood objects. We extracted principal components from each of the three data sets for further analyses. 4. The number of species found per sampled surface area of woody debris indicated that the fungal community on FWD needs a much lower surface area than that on CWD; FWD probably provides more niches per unit surface area than CWD. The abundance of fungi (and therefore also species density) living on FWD and CWD as well as the fungal community composition on CWD were clearly driven by variables characterizing the amount and diversity of the resource. In general, the surface area was the most important factor for abundance of species. In contrast, the community composition on FWD was better predicted by variables characterizing the microclimate. 5. Synthesis. Our results supported the hypotheses that the amount of available resources is more important than macroclimate for fungi living on CWD, and microclimate is more important for fungi living on FWD. Therefore, both dead wood removal and silviculture, which, like logging, open the canopy and increases sunlight exposure, will strongly affect the diversity of wood-decaying fungi in forests. For the conservation of this important group of organisms in forests, silvicultural strategies are more important than climate.																	0022-0477					JUL	2010	98	4					822	832		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01669.x								WOS:000278675000011						
J	Hedley, J; Enriquez, S				Hedley, J.; Enriquez, S.			Optical properties of canopies of the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum estimated by a three-dimensional radiative transfer model	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Three-dimensional models of seagrass canopies were constructed by treating leaves as flexible strips that fall under their own weight into naturalistic canopy structures. Canopy structures incorporated shoot density, canopy height, and physical and along-length optical characteristics of leaves from an empirical data set of six seagrass canopies from a reef lagoon in Puerto Morelos, Mexico. Multiple runs of a radiosity method radiative transfer model elucidated the dependence of various canopy optical properties on incident radiance zenith angle, such as within-canopy diffuse attenuation, the absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by different canopy-complex components, along-leaf variation in PAR absorption, and canopy bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs). Intersite variation in mean PAR absorption by green leaf sections was primarily associated with leaf area index (LAI). Variation in PAR absorption with incident radiance angle was generally small for incident angles within Snell's window (< 49 degrees). Within canopies, absorption by water itself had a negligible effect. Canopy BRDFs were not Lambertian and exhibited features related to canopy architecture. Model outputs validated well in terms of energy conservation and empirical measurements of within-canopy PAR attenuation. The model framework has clear applications to improve understanding of seagrass canopy light harvesting and photosynthetic carbon fixation and to aid the development of quantitative biooptical remote sensing methods for seagrass beds.

The principle of this modelling is the use of a combination of environmental key parameters to produce rules to understand species distribution and hence generate predictive maps. This study focuses on subtidal kelp forests (KF) on the coast of Brittany, France. The most significant key parameters to predict KF frequency are (1) the nature of the substrate, (2) depth, (3) water transparency, (4) water surface temperature and (5) hydrodynamics associated with the flexibility of algae in a flow. All these parameters are integrated in a spatial model, built using a Geographical Information System. This model results in a KF frequency map, where sites with optimum key parameters show a deeper limit of disappearance. After validation, the model is used in the context of Climate Change to estimate the effect of environmental variation on this depth limit of KF. Thus, the effects of both an increase in water temperature and a decrease in its transparency could lead to the complete disappearance of KF.

J	Gao, QZ; Kang, MY; Xu, HM; Jiang, YA; Yang, J				Gao, Qingzhu; Kang, Muyi; Xu, Hongmei; Jiang, Yuan; Yang, Jie			Optimization of land use structure and spatial pattern for the semi-arid loess hilly-gully region in China	CATENA												The semi-arid loess hilly-gully region in China has an extremely vulnerable ecological environment. Inappropriate land use - crop farming, overgrazing, and plantation forestry - has worsened soil erosion, intensified water shortage, and hence impeded the ecological conservation and agricultural development of the entire region in the past. Optimizing land use and vegetation cover and spatial pattern is conducive to achieving both ecological and economic goals in terms of controlling soil erosion, using water resources rationally and raising agricultural productivity. Changchuan Watershed, a typical small catchment in the semi-arid loess hilly region, was selected as the case study area to analyze the impacts of land use and land cover structure and associated spatial pattern on soil erosion and water consumption in the Watershed, through field investigation and model simulation. Land use structure was optimized by multi-objective programming, using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques, analytic hierarchical programming (AHP) and expert consultancy. The digitized optimum spatial pattern embodying rationally-proportioned land use structure was obtained through GIS-aided redistribution of land use types. The optimized land use structure reapportioned woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, and croplands at 3.7%, 38.6%, 49.4%, and 6.3% of the land area respectively, compared to the current land use structure of 2.4%, 38.6%, 24.0%. and 12.6%, respectively, in the Changchuan Watershed. In the optimized land use spatial pattern, croplands are mainly located in the riverside plain and check-dammed valleys and grasslands are widely distributed in the lower reaches of the basin, while shrublands are appropriately established in the middle and upper reaches of the river. A comparative analysis shows that the optimized land use structure, with well-designed spatial pattern is able to reduce soil erosion, enhance the utilization of water resources and raise agricultural productivity.

J	Santos, MJ; Greenberg, JA; Ustin, SL				Santos, Maria J.; Greenberg, Jonathan A.; Ustin, Susan L.			Using hyperspectral remote sensing to detect and quantify southeastern pine senescence effects in red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Conservation of threatened and endangered species requires maintenance of critical habitat. The red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis (RCN) is a threatened bird species, endemic to the mixed conifer forests of the southeastern United States. RCW nests and forages preferentially in mature longleaf pine Pin us palustris, but also uses mature loblolly pine Pinus taeda and shortleaf pine Pinus echinata forests. In the last century, the extent of mature pine forests has been greatly reduced by logging. The RCW, in contrast to other woodpeckers, excavates nest cavities in living trees and senescence symptoms (year round leaf chlorosis and leaf mortality) have been observed in mature pine stands across the southeast. Widespread mortality of the mature pine forests would threaten the long-term survival of the RCW. We used airborne hyperspectral data across a portion of Ft. Benning Military Installation, Georgia, U.S.A., to determine if senescent trees can be identified and mapped and assess the likely persistence of mature pines in the RCW habitat. Univariate analysis of variance showed good separation between asymptomatic, senesced and dead physiological conditions with asymptomatic trees having significantly higher reflectance for all bands in the wavelength range between 0.719 and 1.1676 mu m, senescent trees having significantly lower reflectance for bands in the range between 1.1927 and 1.3122 mu m, and dead trees having significantly higher reflectance for bands in the range between 1.8151 and 1.9471 mu m. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models achieved correct classification rates and kappa statistics above 70%. CART models selected information from wavelength regions similar to those identified from the ANOVA, which likely explains their performance. Our aggregated CART model of tree senescence estimated that 141.4 ha (3%) of the study area is affected. RCW nests occurred in areas with significantly higher tree cover, and trees within foraging and home ranges did not have significantly more senescence than areas without RCW. These results indicate that although tree senescence is widespread, mortality is yet to significantly affect RCW habitat. Results and analysis of critical habitat similar to those exemplified in this study can extend our knowledge about the stressors of these important and imperiled components of biodiversity.

In particular, multispectral imaging in the near-infrared region (NIR) has proved useful in analyzing ancient paintings because of the transparency of most pigments and their varied reflectance changes over this spectral region. A variety of systems, with different detectors and filtering or dispersing technologies, have been implemented. Despite the recognized potential of multispectral NIR imaging, which provides information on both spectral and spatial domains (thus extending the capabilities of conventional imaging and spectroscopy), most of the systems currently used in art diagnostics have limitations. The technology is still in its early stages of development in this field. In this Account, we present the scanning multispectral IR reflectography (SMIRR) technique for artwork analysis, together with an integrated device for the acquisition of imaging data. The instrument prototype is a no-contact optical scanner with a single-point measurement of the reflectance, capable of simultaneously collecting a set of 14 spatially registered images at different wavelengths in the NIR range of 800-2300 nm. The data can be analyzed as a spectral cube, both as a stack of wavelength resolved images (multi-NIR reflectography) and as a series of point reflectance spectra, one for each sampled pixel on the surface (NIR spectrometry). We explore the potential of SMIRR in the analysis of ancient paintings and show its advantages over the wide-band conventional method. The multispectral option allows the choice of the most effective NIR bands and improves the ability to detect hidden features. The interband comparison aids in localizing areas of different pictorial materials with particular NIR reflectance. In addition to the analysis of single monochromatic images, enhancement procedures involving the joint processing of multispectral planes, such as subtraction and ratio methods, false color representation, and statistical tools such as principal component analysis, are applied to the registered image dataset for extracting additional information. Maintaining a visual approach in the data analysis allows this tool to be used by museum staff, the actual end-users. We also present some applications of the technique to the study of Italian masterpieces, discussing interesting preliminary results. The spectral sensitivity of the detection system, the quality of focusing and uniformity of the acquired images, and the possibility for selective imaging in NIR bands in a registered dataset make SMIRR an exceptional tool for nondestructive inspection of painting surfaces. The high quality and detail of SMIRR data underscore the potential for further development in this field.

We assessed changes in habitat condition on the island between 1991 and 2008, using vegetation maps generated by remote-sensing images. We defined forest suitable for gibbons based on composition, tree size and canopy cover. During the 17-year period, the area of suitable gibbon forest decreased by 540 km(2) (35%) across the whole island, and by 6.3 km(2) (7%) in the locality of the sole remaining gibbon population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. The forest patches large enough (>1 km(2)) to support a gibbon group decreased from 754 km(2) to 316 km(2) in total area, and from 92 to 64 in number. Suitable natural forest was mainly replaced by plantations below 760 m, or degraded by logging, grazing and planting of pines above 760 m. Meanwhile, forests in former confirmed gibbon areas became more fragmented: mean area of patches decreased by 53%. We mapped the patches of natural forest in good condition which could potentially support gibbons. We recommend a freeze on further expansion of plantations between core patches at Bawangling, Jiaxi-Houmiling and Yinggeling Nature Reserves in accordance with forest protection regulations; establishment of nature reserves in currently unprotected natural forest patches elsewhere in line with the local government's nature reserve expansion policy; and active natural-forest restoration between remaining fragments at Bawangling.

The ecological status of grasslands on lowland farmlands in western Ireland and implications for grassland classification and nature value assessment	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The identification and protection of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is an objective of the European Rural Development policy which has yet to be met by Member States. Remote sensing and models based on farm statistics are commonly used to identify HNV farmland. Use of datasets such as Corine Landcover Classes is widespread but it has been acknowledged that such datasets can significantly overlook fine-scale biodiversity features. In countries where farmland is predominantly grass-based, there is an added difficulty in distinguishing between grassland types without undertaking field-scale survey work. This study was conducted to improve our knowledge of grassland biodiversity on lowland farms with a view to helping assess their potential conservation value in a High Nature Value farmland context. We analysed the grassland species composition of 603 fields on 32 lowland farms and investigated their relationship to management, ecological and spatial descriptors. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) and Multi-Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) analyses of the grasslands and their ecology on these farms revealed a continuum between semi-natural and improved agricultural grasslands, including an intermediate Semi-Improved Grassland type. This gradation from improved to semi-natural grassland highlights the biodiversity variation that occurs on farms that are frequently considered to be of low nature value. Statistical analyses showed that management practices, and especially soil fertility, were most strongly associated with grassland type. The detailed description of the grasslands that occur on these lowland farms has the potential to provide a better assessment of the overall nature value of a farm, potentially aiding the identification of Type 2 High Nature Value farmland. Before this can be achieved, however, there is a need to amend the grassland classification system used in Ireland in order that intermediate semi-natural grassland assemblages can be identified at the field level. Field surveys are necessary for this level of detail. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For a study area of 88 484 km2, 70% of which lie inside the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot (WGBH), land-cover maps for two dates (1977, 1999) were built from various data sources including remote sensing images and ecological forest maps. SOC stocks were calculated from climatic parameters, altitude, physiography, rock type, soil type and land-cover, with a modelling approach used in predictive learning and based on Multiple Additive Regression Tree. The model was trained on 361 soil profiles data, and applied to estimate SOC stocks from predictor variables using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Comparison of 1977 and 1999 land-cover maps showed 628 km2 of dense forests habitat loss (6%), corresponding to an annual deforestation rate of 0.44%. This was found consistent with other studies carried out in other parts of the WGBH, but not with FAO figures showing an increase in forest area. This could be explained by the different forest definitions used, based on ecological classification in the former, and on percentage tree cover in the latter. Unexpectedly, our results showed that despite ongoing deforestation, overall SOC stock was maintained (similar to 0.43 Pg). But a closer examination of spatial differences showed that soil carbon losses in deforested areas were compensated by sequestration elsewhere, mainly in recent plantations and newly irrigated croplands. This suggests that more carbon sequestration in soils could be achieved in the future through appropriate wasteland management. It is also expected that increasing concerns about biodiversity loss will favour more conservation and reinforce the already prevailing protective measures, thus further maintaining C stocks.

An Integrated Study of Geospatial Information Technologies for Surface Runoff Estimation in an Agricultural Watershed, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Runoff is one of the important hydrologic variables used in most of the water resources applications. The Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method is adopted for the estimation of surface runoff in the Mehadrigedda watershed area, Visakhapatnam district, India using multispectral remote sensing data, curve number approach and normal rainfall data. The main source of water in the Mehadrigedda watershed area is by rain, most of it drains off and only a little percolates into ground. The weighted curve number is determined based on antecedent moisture condition (AMC)-II with an integration of hydrologic soil groups (HSGs) and land use/land cover LULC categories. An integrated approach is applied to delineate the land use/land cover information as adopted from NRSA classification. The recording of daily rainfall data during the years 1997-2006 is collected from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainguage center at Kottavalasa. It is observed that the annual rainfall-runoff relationship during 1997-2006, which is indicating that the overall increase in runoff with the rainfall of the watershed area.

As we enhance our understanding about the structuring of natural populations, it becomes important that we also understand the processes behind these patterns. However, there are few rigorous assessments of the influence of environmental factors on genetic patterns in mobile marine species. Given their dispersal capabilities and localized habitat preferences, coastal cetaceans are adequate study species for evaluating environmental effects on marine population structure. The franciscana dolphin, a rare coastal cetacean endemic to the Western South Atlantic, was studied to examine these issues. We analysed genetic data from the mitochondrial DNA and 12 microsatellite markers for 275 franciscana samples utilizing frequency-based, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian algorithms to assess population structure and migration patterns. This information was combined with 10 years of remote sensing environmental data (chlorophyll concentration, water turbidity and surface temperature). Our analyses show the occurrence of genetically isolated populations within Argentina, in areas that are environmentally distinct. Combined evidence of genetic and environmental structure suggests that isolation by distance and a process here termed isolation by environmental distance can explain the observed correlations. Our approach elucidated important ecological and conservation aspects of franciscana dolphins, and has the potential to increase our understanding of ecological processes influencing genetic patterns in other marine species.

Novel survey method finds dramatic decline of wild cotton-top tamarin population	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) is a critically endangered primate, endemic to the tropical forests of Colombia. Population monitoring is essential to evaluate the success of conservation efforts, yet standard survey methods are ineffective because animals flee silently before they are seen. We developed a novel technique that combines the use of playbacks of territorial vocalizations with traditional transect surveys. We used remote sensing to identify potential habitat within the species 'historic range, and visited the 27% that we could survey safely. Of this, only 99 km(2) was extant forest, containing an estimated 2,045 animals (95% confidence interval 1,587-2,634). Assuming comparable densities in non-surveyed areas, approximately 7,394 wild cotton-top tamarins remain in Colombia. With 20-30,000 animals exported to the United States in the late 1960s, this must represent a precipitous decline. Habitat destruction and capture for the illegal pet trade are ongoing. Urgent conservation measures are required to prevent extinction in the wild.																	2041-1723					JUN	2010	1								30	10.1038/ncomms1030								WOS:000283604700010	20975684					
J	Church, M				Church, Michael			The trajectory of geomorphology	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomorphology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical innovations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the landscape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing development of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomorphological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of climate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science - a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				JUN	2010	34	3					265	286		10.1177/0309133310363992								WOS:000278250600002

The model was applied to a time series of 174 Landsat TM and ETM+ images to reconstruct the flooding regime of a system of small temporary ponds and to study their spatio-temporal changes in a 23-year period. We tried to differentiate natural fluctuations from trends in hydrologic variables (i.e., hydroperiod shortening) that may threaten the preservation of the system. Although medium-resolution remote sensing data have rarely been applied to the monitoring of small-sized wetlands, this study evidences its utility to understand the hydrology of temporary ponds at a local scale. We show that the temporary ponds in Do ana National Park constitute a large and heterogeneous system with high intra and inter-annual variability. We also evidence that the conservation value of this ecosystem is threatened by the observed tendency to shorter annual hydroperiods in recent years, probably due to aquifer exploitation. This system of temporary ponds deserves special attention for the high density and heterogeneity of natural ponds, not common in Europe. For this reason, management decisions to avoid its destruction or degradation are critical.

High-Resolution Remote Sensing of Upland Swamp Boundaries and Vegetation for Baseline Mapping and Monitoring	WETLANDS												Current high-resolution remote sensing provides the means to accurately map upland swamp boundaries and vegetation communities in eastern Australian coastal woodlands. The aim of this study was to develop baseline methods for upland swamp definition and change detection that can be routinely applied in an operational setting. Airborne laser scanning was used to define swamp boundaries, image classification was used to describe vegetation communities, and post-classification comparison used to assess temporal variation in community composition over the period 2006-2007. We found that swamp boundaries could be accurately located along the sharp swamp-fringing tree ecotone (accuracy 98%), which provided a definitive feature to support both short- and long-term monitoring. Wet Heath and Dry Heath areas were well defined by image classification, and generally approximate the field-defined perennial vegetation communities of the Tea Tree Thicket and Sedgeland Heath Complexes. Temporal changes to Wet-Dry Heath extent appear to reflect growth phenology, rather than community composition. The proportion of non-vegetated area was less variable, hence an increase in bare ground is likely to be a robust indicator for impact assessment monitoring.																	0277-5212					JUN	2010	30	3					531	540		10.1007/s13157-010-0059-1								WOS:000278626200014

We studied a mid-altitude steppe-like area of Southern France, the Causse de Sauveterre, that has been grazed for many centuries. The decrease of human population during the 20th century, particularly since the end of 2nd World War, and the ongoing changes in agricultural practices may have dramatic effects on many biodiversity components of these landscapes. Our study assesses landscape change and modifications in bird community composition through the repeated sampling of a network of sites after an interval of 15-19 years. We paid particular attention to the possible consequences of recent changes in agricultural policy on these communities. Landscape changes were studied through remote sensing, and bird community and vegetation changes by field sampling on 183 sites. Correspondence Analysis showed an overall trend towards landscape closure. This results in a decrease of open-habitat species that are fairly rare in Europe (e.g. Tawny Pipit Anthus campestris, Linnet Carduelis cannabina. Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana), and in an increase of common forest species (e.g. the Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes). Although most of the avifauna changes seem to be explained by local landscape changes, the decrease of certain bird species as Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula and Citril Finch Serinus citrinella may result from population changes at larger scales. The current closure of the landscape represents a threat for several steppe species whose conservation status is unfavourable in Europe. This closure does not result from a decrease in human population and/or in flock number, as observed in many Mediterranean hinterlands. It rather results from a shift from a former extensive pastoralism, where sheep grazed steppe-like grasslands (rangeland grazing), towards a more intensive herding that use hay and cereal foodstocks cultivated on the more productive areas of the farms. To alleviate the observed trends, subsidies should be oriented towards the compensation of a possible loss of income resulting from the maintenance of the traditional extensive pastoralism.

Increased human pressures and socioeconomic development make forest protection more challenging, particularly for forest ecosystems that lie across national borders because of the differences in national socioeconomic policies and conditions within them. Here with Landsat data, Google Earth images, and field observations, we show that, in two adjacent biosphere reserves across the border of China and North Korea, over one half of primary forest landscapes have been deteriorated by exploitive uses, including seed harvesting and systematic logging. The combined effects of detectable and hidden degradation processes have further damaged forest ecosystems in the core areas in the two biosphere reserves, threatening sustainable biodiversity conservation in the region. It is urgent to develop cross-border collaborative conservation strategies that can help combat both detectable and hidden degradation processes at a regional scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.																	0364-152X					MAY	2010	45	5					985	997		10.1007/s00267-010-9471-9								WOS:000277771400009	20336296

Evaluating Conservation Program Success with Landsat and SWAT	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In the United States, many state and federally funded conservation programs are required to quantify the water quality benefits resulting from their efforts. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of conservation practices subsidized by the Oklahoma Conservation Commission on phosphorus and sediment loads to Lake Wister. Conservation practices designed to increase vegetative cover in grazed pastures were evaluated using Landsat imagery and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Several vegetative indices were derived from Landsat imagery captured before and after the implementation of conservation practices. Collectively, these indicators provided an estimate of the change in vegetative soil cover attributable to conservation practices in treated fields. Field characteristics, management, and changes in vegetative cover were used in the SWAT model to simulate sediment and phosphorus losses before and after practice implementation. Overall, these conservation practices yielded a 1.9% improvement in vegetative cover and a predicted sediment load reduction of 3.5%. Changes in phosphorus load ranged from a 1.0% improvement to a 3.5% increase, depending upon initial vegetative conditions. The use of fertilizers containing phosphorus as a conservation practice in low-productivity pastures was predicted by SWAT to increase net phosphorus losses despite any improvement in vegetative cover. This combination of vegetative cover analysis and hydrologic simulation was a useful tool for evaluating the effects of conservation practices at the basin scale and may provide guidance for the selection of conservation measures subsidized in future conservation programs.																	0364-152X					MAY	2010	45	5					1164	1174		10.1007/s00267-010-9458-6								WOS:000277771400022	20213232

Venezuela Rainfall-runoff erosivity (R) values Indicated low erosion potential The soils have moderately low to high erodability (K), It being larger in the agricultural zone. The values of the LS factor are relatively low, since the study area is mainly morphologically flat Cell-by-cell multiplication of the maps of R, K and LS factors resulted in a map of potential erosion A similar procedure, adding the factors crop and management (C), and conservation practices (P) was used to estimate actual erosion The smallest actual erosion values of soil losses were registered in forest zones and where agricultural practices are carried out. Actual eronon had a range of 0-2558t ha(-1) per year, but more than 72% of the area is under very low water erosion hazard, and is highly suitable to rain led agriculture Areas susceptible of erosion with a sod loss >12t.ha(-1) per year are found primarily in the higher basin, or where there is sparse cover The percentage of high sustainability for agricultural purpose amounted to 100% in the agricultural area. In accordance, the zone can be used continuously with annual mechanized cultivations without conservation practices The results support that the RUSLE under GIS environment, coupled with digital elevation model (DEM) data and remote sensing, are powerful tools for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of soil erosion in a hydrographical basin.																	0378-1844					MAY	2010	35	5					348	356										WOS:000277677900005						
J	Kincey, M; Challis, K				Kincey, Mark; Challis, Keith			Monitoring fragile upland landscapes: The application of airborne lidar	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												This paper investigates the potential of airborne lidar for recording and monitoring erosion levels in environmentally fragile upland landscapes, using an area of the Brecon Beacons National Park as a case study. Upland areas contain a rich variety of natural and cultural resources that are increasingly endangered through factors such as insensitive land-use practices, improvements in recreational access and climate change. Airborne lidar provides a highly detailed record of microtopography, in this example at a resolution of 0.5 m with a vertical accuracy of c.0.15 m and the ability to differentiate elevation changes to within 1-2 cm. The technique therefore allows the rapid and cost-effective recording of the nature and extent of erosion at a landscape scale, with the results of this analysis recording over 46 kilometres of path erosion within a 3.8 km(2) area. The technique also provides the ability to highlight particular areas of risk, such as extensive braided erosion around path intersections and damage to protected SSSI habitats, providing a snapshot record of erosion at a particular point in time and an invaluable source of information for conservationists and policy-makers.

Geographic information system-based decision support for soil conservation planning in Tajikistan	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Soil erosion on sloping agricultural land poses a serious problem for the environment, as well as for production. In areas with highly erodible soils, such as those in loess zones, application of soil and water conservation measures is crucial to sustain agricultural yields and to prevent or reduce land degradation. The present study, carried out in Faizabad, Tajikistan, was designed to evaluate the potential of local conservation measures on crop-land using a spatial modeling approach to provide decision-making support for the planning. of spatially explicit sustainable land use. A sampling design to support comparative analysis between well-conserved units and other field units was established in order to estimate factors that determine water erosion, according to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Such factor-based approaches allow ready application using a geographic information system and facilitate straightforward scenario modeling in areas with limited data resources. The study showed first that assessment of erosion and conservation in an area with inhomogeneous vegetation cover requires the integration of plot-based cover. Plot-based vegetation cover can be effectively derived from high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a useful basis for plot-wise conservation planning. Furthermore, thorough field assessments showed that 25.7% of current total cropland is covered by conservation measures (terracing, agroforestry, and perennial herbaceous fodder). Assessment of the effectiveness of these local measures, combined with the RUSLE calculations, revealed that current average soil loss could be reduced through low-cost measures such as contouring (by 11%), fodder plants (by 16%), and drainage ditches (by 53%). More expensive measures, such as terracing and agroforestry, can reduce erosion by as much as 63% (for agroforestry) and 93% (for agroforestry combined with terracing). Indeed, scenario runs for different levels of tolerable erosion rates showed that more cost-intensive and technologically advanced measures would lead to greater reduction of soil loss. However, given economic conditions in Tajikistan, it seems advisable to support the spread of low-cost and labour-extensive measures.																	0022-4561					MAY-JUN	2010	65	3					151	159		10.2489/jswc.65.3.151								WOS:000277697700005

However, variations in the use of legends and classification systems sometimes pose challenges. The landscape of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ) has seen many changes in the past few decades. Mapping of land cover in SNPBZ was carried out to fill gaps in basic databases for the area. A review of past land cover initiatives and existing data revealed differences in methodologies and definitions that made them incompatible for cross-region applications. For the present study, a legend was developed using the standard Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) methodology developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, a comprehensive and standardized a priori classification system designed for mapping exercises independent of scales or means. The changes in land cover were analyzed using Landsat Thematic Mapper, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer images from 1992 to 2006. Land cover maps were generated using object-based image analysis supplemented by ancillary information. Extensive fieldwork was carried out for ground truthing and validation. The use of LCCS was instrumental in bringing general understanding of the classification systems and helping to gain greater clarity and accuracy in the results. About 70% of the SNPBZ area is covered by snow and ice, glaciers, bare rocks, and bare soil. Altitude and its influence on climatic conditions have dominated the distribution pattern of vegetation in SNPBZ. The analysis showed that forest is being converted into shrub at elevations between 3000 and 4000 m, while shrub is decreasing between 4000 and 5000 m. A major decrease in snow cover is seen above 5000 m. Harmonization of the classification system helped to gain more reliable information on changes, as comparisons were made between the classes with consistent definitions.

River and landslide dynamics on the western Tanganyika rift border, Uvira, DR Congo: diachronic observations and a GIS inventory of traces of extreme geomorphologic activity	NATURAL HAZARDS												Uvira occupies a series of narrow alluvial fans squeezed between the NW corner of Lake Tanganyika (+/- 710 m asl) and the W-shoulder of the Tanganyika rift, the Itombwe-Mitumba Plateau (+/- 3,000 m asl). In 50 years, the fans progressed into the lake over distances up to some hundreds of metres. This happened during a few catastrophic flash floods issued from the torrents which cascade from the rift shoulder with a mean longitudinal gradient of 0.2 m m(-1). The last event in 2002 led to the destruction of parts of the town and to some 50 casualties. Landslides occurred in the hills. On the base of stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs from 1959, complemented with data from 2000 ETM and 2004 IKONOS imagery, a geographical inventory has been made of strongly incising (10(-1 to 0) m in 43-45 years) river sections, of all types of landslides and of all tectonic structures, visible in the rugged hinterland of the fans. Traces of active N-S as well as E-W trending faults are present. Some of these faults and some surfaces, interpreted as degraded fault facets dip at angles of 40A degrees or less and are probably remnants of formerly active lystric extension faults, originally at a depth of some 2 km, but now at the surface as a result of posterior uplift and erosion. Sixty landslides could be identified. Six slides fall far below the topographic threshold envelope, where the slope at the incision head is expressed as a function of drained surface. Therefore, they are considered to be seismic in origin. Most of the other landslides are located along strongly incising river sections. Temporary landslide barriers contribute to irregular river hydrographs. It is concluded that Uvira is threatened by landsliding, potentially massive (> 18 x 10(6) m(3) debris), in the case of heavy seismicity. It is further discussed that the regularisation of the river regime depends on soil and water conservation strategies, to be developed in the headwaters of the torrents Kavimvira, Mulongwe and Kalimabenge.

J	Khoi, DD; Murayama, Y				Khoi, Duong Dang; Murayama, Yuji			Forecasting Areas Vulnerable to Forest Conversion in the Tam Dao National Park Region, Vietnam	REMOTE SENSING												Tam Dao National Park (TDNP) is a remaining primary forest that supports some of the highest levels of biodiversity in Vietnam. Forest conversion due to illegal logging and agricultural expansion is a major problem that is hampering biodiversity conservation efforts in the TDNP region. Yet, areas vulnerable to forest conversion are unknown. In this paper, we predicted areas vulnerable to forest changes in the TDNP region using multi-temporal remote sensing data and a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) with a Markov chain model (MLPNN-M). The MLPNN-M model predicted increasing pressure in the remaining primary forest within the park as well as on the secondary forest in the surrounding areas. The primary forest is predicted to decrease from 18.03% in 2007 to 15.10% in 2014 and 12.66% in 2021. Our results can be used to prioritize locations for future biodiversity conservation and forest management efforts. The combined use of remote sensing and spatial modeling techniques provides an effective tool for monitoring the remaining forests in the TDNP region.

SURFACE AERODYNAMIC TEMPERATURE MODELING OVER RAINFED COTTON	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Evapotranspiration (ET) or latent heat flux (LE) can be spatially estimated as an energy balance (EB) residual for land surfaces using remote sensing inputs. The EB equation requires the estimation of net radiation (R-n), soil heat flux (G), and sensible heat flux (H). R-n and G can be estimated with an acceptable accuracy. In computing H, radiometric surface temperature (T-s) is often used instead of surface aerodynamic temperature (T-o), as T-o is neither measured nor easily estimated. This may cause an underestimation of ET because H will be overestimated as T-s is typically larger than T-o for unstable atmospheric conditions. The objectives of this study were to (1) model T-o to improve the estimation of H and consequently ET for advective environments in the semi-arid Texas High Plains, and (2) assess the accuracy of the T-o model using three different methods (aerodynamic profile, lysimeter, and eddy covariance). A 6.5 m tower platform was used to measure profiles of wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity in and above cotton canopy near a large weighing lysimeter managed under rainfed conditions at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, Texas. The T-o was modeled using H as a residual from the EB at the lysimeter location. Results indicated that T-o was better modeled as a linear function of T-s, air temperature, and surface aerodynamic resistance. Modeled T-o showed a very small estimation error (0.1% mean bias error and 3.8% root mean square error) when compared to T-o values measured using the aerodynamic profile data. Even though excellent results were found in this study, the model is only valid for dryland cotton with a leaf area index ranging from 0.2 to 1.3 m(2) m(-2). Furthermore, more research is needed to expand the T-o model to cover cotton grown under irrigated conditions and showing larger crop percent cover and leaf area index values, and under different environmental and atmospheric conditions.																	2151-0032	2151-0040				MAY-JUN	2010	53	3					759	767										WOS:000280272500011

Remote sensing of structural complexity indices for habitat and species distribution modeling	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Spatial distribution models are increasingly used in ecological studies, but are limited by the poor accuracy of remote sensing (RS) for mapping microhabitat (<0.1 ha) features. Mapping accuracy can be improved by combining advanced RS image-processing techniques with microhabitat data expressed as a structural complexity index (SCI). To test this idea, we used principal components analysis (PCA) and an additive SCI method developed for forest ecology (calculated by re-scaling and summing representative structural variables) to summarize 13 microhabitat-scale (0.04 ha) vegetation structure attributes describing the rare mountain bongo antelope's (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci) habitat in Kenya's Aberdare mountains. Microhabitat data were collected in 127 plots: 37 related to bongo habitat use, 90 from 1 km-spaced grid points representing overall habitat availability and bongo non-presence. We then assessed each SCI's effectiveness for discerning microhabitat variability and bongo habitat selection, using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests for differences in mean SCI scores among plots divided into 4 vegetation classes, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics from logistic regressions. We also examined the accuracy of predicted SCI scores resulting from regression models based on variables derived from a) ASTER imagery processed with spectral mixture and texture analysis, b) an SRTM DEM and c) rainfall data, using the 90 grid plots for model training and the bongo plots as an independent test dataset. Of the five SCIs derived, two performed best: the PCA-derived Canopy Structure Index (CSI) and an additive index summarizing 8 structural variables (AI(8)). CSI and AI(8) showed significant differences between 5 of 6 vegetation class pairs, strong abilities to distinguish bongo-selected from available habitat (AUCs=0.71 (CSI); 0.70 (AI(8))), and predicted scores 60-110% more accurate than reported by other studies using RS to quantify individual microhabitat structural attributes (CSI model R(2)=0.51, RMSE=0.19 (training) and 0.21 (test); AI(8) model R(2)=0.46, RMSE=0.17 (training) and 0.19 (test)). Repeating the Wilcoxon tests and logistic regressions with RS-predicted SCI values showed that AI(8) most effectively preserved the patterns found with the observed SCIs. These results demonstrate that SCIs effectively characterize microhabitat structure and selection, and boost microhabitat mapping accuracy when combined with enhanced RS image-processing techniques. This approach can improve distribution models and broaden their applicability, makes RS more relevant to applied ecology, and shows that processing field data to be more compatible with RS can improve RS-based habitat mapping accuracy.

When droughts occur, serious social conflicts become apparent in relation to water management practices, i.e. whether to use water for irrigation of croplands or for wetland conservation. Mediterranean wetlands in south-eastern Spain are extremely valuable due to the biodiversity and their role as water reservoirs. In this study, land-cover changes in an artificial wetland are analysed for a drought-affected hydrologic year (2004-2005) in comparison to an average hydrologic year (2000-2001) by means of remote sensing techniques. Land-cover components (vegetation, soil and water) obtained from linear spectral unmixing (LSU) were used to detect temporal changes within and outside the "El Hondo" Natural Park wetland. During the drought period significant differences in vegetation, soil and water components were observed within the protected area with respect to outside. This suggests different water management practices within and outside the Park during the drought. The land-cover maps of 2001 and 2005 that were derived from the LSU components highlight these significant land-cover changes, especially within the protected area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

New strategies are required to more effectively select MPA locations and increase the pace of their implementation. Many criteria exist to design MPA networks, but generally, it is recommended that networks conserve a diversity of species selected for, among other attributes, their representativeness, rarity, or endemicity. Because knowledge of species' spatial distribution remains scarce, efficient surrogates are urgently needed. We used five different levels of habitat maps and six spatial scales of analysis to identify under which circumstances habitat data used to design MPA networks for Wallis Island provided better representation of species than random choice alone. Protected-area site selections were derived from a rarity-complementarity algorithm. Habitat surrogacy was tested for commercial fish species, all fish species, commercially harvested invertebrates, corals, and algae species. Efficiency of habitat surrogacy varied by species group, type of habitat map, and spatial scale of analysis. Maps with the highest habitat thematic complexity provided better surrogates than simpler maps and were more robust to changes in spatial scales. Surrogates were most efficient for commercial fishes, corals, and algae but not for commercial invertebrates. Conversely, other measurements of species-habitat associations, such as richness congruence and composition similarities provided weak results. We provide, in part, a habitat-mapping methodology for designation of MPAs for Pacific Ocean islands that are characterized by habitat zonations similar to Wallis. Given the increasing availability and affordability of space-borne imagery to map habitats, our approach could appreciably facilitate and improve current approaches to coral reef conservation and enhance MPA implementation.

How widespread is woody plant encroachment in temperate Australia? Changes in woody vegetation cover in lowland woodland and coastal ecosystems in Victoria from 1989 to 2005	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Encroachment or densification by woody plants affects natural ecosystems around the world. Many studies have reported encroachment in temperate Australia, particularly in coastal ecosystems and grassy woodlands. However, the degree to which published studies reflect broad-scale changes is unknown because most studies intentionally sampled areas with conspicuous densification. We aimed to estimate changes in woody vegetation cover within lowland grassy woodland and coastal ecosystems in Victoria from 1989 to 2005 to determine whether published reports of recent encroachment are representative of broad-scale ecosystem changes. Location All lowland grassy woodland and coastal ecosystems (c. 6.11 x 105 ha) in Victoria, Australia. Four major ecosystems were analysed: Plains woodlands, Herb-rich woodlands, Riverine woodlands and Coastal vegetation. Methods Changes in woody vegetation cover from 1989 to 2005 were assessed based on state-wide vegetation maps and Landsat analyses of woody vegetation cover conducted by the Australian Greenhouse Office's National Carbon Accounting System. The results show changes in woody cover within mapped patches of native vegetation, rather than changes in the extent of woody vegetation resulting from clearing and revegetation. Results When pooled across all ecosystems, woody vegetation increased by 18,730 ha from 1989 to 2005. Woody cover within Riverine woodlands and within Plains woodlands each increased by > 7000 ha. At the patch scale, the mean percentage cover of woody vegetation in each polygon increased by > 5% in all four ecosystems: Riverine woodlands (+9.2% on average), Herb-rich woodlands (+7.6%), Plains woodlands (+6.7%) and Coastal vegetation (+5.9%). Regression models relating degree of encroachment to geographic and climatic variables were extremely weak (r2 < 0.026), indicating that most variation occurred at local scales rather than across broad geographic gradients. Main conclusions At the scale of observation, woody vegetation cover increased in all lowland woodland and coastal ecosystems over the 16-year period. Thus, published examples of encroachment in selected coastal and woodland patches do appear to reflect widespread increases in woody vegetation cover in these ecosystems. This densification appears to be associated with changes in land management rather than with post-fire vegetation recovery and is likely to be ongoing and long-lasting, with substantial implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services.

Increasing population along with the demand for more food, fodder and fuelwood has given rise to a chain of interrelated economic, social and environmental issues associated with the land degradation. Desertification is essentially a result of soil degradation. A variety of natural and human factors are contributing to desertification, including drought, overgrazing, over exploitation of land and water resources, over cultivation of marginal lands, deforestation, soil erosion, water logging and salinity and the use of inappropriate agricultural technologies. The consequences of this are: abandoned croplands, affected by waterlogging and salinity; abandoned villages, traditional irrigation systems and croplands desertified by deteriorated groundwater aquifers or lowering of the water table; siltation of rivers, irrigation systems and reservoirs; landslides in hilly areas. The desertification leads to agricultural productivity losses and enhance poverty. It also causes significant reductions in carbon storage in soils, contributing to global warming, and loss of biodiversity. Various approaches are being applied to combat the menace of desertification. Introduction of rapid growing exotic species of trees and grasses for stabilization of shifting sand dunes; creation of microclimates through shelterbelt plantation have proved highly successful towards the control of desertification. Sustainable land management (SLM), soil and water conservation, afforestation and rehabilitation of degraded land, repetitive high resolution satellite images, delineation and mapping of affected areas, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) arc likely to be suitable strategies for combating desertification in Pakistan. The efforts already underway to combat desertification need to be strengthened and integrated through a nationally supported, coordinated and monitored system.																	1459-0255					APR	2010	8	2	2				1203	1208										WOS:000279103700109

The prominence of and biases in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning research	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The sub-discipline of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) has emerged as a central topic in contemporary ecological research. However, to date no study has evaluated the prominence and publication biases in BEF research. Herein we report the results of a careful quantitative assessment of BEF research published in five core general ecology journals from 1990 to 2007 to determine the position of BEF research within ecology, identify patterns of research effort within BEF research, and discuss their probable proximal and historical causes. The relative importance of BEF publications increased exponentially during the period analyzed and was significantly greater than the average growth of ecological literature, affirming the prominence of BEF as a current paradigm in ecology. However, BEF research exhibited a strong bias toward experimental studies on terrestrial plant communities, with significantly lower effort devoted to the functional aspects of biodiversity in aquatic systems, multiple trophic level systems, and animal or microbial communities. Such trends may be explained by a combination of methodological adequacy and historic epistemological differences in ecological thinking. We suggest that BEF researchers should direct more effort toward the study of aquatic systems and animal communities, emphasize long-term and trophically complex experiments, such as those with multi-trophic microbial communities, employ larger-scale field observational studies and increase the use of integrative and theoretical studies. Many technical and analytical methodologies that are already employed in ecological research, such as stable isotopes, paleobiology, remote sensing, and model selection criteria, can facilitate these aims. Overcoming the above-mentioned shortcomings of current BEF research will greatly improve our ability to predict how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem processes and services in natural ecosystems.

Landscape associations of globally threatened grassland birds in the Aguapey river Important Bird Area, Corrientes, Argentina	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												The Aguapey river basin in the Pampas grasslands of Argentina is the last refuge for a complete assemblage of globally threatened and Near Threatened birds. We evaluated the influence of landscape characteristics on the occurrence and abundance of six globally threatened and Near Threatened passerines. We used point counts to census birds and vegetation and quantified landscape characteristics 1,000 m from the count centres using remote sensing tools. Strange-tailed Tyrants Alectrurus risora were associated with higher percentages of tall-grass Andropogon lateralis in lowland areas. Saffron-cowled Blackbirds Xanthopsar flavus and Black-and-white Monjitas Heteroxolmis dominicana were associated with rolling landscape with wet lowland grasslands and marshes linked with dry upland grasslands. Marsh Seedeater Sporophila palustris and Chestnut Seedeater S. cinnamomea were associated with tall grasslands and marshes. Rufous-throated Seedeater S. ruficollis was not clearly associated with any type of habitat. The Aguapey grasslands are used mainly for livestock grazing and afforestation. Since 1995, approximately 50% of the original grassland habitat has been planted with exotic trees. If this trend continues, Saffron-cowled Blackbirds are likely to become extinct in the Aguapey river basin which currently supports the largest population of this species in Argentina. We recommend guidelines for establishing future reserves and wildlife management actions based on the landscape responses detected in this study. Future action should consider: maintaining connectivity between the Aguapey grasslands and the Ibera Nature Reserve, creating a protected area, designing a land use plan for the basin, avoiding afforestation in large blocks, removal of government incentives for large afforestation projects, and studying the viability of threatened bird populations in extensive cattle ranching areas.																	0959-2709	1474-0001				MAR	2010	20	1					62	73		10.1017/S0959270909990177								WOS:000276172000007

To reduce land degradation, the government has taken a number of conservation and restoration measures, including the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), which was launched in 1999. A logical question is whether these measures have reduced soil erosion at the regional level. The objective of this article is to answer this question by assessing soil erosion dynamics in the Zuli River basin in the Loess Plateau of China from 1999 to 2006. The MMF (Morgan, Morgan and Finney) model was used to simulate changes in runoff and soil erosion over the period of time during which ecological restoration projects were implemented. Some model variables were derived from remotely sensed images to provide improved land surface representation. With an overall accuracy rate of 0.67, our simulations show that increased ground vegetation cover, especially in forestlands and grasslands, has reduced soil erosion by 38.8% on average from 1999 to 2006. During the same time period, however, the change in rainfall pattern has caused a 13.1% +/- A 4.3% increase in soil erosion, resulting in a net 25.7% +/- A 8.5% reduction in soil erosion. This suggests that China's various ecological restoration efforts have been effective in reducing soil loss.																	0364-152X					MAR	2010	45	3					476	487		10.1007/s00267-009-9369-6								WOS:000275789700006	19756858

Spatial analysis of anthropogenic disturbances in mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The dependence of coastal communities on mangrove forests for direct consumptive use due to the scarcity of alternate resources makes them one of the highly disturbed landscapes. This paper examines the spatial characteristics and extent of anthropogenic disturbances affecting the mangrove forests of Bhitarkanika Conservation Area situated along the east coast of India by using remotely sensed data and GIS, supplemented with socioeconomic surveys. The study reveals that resource extractions from these forests were considerable despite the protected status. Around 14% of the total fuel wood consumed annually in each of the household came from the mangrove forests of the Park. The patterns of consumption were spatially heterogeneous, controlled by the availability of alternatives, ease of accessibility, presence of markets, human density, and forest composition. The disturbance surface showed 30% of the major forest classes to be under high to very high levels of disturbance especially at easy access points. Besides, the distribution of economically useful species also determined the degree of disturbance. Resource use surfaces clearly identified the biotic pressure zones with respect to specific mangrove use and could be combined with the disturbance regime map to prioritize areas for mangrove restoration.																	0255-660X					MAR	2010	38	1					67	83		10.1007/s12524-010-0013-y								WOS:000281393500007

The lesser of two evils: seasonal migrations of Amazonian manatees in the Western Amazon	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We investigated the paradox of why Amazonian manatees Trichechus inunguis undergo seasonal migrations to a habitat where they apparently fast. Ten males were tracked using VHF telemetry between 1994 and 2006 in the Mamiraua and Amana Sustainable Development Reserves, constituting the only long-term dataset on Amazonian manatee movements in the wild. Their habitat was characterized by analysing aquatic space and macrophyte coverage dynamics associated with the annual flood-pulse cycle of the River Solimoes. Habitat information came from fieldwork, two hydrographs, a three-dimensional model of the water bodies and classifications of Landsat-TM/ETM+ images. We show that during high-water season (mid-May to end-June), males stay in varzea lakes in association with macrophytes, which they select. We then show that, during low-water (October-November), the drastic reduction in aquatic space in the varzea leads to the risk of their habitat drying out and increases the manatees' vulnerability to predators such as caimans, jaguars and humans. This explains why males migrate to Ria Amana. Based on data on illegal hunting, we argue that this habitat variability influences females to migrate too. We then use published knowledge of the environment's dynamics to argue that when water levels are high, the habitats that can support the largest manatee populations are the varzeas of white-water rivers, and we conjecture that rias are the species' main low-water refuges throughout Western Amazonia. Finally, we warn that the species may be at greater risk than previously thought, because migration and low-water levels make manatees particularly vulnerable to hunters. Moreover, because the flooding regime of Amazonian rivers is strongly related to large-scale climatic phenomena, there might be a perilous connection between climate change and the future prospects for the species. Our experience reveals that the success of research and conservation of wild Amazonian manatees depends on close working relationships with local inhabitants.																	0952-8369	1469-7998				MAR	2010	280	3					247	256		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00655.x								WOS:000274412100003

The net ecosystem carbon exchange of human-modified environments in the Australian Capital Region	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												As part of a larger study to quantify and map ecosystem services in southeast Australia, we estimated carbon stored in biomass and soils and the net ecosystem carbon exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere in the Australian Capital Region (ACR). Our aim was to understand and quantify how different human-modified landscapes provide an essential ecosystem service: the exchange and storage of carbon in the landscape. Using a remote sensing based modelling methodology, we obtained values of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), total carbon in soil and biomass and carbon turnover from meteorological and terrain inputs and vegetation attributes. We obtained a set of maps of NPP, total carbon (C) storage and C-turnover for the ACR. We superimposed a land use/cover map to assign the uptake, storage and release of carbon to different land use/cover types. Our results support the hypothesis that human-intensive land uses significantly affect the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to provide an important ecosystem service in the form of carbon storage.

New methodology based on satellite data	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												One of the most urgent priorities in the conservation and management of biodiversity in Europe is the assessment of landscape conservation conditions, as well as the analysis of landscape changes. Europe is characterised by the heterogeneous nature of its cultural landscapes. We approached the monitoring and management of habitats and landscapes in the European Atlantic Biogeographical Region at landscape level, using a new methodology which integrates geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing, environmental variables and landscape ecology. The analysis focuses on the biosphere reserve known as Terras do Mino (NW Iberian Peninsula) using two main criteria: a classification scheme based on the pan-European system EUNIS (European Nature Information System) and ecologically meaningful units of analysis, and the assessment of landscape change based on landscape indicators and conservation criteria. Spatial indices, contagion, fractal dimension and dominance, reveal a fragmentation process, occurring at sub-regional level. This process has mainly affected forests and scrublands in the area under study. Our results show the traditional landscape is declining and there is a drop in the habitats of greatest environmental interest. The methodological approach proposed in this paper will facilitate comparative analyses with those changes that may occur in other natural regions within Europe. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mondal, P; Southworth, J				Mondal, Pinki; Southworth, Jane			Protection vs. commercial management: Spatial and temporal analysis of land cover changes in the tropical forests of Central India	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical forests worldwide are undergoing rapid changes due to increasing human populations and varied land use practices. In an effort to protect these forests and their species, the number of protected areas has increased exponentially in recent decades. Clearly protected areas play a crucial role in conservation efforts and this strategy has been found to be successful in several studies. However, protected areas are often embedded within a matrix of other land cover types, including non-protected forests, agricultural fields, or urban areas. It is therefore critical for park management to think beyond the borders of their protected areas and work to maintain ecological integrity of the surrounding matrix and the connectivity between protected areas. This study integrates remote sensing, GIS and field observations to examine the effects of different management strategies on land cover changes. As a case study we examine a tiger reserve in Central India which is surrounded by commercially managed forests, representative of many protected areas throughout India. Findings of this study show that while protected areas play an important role in conservation, alternative approaches including favorable management policies could also be effective to extend conservation over larger areas.

J	Saptarshi, PG; Raghavendra, RK				Saptarshi, Praveen G.; Raghavendra, Rao Kumar			Comparative assessment of micro-watershed silt load with morphological parameters to evaluate soil conservation strategies	CURRENT SCIENCE												The comparative assessment of morphologic runoff and annual silt load from micro-watersheds can help in establishing relationships between these parameters with objectives of controlling runoff, conservation of soil, reduction of reservoir silt load and enhanced ground-water resources in the micro-watersheds. The automated watershed delineation technique using the filled digital elevation model is observed to be reliable for area having converging slopes. The estimation of watershed based annual silt load using universal soil loss equation along with runoff estimation utilizing the soil conservation services model using remote sensing data is possible on such automatically delineated micro-watershed groups. This can be validated through ground measurements. The output in raster geographic information system (GIS) is highly beneficial in making an inventory of soil loss, runoff and morphologic parameters with an objective of establishing relationship between these parameters for planning conservation measures. The GIS output products like soil-erosion potential map, run-off potential map, etc. obtained by using raster interpolation techniques are of value addition for developing and harnessing natural resources enabling sustainable development.																	0011-3891					FEB 10	2010	98	3					417	426										WOS:000275619100026

Previous literatures have demonstrated that many factors may cause wetland change and argued that the global climate change and nutrient enrichment may become the most important ones in the next 50 years. Through field investigation, with the help of remote sensing technology and geographic information system, this research discusses the wetland change in Tianjin under the great pressure of rapid economic development, population growth, and sea-level rising. These findings include: (1) the wetland area expanded from 466.50 km(2) to 658.38 km(2) between 1987 and 1998, but it shrank to 550.5 km(2) by the year of 2006. (2) The results show that the groundwater has not been contaminated while the surface water has been polluted. (3) The questionnaire survey shows that the social environment in some specific ways impedes the protection of natural reserve. In order to achieve the harmony between human and nature, feasible countermeasures on how to keep ecological balance should be immediately taken. Consequently, natural conservation and sustainable economic development will be realized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Knoll, Y; Yavneh, I				Knoll, Yehonatan; Yavneh, Irad			Scale covariant physics: a 'quantum deformation' of classical electrodynamics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL												We present a deformation of classical electrodynamics, continuously depending on a 'quantum parameter', featuring manifest gauge, Poincare and scale covariance. The theory, dubbed extended charge dynamics (ECD), associates a certain length scale with each charge which, due to scale covariance, is an attribute of a solution, not a parameter of the theory. When the EM field experienced by an ECD charge is slowly varying over that length scale, the dynamics of the charge reduces to classical dynamics, its emitted radiation reduces to the familiar Lienard-Wiechert potential and the above length scale is identified as the charge's Compton length. It is conjectured that quantum mechanics describes statistical aspects of ensembles of ECD solutions, much like classical thermodynamics describes statistical aspects of ensembles of classical solutions. A unique 'remote sensing' feature of ECD, supporting that conjecture, is presented, along with an explanation for the illusion of a photon within a classical treatment of the EM field. Finally, a novel conservation law associated with the scale covariance of ECD is derived, indicating that the scale of a solution may 'drift' with time at a constant rate, much like translation covariance implies a uniform drift of the (average) position.																	1751-8113					FEB 5	2010	43	5							055401	10.1088/1751-8113/43/5/055401								WOS:000273638900020

Spatial variability of above-ground net primary production in Uruguayan grasslands: a remote sensing approach	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How does above-ground net primary production (ANPP) differ (estimated from remotely sensed data) among vegetation units in sub-humid temperate grasslands? Location: Centre-north Uruguay. Methods: A vegetation map of the study area was generated from LANDSAT imagery and the landscape configuration described. The functional heterogeneity of mapping units was analysed in terms of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (fPAR), calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images provided by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Finally, the ANPP of each grassland class was estimated using NDVI and climatic data. Results: Supervised classification presented a good overall accuracy and moderate to good average accuracy for grassland classes. Meso-xerophytic grasslands occupied 45% of the area, Meso-hydrophytic grasslands 43% and Lithophytic steppes 6%. The landscape was shaped by a matrix of large, unfragmented patches of Meso-xerophytic and Meso-hydrophytic grasslands. The region presented the lowest anthropic fragmentation degree reported for the Rio de la Plata grasslands. All grassland units showed bimodal annual fPAR seasonality, with spring and autumn peaks. Meso-hydrophytic grasslands showed a radiation interception 10% higher than the other units. On an annual basis, Meso-hydrophytic grasslands produced 3800 kg dry matter (DM) ha(-1) yr(-1) and Meso-xerophytic grasslands and Lithophytic steppes around 3400 kg.DM.ha(-1).yr(-1). Meso-xerophytic grasslands had the largest spatial variation during most of the year. The ANPP temporal variation was higher than the fPAR variability. Conclusions: Our results provide valuable information for grazing management (identifying spatial and temporal variations of ANPP) and grassland conservation (identifying the spatial distribution of vegetation units).

Building large-scale spatially explicit models to predict the distribution of suitable habitat patches for the Greater rhea (Rhea americana), a near-threatened species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												We developed large-scale spatially explicit models to predict the distribution of suitable habitat patches for the Greater rhea (Rhea americana), a near-threatened species, in two areas of central Argentina with different land use: a grassland area (ca. 4943 km(2)) mainly devoted to cattle grazing and an agro-ecosystem area (ca. 4006 km(2)) mostly used for crop production. The models were developed using logistic regression and were based on current records of Greater rhea occurrence coupled with remote sensing data, including land cover and human presence variables. The habitat suitability maps generated were used to predict the suitable habitat patch structure for wild rhea populations in each area. Fifty-one percent of the total grassland area was suitable for the species, being represented by a single large patch that included 62% of the individual locations. In the agro-ecosystem, only 28% of the total area was suitable, which was distributed among four patches. Seventy percent of rhea observations were in suitable habitat, with all rheas grouped in the largest patch. Conservation efforts for preserving wild rhea populations should be focused on maintaining habitats similar to grasslands, which are less profitable for landowners at present. Consequently, the protection of the pampas grasslands, a key habitat for this species as well as for others with similar habitat requirements, will demand strong conservation actions through the reconciliation of interests between producers and conservationists, since the proportion of croplands is increasing.

Ensemble models of habitat suitability relate chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) conservation to forest and landscape dynamics in Western Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Pan troglodytes verus is considered one of the most endangered primates in the world due to habitat loss or degradation, and it is considered extinct in several regions of West-Africa. This study aims at developing a model that predicts habitat suitability for chimpanzee under different land cover scenarios and supports a multi-temporal analysis of the recent habitat evolution in southern Guinea-Bissau. The model, built using a maximum entropy framework, is spatially explicit, uses eco-geographic variables derived from landscape compositional, structural and functional attributes, and is based on nest location data collected in the field. The results show that the developed model has good levels of reliability and the map produced through its application reveals a current extension of 752 km(2) of adequate habitat in a 2723 km(2) study area. Forest related EGVs (ecogeographical variables) had the higher importance for the model production. Habitat suitability maps produced for three dates in the last three decades show that there has been a marked decrease in habitat extension and in connectivity to neighbouring regions. We analyse the implications of these results in possible strategies for the conservation of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zheng, DL; Heath, LS; Ducey, MJ; Butler, B				Zheng, Daolan; Heath, Linda S.; Ducey, Mark J.; Butler, Brett			Relationships Between Major Ownerships, Forest Aboveground Biomass Distributions, and Landscape Dynamics in the New England Region of USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This study utilizes remote sensing derived forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates and ownership information obtained from the Protected Areas Database (PAD), combining landscape analyses and GIS techniques to demonstrate how different ownerships (public, regulated private, and other private) relate to the spatial distribution of AGB in New England states of the USA. "Regulated private" lands were dominated by lands in Maine covered by a Land Use Regulatory Commission. The AGB means between all pairs of the identified ownership categories were significantly different (P < 0.05). Mean AGB observed in public lands (156 Mg/ha) was 43% higher than that in regulated private lands (109 Mg/ha), or 30% higher than that of private lands as a whole. Seventy-seven percent of the regional forests (or about 9,300 km(2)) with AGB > 200 Mg/ha were located outside the area designated in the PAD and concentrated in western MA, southern VT, southwestern NH, and northwestern CT. While relatively unfragmented and high-AGB forests (> 200 Mg/ha) accounted for about 8% of total forested land, they were unevenly proportioned among the three major ownership groups across the region: 19.6% of the public land, 0.8% of the regulated private land, and 11.0% of the other private land. Mean disturbance rates (in absolute value) between 1992 and 2001 were 16, 66, and 19 percent, respectively, on public, regulated private, and other private land. This indicates that management practices from different ownerships have a strong impact on dynamic changes of landscape structures and AGB distributions. Our results may provide insight information for policy makers on issues regarding forest carbon management, conservation biology, and biodiversity studies at regional level.

Remotely-Sensed Active Fire Data for Protected Area Management: Eight-Year Patterns in the Manas National Park, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands, which once extended along most of the Himalayan foothills, now only remain in a number of protected areas. Within these localities, grassland burning is a major issue, but data on frequency and distribution of fires are limited. Here, we analysed the incidence of active fires, which only occur during the dry season (Nov.-Mar.), within a significant area of Terai grasslands: the Manas National Park (MNP), India. We obtained locations of 781 fires during the 2000-2008 dry seasons, from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) that delivers global MODIS hotspot/fire locations using remote sensing and GIS technologies. Annual number of fires rose significantly from around 20 at the start of the study period to over 90 after 2002, with most (85%) detected between December and January. Over half of the fires occurred in tall grasslands, but fire density was highest in wetland and riverine vegetation, dry at the time. Most burning took place near rivers, roads and the park boundary, suggesting anthropogenic origins. A kernel density map of all recorded fires indicated three heavily burnt areas in the MNP, all within the tall grasslands. Our study demonstrates, despite some technical caveats linked to fire detection technology, which is improving, that remote fire data can be a practical tool in understanding fire concentration and burning temporal patterns in highly vulnerable habitats, useful in guiding management.																	0364-152X					FEB	2010	45	2					414	423		10.1007/s00267-009-9411-8								WOS:000274399400018	20016983

Predicting coral bleaching in response to environmental stressors using 8 years of global-scale data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Coral reefs have experienced extensive mortality over the past few decades as a result of temperature-induced mass bleaching events. There is an increasing realization that other environmental factors, including water mixing, solar radiation, water depth, and water clarity, interact with temperature to either exacerbate bleaching or protect coral from mass bleaching. The relative contribution of these factors to variability in mass bleaching at a global scale has not been quantified, but can provide insights when making large-scale predictions of mass bleaching events. Using data from 708 bleaching surveys across the globe, a framework was developed to predict the probability of moderate or severe bleaching as a function of key environmental variables derived from global-scale remote-sensing data. The ability of models to explain spatial and temporal variability in mass bleaching events was quantified. Results indicated approximately 20% improved accuracy of predictions of bleaching when solar radiation and water mixing, in addition to elevated temperature, were incorporated into models, but predictive accuracy was variable among regions. Results provide insights into the effects of environmental parameters on bleaching at a global scale.																	0167-6369					FEB	2010	161	1-4					423	438		10.1007/s10661-009-0758-3								WOS:000273399900035	19267212

Unfortunately, this assumption does not hold in a number of practical applications, where sensors may consume even more energy than the radio. In this context, effective energy management should include policies for an efficient utilization of the sensors, which become one of the main components that affect the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm that estimates online the optimal sampling frequencies for sensors. This approach, which requires the design of adaptive measurement systems, minimizes the energy consumption of the sensors and, incidentally, that of the radio while maintaining a very high accuracy of collected data. As a case study, we considered a sensor for snow-monitoring applications. Simulation experiments have shown that the suggested adaptive algorithm can reduce the number of acquired samples up to 79% with respect to a traditional fixed-rate approach. We have also found that it can perform similar to a fixed-rate scheme where the sampling frequency is known in advance.																	0018-9456					FEB	2010	59	2					335	344		10.1109/TIM.2009.2023818								WOS:000273565700010

Harnessing wireless sensor technologies to advance forest ecology and agricultural research	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Over the past few decades, wireless technologies have revolutionized personal communications by improving flexibility and solving myriad logistical constraints. Recently, wireless sensor technologies have begun offering similar enhancements to communications between the scientist and the environment. This includes monitoring of civil structures and natural ecosystems. Although forest biology has benefited from novel technologies such as remote sensing and GIS, many 'on the ground' sensing technologies have not changed in many decades. What can wireless sensor networks offer the forest and agricultural scientist? We suggest at least three benefits: improved experimental design via flexible equipment deployment, improved monitoring access in logistically challenging environments (i.e. tall tree canopies) and increased density of observations for better validation of models and hypotheses. Here we briefly describe the current state of wireless environmental monitoring from an end-user point of view and report our initial attempts to adapt this cutting-edge technology to the realm of forest research.

Testing hypotheses about the distribution of herbivores is hampered by the absence of reliable methods for measuring the variability of vegetation quality (e.g. biochemical composition) across the landscape. It is demonstrated that hyperspectral remote sensing fills this gap by revealing simultaneously the spatial variation of foliar nitrogen (crude protein) as well as the total amount of polyphenols, in grasses and trees. For the first time, the pattern of resources important for feeding preferences in herbivores (polyphenols and nitrogen) is mapped across an extensive landscape and the modeled foliar concentrations are shown to fit with ecological knowledge of the area. We explain how estimates of nitrogen (crude protein) and polyphenols may be scaled up from point-based observations to reveal their spatial pattern, and how the variation in forage quality can influence the management of savannas, including farms, communal grazing areas, and conservation areas. It provides a glimpse of the choices herbivores must face in selecting food resources of different qualities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y.; Yang, Felix Y.; Wang, Liming			Social-Ecological Impacts of Concurrent Reservoir Inundation and Reforestation in the Three Gorges Region of China	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS												The Three Gorges Project (TGP) in the mountainous middle reach of the Yangtze River entailed large dam construction and farmland inundation by reservoir. Concurrently, national policy mandated defarming and reforesting extensive erosion-prone slope farmlands in the region. This study evaluated social-ecological impacts of two parallel land-cover change projects on farmland supply, carrying capacity, resettlement, and alternative employment. The integrated research adopted field assessment, interviews, questionnaire surveys, and remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. Analysis of high-resolution QuickBird images and thematic maps generated digital maps on land use, farmland quality, and standardized farmland. The two projects, development versus conservation, accentuated and disseminated impacts on rural communities. Reservoir inundation eliminated the best farmlands in riverside villages and aggravated population pressure. Widespread poor farmlands on steep slopes required extensive defarming and reforestation. The double blow reduced carrying capacity and brought economic hardship in impoverished areas. Villages beset by farmland deficits encountered difficulty decanting the surplus population because of resistance to intervillage and nonlocal resettlement. Migrant labor, as transient rural-urban migration operating outside the official regime, offered alternative employment and supplementary income to alleviate overpopulation and poverty. This safety valve was neither equally accessible to households nor assisted by the government. The simultaneous execution of resettlement and reforestation called for a systematic rural-urban migration program, engagement of local people in policy formulation, and provision of incentives in the form of long-term market benefits and livelihood assurances. The findings offered hints and precautions on the joint implementation of major land-cover change projects in developing regions.

FUZZY AND BOOLEAN FOREST MEMBERSHIP: ON THE ACTUAL SEPARABILITY OF LAND COVER CLASSES	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Forests are among the most important habitats of the Earth for several ecological reasons and their management is a prior task when dealing with landscape conservation. Thematic maps and remote sensing data are powerful tools to be used in landscape planning and forest management; nevertheless, most of the European and Mediterranean forest monitoring and conservation programs do not take into account the continuity of the variation of habitats within the landscape but they only rely on boolean classification methods. The utilisation of a classification method that applies a continuity criterion is fundamental because it is expected to better represent the ecological gradients within a landscape. The aim of this paper is to assess the amount of classification uncertainty related to crisp (boolean) classes, particularly focusing on forest identification uncertainty. Forest fuzzy membership of the Tuscany region (Italy) derived from a Landsat ETM+ image scene was compared with the widely used crisp datasets in European forests management and conservation practices, i.e. the European JRC Forest/Non-Forest map, the CORINE Land Cover 2000 (levels 1 and 2), as well as the Global Land Cover 2000, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the separability of crisp classes with respect to forest fuzzy membership. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) forest fuzzy membership separability among the considered crisp classes was found. Despite the crisp dataset and hierarchical level taken into account, both forest and non-forest crisp classes showed a high degree of forest fuzzy membership variability. Therefore, given the intrinsic mixture of crisp land cover classes, ecological studies on forestal ecosystems should rigorously take into account the classification uncertainty related to a crisp view of ecological entities which are being mapped.

The Importance of Defining 'Forest': Tropical Forest Degradation, Deforestation, Long-term Phase Shifts, and Further Transitions	BIOTROPICA												While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products).																	0006-3606					JAN	2010	42	1					10	20		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00567.x								WOS:000273301100003						
J	Altamirano, A; Lara, A				Altamirano, Adison; Lara, Antonio			Deforestation in temperate ecosystems of pre-Andean range of south-central Chile	BOSQUE												A multitemporal analysis to determine the land cover change was conduced in the pre-Andean range of Maule region of Chile. We used satellite imagery from the year 1989 and 2003 to analyze the likely causes of native forest change. In this period, there was a reduction in native forest area of 44% in the study area, which is equivalent to an annual forest loss rate of 4.1%. The native forest area is replaced by shrublands (29%) and exotic forest plantations (27%). A great proportion of current exotic forest plantations are established on lands that were native forest in 1989 (63%). Most forest loss was associated with intermediate elevation and less distance to road network, where native forest area dominated. Native forest replacing by shrublands was associated to selective forest logging and firewood, which leads to degradation of these forests. Native forest replacing by exotic forest plantations was the result of the forestation incentive and an increase in the demand for forest products such as wood and pulp. Because of multiple impacts of the forest loss, we propose to focus the government incentives. Priority areas for incentives must be characterized by high forest loss rate and poverty, presence of threatened species and low availability of water from catchments. Moreover, we propose to prioritize the connectivity of the current network protected areas and to develop an effective forest management monitoring system using advanced technologies.																	0717-9200						2010	31	1					53	64		10.4067/S0717-92002010000100007								WOS:000277434400007

Warming Seas in the Coral Triangle: Coral Reef Vulnerability and Management Implications	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The highest diversity coral reefs in the world, located in the Coral Triangle, are threatened by a variety of local stresses including pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing in addition to climate change impacts, such as increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and ocean acidification. As climate change impacts increase, coral reef vulnerability at the ecoregional scale will have an increasingly important influence on conservation management decisions. This project provides the first detailed assessment of past and future climatic stress, thermal variability, and anthropogenic impacts in the Coral Triangle at the ecoregional level, thus incorporating both local (e.g., pollution, development, and overfishing) and global threats (increasing SSTs). The development of marine protected area (MPA) networks across the Coral Triangle is critical for the region to address these threats. Specific management recommendations are defined for MPA networks based on the levels of vulnerability to thermal and local stress. For example, coral reef regions with potentially low vulnerability to thermal stress may be priorities for establishment of MPA networks, whereas high vulnerability regions may require selection and design principles aimed at building resilience to climate change. The identification of climate and other human threats to coral reef systems and ecoregions can help conservation practitioners prioritize management responses to address these threats and identify gaps in MPA networks or other management mechanisms (e. g., integrated coastal management).

Beyond the 'woody remnant' paradigm in conservation of woodland birds: habitat requirements of the Hooded Robin (Melanodryas cucullata cucullata)	EMU												Declines in populations of woodland birds in southern Australia have generally been attributed to historical and ongoing reductions in the area of tree cover and increasing fragmentation of timbered remnants. The extent of native grassy ground cover has received much less attention in studies of fragmentation despite the fact that a large proportion of declining woodland bird species forage predominantly within this stratum. In this study, records of the south-eastern subspecies of the Hooded Robin (Melanodryas cucullata cucullata), a subspecies formally recognised as threatened in New South Wales, were examined in relation to vegetation structure and configuration in the NSW South Western Slopes Bioregion. Logistic regression models were constructed using a presence-absence dataset derived from Atlas of NSW Wildlife records and recent bird surveys and a small number of variables representing broad categories of native vegetation cover, including grassy ground cover. The models indicate a positive association between the presence of the Hooded Robin and the edges of open vegetation dominated by ungrazed or lightly grazed grassy ground cover in which species of native perennial tussock-grass predominate, adjoining timbered native vegetation cover, on moderately deep to deep soils. The study highlights the need to account for the range of vegetation types and conditions in variegated landscapes when investigating the habitat requirements of declining woodland birds, rather than relying on a simple binary 'woody/non-woody' classification.																	0158-4197						2010	110	2					118	124		10.1071/MU09051								WOS:000278020200002

With the economic development and construction in Turkey, forests, agricultural as well as green areas have been damaged. Without prudential planning, the natural environment could not be protected. In this study, remote sensing was utilized to ascertain whether urbanization damaged areas in one of the greenest provinces of Turkey, how the land was used, and, particularly, how the plains that could be used as agricultural areas were used. As a result of the conducted research, it is seen that the forest area has been protected over 22 years, 63% of the land is covered with trees including hazelnut fields. Furthermore, settlement areas were developed to a considerable extent in the last 9 years but this development took place in Duzce Plain which is largely used as agricultural area. This is the most negative situation evident in Duzce. Once again, this study puts forward the benefits of remote sensing in urban growth and environmental management.																	1018-4619						2010	19	7					1312	1319										WOS:000280514100013

An integrated approach for prioritization of reservoir catchment using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												This study is aimed at evolving a watershed prioritization of reservoir catchment based on vegetation, morphological and topographical parameters, and average annual soil loss using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. A large multipurpose river valley project, Upper Indravati reservoir, situated in the state of Orissa, India, has been chosen for the present work. Watershed prioritization is useful to soil conservationist and decision makers. This study integrates the watershed erosion response model (WERM) and universal soil loss equation (USLE) with a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate the erosion risk assessment parameters of the catchment. The total catchment is divided into 15 sub-watersheds. Various erosion risk parameters are determined for all the sub-watersheds separately. Average annual soil loss is also estimated for the sub-watersheds using USLE. The integrated effect of all these parameters is evaluated to recommend the priority rating of the watersheds for soil conservation planning.																	1010-6049						2010	25	2					149	168		10.1080/10106040903015798								WOS:000208629900006

Using remote sensing imagery to determine the impact of land cover changes on potential runoff for the Mid-Cibolo Creek watershed, Texas	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Land cover changes within watersheds have the potential to produce dramatic changes in surface hydrology, namely runoff, in the event of storms. The Mid-Cibolo Creek watershed in south-central Texas has experienced extensive land-cover change in the past two decades due to mass residential development and land clearing in the wake of urban growth along the I-35 corridor. This study determined land-cover changes within the basin using supervised classification to classify land cover from LANDSAT images for the years 1986 and 1999. Changes in runoff volume were then calculated using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) runoff equation for a series of rainfall scenarios. The results showed that an overall increase in impervious cover and decrease in natural vegetative cover has occurred leading to larger runoff volumes for all storm scenarios. The findings are important for watershed scale urban expansion and land clearing practices as current methods suggest that flood risk is increased.																	1010-6049						2010	25	7					543	554		10.1080/10106049.2010.507822								WOS:000208630400004

The use of remote sensing to quantify wetland loss in the Choke Mountain range, Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services such as storing and regulating water flows and water quality, providing unique habitats to flora and fauna, and regulating micro-climatic conditions. Conversion of wetlands for agricultural use is a widespread practice in Ethiopia, particularly in the southwestern part where wetlands cover large areas. Although there are many studies on land cover and land use changes in this region, comprehensive studies on wetlands are still missing. Hence, extent and rate of wet-land loss at regional scales is unknown. The objective of this paper is to quantify wetland dynamics and estimate wetland loss in the Choke Mountain range (area covering 17 443 km(2)) in the Upper Blue Nile basin, a key headwater region of the river Nile. Therefore, satellite remote sensing imagery of the period 1986-2005 were considered. To create images of surface reflectance that are radiometrically consistent, a combination of cross-calibration and atmospheric correction (Vogelman-DOS3) methods was used. A hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach was used to classify the images. Overall accuracies of 94.1% and 93.5% and Kappa Coefficients of 0.908 and 0.913 for the 1986 and 2005 imageries, respectively were obtained. The results showed that 607 km(2) of seasonal wetland with low moisture and 22.4 km2 of open water are lost in the study area during the period 1986 to 2005. The current situation in the wetlands of Choke Mountain is characterized by further degradation which calls for wetland conservation and rehabilitation efforts through incorporating wetlands into watershed management plans.

To decrease the risk on environmental impacts, there is an increasing demand for sound, and readily applicable techniques for soil conservation planning in this area. This study was conducted at the Weigou River basin in northwestern China to predict annual soil loss using the RUSLE to determine the erosion hazard in the area and target locations for appropriate initiation of conservation measures. All factors used in RUSLE were calculated for the basin using local data. The rainfall erosivity R-factor was 607.4 MJ mm ha(-1)h(-1)year(-1) and the annual average soil erodibility K-factor has been drawn from the soil map. LS factor has been estimated according to the RUSLE model by using a 25-m square cell DEM. C factor has been derived by processing the data inferred from the land cover map, whose legend includes 12 different land uses type interpreted from remote sensing images. Support practice P-factors were from terraces that exist on slopes where crops is grown. Resulting soil loss map revealed that spatial average soil erosion at the basin was 95.59 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1998 and 93.4t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2004, while the estimated sediment yield was found to be 280.92x10(4)t and 274.60x10(4)t respectively. Soil erosion is serious respectively from 15 to 25 of slope degree, elevation area from 1800 to 1900 meters, where is the particular area of soil and water loss prevention. As far as land use is concerned, soil losses are highest in dry crop land and those in resident area are second. The results of the study provide useful information for decision makers and planners to take appropriate land management measures in the area.																	1079-8587						2010	16	6			SI		857	867										WOS:000283468800002

Use of remote sensing and GIS for improved natural resources management: case study from different agroecological zones of West Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Historical and recent aerial photograph and satellite images were analysed to study the change of land use/land cover and soil degradation in different agroecological zones of Nigeria and Benin. The sites were characterized by an expansion of farmland at the expense of forest and shrub, fallow and uncultivated land, at an increasing rate due to population growth, food demand and land scarcity. Sheet and gully erosion were the consequences of the land use intensification and have destroyed extensive areas of farmland and grazing land. Reduced agricultural and livestock production, declining revenue, as well as increased conflict from resource competition between farmers and pastoralists are expected for the future. To combat these problems, improved land use management through continuing land inventory, generating an environmental database, developing land use plans and controlling erosion through adequate soil conservation measures are recommended.

Random Forest characterization of upland vegetation and management burning from aerial imagery	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The upland moorlands of Great Britain form distinctive landscapes of international conservation importance, comprising mosaics of heathland, acid grassland, blanket bog and bracken. Much of this landscape is managed by rotational burning to create gamebird habitat and there is concern over whether this is driving long-term changes in upland vegetation communities. However, the inaccessibility and scale of uplands means that monitoring changes in vegetation and burning practices is difficult. We aim to overcome this problem by developing methods to classify aerial imagery into high-resolution maps of dominant vegetation cover, including the distribution of burns on managed grouse moors. Location Peak District National Park, England, UK. Methods Colour and infrared aerial photographs were classified into seven dominant land-cover classes using the Random Forest ensemble machine learning algorithm. In addition, heather (Calluna vulgaris) was further differentiated into growth phases, including sites that were newly burnt. We then analysed the distributions of the vegetation classes and managed burning using detrended correspondence analysis. Results Classification accuracy was c. 95% and produced a 5-m resolution map for 514 km2 of moorland. Cover classes were highly aggregated and strong nonlinear effects of elevation and slope and weaker effects of aspect and bedrock type were evident in structuring moorland vegetation communities. The classification revealed the spatial distribution of managed burning and suggested that relatively steep areas may be disproportionately burnt. Main conclusions Random Forest classification of aerial imagery is an efficient method for producing high-resolution maps of upland vegetation. These may be used to monitor long-term changes in vegetation and management burning and infer species-environment relationships and can therefore provide an important tool for effective conservation at the landscape scale.

The remote sensing data revealed that in the submergence zone only mixed deciduous forest that occupies 807.5ha area and has a wood biomass volume of 4,027,503m3 is likely to be lost due to impoundment. A total of 165 plant species found in the submergence zone also occur in the influence and free draining catchment area of the project. In the influence zone of the project area only one tree species (Acer oblongum) is found under conservation threat category, which is also present in the free draining catchment of the project. The project affected population (6716 people) residing in the submergence and influence zone depend upon the surrounding forests for fuel wood, fodder, wild edibles etc., and most likely they will settle in the nearby areas, thus mounting more pressure on residual forests of the influence zone for various forest products. Further, from the vegetation analysis it is evident that several tree species (e.g. Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata, T. bellerica etc.), may face more pressure from exploitation as they provide a number of useful products and are represented in lower numbers in the forests of the project area. To compensate for the loss of various goods and services provided by the forests falling in the submergence zone and to offset the increased pressure of the project affected families on the forests of influence zone, a biodiversity management plan is suggested incorporating socio-economic considerations.																	0964-0568						2010	53	7					907	923	PII 925289436	10.1080/09640568.2010.490060								WOS:000281729300006

Characterizing the diversity of coral reef habitats and fish communities found in a UNESCO World Heritage Site: The strategy developed for Lagoons of New Caledonia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Since 1972, the UNESCO "World Heritage Convention" offers an international canvas for conservation and management that targets areas of high cultural and environmental significance. To support the designation of areas within the 36.000 km(2) of New Caledonia coral reefs and lagoons as a World Heritage Site, the natural value and diversity of the proposed zones needed to be demonstrated. To exhaustively identify each configuration of shallow habitats, high resolution remote sensing images were used to select the sampling sites. This optimal scheme resulted in the selection of nearly 1300 sampling sites, and was then simplified to render its application realistic. In the final sampling plan, only the most common or the most remarkable coral zones were selected. Following this selection, in situ habitat and fish surveys were conducted in 2006-2008 in five large areas spanning a 600 km-long latitudinal gradient. Habitats were described using line-intercept transects in parallel with underwater visual census of indicator and commercial coral reef fish species. We report here on the results achieved in terms of: (i) the actual diversity of coral habitats captured by the remote sensing based sampling strategy, (ii) the different reef fish communities captured from the different sites, and (iii) how well they represent New Caledonia diversity. We discuss the possible generalization of this scheme to other sites, in the context of World Heritage Site selection and for other large-scale conservation planning activities.

Because large rivers and their dynamics bind the floodplain together, the method most go beyond simple inventory of remnant patches to evaluate flood processes and identify constraints in the surrounding watersheds. We develop such a method for a three million hectare watershed in New England using a combination of data types to evaluate key attributes of floodplain systems. Riparian and floodplain communities were modeled using a GIS analysis of river valley topography and riverine processes, and floodplain forest occurrences were identified in a classification and regression (CART) analysis. Current flooding was verified using overlays of remotely sensed imagery of spring and fall water levels. We evaluated the intactness of the floodplain occurrences using ratios of upstream dam storage to annual runoff, the length of the connected stream network, and the naturalness of surrounding land cover. Field-assigned ranks of forest quality were correlated with the Occurrence size, percent verified flooding, and percent natural cover. Predicted quality ranks reinforced the importance of these factors. Results indicate that the twenty top-ranking streams collectively contain 75 high quality areas Suitable for floodplain forest restoration and conservation. Independent verification of these areas strongly corroborated our results.																	0885-8608					JAN	2010	30	1					39	52		10.3375/043.030.0105								WOS:000274223600005

Landslides and vegetation cover in the 2005 North Pakistan earthquake: a GIS and statistical quantitative approach	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The growing concern for loss of services once provided by natural ecosystems is getting increasing attention. However, the accelerating rate of natural resources destruction calls for rapid and global action. With often very limited budgets, environmental agencies and NGOs need cost-efficient ways to quickly convince decision-makers that sound management of natural resources can help to protect human lives and their welfare. The methodology described in this paper, is based on geospatial and statistical analysis, involving simple Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing algorithms. It is based on free or very low-cost data. It aims to scientifically assess the potential role of vegetation in mitigating landslides triggered by earthquakes by normalising for other factors such as slopes and distance from active fault. The methodology was applied to the 2005 North Pakistan/India earthquake which generated a large number of victims and hundreds of landslides. The study shows that if slopes and proximity from active fault are the main susceptibility factors for post landslides triggered by earthquakes in this area, the results clearly revealed that areas covered by denser vegetation suffered less and smaller landslides than areas with thinner (or devoid of) vegetation cover. Short distance from roads/trails and rivers also proved to be pertinent factors in increasing landslides susceptibility. This project is a component of a wider initiative involving the Global Resource Information Database Europe from the United Nations Environment Programme, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the Institute of Geomatics and Risk Analysis from the University of Lausanne and the 'institut universitaire d',tudes du d,veloppement' from the University of Geneva.																	1561-8633						2010	10	4					623	640		10.5194/nhess-10-623-2010								WOS:000277185000001

J	Benzer, N				Benzer, Nuket			Using the Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing Techniques for Soil Erosion Assessment	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												The objective of this study is to establish a geographical information system method for spatial assessment of soil erosion based on the universal soil loss equation (USLE), and to evaluate the utility of GIS with regard to soil erosion mapping. The study area, Goynuk, covers 1,437 square kilometers and is located in the southeastern part of Bob, Turkey. In this study, USLE factors including rainfall erosivity (R-factor), soil erodibility (K-factor), slope and slope length (LS-factor), vegetative cover (C-factor), and conservation practice (P-factor) were studied and reviewed. Each factor, which consists of a set of logically related geographic features and attributes, was used as an input for analysis. A land use map of the study area was generated from (Landsat TM 2000) satellite imagery. A digital elevation model (DEM) interpolated from elevation contours was used to generate the slope and LS-factor. Spatial vegetative cover, extracted from Landsat TM imagery, was used to determine the spatial C-factor and P-factor, values of which are based on experimental results from the literature. USLE model calculation applied to the resultant polygonal layer gave values of soil loss in tons/ha/year. These are then ranked into three classes as low, moderate, and high. The study indicated that highly eroded areas are bare lands and steep conditions, whereas less eroded areas are low slope classes. As a conclusion the study confirms that the use of GIS and remotely sensed data can greatly enhance spatial modeling for soil erosion.																	1230-1485						2010	19	5					881	886										WOS:000283516600001

When a diagnosis is made over all Brazil, the reality is quite different from what is demanded by law. Therefore, this work, as a general objective, proposes ways of establishing Legal Reserves based on the analysis of the environmental deterioration in a river basin. For this purpose, the environmental deterioration was detected based on three diagnoses: physical-conservational, socioeconomical, and environmental quality. In this way, from a quantitative and qualitative diagnosis, it was possible to identify the main aggressive factors in the studied river basin and to indicate the main vulnerabilities that the area is subjected. According to such diagnosis, some proposals for the establishment of Legal Reserves are discussed here based on scientific arguments aimed at the conservation of water resources, soil and biodiversity. It is hoped, that from this study, the environment receives a new tool for diagnosis, pollution control, recovery and conservation of natural resources.

Using field studies and multi-temporal Landsat imagery, we examine a forest park, Kibale National Park in western Uganda, its changes over time, and related land cover change in the surrounding landscape. We find Kibale has successfully defended its borders and prevents within-park deforestation and other land incursions, and has maintained tree cover throughout the time period of the study. Outside the park there was a significant increase in tea plantations and continued forest fragmentation and wetland loss. The question of whether the park is a conservation success because of the network of forest fragments and wetlands or in spite of them remains unanswered.

Ecological disturbances due to high cutback in the green infrastructure of Karachi: Analyses of public perception about associated health problems	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												This paper evaluates the changes to the green infrastructure of the megacity of Karachi, Pakistan, occurring during a period of rapid development, involving extensive loss of trees and green spaces since 2000, occurring as a consequence of road widening and improvements to the city's transport infrastructure, aggravated by a series of cyclones, involving further tree loss and which has led to numerous ecological problems in the city, assessing how the effect of the reduction of Karachi's green infrastructure has impacted both the reality and the perception of human health conditions. It uses medium-resolution satellite images classified for land use and land cover (LULC) data extraction and detailed field surveys to map the extent of change; structured questionnaires are used to identify the perception of selected, targeted groups regarding the state of Karachi's urban green infrastructure and perceived human health conditions. Findings indicate that the public perception of green space functionality or presence does not equate with the remote sensing and field mapping results, which show a dramatic loss. The need to develop a comprehensive urban greening strategy, which considers the needs and priorities of the population, is identified. The impact of such a strategy in terms of increased frequency of visits to green sites and associated increase in the physical activity of the people to improve overall physical health is discussed in relation to the general development of Karachi.

J	Imam, E; Kushwaha, SPS; Singh, A				Imam, Ekwal; Kushwaha, S. P. S.; Singh, Aditya			Evaluation of suitable tiger habitat in Chandoli National Park, India, using multiple logistic regression	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Application of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)as a tool has assumed an immense significance in habitat suitability modelling for various wildlife species and now a days these are widely used in conservation biology and wildlife management. This paper evaluates habitat suitability for tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) in Chandoli National Park, India. This research provides information about potential areas that can be declared as Tiger Reserve, a federal designation of protection. Habitat evaluation was completed in the Chandoli National Park (17 degrees 04' 00 '' N to 17 degrees 19' 54 '' N and 73 degrees 40' 43 '' E to 73 degrees 53' 09 '' E) using habitat suitability index (HSI). Remotely sensed data of satellite IRS-P6, LISS-III of 25th February 2005 was procured from National Remote Sensing Agency, India. The satellite imagery data was digitally processed and collateral data were generated from topographic maps in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as landuse land cover, forest density, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created based on ground truthing. These layers, GPS location of animal's presence and "binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR)" techniques were integrated in a GIS environment for the HSI modelling. Results indicate that approximately 160.48 km(2) (55%) of the forest of Chandoli National Park is highly suitable for herbivores population, and 176.52 km(2) (50%) of the Park is suitable for tigers. Therefore, this study concludes that forest areas within the Chandoli National Park are appropriate for consideration as Tiger Reserve. Furthermore, the identification and mapping of wildlife corridors and other forest patches lying in between neighboring protected area like Koyana sanctuary, suggests that these region of Sahyadri range of Western Chats should be included into the proposed Tiger Reserve. This will be a benefit for tigers, as tigers require larger and least disturbed forest habitats for establishing and maintaining their high-density population. Fortunately, in May 2008 the Government of India declared Chandoli NP as tiger reserve. Thus declaration of Chandoli National Park as a Tiger Reserve reflects that the habitat suitability model developed by us for tiger was not only statistically sound but also has potential to be considered while taking any decision regarding wildlife habitat management.

Remote sensing of vegetation 3-D structure for biodiversity and habitat: Review and implications for lidar and radar spaceborne missions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Biodiversity and habitat face increasing pressures due to human and natural influences that alter vegetation structure. Because of the inherent difficulty of measuring forested vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure on the ground, this important component of biodiversity and habitat has been, until recently, largely restricted to local measurements, or at larger scales to generalizations. New lidar and radar remote sensing instruments such as those proposed for spaceborne missions will provide the capability to fill this gap. This paper reviews the state of the art for incorporatinginformation on vegetation 3-D structure into biodiversity and habitat science and management approaches, with emphasis on use of lidar and radar data. First we review relationships between vegetation 3-D structure, biodiversity and habitat, and metrics commonly used to describe those relationships. Next, we review the technical capabilities of new lidar and radar sensors and their application to biodiversity and habitat studies to date. We then define variables that have been identified as both useful and feasible to retrieve from spaceborne lidar and radar observations and provide their accuracy and precision requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of implications for spaceborne missions and research programs. The possibility to derive vegetation 3-D measurements from spaceborne active sensors and to integrate them into science and management comes at a critical juncture for global biodiversity conservation and opens new possibilities for advanced scientific analysis of habitat and biodiversity.

Incorporating remotely sensed tree canopy cover data into broad scale assessments of wildlife habitat distribution and conservation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing provides critical information for broad scale assessments of wildlife habitat distribution and conservation. However, such efforts have been typically unable to incorporate information about vegetation structure, a variable important for explaining the distribution of many wildlife species. We evaluated the consequences of incorporating remotely sensed information about horizontal vegetation structure into current assessments of wildlife habitat distribution and conservation. For this, we integrated the new NLCD tree canopy cover product into the US GAP Analysis database, using avian species and the finished Idaho GAP Analysis as a case study. We found: (1) a 15-68% decrease in the extent of the predicted habitat for avian species associated with specific tree canopy conditions, (2) a marked decrease in the species richness values predicted at the Landsat pixel scale, but not at coarser scales, (3) a modified distribution of biodiversity hotspots, and (4) surprising results in conservation assessment: despite the strong changes in the species predicted habitats, their distribution in relation to the reserves network remained the same. This study highlights the value of area wide vegetation structure data for refined biodiversity and conservation analyses. We discuss further opportunities and limitations for the use of the NLCD data in wildlife habitat studies.

J	Malinverni, ES; Fangi, G				Malinverni, Eva Savina; Fangi, Gabriele			Comparative cluster analysis to localize emergencies in archaeology	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE												In the Northwestern Peru, near the city of Trujillo, an Italian Archaeological Mission (MIPE), in close collaboration with the National Institute of Culture (INC) of Peru, is working on the site of Chan Chan, the widest archaeological complex in the world for the constructions in raw earth. The mission is carrying out a multidisciplinary survey with the purpose to study a methodology for the site maintenance and the creation of a local center of documentation. Inside this project we want to explain a step of the research by means of a remote sensing analysis based on a Quickbird high-resolution image. By applying some image classification techniques, it has been possible to investigate the whole archaeological site, with the aim of a better definition of its general features and of a contribution to the exploitation of the surroundings. This analysis was carried out in open source environment implementing and performing two different classification algorithms and comparing the final results. As we had at our disposal no set of reliable ground truth of the study area it was necessary to follow an unsupervised classification approach. The off-line clustering techniques have been: K-means and Fuzzy K-means. Both approaches rely on minimizing a cost function of dissimilarity (distance) measure. We have overcome the problem of data group overlapping in a hard classification testing a fuzzy approach where each observation belongs to a cluster with a fuzzy membership degree. The resulted classification clearly separates the central archaeological site from the areas intensively cultivated and besides puts in evidence the coastal band, characterized by a reduced parceling and by the presence of damp zones. Another purpose of this research has been also to individualize the principal features of the Chan Chan site, possibly, by putting in evidence some archaeological emergencies and discovering new mark and signs. We performed every phase by the software Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) 3.4 developed by the ITC of Enschede and open source from July 2007. All collected information are useful to organize a master plan in a GIS, dedicated to the conservation of the archaeological complex. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Geospatial approach for tiger habitat evaluation and distribution in Corbett Tiger reserve, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												India has a rich repository of flora and fauna, but the rapid decline of wildlife and threat to its habitat has been a serious cause of concern. Hence, protected areas have been set up to achieve specific conservation objectives to facilitate timely and reliable information on forest types and its composition, degradation status and their suitability for different species of flora and fauna. In the present study, evaluation of tiger habitat in Corbett Tiger reserve is carried out using remote sensing, ground and other ancillary sources and is integrated using GIS using multi-criteria model. The results indicated that sal, mixed sal, miscellaneous forest, plantation, grassland, agriculture and scrub land are the major land use/land cover types and majority of the study area is covered under dense forest. Tiger habitat suitability analysis showed that large proportion of the area (51.4%) was found to be highly suitable followed by moderately suitable area (31%). Further, the correlation drawn between range-wise suitability area and actual tiger population in Corbett Tiger Reserve CTR indicated a positive correlation of 0.73. Disturbance to wildlife habitat, vegetation degradation and shrinking passage corridor are the major concern in CTR.																	0255-660X					DEC	2009	37	4					573	585		10.1007/s12524-009-0052-4								WOS:000276181400004

Differing from the previous researches, this paper highlights the investigation of not only the socioeconomic factors driving urban area growth, but also the physical elements affecting urban land's spatial distribution through remote sensing and multivariable regression methods. The results indicate that land-use changes have been occurring at an accelerating pace in Shanghai over the past two decades, and are characterized by a massive increase of urban land and a loss of croplands. The growth in urban land use has primarily been driven by population, economy, and transportation, and its spatial distribution has mainly been influenced by accessibility to the transport network and the city center, together with the constraints of existing land-use patterns. The implications for policy are that improvements are needed in the efficient use of resources and the layout of a more adequate transport network; simple restrictions on the migration to cities are not a long-term solution. The conservation and exploitation of agricultural land, as well as the promotion of urban green spaces, are also crucial instruments for sustainable city development.

Tracking Forest Change and Development Using Low-Cost Remote Sensing Imagery and GIS Integration	NORTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY												Conversion of forestland to other uses is occurring in Maine as growing human populations and desire for second homes are exerting development pressures on privately owned forestland. This study was performed to assess forest cover change and conversion to developed uses in a 636,000-ha study area in Maine. A three-date time series (2000, 2002, and 2006) of Landsat Thematic Mapper data was analyzed to detect forest cover losses, and overall mapping accuracy was determined to be 91%. Forest cover losses (percentage per year) were aggregated for 81 townships and reported for each time sequence. Rates of forest cover loss differ among townships and for the same township in different time periods. Visual interpretation of forestland conversion using high-resolution images for a subsample of 24 townships showed that 305 of 4,716 harvested forest hectares (6.47%) was converted to developed uses. The study demonstrates the practical use of low-cost remote-sensing imagery and routine interpretation methods for accurate trucking of forest change and quantification of land use conversion. The methods are adaptable to other states to assist decisionmakers in assessing regional and local land use and planning forest conservation measures.																	0742-6348					DEC	2009	26	4					148	155										WOS:000273375400004

Classification of four satellite (SPOT) images from the years 1987, 1995, 2004 and 2006 and field ground truth data from 2004 and 2005 were used for map generation. The results show major changes in the western area of the SAL, with large area increases of rice fields, dry land agriculture, aquaculture and rural areas, and decreases in mangrove cover, mud flat and lagoon area. In the eastern area, minor decreases in mangrove area and increase in aquaculture, rural and industrial areas were also observed. Changes are due to the filling of the lagoon with riverine sediments derived from the hinterland and to mangrove conversion and resources exploitation.

This paper presents an integrated concept for vegetation type mapping in a dry savanna ecosystem based on local scale in-situ botanical survey data with high resolution (Landsat) and coarse resolution (MODIS) satellite time series. In this context, a semi-automated training database generation procedure using object-oriented image segmentation techniques is introduced. A tree-based Random Forest classifier was used for mapping vegetation type associations in the Kalahari of NE Namibia based on inter-annual intensity-and phenology-related time series metrics. The utilization of long-term inter-annual temporal metrics delivered the best classification accuracies (Kappa = 0.93) compared with classifications based on seasonal feature sets. The relationship between annual classification accuracies and bi-annual precipitation sums was conducted using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). Increased error rates occurred in years with high rainfall rates compared to dry rainy seasons. The variable importance was analyzed and showed high-rank positions for features of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the blue and middle infrared bands, indicating that soil reflectance was crucial information for an accurate spectral discrimination of Kalahari vegetation types. Time series features related to reflectance intensity obtained increased rank-positions compared to phenology-related metrics.

Integrating spectral indices into prediction models of soil phosphorus in a subtropical wetland	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing, in combination with multivariate geostatistical methods, has the potential to improve the prediction of soil properties at landscape scales. In the Everglades region, and particularly in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A), phosphorus enrichment has drawn a lot of attention and has led to an extensive documentation of different aspects of the degradation of the system. This study presents a hybrid geospatial modeling approach to predict soil total phosphorus (TP) using remotely-sensed data and ancillary landscape properties as supporting variables. Two remote sensors, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+ and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), were used to investigate relationships between spectral data and indices and soil TR A variation of a vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI green) was found to be the most effective in predicting floc TP values, due to its capacity to capture small variations in chlorophyll a that are associated to TP levels in periphyton, especially in aquatic/non-impacted areas. On the other hand, NDVI, a more traditionally used vegetation index, was still a good indicator of TP variability, particularly in the soil surface layer, due to its stronger relationship with impacted areas dominated by cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.). Findings from this study indicate that: a) remote sensing can play an important role in optimizing monitoring of environmental variables, particularly below-ground properties of floc and soils: b) because of limitations about the numbers and frequency of soil samples that can be taken, the combination of remote sensing and geostatistics could represent a non-invasive and cost-effective method to monitor soil nutrient status in complex wetland systems, and c) variations of traditional remote sensing indices such as NDVI can be used to better capture the spatial variability associated with soil and periphyton TP.

A comparison of operational remote sensing-based models for estimating crop evapotranspiration	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The integration of remotely sensed data into models of evapotranspiration (ET) facilitates the estimation of water consumption across agricultural regions. To estimate regional ET, two basic types of remote sensing approaches have been successfully applied. The first approach computes a surface energy balance using the radiometric surface temperature for estimating the sensible heat flux (H), and obtaining ET as a residual of the energy balance. This paper compares the performance of three different surface energy balance algorithms: an empirical one-source energy balance model; a one-source model calibrated using inverse modeling of ET extremes (namely ET = 0 and ET at potential) which are assumed to exist within the satellite scene; and a two-source (soil + vegetation) energy balance model. The second approach uses vegetation indices derived from canopy reflectance data to estimate basal crop coefficients that can be used to convert reference ET to actual crop ET. This approach requires local meteorological and soil data to maintain a water balance in the root zone of the crop. Output from these models was compared to sensible and latent heat fluxes measured during the soil moisture-atmosphere coupling experiment (SMACEX) conducted over rain-fed corn and soybean crops in central Iowa. The root mean square differences (RMSD) of the estimation of instantaneous latent and heat fluxes were less than 50 W m(-2) for the three energy balance models. The two-source energy balance model gave the lowest RMSD (30 W m(-2)) and highest r(2) values in comparison with measured fluxes. In addition, three schemes were applied for upscaling instantaneous flux estimates from the energy balance models (at the time of satellite overpass) to daily integrated ET, including conservation of evaporative fraction and fraction of reference ET. For all energy balance models, an adjusted evaporative fraction approach produced the lowest RMSDs in daily ET of 0.4-0.6 mm d(-1). The reflectance-based crop coefficient model yielded RMSD values of 0.4 mm d(-1), but tended to significantly overestimate ET from corn during a prolonged drydown period. Crop stress can be directly detected using radiometric surface temperature, but ET modeling approaches-based solely on vegetation indices will not be sensitive to stress until there is actual reduction in biomass or changes in canopy geometry.

J	Chai, SL; Tanner, E; McLaren, K				Chai, Shauna-Lee; Tanner, Edmund; McLaren, Kurt			High rates of forest clearance and fragmentation pre- and post-National Park establishment: The case of a Jamaican montane rainforest	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The principal defense of tropical forests has been to designate them as protected areas, but few of these protected areas have been studied to determine their effectiveness at preventing forest clearance within their boundaries. We used remote sensing techniques to quantify three fundamental forest cover change processes: forest clearance, re-growth and fragmentation over a 19-year time period, in a National Park of Jamaica. Results show that forest clearance occurred at similar high levels prior and subsequent to the establishment of the area as a National Park in 1993: 1.50% yr(-1) (1983-1992) and 1.42% yr(-1) (19922002), respectively. Fragmentation continued post-establishment, and manifested itself in an increasing number of smaller more vulnerable fragments; the number of fragments increased by 60%, and the mean fragment size decreased by 40%. Core areas decreased with ensuing increases in edge lengths, and fragments became more isolated from one another. After designation as a National Park however, increased forest re-growth occurred, resulting in a 63% decline in the net deforestation rate from 0.80% yr(-1) (19831992) to 0.26% yr(-1) (1992-2002). Image classifications gave accuracies of 90-97% (Kappa 0.80-0.93). Although the decrease in net deforestation may indicate some level of success of this National Park, forest clearance and fragmentation, leading to species shifts and biodiversity loss were still present at pre-National Park levels. We then examined the preponderance of successful protected areas, and found that success may be an artifact of the most widely used method of assessment, which compares deforestation rates inside versus outside protected areas.

Fairways	CROP SCIENCE												Turfgrass irrigation strategies must be clearly defined in response to increasing concerns over quality water availability. Water conservation may be achieved with technologies such as remote sensing. The objectives of this research were to (i) correlate reflectance measurements from creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) under stress with volumetric water content and turf quality measurements, (ii) determine if remote sensing can detect plant stress before visual observation, and (iii) explore the influence of nitrogen fertility on water stress detection. Four experiments were conducted in the 2006 and 2007 growing seasons on 3-m(2) creeping bentgrass plots maintained under fairway conditions at the University of Minnesota agriculture campus. Treatments were irrigation at 20, 40, 60, and 80% of predicted evapotranspiration every 3 d on plots fertilized with 98 or 244 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Reflectance measurements from two remote sensors were more highly correlated (r = 0.73-0.91) than reflectance and turf quality (r = 0.42-0.71) or reflectance and volumetric water content (r = 0.28-0.64). Reflectance measurements detected water stress 0 to 48 h before visual observation across all treatments and experiments. Nitrogen did not influence the ability to detect drought-stressed turfgrass. Use of remote sensors to monitor and detect drought stress has the potential to improve turfgrass irrigation and ultimately conserve water.																	0011-183X					NOV-DEC	2009	49	6					2261	2274		10.2135/cropsci2008.09.0544								WOS:000271607300033

Soil erosion modeling of a Himalayan watershed using RS and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Employing the remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS), an assessment of sediment yield from Dikrong river basin of Arunachal Pradesh (India) has been presented in this paper. For prediction of soil erosion, the Morgan-Morgan and Finney (MMF) model and the universal soil loss equation (USLE) have been utilized at a spatial grid scale of 100 m x 100 m, an operational unit. The average annual soil loss from the Dikrong river basin is estimated as 75.66 and 57.06 t ha(-1) year(-1) using MMF and USLE models, respectively. The watershed area falling under the identified very high, severe, and very severe zones of soil erosion need immediate attention for soil conservation.

There is a clear need to recognize that parks are significantly impacted by human-environment interactions in the larger landscape within which they are embedded, and to move the frontier of research beyond the boundaries of protected areas in order to examine larger landscapes where multiple forms of ownership and access are embedded. This research evaluates forest change and fragmentation between 1990 and 2000, in a landscape surrounding the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian state of West Bengal. This protected forest is bounded to the south by a less intensively protected area, the Baikunthapur Reserve Forest, and surrounded by a mosaic of unprotected, largely private land holdings. Results indicate differences in the extent and spatial pattern of forest cover change in these three zones, corresponding to different levels of government protection, access and monitoring. The two protected areas experience a trend toward forest regrowth, relating to the cessation of commercial logging by park management during this period. Yet, there is still substantial clearing toward peripheral areas that are well connected to illegal timber markets by transportation networks. The surrounding landscape, although experiencing some forest regrowth within less intensively cultivated tea plantations, is also becoming increasingly fragmented, with potentially critical impacts on the maintenance of effective wildlife corridors in this ecologically critical region.

Monitoring conservation effectiveness in a global biodiversity hotspot: the contribution of land cover change assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Tropical forests, which play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles, radiation budgets and biodiversity, have undergone rapid changes in land cover in the last few decades. This study examines the complex process of land cover change in the biodiversity hotspot of Western Ghats, India, specifically investigating the effects of conservation measures within the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary. Current vegetation patterns were mapped using an IRS P6 LISS III image and this was used together with Landsat MSS data from 1973 to map land cover transitions. Two major and divergent trends were observed. A dominant degradational trend can be attributed to agricultural expansion and infrastructure development while a successional trend, resulting from protection of the area, showed the resilience of the system after prolonged disturbances. The sanctuary appears susceptible to continuing disturbances under the current management regime but at lower rates than in surrounding unprotected areas. The study demonstrates that remotely sensed land cover assessments can have important contributions to monitoring land management strategies, understanding processes underpinning land use changes and helping to inform future conservation strategies.

ASSESSMENT OF SOIL EROSION HAZARD AND PRIORITIZATION FOR TREATMENT AT THE WATERSHED LEVEL: CASE STUDY IN THE CHEMOGA WATERSHED, BLUE NILE BASIN, ETHIOPIA	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Soil erosion by water is the most pressing environmental problem in Ethiopia, particularly in the Highlands where the topography is highly rugged, population pressure is high, steeplands are cultivated and rainfall is erosive. Soil conservation is critically required in these areas. The objective of this study was to assess soil erosion hazard in a typical highland watershed (the Chemoga watershed) and demonstrate that a simple erosion assessment model, the universal soil loss equation (USLE), integrated with satellite remote sensing and geographical information systems can provide useful tools for conservation decision-making. Monthly precipitation, soil map, a 30-m digital elevation model derived from topographic map, land-cover map produced from supervised classification of a Land Sat image, and land use types and slope steepness were used to determine the USLE factor values. The results show that a larger part of the watershed (>58 per cent of total) suffers from a severe or very severe erosion risk (>80 t ha(-1) y(-1)), mainly in the midstream and upstream parts where steeplands are cultivated or overgrazed. In about 25 per cent of the watershed, soil erosion was estimated to exceed 125 t ha(-1) y(-1). Based on the predicted soil erosion rates, the watershed wits divided into six priority categories for conservation intervention and 18 micro-watersheds were identified that may be used as planning units. Finally, the method used has yielded it fairly reliable estimation of soil loss rates and delineation of erosion-prone areas. Hence, it similar method can be used in other watersheds to prepare conservation master plans and enable efficient use of limited resources.

Modeling soil depth from topographic and land cover attributes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Soil depth is an important input parameter in hydrological and ecological modeling. Presently, the soil depth data available in national soil databases (STATSGO and SSURGO) from the Natural Resources Conservation Service are provided as averages within generalized land units ( map units). Spatial uncertainty within these units limits their applicability for distributed modeling in complex terrain. This work reports statistical models for prediction of soil depth in a semiarid mountainous watershed that are based upon the relationship between soil depth and topographic and land cover attributes. Soil depth was surveyed by driving a rod into the ground until refusal at locations selected to represent the topographic and land cover variation in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho. The soil depth survey consisted of a model calibration set, measured at 819 locations over 8 subwatersheds representing topographic and land cover variability and a model testing set, measured at 130 more broadly distributed locations in the watershed. Many model input variables were developed for regression to the field data. Topographic attributes were derived from a digital elevation model. Land cover attributes were derived from Landsat remote sensing images and high-resolution aerial photographs. Generalized additive and random forests models were developed to predict soil depth over the watershed. They were able to explain about 50% of the soil depth spatial variation, which is an important improvement over the soil depth extracted from the SSURGO national soil database.

The role of local and landscape level measures of greenness in modelling boreal plant species richness	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Measurements of primary productivity and its heterogeneity based on satellite images can provide useful estimates of species richness and distribution patterns. However, species richness at a given site may depend not only on local habitat quality and productivity but also on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In this study we investigated whether the predictions of species richness of plant families in northern boreal landscape in Finland can be improved by incorporating greenness information from the surrounding landscape, as derived from remotely sensed data (mean, maximum, standard deviation and range values of NDVI derived from Landsat ETM), into local greenness models. Using plant species richness data of 28 plant families from 440 grid cells of 25 ha in size, generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted into three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) local greenness only, (2) landscape greenness only, and (3) combined local and landscape greenness. The derived richness-greenness relationships were mainly unimodal or positively increasing but varied between different plant families, and depended also on whether greenness was measured as mean or maximum greenness. Incorporation of landscape level greenness variables improved significantly both the explanatory power and cross-validation statistics of the models including only local greenness variables. Landscape greenness information derived from remote sensing data integrated with local information has thus the potentiality to improve predictive assessments of species richness over extensive and inaccessible areas, especially in high-latitude landscapes. Overall, the significant relationship between plants and surrounding landscape quality detected here suggests that landscape factors should be considered in preserving species richness of boreal environments, as well as in conservation planning for biodiversity in other environments.

J	Feilhauer, H; Schmidtlein, S				Feilhauer, Hannes; Schmidtlein, Sebastian			Mapping continuous fields of forest alpha and beta diversity	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question How to map continuous fields of forest alpha and beta diversity in remote areas, based on easily accessible spatial data. Location Kyrgyzstan/Central Asia. Methods The study relied on a combination of predictive mapping and remote sensing. Punctual measurements of alpha diversity were linked to topography and reflectance using regression models. For beta diversity, ordination techniques were employed to extract major vegetation gradients. Scores on the ordination axes were regressed against topography as well as reflectance and subsequently mapped. Beta diversity was mapped as spatial turnover rate along these axes. Results The diversity maps quantified species counts and turnover in a spatially contiguous manner while taking into account fuzzy transitions. The variance explained by regression models ranged from 51% to 61% in cross-validation. Many of the observed differences were caused by differences in species shares. The occurrence of walnut, in particular, showed a negative relation to woody species numbers. Conclusion Mapping biodiversity in remote areas can be based on easily accessible spatial data in combination with a set of calibration field samples. With regard to human influence on walnut dominance, a total removal of human land use would be counterproductive in terms of diversity conservation. The results of this study highlight the need for comprehensive analyses of diversity patterns that include spatially contiguous quantifications of species numbers, shares and turnover rates.

J	Butler, DW				Butler, Don William			Planning iterative investment for landscape restoration: Choice of biodiversity indicator makes a difference	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Natural regrowth vegetation offers a cost-effective means of restoring some degraded landscapes. Worldwide, policy responses to climate change are increasing the attractiveness of investment in regrowth protection or facilitation which with strategic planning could also deliver substantial dividends for biodiversity conservation. This study compares the performance of two commonly used indicators of biodiversity conservation priority, irreplaceability and complementarity, as tools to support planning for iterative investment to protect natural regrowth of Brigalow, an endangered ecological community in subtropical eastern Australia. Brigalow covered more than seven million hectares prior to clearing, it now persists 'intact' on less than a tenth of that area but there are significant areas of regrowth. Data on Brigalow regrowth derived from mapping and remote sensing identify 10,555 patches covering 280,000 hectares in total. Two different classifications are used to represent Brigalow biodiversity: a land-type classification of 16 'regional ecosystems' mapped at 1:100,000 scale, and a landscape-scale classification of 40 biogeographic subregions that discriminate relatively uniform landscapes at about 1:500,000 scale. Conservation targets are expressed as the extent of regrowth needed to increase the extent of intact or 'remnant' areas of each biodiversity feature to either 5% or 10% of its former extent. In each case, irreplaceability and complementarity are positively correlated, and either metric type could be used to identify relatively large sets of high-priority patches. However, regional-scale restoration is likely to involve iterative investment and therefore to require discrimination of relatively small sets of patches of the highest priority for biodiversity conservation. Irreplaceability is not an ideal measure of biodiversity value when planning such iterative processes, simply because irreplaceability is uninformative for ranking 'high-value' patches; they all have the highest possible score. This study demonstrates the importance of considering quite fundamental points when choosing metrics for conservation planning, such as the frequency distribution of values they produce. Where planning aims to identify quite small sets of very high value features metrics that are most variable among the highest value patches, like the one used for complementarity, in this study, will be more useful than metrics that are strongly bounded at higher values.

To improve this, we have undertaken a study of the accuracy of five supervised classification methods (Parallelepiped, Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis Classifier Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper and Maximum Likelihood) using multispectral and pan-sharpened QuickBird imagery. We sought to verify whether remote sensing offers the ability to efficiently identify crops and agro-environmental measures in a typical agricultural Mediterranean area characterized by dry conditions. A segmentation of the satellite data was also used to evaluate pixel, object and pixel + object as minimum information units for classification. The results indicated that object- and pixel + object-based analyses clearly outperformed pixel-based analyses, yielding overall accuracies higher than 85% in most of the classifications and exhibiting the Maximum Likelihood of being the most accurate classifier. The accuracy for pan-sharpened image and object-based analysis indicated a 4% improvement in performance relative to multispectral data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Overestimation of Fire Risk in the Northern Spotted Owl Recovery Plan	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's recent recovery plan for one of the most carefully watched threatened species worldwide, the Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), recommended a major departure in conservation strategies in the northwestern United States. Due to concern about fire, the plan would switch from a reserve to a no-reserve strategy in up to 52% of the owl's range. Fuel treatments (e.g., thinning) at regular intervals also would occur on up to 65-70% of dry forests in this area. Estimations of fire risk, however, were based on less than a decade of data and an anecdotal assessment of a single, large fire. We found that decadal data are inherently too short, given infrequent large fires, to accurately predict fire risk and trends. Rates of high-severity fire, based on remote-sensing data, are far lower than reported in the plan and in comparison with the rate of old-forest recruitment. In addition, over a 22-year period, there has been no increase in the proportion of high-severity fire. Our findings refute the key conclusions of the plan that are the basis for major changes in conservation strategies for the Spotted Owl. The best available science is needed to address these strategies in an adaptive-management framework. From the standpoint of fire risk, there appears to be ample time for research on fire and proposed treatment effects on Spotted Owls before designing extensive management actions or eliminating reserves.

J	Sasaki, N; Putz, FE				Sasaki, Nophea; Putz, Francis E.			Critical need for new definitions of "forest" and "forest degradation" in global climate change agreements	CONSERVATION LETTERS												If global policies intended to promote forest conservation continue to use the definition of "forest" adopted in 2001 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (an area of >0.05-1 ha with >10-30% cover of plants >2-5 m tall at maturity), great quantities of carbon and other environmental values will be lost when natural forests are severely degraded or replaced by plantations but technically remain "forests." While a definition of "forest" that is globally acceptable and appropriate for monitoring using standard remote sensing options will necessarily be based on a small set of easily measured parameters, there are dangers when simple definitions are applied locally. At the very least, we recommend that natural forest be differentiated from plantations and that for defining "forest" the lower height limit defining "trees" be set at more than 5 m tall with the minimum cover of trees be set at more than 40%. These changes will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from what is now termed forest "degradation" without increasing monitoring costs. Furthermore, these minor changes in the definition of "forest" will promote the switch from degradation to responsible forest management, which will help mitigate global warming while protecting biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development.

Radiative transfer theory applied to ocean bottom modeling	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Research on the propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean bottom sediment is of interest for active sonar applications such as target detection and remote sensing. The interaction of acoustic energy with the sea floor sublayers is usually modeled with techniques based on the full solution of the wave equation, which sometimes leads to mathematically intractable problems. An alternative way to model wave propagation in layered media containing random scatterers is the radiative transfer (RT) formulation, which is a well established technique in the electromagnetics community and is based on the principle of conservation of energy. In this paper, the RT equation is used to model the backscattering of acoustic energy from a layered elastic bottom sediment containing distributions of independent scatterers due to a constant single frequency excitation in the water column. It is shown that the RT formulation provides insight into the physical phenomena of scattering and conversion of energy between waves of different polarizations.

Aiming at providing subsidies to protected areas monitoring and management, the present study aimed at answering the following question: what vegetation formations are being preserved in the national parks within the Cerrado biome? For that, forestlands, shrublands, and grasslands from fifteen national parks located in the Cerrado were classified and quantified. Landsat ETM+ geocover satellite images were processed through the image segmentation technique. As a result, it was verified that only 1.3% of the biome is under protection in the national park category which favors the conservation of shrublands (66.7%), followed by forestlands (23.4%), and grasslands (9.1%). Some protected areas are prominent for preserving a specific formation, as it is the case of the Emas (74.6% of grasslands), the Chapada Diamantina (80.5% of shrublands), and Sete Cidades (42.8% of forestlands) National Parks. The recorded areas for the three analyzed formations represent the proportion that was originally found in the biome, however, the establishment of new integrally protected areas is highly recommended in areas where forestlands and shrublands are predominant, especially in the Wetlands, Seasonal Forests, and Cerraddao phytophysiognomies.																	1679-0073	2178-3675				OCT	2009	7	2					149	163										WOS:000274068600006						
J	Lechner, AM; Stein, A; Jones, SD; Ferwerda, JG				Lechner, Alex Mark; Stein, Alfred; Jones, Simon D.; Ferwerda, Jelle Garke			Remote sensing of small and linear features: Quantifying the effects of patch size and length, grid position and detectability on land cover mapping	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The accurate mapping of small, often fragmented and linear vegetation patches is of key importance for natural resource management because of their ecological significance. However, due to their small size and the quantised nature of remote sensing imagery they may be under-represented in the landscape when mapped using earth observation. This paper investigates the effect of patch area and patch elongation on the accurate mapping of these vegetation patches. Using synthetic images to simulate sub-pixel patch location, we investigated classification accuracy and extraction probability resulting from differences in the geometric properties of the raster grid and the feature alone. We simulated the effect of grid position, detectability, feature size and shape on classification. This represents the highest achievable accuracy using the remote sensing raster grid, where other factors influencing classification such as classification algorithm, radiometric calibration and sensor characteristics are excluded. We found that mapping error was highest when the scale of the feature and the raster grid coincided. We showed that the spatial resolution of the grid should be many times finer in order to extract these features accurately. For square patches with a mean classification accuracy of 75%, the grid pixel area was 11 times smaller than patch size. When patches were small and/or elongated, the probability of extraction was reduced, mapping accuracies decreased and variability in accuracy due to the effects of grid position increased. For example, a square shaped patch needed an area of at least 11 pixels to achieve a mean accuracy of 75%, whilst a linear patch with a width to length ratio of 4 needed an area of 12.3 pixels. This paper quantifies the limitations of remote sensing for the accurate detection of small and linear features and provides guidelines on the appropriate spatial resolution required to map these features. Using our results, map users can estimate the probability of a map classifying small and linear features independently of the error matrix. Furthermore, we provide a more precise estimate of the size of the smallest discernable feature taking into account the random position of the remote sensing grid with respect to the feature as well as its shape. An understanding of this phenomenon is critical for making good land management decisions based on a thorough understanding of the limitations of remote sensing data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Review of commonly used remote sensing and ground-based technologies to measure plant water stress	WATER SA												This review provides an overview of the use of remote sensing data, the development of spectral reflectance indices for detecting plant water stress, and the usefulness of field measurements for ground-truthing purposes. Reliable measurements of plant water stress over large areas are often required for management applications in the fields of agriculture, forestry, conservation and land rehabilitation. The use of remote sensing technologies and spectral reflectance data for determining spatial patterns of plant water stress is widely described in the scientific literature. Airborne, space-borne and hand-held remote sensing technologies are commonly used to investigate the spectral responses of vegetation to plant stress. Earlier studies utilised multispectral sensors which commonly collect four to seven spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Advances in sensor and image processor technology over the past 3 decades now allow for the simultaneous collection of several hundred narrow spectral bands resulting in more detailed hyperspectral data. The availability of hyperspectral data has led to the identification of several spectral indices that have been shown to be useful in identifying plant stress. Such studies have revealed strong linear relationships between plant pigment concentration and the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance, while plant water content has been linked to specific bands in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region of the spectrum. Ground-truthing is essential to identifying useful reflectance information for detecting plant water stress, and four commonly used ground-based methods viz. predawn leaf water potential, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf pigment concentrations and leafwater content are reviewed for their, usefulness and practical application.

Impacts of conservation easements for threat abatement and fire management in a rural oak woodland landscape	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Rural residential development can impact habitat and complicate fire management. Conservation easements are created to prevent development but are rarely assessed for their influence on development patterns. In the Lassen Foothills, California, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) holds over 37,000ha of mostly public-funded conservation easements on ranchland dominated by blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland. For this region we modeled land use through 2050 under two scenarios, with and without conservation easements, using a rule-based growth model. We mapped development footprints on 760 rural residential parcels through automated remote sensing. From calculated footprint sizes we projected site-level habitat loss for each scenario. We also projected the influence of development patterns on fire management. With easements present the Lassen Foothills would gain about 184 new homes, compared with 223 homes if easements were absent. With an average residential footprint size of 0.34 +/- 0.25 ha (mean +/- SD), we found that easements slightly reduce vegetation conversion, protecting an additional 16.8 ha than were protected by the general plan alone. Without easements, scattered development may alter fire management on 12,370 ha (17.5% of undeveloped wildfire containment areas) by requiring more fire suppression and reducing options for prescribed burning. Low development pressure and county land use policies maintain very low residential densities in the Lassen Foothills. The easement program may increase options for fire management by preserving large landscapes. This case illustrates the limited effectiveness of land acquisition in preventing development in a low-threat landscape, and demonstrates the utility of growth models for prioritizing conservation investments.

Modelling the spatial distribution of Natura 2000 habitats across Europe	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The development of a Pan-European Ecological Network is now widely recognised as an important policy initiative in support of protected Natura 2000 sites. The site selection is based on habitats as defined in the Annex I of the Habitats Directive. Whilst there is information about the presence of these habitats in Natura 2000 sites, there is no detail of their distribution elsewhere in Europe. The present paper describes a methodology that identifies the spatial distribution of habitats across Europe so that their actual extent can be determined. Five methodological steps are involved starting with selection of appropriate spatial data sets, defining knowledge rules from the descriptions of Annex I habitats, continuing with additional ecological expert knowledge when needed, implementation of the models, and finally the validation. Spatial distribution models were derived for 27 habitats representing the most significant ecosystems. This spatial modelling approach is illustrated with one detailed example. Validation showed that mapping accuracy depends on the habitat description available but also upon its spatial character. Thus widespread habitats such as forests were accurately assessed whereas dispersed classes such as freshwater systems were more difficult to assess. Possible methodological improvements are suggested, such as inclusion of vegetation releves to improve the knowledge rules. Extension of the methodology to other habitats would require a moderate effort since data collection and processing has now been completed and it is this which is the most time consuming part of the process. We conclude that our method maps widespread European habitats with unprecedented accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we evaluate land cover change processes around one of the most important tropical dry forest reserves in the Americas: the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. The analysis is conducted at three scales: regional scale (coast of the State of Jalisco), proximity to the reserve (via a 30-km buffer zone analysis), and inside the Biosphere Reserve. The proximity analysis is complemented by a unique data set that represents the extent and boundaries of Ejidos (local land management units) in the region. Results indicate that areas surrounding the reserve have low deforestation, with Ejidos and buffer areas having more forest cover as they get closer to the reserve. The nature of this important phenomenon is discussed in the context of the socio-economic conditions of the local communities. Our work suggests that the creation of a network of "Ejidos' Conservation Areas", in the context of an approach that will recognize payments for environmental services provided to local communities, could contribute to the conservation and maintenance of the rich biodiversity in a region that has one of the highest levels of endemism in the world.

Tropical dry forests (TDF) are among the most threatened tropical ecosystems, there are more secondary forests and forest restoration efforts that require a better understanding of successional processes. The main goal of this synthesis for this special issue on the ecology and management of tropical dry forests in the Americas is to present a summarized review of the current knowledge of the ecology and management implications associated to TDF succession. We explore specific issues associated to tropical dry forest succession with emphasis on the use of chronosequences, plant diversity and composition, plant phenology and remote sensing, pollination, and animal-plant interactions; all under the integrating umbrella of ecosystem succession. We also emphasize the need to conduct socio-ecological research to understand changes in land-use history and its effects on succession and forest regeneration of TDF. We close this paper with some thoughts and ideas associated with the strong need for an integrating dimension not considered until today: the role of cyberinfrastructure and eco-informatics as a tool to support sound conservation, management and understanding of TDF in the Americas.

J	Lauer, M; Aswani, S				Lauer, Matthew; Aswani, Shankar			Indigenous Ecological Knowledge as Situated Practices: Understanding Fishers' Knowledge in the Western Solomon Islands	AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST												In this article, we draw on research among fisherfolk of Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, to examine certain epistemological assumptions of the "indigenous knowledge" concept. We describe how approaches to knowledge in Roviana differ from prevailing models of knowledge that distinguish between cognitive aspects and other modalities of knowing. For many Roviana fishers, ecological knowledge is not analytically separated from the changing contexts of everyday activities such as navigating and fishing. Inspired by Roviana epistemologies, we argue that a practice-oriented approach provides a more sympathetic and informative theoretical framework for understanding knowledge and its role in contemporary marine-resource conservation efforts. The theoretical and methodological implications of the perspective are illustrated with examples from an ongoing marine conservation project in the western Solomon Islands that integrates indigenous knowledge, remote-sensing techniques, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies.																	0002-7294	1548-1433				SEP	2009	111	3					317	329		10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01135.x								WOS:000269490800005

LYSIMETRIC EVALUATION OF SIMPLIFIED SURFACE ENERGY BALANCE APPROACH IN THE TEXAS HIGH PLAINS	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Numerous energy balance (EB) algorithms have been developed to make use of remote sensing data to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) regionally. However, most EB models are complex to use and efforts arc, being made to simplify procedures mainly through the scaling of reference ET The Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) is one such method. This approach has never been evaluated using measured ET data. In this study, the SSEB approach was applied to 14 Landsat TM images covering a major portion of the Southern High Plains that were acquired during 2006 and 2007 cropping seasons. Performance of the SSEB was evaluated by comparing estimated ET with measured daily ET from four large monolithic lysimeters at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, Texas. Statistical evaluation of results indicated that the SSEB accounted for 84% of the variability in the measured ET values with a slope and intercept of 0.75 and 1.1 mm d(-1), respectively. Considering the minimal amount of ancillary data required and excellent performance in predicting daily ET, the SSEB approach is a promising tool for mapping ET in the semiarid Texas high Plains and in other parts of the world with similar hydro-climatic conditions.																	0883-8542	1943-7838				SEP	2009	25	5					665	669										WOS:000271220200004

Such evaluations ignore forest degradation or the decline in quality of the ecological values of the forest. Landsat image processing and geographical information systems were used to study forest cover changes in and around Popa Mountain Park (central Myanmar). Deforestation inside the Park was lower than outside the Park, but forest degradation, namely the net area that changed from dense forest to open forest, within the Park had grown at rates exceeding those outside the Park. The effectiveness of the PA was overestimated by adopting deforestation as the only indicator of conservation effectiveness. Forest degradation studies can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PAs.																	0376-8929					SEP	2009	36	3					218	224		10.1017/S0376892909990415								WOS:000275897300006

They not only provide the traditional livelihood of the local communities but are also the basis of a tourism industry that generates substantial revenue for the whole of Botswana. For the global community, the wetlands retain a tremendous pool of biodiversity. As the upstream states Angola and Namibia are developing, however, changes in the use of the water of the Okavango River and in the ecological status of the wetlands are to be expected. To predict these impacts, the hydrology of the Delta has to be understood. This article reviews scientific work done for that purpose, focussing on the hydrological modelling of surface water and groundwater. Research providing input data to hydrological models is also presented. It relies heavily on all types of remote sensing. The history of hydrologic models of the Delta is retraced from the early box models to state-of-the-art distributed hydrological models. The knowledge gained from hydrological models and its relevance for the management of the Delta are discussed.

Interferometric SAR for characterization of ravines as a function of their density, depth, and surface cover	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												In recent years, the problem of ravine erosion with consequent loss of usable land has received much attention worldwide. The Chambal ravine zone in India is well known for being an extremely intricate, deeply incised network of ravines in a 10 km wide zone on the flanks of the Chambal River. It occupies an area of similar to 0.5 million hectares at the expense of fertile agricultural land of the Chambal Valley. The broad grouping of the ravines considering their reclamation potential, as carried out by previous workers based on visual interpretation of optical remote sensing data, is mostly descriptive in nature. In the present study, characterization of the ravines as a function of their erosion potential expressed through ravine density, ravine depth, and ravine surface cover was made in quantitative terms exploiting the preferential characteristics of side-looking, long-wavelength, coherent SAR signal and precision measurements associated with the InSAR technique. The outlines of ravines appear remarkably prominent in SAR backscattered amplitude images due to the high sensitivity of the SAR signal to terrain ruggedness. Using local statistics-based meso and macro textural information of SAR backscattered amplitude images in 7 x 7 pixel windows (the pixel size being 20 m x 20 m), the ravine-affected area has been classified into three density classes, namely low, moderate, and high density ravine classes. C-band InSAR digital elevation models (DEMs) of sparsely vegetated ravine areas essentially give the terrain height. From the pixel-by-pixel terrain height, the ravine depth was calculated by differencing the maximum and minimum terrain heights of the pixels in a 100 m distance range. Considering the vertical precision of the ERS InSAR DEMs of similar to 5 m and ravine depth classification by previous workers [Sharma, H.S., 1968. Genesis and pattern of ravines of the Lower Chambal Valley, India. Special Issue. 21st International Geographical Union Congress 30(4), 14-24; Seth, S.P., Bhatnagar, R.K., Chauhan, S.S., 1969. Reclamability classification and nature of ravines of Chambal Command Areas. Journal of Soil and Water Conservation in India 17 (3-4), 39-44.], three depth classes, namely shallow (<5 m), moderately deep (5-20 m), and deep (>20 m) ravines, were made. Using the temporal decorrelation property of the close time interval InSAR data pair, namely the ERS SAR tandem pair, four ravine surface cover classes, namely barren land, grass/scrub/crop land, sparse vegetation, and wet land/dense vegetation, could be delineated, which was corroborated by the spectral signatures in the optical range and selective ground truths.

Land Use Dynamics in a Marine Protected Area System in Lower Andaman Coast of Thailand, 1990-2005	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study has depicted a scenario on assessing spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in and adjacent to marine protected areas (MPA) in a study site in Thailand. The measurement of landscape stability and its implications for protection and conservation of coastal resources are emphasized in this study. The methods employed include interpretation and analysis of satellite images, aerial photographs, and geographic information system (GIS) data. Image analysis and GIS techniques have been used extensively, and a site-specific geospatial database was developed accordingly. Initial temporal changes inside and outside protected areas are captured from visual interpretation of three time series satellite images, where an increase of aquaculture ponds and abandoned areas is clearly visible. The output changes derived from the image differencing techniques demonstrated considerable changes in the whole study area as well as inside the protected area boundary during 1976 to 1990. Compared to the earlier time (1976-1990) the changes during 1990 to 2005 are found to be less extensive. Although the existing marine protected areas were declared earlier than the 1990s, the changes are still found inside the protected area boundary during 1990-2005. The result shows significant increases in agriculture areas, including aquaculture development, which are, however, less inside the protected areas than the buffer areas. While mangrove areas have noticeable negative changes, an increase in Malalueca forest areas is interesting. In the discussion, a quantitative comparison of legislative boundary and buffer effects on protecting land use and land cover is illustrated. In light of existing ecological context and socioeconomic activities, observations are made on agents of change and resource use conflicts.																	0749-0208					SEP	2009	25	5					1082	1095		10.2112/08-1058.1								WOS:000270369500002

Using satellite remote sensing to estimate winter cover crop nutrient uptake efficiency	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Winter cover crops are recognized as an important agricultural conservation practice for reducing nitrogen (N) losses to groundwater following the summer growing season. Accordingly, cost-share programs have been established to promote winter cover crops for water quality on farms throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. However, current estimates of cover crop nutrient uptake are largely calculated from plot-scale studies extrapolated to watershed-scale based solely on enrollment acreage. Remote sensing provides a tool for rapid estimation of cover crop biomass production on working farms throughout the landscape. This project combined cost-share program enrollment data with satellite imagery and on-farm sampling to evaluate cover crop N uptake on 136 fields within the Choptank River watershed, on Maryland's eastern shore. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index seas a successful predictor of aboveground biotnass for fields with >210 kg ha(-1) (>187 lb ac(-1)) of vegetation (corresponding to 4.2 kg ha(-1) [3.7 lb ac(-1)] of plant N), below which the background reflectance of soils and crop residues obstructed the cover crop signal. Cover crops planted in the two weeks prior to the regional average first frost date (October 15) exhibited average fill aboveground N uptake rates of 18, 13, and 5 kg ha(-1) (16, 12, 4 lb ac(-1)) for rye, barley, and wheat, respectively, corresponding to 1,260, 725, and 311 kg ha(-1) (1,124, 647, 277 lb ac(-1)) of aboveground biomass, with associated cost-share implementation costs of $5.49, $7.60, and $19.77 kg(-1) N ($2.50, $3.46, and $8.99 lb(-1) N). Cover crops planted after October 15 exhibited significantly reduced biomass and nutrient uptake, with associated program costs of $15.44 to $20.59 kg(-1) N ($7.02 to $9.36 lb(-1) N). Agronomic factors influencing cover crop performance included species, planting date, planting method, and previous crop. Field Sampling locations with >1,000 kg ha(-1) (>890 lb ac(-1)) of springtime cover crop biomass exhibited greatly reduced soil nitrate (<3 mg kg(-1) [<3 ppm]) in comparison to fields with lose cover crop biomass (up to 14 mg kg(-1) soil nitrate), indicating a target biomass threshold for maximum water quality impact. Additional sampling years will be necessary to account for cover crop response to climate variability. Combining remote sensing with farm program data can provide important information to scientists and regulators working to improve conservation programs. Results can be used to more effectively utilize scarce conservation resources and increase water quality protection.

J	Watts, JD; Lawrence, RL; Miller, PR; Montagne, C				Watts, Jennifer D.; Lawrence, Rick L.; Miller, Perry R.; Montagne, Cliff			Monitoring of cropland practices for carbon sequestration purposes in north central Montana by Landsat remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We used an object-oriented approach in conjunction with the Random Forest algorithm to classify agricultural practices, including tillage (till or no-till (NT)), crop intensity, and grassland-based conservation reserve (CR). The object-oriented approach allowed for per-field classifications and the incorporation of contextual elements in addition to spectral features. Random Forest is a classification tree-based advanced classifier that avoids data over-fitting associated with many tree-based models and incorporates an unbiased internal classification accuracy assessment. Landsat satellite imagery was chosen for its continuous coverage, cost effectiveness, and image accessibility. Classification results for 2007 included producer's accuracies of 91% for NT and 31% for tillage when applying Random Forest to image objects generated from a May Landsat image. Low classification accuracies likely were attributed to the misclassification of conservation-based tillage practices as NT. Results showed that the binary separation of tillage from NT management is likely not appropriate due to surface spectral and textural similarities between NT and conservation-type tillage practices. Crop and CR lands resulted in producer's accuracies of 100% and 90%, respectively. Crop and fallow producer's accuracies were 95% and 82% in the 2007 classification, despite post-senesced vegetation; misclassification within the fallow class was attributed to pixel-mixing problems in areas of narrow (<100 m) strip management. A between-date normalized difference vegetation index approach was successfully used to detect areas having "changed" in vegetation status between the 2007 and prior image dates; classified "changed" objects were then merged with "unchanged" objects to produce crop status maps. Field crop intensity was then determined from the multi-year analysis of generated crop status maps. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Effect of Soil Spectral Properties on Remote Sensing of Crop Residue Cover	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Conservation tillage practices often leave appreciable amounts of crop residues on soil surfaces after harvesting and generally improve soil structure, enhance soil organic C (SOC) content, and reduce soil erosion. Remote sensing methods have shown great promise in efficiently estimating crop residue cover, and thus inferring soil tillage intensity. Furthermore, these tillage intensity estimates can be used in soil C models. Reflectance spectra of more than 4200 soils and 80 crop residues were measured in the laboratory across the 350- to 2500-nm wavelength region. Six remote sensing spectral indices were used to estimate crop residue cover: the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), the Lignin- Cellulose Absorption Index (LCA), the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI.), the Normalized Difference Senescent Vegetation Index (NDSVI), and the Normalized Difference Indices 5 and 7 (ND15 and ND17, respectively). Soil mineralogy and SOC affected these spectral indices for crop residue cover more than soil taxonomic order, which generally had little effect on spectral reflectance. The values of the spectral indices for soils were similar within Land Resource Regions and, specifically, for Major Land Resource Areas. The CAI showed the best separation between soils and residues, followed by LCA and NDTI. Although NDSVI, ND15, and ND17 had significant overlaps between soil and residue index values, assessments of crop residue cover classes may be possible with local calibrations. Future satellite sensors should include appropriate bands for assessing crop residue and nonphotosynthetic vegetation.

The relative influence of fire and herbivory on savanna three-dimensional vegetation structure	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The relative importance of fire and herbivory on vegetation structure has been the subject of much debate in savanna ecology. Fire regime and herbivore numbers are two key variables that managers of protected areas can manipulate to meet their conservation objectives. We deployed a new airborne remote sensing system (Carnegie Airborne Observatory) to the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, to map a unique herbivore/fire exclusion experiment on basaltic soils. We collected high resolution (56 cm) three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structural data over areas that have been protected from herbivores (34 yr) and/or fire (7 yr), as well as those exposed to both disturbance agents. Canopy height distribution, as well as the distribution of foliage within the vertical canopy profile, differed significantly between all treatments and between each, treatment and the control area (Kolmogorov-Smimov, p < 0.001). Herbivory exerted a greater influence on vegetation 3-D structure and heterogeneity than did fire. At the broad scale, total percentage woody cover was 36 times greater in areas protected from herbivores, compared to the control area. At a finer scale, areas protected from herbivores contained 5 times more tall tree canopy (> 9 m) and up to 66 times more small tree canopy (3-6 m). Fire restricted growth of vegetation in the 0-3 m height range, both in the absence and presence of herbivores. Our findings highlight the active role that conservation managers can play in modifying vegetation structure and heterogeneity through herbivore and fire management, as well as the value of 3-D remote sensing for the assessment of conservation management outcomes.

Allocation of hunting effort by Amazonian smallholders: Implications for conserving wildlife in mixed-use landscapes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Most tropical forest landscapes are modified by humans, but the effects of these changes on rural hunting patterns and hunted vertebrate populations remain poorly understood. We investigated subsistence hunting patterns across a highly heterogeneous landscape mosaic in the Brazilian Amazon, where hunters from three villages had access to primary forest, active and fallow agricultural fields, and active and fallow Eucalyptus plantations. Landscape composition and the areas used by hunters were defined using a remote-sensing approach combined with mapping. We quantified hunting effort accounting for the availability and spatial distribution of each habitat. Overall, 71% of the kills were sourced in primary forest, but hunting in primary forest, which was often combined with other extractive activities (such as Brazil nut harvesting), yielded the lowest catch-per-unit-effort of all habitats. Hunting effort per unit area was highest in fallow fields, followed by primary forest, and both of these habitats were over-represented within village hunting catchments when compared to the composition of the available landscape. Active and fallow fields sourced a limited number of species known to be resilient to hunting, but hunting had additional benefits through crop-raider control. In contrast, hunting pressure in active and fallow plantations was low, despite a high catch-per-unit-effort, presumably because there were limited additional benefits from visiting these habitats. These results indicate that large-scale tree plantation and forest regeneration schemes have limited conservation potential for large vertebrates, as they support few forest specialists and fail to attract hunters away from primary forest, (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The frontal Froude number Fr is an important parameter characterizing the frontal status with respect to both propagation and vertical mixing. In this study, we examine azimuthal variations in Fr using a new remote sensing method. We derive Fr from SAR image data on the basis of the SAR imaging theory and the mechanism of internal wave fission at front. This method is applied to a SAR image showing a front off the Columbia River (CR) mouth taken on 31 May 2003 at 14: 33: 19 UTC under weak wind conditions. Fr increases from south to north along the front. This variation is consistent with potential vorticity conservation and the influence of tidal currents on the plume. This calculation confirms arguments based on vessel observations by Jay et al. (2009). Citation: Pan, J., D. A. Jay, and H.

J	Muller, J; Brandl, R				Mueller, Joerg; Brandl, Roland			Assessing biodiversity by remote sensing in mountainous terrain: the potential of LiDAR to predict forest beetle assemblages	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. Effective biodiversity management can only be implemented if data are available on assemblage-environment relationships. The level of detail needs to be relevant to the scale of planning and decision making. A number of remote-sensing methods are available, but there are few studies that link information collected at both landscape and local scales. This is particularly true for arthropods even though these organisms are ecologically very important. 2. We assessed the predictive power of habitat variables measured by airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging; LiDAR) to model the activity, richness and composition of assemblages of forest-dwelling beetles. We compared the results with data acquired using conventional field methods. We sampled beetles with pitfall traps and flight-interception traps at 171 sampling stations along an elevation gradient in a montane forest. 3. We found a high predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables, which captured most of the predictive power of variables measured in ground surveys. In particular, mean body size and species composition of assemblages showed considerable predictability using LiDAR-derived variables. The differences in the predictability of species richness and diversity of assemblages between trap types can be explained by sample size. We expect predictabilities with R-2 of up to 0 center dot 6 for samples with 250 individuals on average. 4. The statistical response of beetle data and the ecological interpretability of results showed that airborne laser scanning can be used for cost-effective mapping (LiDAR : field survey : beetles 15 : 100 : 260 euro ha(-1)) of biodiversity even in remote mountain areas and in structurally complex habitats, such as forests. 5. Synthesis and applications. The strong relationship between characteristics of beetle assemblages to variables derived by laser scanning provides an opportunity to link data from local ground surveys of hyperdiverse taxa to data collected remotely at the landscape scale. This will enable conservation managers to evaluate habitats, define hotspots or map activity, richness and composition of assemblages at scales relevant for planning and management. In addition to the large area that can be sampled remotely, the grain of the data allows a single tree to be identified, which opens up the possibility of planning management actions at local scales.																	0021-8901	1365-2664				AUG	2009	46	4					897	905		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01677.x								WOS:000267706000019						
J	Girard, C; Tucker, AD; Calmettes, B				Girard, Charlotte; Tucker, Anton D.; Calmettes, Beatriz			Post-nesting migrations of loggerhead sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico: dispersal in highly dynamic conditions	MARINE BIOLOGY												This study is the first report of post-nesting migrations of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting in Sarasota County (Florida, USA), their most important rookery in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). In total, 28 females (curved carapace length CCL between 82.2 and 112.0 cm) were satellite-tracked between May 2005 and December 2007. Post-nesting migrations were completed in 3-68 days (mean +/- A SD = 23 +/- A 16 days). Five different migration patterns were observed: six turtles remained in the vicinity of their nesting site while the other individuals moved either to the south-western part of the Florida Shelf (n = 9 turtles), the Northeast GOM (n = 2 turtles), the South GOM (Yucatan Shelf and Campeche Bay, Mexico, and Cuba; n = 5 turtles) or the Bahamas (n = 6 turtles). In average, turtles moved along rather straight routes over the continental shelf but showed more indirect paths in oceanic waters. Path analyses coupled with remote sensing oceanographic data suggest that most of long-distance migrants reached their intended foraging destinations but did not compensate for the deflecting action of ocean currents. While six out of seven small individuals (CCL < 90 cm) remained on the Florida Shelf, larger individuals showed various migration strategies, staying on the Florida Shelf or moving to long-distance foraging grounds. This study highlights the primary importance the Western Florida Shelf in the management of the Florida Nesting Subpopulation, as well as the need of multi-national effort to promote the conservation of the loggerhead turtle in the Western Atlantic.

Remote sensing and the future of landscape ecology	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Landscape ecology focuses on the analysis of spatial pattern and its relationship to ecological processes. As a scientific discipline, landscape ecology has grown rapidly in recent years, supported by developments in GIS and spatial analysis techniques. Although remote sensing data are widely employed in landscape ecology research, their current and potential roles have not been evaluated critically. To provide an overview of current practice, 438 research papers published in the journal Landscape Ecology for the years 2004-2008 were examined for information about use of remote sensing. Results indicated that only 36% of studies explicitly mentioned remote sensing. Of those that did so, aerial photographs and Landsat satellite sensor images were most commonly used, accounting for 46% and 42% of studies, respectively. The predominant application of remote sensing data across these studies was for thematic mapping purposes. This suggests that landscape ecologists have been relatively slow to recognize the potential value of recent developments in remote sensing technologies and methods. The review also provided evidence of a frequent lack of key detail in studies recently published in Landscape Ecology , with 75% failing to provide any assessment of uncertainty or error relating to image classification and mapping. It is suggested that the role of remote sensing in landscape ecology might be strengthened by closer collaboration between researchers in the two disciplines, by greater integration of diverse remote sensing data with ecological data, and by increased recognition of the value of remote sensing beyond land-cover mapping and pattern description. This is illustrated by case studies drawn from Latin America (focusing on forest loss and fragmentation) and the UK (focusing on habitat quality for woodland birds). Such approaches might improve the analytical and theoretical rigour of landscape ecology, and be applied usefully to issues of outstanding societal interest, such as the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Because such areas may be large, not easily accessible, subject to change, and sensitive to the surrounding landscape, remote sensing can be a valuable tool in establishing and managing protected areas. We describe three case studies to illustrate how remote sensing can contribute to setting priorities for conservation actions, monitoring the status of conservation targets, and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. In the Connecticut River watershed, remote sensing has been used to assess flood regimes and identify key areas of floodplain forests and their context for conservation planning. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, remote sensing has provided information to assess the effectiveness of management strategies to restore fire to the longleaf pine sandhills ecosystem, control invasive species, and prioritize annual prescribed burns. In eastern US forests, remote sensing is being used to evaluate the ecological condition and changes at properties where direct access would be difficult. As the resolution and capacities of remote-sensing technology continue to develop, however, several issues are becoming increasingly important. It is essential that the spatial and temporal resolution of remotesensing data be matched to the relevant scales of biodiversity, major threats, and management actions. Data layers must be compatible, both in scale and in measurement properties, and key patterns must be distinguished from irrelevant detail, especially at the finer scales of application in local management. Combining remote sensing with ground surveys can expand the array of information used in management and contribute to the ecological interpretation of remote-sensing data. Because conservation funds are always limited, remote sensing also must be cost effective. This requires balancing the wealth of detail afforded by ever-finer resolution of remote-sensing data with what is actually needed to implement sound conservation and management. Remote sensing is a valuable tool, but it is not a panacea for all of the challenges of conservation monitoring and management.

In this study we developed and implemented a multi-scale protocol for detecting and monitoring land-cover change in and adjacent to National Parks and ten segments of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail (AT) in the northeastern United States. We used Landsat imagery from 1970 to 2002 and recent ground-based photography to evaluate changes within park boundaries and within 0.5. 1, and 5 km buffers. The study concluded that all of the studied park units, except one segment of AT in Maine, experienced increases of urban land and declines of forest cover in the immediately adjacent areas and extended buffer zones. Over 30 years and across all parks and trail segments, urban land increased 172% and 181% within 0.5 and 1 km, respectively, of the park boundary or trail centerline. Over the same time period, forested area decreased by 5% and 6% within 0.5 and 1 km, respectively, of the park boundary or trail centerline, with more loss of forest near the parks (18%) than the trail segments (2%). This study provided baseline data demonstrating landcover alteration over the past three decades and a foundation for a land-cover change and landscape context protocol suitable for monitoring future changes of National Parks and protected areas.

Emerging protocols for assessing the conservation status of communities include as central criteria the current extent, historical reduction and contemporary rate of decline in geographic distribution. Estimation of these parameters is confronted by methodological challenges, data limitations and uncertainties that may vary from case to case. We describe an approach to these issues comprising five steps: (1) classification of the community using an analysis of data from systematic ground surveys; (2) mapping to produce a contemporary baseline distribution (1980s); (3) interpolation to produce a historical distribution (pre-European settlement); (4) interpretation of satellite imagery to update the distribution (various dates up to 2004) and (5) assessment of change in extent over historical and contemporary time scales incorporating plausible bounds of uncertainty around best estimates. The bounds can be based on areas for which image interpretation produces uncertain diagnosis of clearing and differences between credible alternative base maps of the same area. We demonstrated the approach using a case study of Coolibah-Black Box Woodland, a declining semi-arid woodland community in Australia and found that 61% (plausible range 50-67%) of the woodland community had been cleared since European settlement and that during 1998-2004 the community continued to decline on average by 135.3(+/- 21.7) km(2) each year, or 1.7(+/- 0.3)% of each previous year's distribution, apparently accelerating in recent years. Strengths of the approach include the use of biological data (cf. remote sensing) to distinguish the target assemblage from others, the use of historical and contemporary base lines to examine change over different time scales, and the use of bounded estimates to incorporate uncertainty into the assessment.

A method for assessing evergreen habitats using phytodiversity and geospatial techniques in tropical rain forests of Southern Western Ghats (India)	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												We have used data generated using remote sensing and geographical information systems to categorize habitats, and then determined the relationship between the habitat categorizations and species-distribution patterns. A biologically rich hotspot-Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, located at Southern Western Ghats, India, was chosen for this study. In order to spatially delineate areas of high species richness/diversity and endemic habitat zones, we have identified evergreen habitats in conjunction with landscape metrics, species assemblage, micro-habitats like slope, topography, species endemism, and proportion of core and edge species. A total of 236 species and 2,920 individuals were recorded using systematic stratified plots of 0.1 ha covering 47 plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was done using Ward's method. Plot information was used to identify clusters based on species density. The analysis showed five species assemblages that are quite distinct from each other in terms of dominant species. The distribution of endemic and edge species, land cover heterogeneity, and continuity of patches in these clusters were evaluated to understand the degree of disturbance and intactness at landscape scale. Integration of species assemblages and topography brought out four major elevation-slope complexes. Information on species composition (robust field survey) with spectral (hybrid classification) properties has shown 72% overall accuracy and distinguished four evergreen sub-groups and other land cover classes. The developed approach assumes great importance in the assessment of biodiversity and prioritizing the areas of conservation.																	0912-3814					JUL	2009	24	4					749	760		10.1007/s11284-008-0547-4								WOS:000267680600005						
J	Geneletti, D; Dawa, D				Geneletti, Davide; Dawa, Dorje			Environmental impact assessment of mountain tourism in developing regions: A study in Ladakh, Indian Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW												Mountain tourism in developing countries is becoming a growing environmental concern due to extreme seasonality, lack of suitable infrastructures and planning, and interference with fragile ecosystems and protected areas. This paper presents a Study devoted to assess the adverse environmental impacts of tourism, and in particular of trekking-related activities, in Ladakh, Indian Himalaya. The proposed approach is based on the use of Geographical Information System (GIS) modeling and remote sensing imageries to cope with the lack of data that affect the region. First, stressors associated with trekking, and environmental receptors potentially affected were identified. Subsequently, a baseline study on stressors (trail use, waste dumping, camping, pack animal grazing and off-road driving) and receptors (soil, water, wildlife, vegetation) was conducted through field work, data collection, and data processing supported by GIS. Finally. impacts were modeled by considering the intensity of the stressors, and the vulnerability and the Value of the receptors. The results were spatially aggregated into watershed units, and combined to generate composite impact maps. The study concluded that the most affected watersheds are located in the central and southeastern part of Ladakh, along some of the most visited trails and within the Hemis and the Tsokar Tsomoriri National parks. The main objective of the study was to understand patterns of tourism-induced environmental degradation, so as to support mitigation interventions, as well as the development of suitable tourism policies.

A kinematic wave based watershed model for soil erosion and sediment yield	CATENA												In this study, a finite element method based soil erosion and sediment yield model has been developed for overland and stream flow. The one dimensional conservation of mass of sediment flow equation has been solved based on kinematic wave flow approximation and Galerkin's based numerical solution. Various thematic maps required for the model are prepared using Geographical Information System (GIS). Land use/Land cover is extracted from remotely sensed data.

Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, each country has approached forest monitoring, protection and the improvement of forest conditions in its own way. Spaceborne remote sensing of forest changes across country borders offers great potential for better understanding the underlying drivers of change and for developing comparable indicators between countries. For this paper we evaluated how forests changed in the border region of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 1987 and 2005 and how these changes depended on industrial transformations before and after 1989. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to assess forest cover change between 1987 and 2005. Our results showed that 8.12% of the forest stands in our study region were degraded either partially or completely during that time period, a percentage that equals 14,972 ha of the area's total forest cover. At the same time, 7.57% (13,951 ha) of the area were reforested or regenerated on previously damaged forest stands. Forest changes were similar in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but differed in Poland. Comparing forest composition, topography, and aspect with forest decline revealed the importance of forest management and pollution legacies from communist times when explaining today's forest disturbance patterns.

In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, illegal logging increased and reforestation on abandoned farmland was widespread after the breakdown of socialism, and the region's forest cover trends remain overall largely unclear. Our goal here was to map forest cover change and to assess the extent of illegal logging and reforestation in the Ukrainian Carpathians. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive forest change trajectories between 1988 and 2007 for the entire Ukrainian Carpathians. We calculated logging and reforestation rates, and compared Landsat-based forest trends to official statistics and inventory maps. Our classification resulted in reliable forest/nonforest maps (overall accuracies between 97.1%-98.01%) and high clear cut detection rates (on average 89.4%). Forest cover change was widespread in the Ukrainian Carpathians between 1988 and 2007. We found forest cover increase in peripheral areas, forest loss in the interior Carpathians, and increased logging in remote areas. Overall, our results suggest that unsustainable forest use from socialist times likely persisted in the post-socialist period, resulting in a continued loss of older forests and forest fragmentation. Landsat-based forest trends differed substantially from official forest resource statistics. Illegal logging appears to have been at least as extensive as documented logging during the early 1990s and so-called sanitary clear-cuts represent a major loophole for overharvesting and logging in restricted areas. Reforestation and illegal logging are frequently not accounted for in forest resource statistics, highlighting limitations of these data. Combating illegal logging and transitioning towards sustainable forestry requires better monitoring and up-to-date accounting of forest resources, in the Carpathians and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and remote sensing can be a key technology to achieve these goals.

J	Remm, K; Remm, L				Remm, Kalle; Remm, Liina			Similarity-based large-scale distribution mapping of orchids	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The expected presence/absence of a target species outside the area of actual observations is commonly estimated using statistical models or decision criteria. This investigation demonstrates a similarity-based solution for predictive mapping as an alternative to generalizing models. The maps of the expected distribution of 12 orchids were created using find sites from field observations and absence sites generated onto the observation track. The expected presence/absence of a species in a location was calculated according to the similarity between the location and selected examples of presence and absence sites. A machine learning system selected the best predictive sets for each species out of 161 cartographic and remote sensing features. The usefulness of the predictive distribution maps was expressed as the ratio of the density of find sites per track in the predicted presence area relative to the density per track in the predicted absence area. The predictive mapping was more efficient for Dactylorhiza incarnata, D. russowii, Gymnadenia conopsea, and Goodyera repens. Soil properties and the proportion of find sites for the other species in the vicinity were the most indicative site characteristics. The rarer species were found to be better indicators of the occurrence of the other species than were the more common orchids. The proposed approach-to direct subsequent field observations to sites where the occurrence of the target species was predicted but has not yet been recorded-helped discover new populations of orchids and enhance the representativeness of absence sites.																	0960-3115					JUN	2009	18	6					1629	1647		10.1007/s10531-008-9547-5								WOS:000266137900012

Conservation Threats Due to Human-Caused Increases in Fire Frequency in Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Periodic wildfire is an important natural process in Mediterranean-climate ecosystems, but increasing fire recurrence threatens the fragile ecology of these regions. Because most fires are human-caused, we investigated how human population patterns affect fire frequency. Prior research in California suggests the relationship between population density and fire frequency is not linear. There are few human ignitions in areas with low population density, so fire frequency is low. As population density increases, human ignitions and fire frequency also increase, but beyond a density threshold, the relationship becomes negative as fuels become sparser and fire suppression resources are concentrated. We tested whether this hypothesis also applies to the other Mediterranean-climate ecosystems of the world. We used global satellite databases of population, fire activity, and land cover to evaluate the spatial relationship between humans and fire in the world's five Mediterranean-climate ecosystems. Both the mean and median population densities were consistently and substantially higher in areas with than without fire, but fire again peaked at intermediate population densities, which suggests that the spatial relationship is complex and nonlinear. Some land-cover types burned more frequently than expected, but no systematic differences were observed across the five regions. The consistent association between higher population densities and fire suggests that regardless of differences between land-cover types, natural fire regimes, or overall population, the presence of people in Mediterranean-climate regions strongly affects the frequency of fires; thus, population growth in areas now sparsely settled presents a conservation concern. Considering the sensitivity of plant species to repeated burning and the global conservation significance of Mediterranean-climate ecosystems, conservation planning needs to consider the human influence on fire frequency. Fine-scale spatial analysis of relationships between people and fire may help identify areas where increases in fire frequency will threaten ecologically valuable areas.

Mapping Economic Returns to Agriculture for Informing Environmental Policy in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												We integrate information from several disparate data sources including agricultural statistics and remote sensing to quantify and map the distribution and dynamics of agricultural returns to land and water resources from 1996/1997 to 2000/2001 in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Total profit to agriculture was estimated at AUD3.86B in 1996/1997 and AUD3.73B in 2000/2001. The mapping reveals a high spatial concentration of economic returns to land and water resources from agriculture. Dryland agriculture covers over 82% of the study area. Irrigated agriculture covers 1.7% of the land area (2000/2001) but returns one third of the total profit to agriculture. We found that around 80% of the profit to agriculture comes from just over 5% of the land area. The results from this regional scale economic mapping can inform regulatory policy and public investments in natural resource management through targeting industries and regions that provide low marginal returns to the natural resource base.

Changes in the shape of coastline may fundamentally affect the environment of the coastal zone. This may be caused by natural processes and/or human activities. Over the past 30 years, the coastal sites in Turkey have been under an intensive restraint associated with a population press due to the internal and external touristic demand. In addition, urbanization on the filled up areas, settlements, and the highways constructed to overcome the traffic problems and the other applications in the coastal region clearly confirm an intensive restraint. Aerial photos with medium spatial resolution and high resolution satellite imagery are ideal data sources for mapping coastal land use and monitoring their changes for a large area. This study introduces an efficient method to monitor coastline and coastal land use changes using time series aerial photos (1973 and 2002) and satellite imagery (2005) covering the same geographical area. Results show the effectiveness of the use of digital photogrammetry and remote sensing data on monitoring large area of coastal land use status. This study also showed that over 161 ha areas were filled up in the research area and along the coastal land 12.2 ha of coastal erosion is determined for the period of 1973 to 2005. Consequently, monitoring of coastal land use is thus necessary for coastal area planning in order to protecting the coastal areas from climate changes and other coastal processes.																	0167-6369					JUN	2009	153	1-4					391	403		10.1007/s10661-008-0366-7								WOS:000265917200035	18560986

Airborne spectranomics: mapping canopy chemical and taxonomic diversity in tropical forests	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Tree canopies play an enormous role in the maintenance of tropical forest diversity and ecosystem function, and are therefore central to conservation, management, and resource policy development in tropical regions. However, high-resolution mapping of tropical forest canopies is very difficult, because traditional field, airborne, and satellite measurements cannot resolve the number of canopy species, or particular species of interest, over the large regional scales commensurate with conservation goals and strategies. Newer technologies, such as imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (lidar), are just now reaching performance levels that will allow monitoring of tropical forest diversity from the air, but the methods for applying these technologies are not yet ready. Here, we present concepts that combine chemical and spectral remote sensing perspectives to facilitate canopy diversity mapping. Using examples from our ongoing work in the Hawaiian Islands, we demonstrate how a new "airborne spectranomics" approach could revolutionize tropical forest monitoring in the future.

For some animal species, relative habitat availability can be estimated using time series of aerial photographs, but the limited information in old black-and-white images makes it challenging to estimate accurately at large spatial scales. Australia's most endangered snake, the broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides, requires unshaded, exfoliated sandstone rocks for shelter. Using digitized aerial photographs of four sites from 1941 and 1971, and a Quickbird satellite image from 2006, we estimated the trend in habitat availability for a well-studied population of H. bungaroides in New South Wales. We did this using both traditional, pixel-based classifications and a more recently developed object-based approach. Both classification methods revealed substantial, monotonic decreases (by 24-77%) in the percentage cover of bare rock from 1941 to 2006 at all sites, with concomitant (although non-monotonic) net increases in percentage tree-canopy cover of 3-70%. The cover of herbaceous and low-shrub vegetation appeared variable and was poorly resolved in the classifications. Both classification methods yielded adequate (> 70%) accuracy for most images, but the object-based classifications were consistently more accurate than the pixel-based classifications and performed better when analysing images (from 1971) with comparatively low resolution. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that habitat availability for broad-headed snakes has decreased considerably over 65 years due to increased shading from vegetation, and that object-based image analysis is a promising tool for assessing habitat trends using historical photographs. Multiple studies have reported woody-vegetation increases over multi-decadal time-scales in Australia and elsewhere, but few have tied these trends to habitat availability for animal species of concern. The phenomenon we document may therefore be quite widespread, and advances in remote sensing (including applications and refinements of the methods presented here) will be invaluable for revealing these trends and designing ameliorative management strategies. Management plans to conserve broad-headed snakes and similarly threatened species should include either controlled burns or regular targeted removal of vegetation, preferably after a rigorous comparison of the relative economic and biological costs and benefits of each.

Morphometric analysis has been commonly applied to prioritization of watersheds. The present study makes an attempt to prioritize sub-watersheds based on morphometric and land use characteristics using remote sensing and GIS techniques in Kanera watershed of Guna district, Madhya Pradesh. Various morphometric parameters, namely linear and shape have been determined for each sub-watershed and assigned ranks on the basis of value/relationship so as to arrive at a computed value for a final ranking of the sub-watersheds. Land use/land cover change analysis of the sub-watersheds has been carried out using multi-temporal data of IRS LISS II of 1989 and IRS LISS III of 2001. The study demonstrates the significant land use changes especially in cultivated lands, open scrub, open forest, water bodies and wastelands from 1989 to 2001. Based on morphometric and land use/land cover analysis, the sub-watersheds have been classified into three categories as high, medium and low in terms of priority for conservation and management of natural resources. Out of the seven sub-watersheds, two sub-watersheds viz., SW1 and SW6 qualify for high priority, whereas SW7 has been categorised as medium priority based on the integration of morphometric and land use change analysis.																	0255-660X					JUN	2009	37	2					261	274		10.1007/s12524-009-0016-8								WOS:000275958600010

Estimation of Surface Runoff in Malattar Sub-watershed using SCS-CN Method	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Nowadays watershed management plays a vital role in water resources engineering. Watershed based on water resources management is necessary to plan and conserve the available resources. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques can be effectively used to manage spatial and non spatial database that represent the hydrologic characteristics of the watershed use as realistically as possible. The present study area is Malattar sub-watershed (4C2B2) lies in the region Gudiyattam w Block, Vellore District, Tamil Nadu. The daily rainfall data of Gudiyattam rain gauge station (1971-2007) was collected and used to predict the daily runoff from the watershed using Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method (USDA, 1972) and GIS. Monthly and annual runoff have been calculated from the monthly rainfall data for the years of 1971 to 2007 in the watershed area. The average minimum and maximum rainfall for the years of 1971 to 2007 is 35.30 mm and 111.61 mm respectively and average runoff for the year of 1971 to 2007 is 31.87 mm(3) and 47.04 mm(3) respectively. The developed rainfall-runoff model is used to understand the watershed and its runoff flow characteristics.																	0255-660X					JUN	2009	37	2					291	304		10.1007/s12524-009-0017-7								WOS:000275958600012

The runoff factor of MUSLE was computed using the measured values of runoff and peak rate of runoff at outlet of the watershed. The topographic factor (LS) was determined using GIS while crop management factor (C) was determined from land use/land cover data, obtained from RS and field survey. The conservation practice factor (P) was obtained from the literature. Sediment yield at the outlet of the study watershed was simulated for 345 rainfall events spread over a period of 1996-2001 and validated with the measured values. Nash-Sutcliffe simulation model efficiency of 0.8 and high value of coefficient of determination (0.83) indicated that MUSLE model estimated sediment yield satisfactorily.

Late Quaternary dynamics of a South African floodplain wetland and the implications for assessing recent human impacts	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Knowledge of the long-term geomorphological dynamics of wetlands is limited, so currently there is an inadequate scientific basis for assessing anthropogenically induced changes and for developing conservation, remediation, and/or sustainable management guidelines for these fragile ecosystems. Along the upper Klip River, eastern South Africa, geomorphological and sedimentological investigations, geochronology, and remote sensing have been used to establish the late Quaternary dynamics of some internationally important floodplain wetlands, thus providing a reference condition against which to assess the extent of recent human impacts. Optically stimulated luminescence dating reveals that the wetlands have developed over at least the last 30 ky as a result of slow meander migration (<0.2 m y(-1)), irregular cutoff events, and infrequent avulsions (approximately one every 3-6 ky) that have occurred autogenically as a natural part of meander-belt development. Following European settlement in the Klip valley (late nineteenth century), however, modifications to local flora and fauna, as well as the initiation of local wetland drainage schemes, have had major impacts. In particular, proliferation of exotic willows and associated debris jams, and the artificial excavation of a 1.2-km-long channel section across the wetlands have initiated an ongoing avulsion that is characterised by failure (gradual abandonment) of the main channel and rapid incision of a headcutting channel. Compared to the pre-settlement condition, little change in lateral migration activity has occurred, but this avulsion provides a clear example of anthropogenically accelerated change, occurring only -1 ky after the last natural avulsion and in a part of the wetlands where avulsions have not occurred previously. Subsequent human interventions have included installing weirs in an attempt to control the resulting erosion and promote reflooding, but ongoing maintenance has been required. In areas that were not glaciated during the Quaternary, many other floodplain wetlands may be of similar antiquity, but the Klip River illustrates their sensitivity to direct and indirect human impacts.

One of the world's largest remaining areas of tropical forest is located in Papua New Guinea. Here we show that change in its extent and condition has occurred to a greater extent than previously recorded. We assessed deforestation and forest degradation in Papua New Guinea by comparing a land-cover map from 1972 with a land-cover map created from nationwide high-resolution satellite imagery recorded since 2002. In 2002 there were 28,251,967 ha of tropical rain forest. Between 1972 and 2002, a net 15 percent of Papua New Guinea's tropical forests were cleared and 8.8 percent were degraded through logging. The drivers of forest change have been concentrated within the accessible forest estate where a net 36 percent were degraded or deforested through both forestry and nonforestry processes. Since 1972, 13 percent of upper montane forests have also been lost. We estimate that over the period 1990-2002, overall rates of change generally increased and varied between 0.8 and 1.8 percent/yr, while rates in commercially accessible forest have been far higher-having varied between 1.1 and 3.4 percent/yr. These rates are far higher than those reported by the FAO over the same period. We conclude that rapid and substantial forest change has occurred in Papua New Guinea, with the major drivers being logging in the lowland forests and subsistence agriculture throughout the country with comparatively minor contributions from forest fires, plantation establishment, and mining.																	0006-3606					MAY	2009	41	3					379	390		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00495.x								WOS:000265407000015

The successional stages were mapped using the combination of Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), aerial photos and high resolution satellite images (IKONOS). Forest structure and its relationship with structural plant diversity along with its changes over time were characterized using FRAGSTATS. In terms of spatial configuration of seral stages, the total number of fragments increased from 572 to 735, and mean size of patch (MPS) decreased from 154.97 ha to 120.60 ha over 33 years. The situation resulted in forestation serving appropriate conditions for plant diversity in the area. As an overall change in study area, there was a net increase of 1823.3 ha forest during the period with an average annual forestation rate of 55.25 ha year(-1)(0.4% per year). In conclusion, the study revealed that stand type maps of forest management plans in Turkey provide a great chance to monitor the changes in structural plant diversity over time. The study further contributes to the development of a framework for effective integration of biodiversity conservation into Multiple Use Forest Management (MUFM) plans using the successional stages as a critical mechanism.

The study area is located about 44 km north of Ankara and covers 17.5 km(2). The selected theme layers of this model include topographic factor, soil factors (depth, texture, impermeable horizon) and land use. Slope layer and land use-land cover data were prepared by using DEM and Landsat-TM satellite image. According to land use classification, the most common land use type and land cover are rangeland (50.5%) then, rainfed (36.4%), week forest land (3.2%), irrigated land (0.7%) and other various lands (rock out crop and lake) (9.2%). Each land characteristic is also considered as a thematic layer in geographical information systems (GIS) process. After combination of the layers, soil erosion risk map was produced. The results showed that 44.4% of the study area is at high soil erosion risk, whereas 42% of the study area is insignificantly and slightly susceptible to erosion risk. In addition, it was found that only 12.6% of the total area is moderately susceptible to erosion risk. Furthermore, conservation land management measures were also suggested for moderate, high and very high erosion risk areas in Ankara-Guvenc Basin.																	0254-8704					MAY	2009	30	3					339	344										WOS:000265504200004	20120455

The 795,000 km(2) catchment encompasses several ecoregions, incorporating biodiverse and productive wetland systems. Eighty percent of the rapidly expanding population of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), made up in part by Lao PDR. Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam, live in rural areas and are heavily reliant on wetland resources. As the populations of Cambodia and Lao PDR will double in the next 20 years, pressure on natural resources and particularly wetlands can only increase. For development planning, resource and conservation management to incorporate wetland issues, information on the distribution and character of Mekong wetlands is essential. The existing but outdated wetland maps were compiled from secondary landuse-landcover data, have limited coverage, poor thematic accuracy and no metadata. Therefore the Mekong River Commission (MRC) undertook to produce new wetland coverage for the LMB. As resources, funding and regional capacity are limited, it was determined that the method applied should use existing facilities, be easily adaptable, and replicable locally. For the product to be useful it must be accepted by local governments and decision makers. The results must be of acceptable accuracy (%75%) and the methodology should be relatively understandable to non-experts. In the first stage of this exercise, field survey was conducted at five pilot sites covering a range of typical wetland habitats (MRC wetland classification) to supply data for a supervised classification of Landsat ETM images from the existing MRC archive. Images were analysed using ERDAS IMAGINE and applying Maximum Likelihood Classification. Field data were reserved to apply formal accuracy assessment to the final wetland habitat maps, with resulting accuracy ranging from 77 to 94%. The maps produced are now in use at a Provincial and National level in three countries for resource and conservation planning and management applications, including designation of a Ramsar wetland site of international importance.

In this study. the aquatic plants of the large and shallow Lake Mogan, located in Central Anatolia were identified and mapped using high spatial resolution Quickbird imagery. As Lake Mogan is an important bird area the assessment of submerged plant species is of great value for ecosystem conservation and management. Quickbird multispectral image acquired on August 6, 2005 was geometrically corrected and a water mask was used based on strong absorption of Near Infrared (NIR) wavelengths by calm, clear and deep water. The water mask was applied using band reflectance values for a specific pixel satisfying the conditions of band decreasing property (Green > Red > NIR) and NIR < NIRthreshold. Unsupervised classification was applied to the wetland-only image to identify submerged plant vegetation classes. Spectral similarity among the isodata classes was used to decrease the number of the classes to the available species in the lake. Classification of Quickbird satellite data with an unsupervised classification technique provided high accuracy for identification and mapping of submerged plant coverage and of different submerged plant species and water classes (83.02% and 71.69%). Quickbird sensor data were found to be very useful for classifying submerged plants in a large and shallow lake. However, the closeness of the dates of field data collection to that of the sensor overpass and mixed pixel problem are the main limitations in the near-ideal conditions for submerged vegetation classification with satellite data having high spatial resolution.

Using Earth Observation to update a Natura 2000 habitat map for a wetland in Greece	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The European Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC has defined the need for the conservation of habitats and species with the adoption of appropriate measures. Within the Natura 2000 ecological network of special areas of conservation, natural habitats will be monitored to ensure the maintenance or restoration of their composition, structure and extent. The European Space Agency's GlobWetland project has provided remotely sensed products for several Ramsar wetlands worldwide, Such as detailed land cover-land use, water cycle and inundated vegetation maps. This paper presents the development and testing of an operational methodology for updating a wetland's habitat snap using the GlobWetland products. and the evaluation of the extent to which GlobWetland products have contributed to the habitat snap updating. The developed methodology incorporated both automated and analyst-supervised techniques to photo-interpret, delineate, refine, and evaluate the updated habitat polygons. The developed methodology was proven Successful in its application to the wetland complex of the Axios-Loudias-Aliakmon delta (Greece). The resulting habitat trap met the European and Greek national requirements.

Knowledge about the biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation retrieved from satellite images enables us to improve the monitoring of these unique areas, which are otherwise very often impenetrable and therefore difficult to examine, analyze and assess by means of site visits. The Biebrza Wetlands are Situated in the North-East part of Poland and are one of the largest areas made LIP of marshes and swamps in the entire EU. This is still one of the wildest areas and one of the least destroyed, damaged or changed by human impact. However, in the recent decades there have been attempts made to intensify and overexploit the natural resources of the region and implement new agriculture practices in the area. In this period, drainage canals have been built, and a good deal of the area has been drained. The area of this precious ecosystem covers 25494 ha. This valuable area of peat with unique vegetation species and with very special birds is one of the most valuable areas in Europe and in 1995 was added to the list of Ramsar sites. The investigation of wetlands in the Biebrza River Valley has been carried out at ground level by taking measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, Leaf Area Index, wet and dry biomass and the levels of ground water and meteorological parameters. Also examined were radiative temperature, detailed vegetation mapping, and APAR. For some years the deterioration of peat lands has been noticed due to the drying out of the area and the frequent outbreak of fires. The consequence is the succession of new vegetation and the appearance of new ecosystems. The Remote Sensing Centre in the Institute of Geodesy and Cartography has undertaken the investigation by applying ERS-2.SAR and ENVISAT ASAR of IS2 and IS4 and VV, HH, HV polarization for the purpose of modeling soil moisture and humidity changes of the area under investigation. The investigation also aimed at finding the best biophysical properties of wetlands' vegetation to characterize marshland habitats and its changes. At the same time as registering the microwave data, the optical data from Landsat ETM+, SPOT VEGETATION, ERS-2.ATSR. ENVISAT MERIS, and NOAA/AVHRR have been registered and information about the biomass and heat fluxes as sensible and latent heat has also been calculated. The vegetation indices are calculated from EO satellite data taking into account jointly the features of vegetation responsible for reflection in various bands and combining this information from several spectral bands. Also, the changes in the humidity of the area have been examined by extracting the backscattering coefficients from two SAR images that were taken at a similar period of the year but with a gap of 5 years. The information about soil moisture as retention, soil moisture changes, heat fluxes and evapotranspiration are all very important for estimates of CO2 sequestration. The ENVISAT images have been obtained for the ESA AO-ID122 project. Also the SMOS and ALOS data will be applied for the Biebrza Wetlands in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hartter, J; Southworth, J				Hartter, Joel; Southworth, Jane			Dwindling resources and fragmentation of landscapes around parks: wetlands and forest patches around Kibale National Park, Uganda	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Landscapes surrounding parks in most of the developing world, while still containing considerable biodiversity, also have rapidly growing human populations and associated agricultural development. Since the establishment of Kibale National Park first as a Crown Forest Reserve in 1932 and later as a park in 1993 in western Uganda, most access and resource extraction has been prohibited. The park has become nearly a complete island of forested land cover surrounded by intensive small-scale agriculture and some large-scale tea plantations, along with a network of wetland and forest patches. As the population grows outside the park and land becomes more scarce, remaining forests and wetlands are being used more intensively for material resources (e.g., fuelwood, building poles) and converted to other land uses (e.g., pasture, agriculture). This study uses both discrete and continuous data analyses of satellite imagery to examine these diminishing resource bases at the landscape level placing the results within the social context of conservation and parks. Findings reveal that the park boundaries have remained fairly intact whereas, the landscape surrounding the park has become increasingly fragmented. From a landscape perspective, while the park has indeed maintained its forest cover, it has become increasingly islandized with wetland and forest patches in the surrounding landscape becoming smaller in number and size. Those that have survived are now more isolated and even lower productivity than in 1984, which may be a precursor to their eventual loss in this landscape.

Monitoring Animal Behaviour and Environmental Interactions Using Wireless Sensor Networks, GPS Collars and Satellite Remote Sensing	SENSORS												Remote monitoring of animal behaviour in the environment can assist in managing both the animal and its environmental impact. GPS collars which record animal locations with high temporal frequency allow researchers to monitor both animal behaviour and interactions with the environment. These ground-based sensors can be combined with remotely-sensed satellite images to understand animal-landscape interactions. The key to combining these technologies is communication methods such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We explore this concept using a case-study from an extensive cattle enterprise in northern Australia and demonstrate the potential for combining GPS collars and satellite images in a WSN to monitor behavioural preferences and social behaviour of cattle.

Relationships between floristic diversity and vegetation indices, forest structure and landscape metrics of fragments in Brazilian Cerrado	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Favorable characteristics for development of agricultural activities were crucial factors in the fast substitution of the physiognomy of the Cerrado by agricultural crops and pastures. During this occupation process. the remaining natural vegetation became extremely fragmented and a little is known about the structural and functional integrity even about the species diversity of these ecosystems. The use of vegetation indices as indicators of the forest integrity has been shown to be a useful tool for environmental planning and also for conservation strategies. in this study, we analyzed the correlations between floristic diversity of 22 forests fragments, from diversity indices of Shannon and the equability of Pielou: and the structural parameters of communities represented by basal area and cylindrical volume. Correlations between the diversity and patch metric: AREA, PERIM, GYRATE, PARA, SHAPE. FRAC, CIRCLE. CONTIG, CORE, CAI. PROX and ENN obtained for fragments and among the indices NDVI, SAVI, EVI, MV15 and MV17 derived from TM/Landsat images acquired in two seasons Were also evaluated. The index which presented strongest correlation with floristic diversity was EVI and the one that showed strongest correlation with the equability was MV15. The structural parameters basal area and cylindrical volume did not present correlations with diversity and equability. The diversity and equability indices showed correlations with the fragment shape. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Quantifying and mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services: Utility of a multi-season NDVI based Mahalanobis distance surrogate	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												There is an urgent need for techniques to rapidly and periodically measure biodiversity and ecosystem services over large landscapes. Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Chats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.

Don Ciferri) in SW Sydney, Australia using satellite remote sensing	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Is satellite imagery an effective tool for mapping and examining the distribution of the invasive species Olea europaea L. ssp. cuspidata at a regional landscape scale? Location: Southwest Sydney, Australia. Methods: Remote sensing software was used to classify pixels of Olea europaea L. ssp. cuspidata (African Olive) and major vegetation types from satellite imagery, using a "supervised classification'' technique across a 721 km(2) study area in the Cumberland Plain region of western Sydney. A map of African Olive distribution was produced from the image analysis and checked for accuracy at 337 random locations using ground observation and comparison with existing vegetation maps. The African Olive distribution data were then used in a GIS analysis with additional spatial datasets to investigate the relationship between the distribution of African Olive and environmental factors, and to quantify the conservation threat to endangered native vegetation. Results: A total area of 1907 ha of dense African Olive infestation was identified, with an omission error of 7.5% and a commission error of 5.4%. African Olive was found to occur on the steepest slopes (mean slope 14.3 degrees) of the vegetation classes examined, with aspect analysis identifying a high prevalence on south- and southwest-facing slopes. The analysis also quantified the level of African Olive infestation in endangered ecological communities, with Western Sydney Dry Rainforest (25% affected) and Moist Shale Woodland (28% affected) identified as most vulnerable to African Olive invasion. Conclusion: The distribution of African Olive can be efficiently mapped at a landscape scale. This technique, used in association with additional spatial datasets, identified African Olive as a significant environmental weed in SW Sydney, occupying a greater area than previously recognised and threatening several endangered native vegetation communities.

Detecting subtle land use change in tropical forests	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This paper presents a study of land use and land cover dynamics in an indigenous community in the Amazon, in particular the methods used to deal with problems related to small size of cultivated plots, spectral similarity between land use classes, atmospheric haze and topographic shade. The main focus was on identifying and quantifying cultivated and fallow areas. Based on remote sensing alone, it was possible to identify about half of the fallows younger than 20 years of age. Combining remote sensing with field-based methods, however, it was possible to estimate the number and size of cultivated areas, the extent of fallows up to 65 years of age, as well as the rate of old-growth forest loss.

However, most deforestation research focuses on tropical rain forests. We analyzed spatial and temporal changes in land cover from 1972 through 2005 at Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS), a tropical dry forest in Myanmar (Burma). CWS is one of the largest protected patches of tropical dry forest in Southeast Asia and supports over half the remaining wild population of the endangered Eld's deer. Between 1973 and 2005, 62% of forest was lost at an annual rate of 1.86% in the area, while forest loss inside CWS was only 16% (0.45% annually). Based on trends found during our study period, dry forests outside CWS would not persist beyond 2019, while forests inside CWS would persist for at least another 100 years. Analysis of temporal deforestation patterns indicates the highest rate of loss occurred between 1992 and 2001. Conversion to agriculture, shifting agriculture, and flooding from a hydro-electric development were the main deforestation drivers. Fragmentation was also severe, halving the area of suitable Eld's deer habitat between 1973 and 2001, and increasing its isolation. CWS protection efforts were effective in reducing deforestation rates, although deforestation effects extended up to 2 km into the sanctuary. Establishing new protected areas for dry forests and finding ways to mitigate human impacts on existing forests are both needed to protect remaining dry forests and the species they support.

Characteristics of Important Stopover Locations for Migrating Birds: Remote Sensing with Radar in the Great Lakes Basin	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												A preliminary stage in developing comprehensive conservation plans involves identifying areas used by the organisms of interest. The areas used by migratory land birds during temporal breaks in migration (stopover periods) have received relatively little research and conservation attention. Methodologies for identifying stopover sites across large geographic areas have been, until recently, unavailable. Advances in weather-radar technology now allow for evaluation of bird migration patterns at large spatial scales. We analyzed radar data (WSR-88D) recorded during spring migration in 2000 and 2001 at 6 sites in the Great Lakes basin (U.S.A.). Our goal was to link areas of high migrant activity with the land-cover types and landscape contexts corresponding to those areas. To characterize the landscapes surrounding stopover locations, we integrated radar and land-cover data within a geographic information system. We compared landscape metrics within 5 km of areas that consistently hosted large numbers of migrants with landscapes surrounding randomly selected areas that were used by relatively few birds during migration. Concentration areas were characterized by 1.2 times more forest cover and 9.3 times more water cover than areas with little migrant activity. We detected a strong negative relationship between activity of migratory birds and agricultural land uses. Examination of individual migration events confirmed the importance of fragments of forested habitat in highly altered landscapes and highlighted large concentrations of birds departing from near-shore terrestrial areas in the Great Lakes basin. We conclude that conservation efforts can be more effectively targeted through intensive analysis of radar imagery.
