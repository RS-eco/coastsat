In particular, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability of turbidity and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Po River prodelta (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) during the period 2013-2016. To perform this analysis, a two-pronged processing methodology was implemented and the resulting outputs were analysed through a series of statistical tools. A pixel-based spatial correlation analysis was carried out by comparing temporal curves of turbidity and SST hypercubes with in situ time series of wind speed and water discharge, providing correlation coefficient maps. A geostatistical analysis was performed to determine the spatial dependency of the turbidity datasets per each satellite image, providing maps of correlation and variograms. The results show a linear correlation between water discharge and turbidity variations in the points more affected by the buoyant plumes and along the southern coast of Po River delta. Better inverse correlation was found between turbidity and SST during floods rather than other periods. The correlation maps of wind speed with turbidity show different spatial patterns depending on local or basin-scale wind effects. Variogram maps identify different spatial anisotropy structures of turbidity in response to ambient conditions (i.e. strong Bora or Scirocco winds, floods). Since the implemented processing methodology is based on open source software and free satellite data, it represents a promising tool for the monitoring of maritime ecosystems and to address water quality analyses and the investigations of sediment dynamics in estuarine and coastal waters.																	0303-2434					APR	2018	66						210	225		10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.012								WOS:000423650500019						
J	Beck, MW; Hagy, JD; Le, CF				Beck, Marcus W.; Hagy, James D., III; Le, Chengfeng			Quantifying Seagrass Light Requirements Using an Algorithm to Spatially Resolve Depth of Colonization	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Depth of colonization (Z (c)) is a useful seagrass growth metric that describes seagrass response to light availability. Similarly, percent surface irradiance at Z (c) (% SI) is an indicator of seagrass light requirements with applications in seagrass ecology and management. Methods for estimating Z (c) and % SI are highly variable making meaningful comparisons difficult. A new algorithm is presented to compute maps of median and maximum Z (c), Z (c,med), and Z (c,max), respectively, for four Florida coastal areas (Big Bend, Tampa Bay, Choctawhatchee Bay, Indian River Lagoon). Maps of light attenuation (K (d)) based on MODIS satellite imagery, PAR profiles, and Secchi depth measurements were combined with seagrass growth estimates to produce maps of % SI at Z (c,med) and Z (c,max). Among estuary segments, mean Z (c,med) varied from (+/- SE) 0.80 +/- 0.13 m for Old Tampa Bay to 2.33 +/- 0.26 m for Western Choctawhatchee Bay. Standard errors for Z (c,med) were 1-10% of the segment means. Percent SI at Z (c,med) averaged 18% for Indian River Lagoon (range = 9-24%), 42% for Tampa Bay (37-48%), and 58% for Choctawhatchee Bay (51-75%). Estimates of % SI were significantly lower in Indian River Lagoon than in the other estuaries, while estimates for Tampa Bay and Choctawhatchee Bay were higher than the often cited estimate of 20%. Spatial gradients in depth of colonization and % SI were apparent in all estuaries. The analytical approach could be applied easily to new data from these estuaries or to other estuaries and could be incorporated routinely in assessments of seagrass status and condition.

J	Yu, X; Wang, YB; Liu, XY; Liu, X				Yu, Xiang; Wang, Yebao; Liu, Xiangyang; Liu, Xin			Remote sensing estimation of carbon fractions in the Chinese Yellow River estuary	MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY												Reliable and consistent carbon fraction estimates are crucial in studying the role of coasts in the global carbon cycle. Remote sensing offers the potential to estimate carbon fractions with its advantages of large spatial coverage and real-time surveys. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption was generally used as a proxy to estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC). However, the CDOM-DOC relationship varies by region and remains inconstant. Thus, the correlation between the reflectivity of visible band and DOC concentration was directly adopted in DOC estimation and performed well in former studies. Atomic groups of the various components of carbon fractions produce electronic transition by absorbing photons, and this process occurs both in the visible bands and in the near-infrared bands. Thus, the wide range of absorption band provides an approach to estimate carbon fractions using the correlation between the reflectivity of the whole visible/near-infrared bands of optical satellite sensors and carbon fractions. A new ratio band combination was developed and performed well in carbon fraction concentration retrievals, and the yielded estimation accuracies (R-2>0.77, RPD >2.02) were sufficient to map the spatial distributions of carbon fractions with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer image.																	1064-119X	1521-0618					2018	36	2					202	210		10.1080/1064119X.2017.1297876								WOS:000424062100006						
J	von Holdt, JR; Eckardt, FD				von Holdt, Johanna R.; Eckardt, Frank D.			Dust activity and surface sediment characteristics of the dustiest river in southern Africa: the Kuiseb River, Central Namib	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												Previous remote sensing studies (2005-2008) have identified Namibia's Kuiseb as the dustiest river in southern Africa. The purpose of this study was to extend the dust event record through to 2014, and to examine the nature of the surfaces from which this satellite imagery indicates these dust plumes originate. The new 10-year record confirms the delta as the dustiest geomorphological unit (54% of plumes), followed by the gravel plain (28%) and then the river (8%). No dust originated from the Namib Sand Sea dunes or interdunes. Field observations provided detail about the geomorphological and sedimentological setting of the landscape components. The laboratory analysis focused on the size characteristics of 153 surface sediment samples collected from the Kuiseb main channel, its terraces, delta, gravel plain surfaces and tributaries, dunes and interdune. This study has identified that surface sediments suitable for dust production increase towards the coast with particular dusty' floodplain surfaces between Swartbank and Rooibank and the Kuiseb delta. We suggest that silt crusts formed as the flood water dissipate, provide a main source of potentially entrainable material for emission. The crusts consist entirely of silt- and clay-sized materials, with a maximum of 97%<63m, 39%<10m and 6%<2m. Anthropogenic disturbances of the surfaces are potentially playing a role in the production of dust, with the area undergoing significant development.																	0373-6245	2151-2418					2018	100	1					104	121		10.1080/03736245.2017.1339627								WOS:000423739500006						
J	Xiao, L; Lang, Y; Christakos, G				Xiao, Lu; Lang, Yichao; Christakos, George			High-resolution spatiotemporal mapping of PM2.5 concentrations at Mainland China using a combined BME-GWR technique	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												With rapid economic development, industrialization and urbanization, the ambient air PM2.5 has become a major pollutant linked to respiratory, heart and lung diseases. In China, PM2.5 pollution constitutes an extreme environmental and social problem of widespread public concern. In this work we estimate ground-level PM2.5 from satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD), topography data, meteorological data, and pollutant emission using an integrative technique. In particular, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis was combined with Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) theory to assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of PM2.5 exposure in a large region of China and generate informative PM2.5 space-time predictions (estimates). It was found that, due to its integrative character, the combined BME-GWR method offers certain improvements in the space-time prediction of PM2.5 concentrations over China compared to previous techniques. The combined BME-GWR technique generated realistic maps of space-time PM2.5 distribution, and its performance was superior to that of seven previous studies of satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations in China in terms of prediction accuracy. The purely spatial GWR model can only be used at a fixed time, whereas the integrative BME-GWR approach accounts for cross space-time dependencies and can predict PM2.5 concentrations in the composite space-time domain. The 10-fold results of BME-GWR modeling (R-2 = 0.883, RMSE = 11.39 mu g/m(3)) demonstrated a high level of space-time PM2.5 prediction (estimation) accuracy over China, revealing a definite trend of severe PM2.5 levels from the northern coast toward inland China (Nov 2015 Feb 2016). Future work should focus on the addition of higher resolution AOD data, developing better satellite-based prediction models, and related air pollutants for space-time PM2.5 prediction purposes.																	1352-2310	1873-2844				JAN	2018	173						295	305		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.10.062								WOS:000423007600028

In this paper, we analyze the spatio-temporal variability of the Chlorophyll-a detected by the ocean color sensor (CHLA(sat)) in BMCZ in order to understand its environmental variability. We use the MODIS-Aqua CHLAsat monthly composites imagery from 2002 to 2015, and applied two statistical methods: the correlogram-based robust periodogram to identify, over a broad spectrum of temporal, the most significant periodicities, and the pixel gradient distribution to study the spatial-temporal gradients within the BMCZ and variations over the continental shelf and coastal waters. Our results point out to the predominance of the annual cycle over most of the investigated area, although an area from latitude 37 degrees S in direction NE, alongshore of Uruguay to Brazil, evidences interannual periodicities, possibly related to variations in the discharge of the Rio de la Plata associated with the El Nino phenomena. The ocean color spectroradiometric signature in terms of pixel gradient presents a relatively high variability (similar to 0.0 to 0.65 mg m(-3)); in particular the high values of the pixel gradient correspond to saline front of the estuarine system of Rio de la Plata, and to the strip of the platform that extends along the isobaths of 80 m (coast of Uruguay), especially in the center and south of the study area.

J	Wang, J; Deng, ZQ				Wang, Jiao; Deng, Zhiqiang			Development of a MODIS Data-Based Algorithm for Retrieving Gage Height in Nearshore Waters along the Louisiana Gulf Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Gage height is one of most important physical parameters commonly used for the description of daily sea levels and generally monitored at sparsely scattered tidal stations. This paper presents a novel remote sensing algorithm for the retrieval of spatially distributed gage height data in coastal waters with emphasis on nearshore waters using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The algorithm was trained using the Artificial Neural Networks toolbox in the MATLAB program and over 4 years (2007-11) of cloud-free MODIS Aqua data for waterleaving reflectance as well as ground truth measurements collected daily from U.S. Geological Survey stations along the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The algorithm was validated using 3 additional years of independent data sets, which were not used in the algorithm training and collected from 2012 to 2014. Cross-validation results indicated that the gage heights derived from the new algorithm were in good agreement with observed height, as evidenced by the high linear correlation coefficient of 0.8465 and low root mean square error of 0.2238 m. The new algorithm makes it possible to produce daily, spatially distributed gage height data for coastal management and resources development in shallow coastal areas where there are no gages.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2018	34	1					220	228		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00161.1								WOS:000422738000021

Large surface water bodies have an ephemeral nature in the vast sedimentary plains of the Pampas (Argentina) where non-flooded periods alternate with flooding cycles covering up to one third of the landscape for several months. Based on temperature records from 17 sites located 1 to 700 km away from the Atlantic coast and MODIS land surface temperature data, we explore the effects of floods on diurnal and seasonal thermal ranges as well as temperature extremes. In non-flooded periods, there is a linear increase of mean diurnal thermal range (DTR) from the coast towards the interior of the region (DTR increasing from 10 to 16 K, 0.79 K/100 km, r (2) = 0.81). This relationship weakens during flood episodes when the DTR of flood-prone inland locations shows a decline of 2 to 4 K, depending on surface water coverage in the surrounding area. DTR even approaches typical coastal values 500 km away from the ocean in the most flooded location that we studied during the three flooding cycles recorded in the study period. Frosts-free periods, a key driver of the phenology of both natural and cultivated ecosystems, are extended by up to 55 days during floods, most likely as a result of enhanced ground heat storage across the landscape (similar to 2.7 fold change in day-night heat transfer) combined with other effects on the surface energy balance such as greater night evaporation rates. The reduced thermal range and longer frost-free periods affect plant growth development and may offer an opportunity for longer crop growing periods, which may not only contribute to partially compensating for regional production losses caused by floods, but also open avenues for flood mitigation through higher plant evapotranspirative water losses.

Spatio-temporal distribution of burned areas by ecoregions in Mexico and Central America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Fire activity in Mexico and Central America, and its associated emissions, has impacts across multiple scales. On the local-to-regional scale, fire activity impacts land use, productivity, and biodiversity. On the regional-to-global scale, fire activity impacts hydrological, biogeochemical, and atmospheric processes. A consistent, reliable, large-scale characterization of the spatial and temporal distribution of fire burned area is required to assess its environmental impacts and to support natural resources' management. The spatial and temporal distributions of fire burned areas in ecoregions of Mexico and Central America are evaluated in this study for the period 2001-2014, using the satellite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD45 Burned Area data set. The methodology combines the 500 m burned area product with a MODIS land cover product and a map of North American land cover to calculate the spatiotemporal variability of fire activity as a function of land-use type. The total burned area over Mexico and Central America over the period 2001-2014 was found to be 614,243.5 km(2), but with significant interannual variability over the 14years included in the study. Indeed, the minimum burned area over the period was 9892.25 km(2) in 2014 and the maximum was 37,669.50 km(2) in 2011, a fourfold increase. Burned areas were found to be concentrated in northern Mexico and on the Pacific coast, mainly from October to June. Agricultural burned areas accounted for 37% and 43% of total detected burns in Mexico and Central America, respectively. The largest extent of burned surface occurs in May for most land-cover types. The maximum density of burned areas occurred in the tropical dry forests ecoregion during the dry season. Both in Mexico and Central America, burned area anomalies have significant anti-correlation with precipitation anomalies.

J	Lamont, T; Brewin, RJW; Barlow, RG				Lamont, T.; Brewin, R. J. W.; Barlow, R. G.			Seasonal variation in remotely-sensed phytoplankton size structure around southern Africa	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010) computes fractional contributions of three phytoplankton size classes (micro- (> 20 mu m), nano- (2-20 mu m), picophytoplankton (< 2 mu m)) to the overall chlorophyll a concentration (Chla). Using in situ pigment data, model coefficients were adjusted for application to the southern African marine region. The refined model was applied to seasonal and monthly climatologies of MODIS Aqua Chla around Southern Africa. Chla > 1 mg m(-3) was limited to shelf regions along the coasts of Southern Africa and Madagascar, while values < 0.1 mg(-3) were found over most of the open ocean between the equator and 38 S during austral summer and autumn. In winter and spring, low values (< 0.1 mg m(-3)) were restricted to smaller regions within subtropical gyres, while values up to 0.7 mg m(-3) extended over a much greater area of the open ocean. Shelf regions in the northern (NB) and southern Benguela (SB), Agulhas Bank (AB), Agulhas region (AR), and Mozambique Channel (MC) all showed similar seasonal cycles of size structure. On average, microphytoplankton comprised > 50% of the total Chia in these regions with little change throughout the year. The AR shelf differed, with picophytoplankton dominating in summer, and micro- and nanophytoplankton the rest of the year. In the open ocean domains of the NB, SB, and AB regions, nanophytoplankton dominated for most of the year, with picophytoplankton being more prevalent during summer and autumn. In contrast, in the AR open ocean, nanophytoplankton were dominant only during winter and early spring, whereas picophytoplankton dominated throughout the year in the MC open ocean. The refined model characterised previously unknown spatial and temporal changes in size structure in various ecosystems around Southern Africa.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2018	204						617	631		10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.038								WOS:000418464400045

Marine mammals observations were obtained from two research platforms. CTD casts were deployed down to 100 m, water samples were taken monthly at six stations for determination of organic nutrients, and another 15 stations were sampled over a wider area only during the winter. Satellite images from MODIS-AQUA L2 were used to obtain sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) values, likewise altimetry data to identify mesoscale dynamic structures in the region. High salinity values (34.6), low concentrations of nitrates and nitrites ((similar to)3-4 mu M), silicates (5-7 mu M), Chl-alpha ((similar to)10 mg m(-3)), and low SST ((similar to)23.5 degrees C) were detected, as well as the presence of cyclonic gyres near the coast during the winter-spring period. This coincided with high marine mammal species richness in the area (from 5 to 9 species depending on spatial scale). The dominant species was Megaptera novaeangliae (0.092 sightings km(-1)), which was distributed close to the coast in shallow waters. Low salinity (32.8) and Chl-alpha values (0.1 mg m(-3)) were detected during the summer-fall period. High phosphate availability (2.5 mu M), presence of anticyclonic gyres, and high SST ((similar to)31 degrees C) were also found, coinciding with low species richness (3 species). The dominant species was Stenella attenuata (0.036 sightings km(-1)); those individuals were found distributed near the Jalisco-Colima coast (0-3 nm) in shallow waters with high inorganic nutrient availability. The principal components analysis showed that bathymetry (99.6%) was the main parameter explaining data variance; this parameter could therefore potentially modulate ecological aspects of marine mammals.																	0717-3326	0718-1957				DEC	2017	52	3					479	494										WOS:000423325000006

A Multi-Sensor Approach for Assessing Mangrove Biophysical Characteristics in Coastal Odisha, India	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												Mangroves around the world play a major role in coastal ecosystem processes by mitigating erosion and serving as a barrier against storm surges. India holds approximately 5% of the world's mangroves, over half of which are found along its east coast. Situated in the state of Odisha, Chilika Lagoon and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary are two wetlands of local importance in need of effective management. This study demonstrated the use of Terra, Landsat, and Sentinel-1 satellite data for spatio-temporal monitoring of mangrove health at these two sites. Several indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, were examined to develop biophysical prediction tools and derive a 17-year time-series (from 2000 to 2016) of leaf chlorophyll (CHL), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The long-term analysis revealed phenological patterns in the biophysical characteristics such as high values during wet season and low values during the dry season. Correlations between biophysical characteristics and meteorological factors revealed a time lag exists in response to precipitation and associated runoff. In contrast, surface temperature did not show any lag in response time. This study also utilized Sentinel-1 radar data for the first time for Odisha mangroves to show seasonal variability in LAI, GPP, and CHL. The results from radar data were consistent with optical sensors and proved useful for capturing the rainy season, where data were limited due to cloud cover. This study revealed the advantages of using a multi-sensor approach for monitoring mangrove health and defining future monitoring protocols.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					679	700		10.1007/s40010-017-0441-y								WOS:000418819200015

The temporal-spatial variability of the source locations for infrasound excitation during the eight-month period between January and August 2015 was investigated using recordings made by two infrasound arrays deployed along a section of the coast of Lutzow-Holm Bay (LHB), Antarctica. The infrasound arrays clearly detected temporal variations in frequency content and propagation direction during this period. A number of infrasound sources were identified, many located north of the arrays. Many of the events had a predominant frequency content of a few Hz, higher than microbaroms from the ocean. A comparison of the results with MODIS satellite images indicated that these infrasound sources were ice-quakes associated with the calving of glaciers, the breaking off of sea ice, and collisions between this sea ice and icebergs around the LHB. Continuous measurements of infrasound in the Antarctic may serve as a proxy for monitoring the regional surface environment in terms of climate change at high southern latitudes.																	1873-9652	1876-4428				DEC	2017	14						39	48		10.1016/j.polar.2017.10.001								WOS:000417043600005

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

The dynamic oceanographic pattern in this area influences the distribution of this pelagic fish. Understanding the relationship between the distribution of fish and environmental factors is important in exploring fisheries resources. This study used Rastrelliger kanagurta fishing-catch data during the high-catch season in the second quarter, which was from April to June (2008 and 2009), and satellite data of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS-Aqua. The study aimed to identify the relationship between fish distribution with chl-a and SST constructed using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM), detect the potential fishing grounds, and determine the impact of climate change on fish distribution based on temperature projection of IPCC-AR5-RCPs. The distribution of Rastrelliger kanagurta was significantly associated (p < 0.0001) with the preferred range of chl-a at 0.30-0.40 mg/m(3) and SST at 30.00-31.00 degrees C. The potential fishing ground maps showed that areas with high potential catch were located near the coast to offshore (3-20 M), with acceptable level of map accuracy at 83.34%; with kappa value at 0.70. Increased temperature of 1.80 degrees C resulted in movement of potential fishing grounds to the southern part of Makassar Straits leading to the archipelagic waters of Spermonde. In contrast, increased temperature of 2.60 degrees C and 3.30 degrees C resulted in lesser potential fishing grounds area which shifted further to the south. The results of this study indicated applicability of remote sensing in contributing to optimal fishing effort and decision making for long-term management of Rastrelliger kanagurta resources.

Using satellite imagery from MODIS, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, Geostationary Ocean Color Imager, and Ocean Land Imager, and combined with numerical particle tracing experiments and laboratory experiments, we examined the history of this bloom as well as similar blooms in previous years and attempted to trace the bloom source and identify the algae type. Results suggest that one bloom origin is offshore Zhejiang coast where algae slicks have appeared in satellite imagery almost every February-March since 2012. Following the Kuroshio Current and Taiwan Warm Current, these "initial" algae slicks are first transported to the northeast to reach South Korea (Jeju Island) and Japan coastal waters (up to 135 degrees E) by early April 2017, and then transported to the northwest to enter the Yellow Sea by the end of April. The transport pathway covers an area known to be rich in Sargassum horneri, and spectral analysis suggests that most of the algae slicks may contain large amount of S. horneri. The bloom covers a water area of similar to 160,000 km(2) with pure algae coverage of similar to 530 km(2), which exceeds the size of most Ulva blooms that occur every May-July in the Yellow Sea. While blooms of smaller size also occurred in previous years and especially in 2015, the 2017 bloom is hypothesized to be a result of record-high water temperature, increased light availability, and continuous expansion of Porphyra aquaculture along the East China Sea coast. Plain Language Summary A massive floating algae bloom in the East China Sea was first captured in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite imagery in mid-May 2017. Both its size and location are unprecedented. Several means have been used to identify the algae type and bloom origin, including the use of multisource satellite imagery, numerical particle tracing experiments, and laboratory experiments. While multiple origins are possible, the bloom could be tracked to Zhejiang coastal waters where the "initial" algae slicks back in February were transported to the northeast following the Kuroshio Current and Taiwan Warm Current to reach South Korea (Jeju Island) and Japan coastal waters by early April 2017, and then transported to the northwest to enter the Yellow Sea by end of April. Spectral analysis and historical field surveys suggested that the bloom may be dominated by Sargassum horneri, while expanded seaweed aquaculture and record-high water temperature and increased surface light may have contributed to the unprecedented bloom, which covered a water area of similar to 160,000 km(2) with pure algae coverage of similar to 530 km(2), both exceeding the maximum size of most Ulva blooms in the Yellow Sea.

Despite differences in sampling methods, regional SWARE and AOT trends are highly correlated with one another. Over global oceans, weak SWARE (cloud-free SW flux) and AOT trends of 0.5-0.6 W m(-2) (0.5 to 0.6 W m(-2)) and 0.002 AOT decade 1 are found using Terra data. Near-zero AOT and SWARE trends are also found for using Aqua data, regardless of the angular distribution models (ADMs) used. Regionally, positive AOT and cloud-free SW flux (negative SWARE) trends are found over the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, the Arabian/Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, while statistically significant negative trends are derived over the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern US coast. In addition, the global mean instantaneous SW aerosol direct forcing efficiencies are found to be similar to -60 W m(-2) AOT(-1), with corresponding SWARE values of similar to -7 W m(-2) from both Aqua and Terra data, again regardless of CERES ADMs used. Regionally, SW aerosol direct forcing efficiency values of similar to -40 W m(-2) AOT(-1) are found over the southwest coast of Africa where smoke aerosol particles dominate in summer. Larger (in magnitude) SW aerosol direct forcing efficiency values of -50 to -80 W m(-2) AOT(-1) are found over several other dust-and pollutant-aerosol-dominated regions. Lastly, the AOT and SWARE trends from this study are also intercompared with aerosol trends (such as active-based ones) from several previous studies. Findings suggest that a cohesive understanding of the changing aerosol skies can be achieved through the analysis of observations from both passive-and active-based analyses, as well as from both narrowband and broadband datasets.																	1680-7316	1680-7324				NOV 21	2017	17	22					13849	13868		10.5194/acp-17-13849-2017								WOS:000415895200002

This study analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in China using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer near-infrared (MODIS-NIR)-Clear PWV products from 2011 to 2013. We then compared the four PWV products (Global Positioning System PWV (GPS-PWV), radiosonde PWV (RS-PWV), MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV, and Aerosol Robotic Network sunphotometer PWV (AERONET-PWV)) at six typical sites in China from 2011 to 2013. The analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution showed that the PWV distribution in China has clear geographical differences, and its basic distribution characteristics gradually change from the coast in the southeast to inland in the northwest. Affected by the East Asian monsoon, the PWV over China showed clear seasonal distribution features, with highest values in the summer, followed by autumn and spring, and the lowest values in winter. Intercomparison results showed that GPS-PWV and RS-PWV had a slightly higher correlation (R-2 = 0.975) at 0000 UTC than that at 1200 UTC (R-2 = 0.967). The mean values of Bias, SD, and RMSE between GPS-PWV and RS-PWV (GPS-RS) were 0.03 nun, 2.36 mm, and 2.60 mm at 0000 UTC, and -0.23 nun, 2.76 mm, and 2.95 nun at 1200 UTC, respectively. This showed that GPS-PWV was slightly lower than RS-PWV, and this difference was more obvious during the nighttime. The MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV product showed a similar correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.88) with GPS-PWV compared with RS-PWV. In addition, MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV was greater than GPS-PWV and RS-PWV. The MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV showed a larger deviation from GPS-PWV (MODIS-GPS Bias = 1.50 mm, RMSE = 5.76 mm) compared with RS PWV (MODIS-RS Bias = 0.75 mm, RMSE = 5.31 mm). The correlation coefficients between AERONET-PWV and the PWV from GPS, RS, and MODIS-NIR-Clear were 0.970, 0.963, and 0.923 (with RMSE of 2.53 mm, 3.67 nun, and 4.39 mm), respectively. In the Beijing area, the overall mean bias of the AERONET-PWV product with GPS-PWV, RS-PWV and MODIS-NIR-Clear PWV was -0.09 mm, -1.82 mm, and -1.54 mm, respectively, which shows that the AERONET-PWV product was lower than the other three PWV products.					che, Huizheng/0000-0002-9458-3387												0169-8095	1873-2895				NOV 15	2017	197						461	473		10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.07.021								WOS:000412250700038

However, the spatiotemporal variations in terrestrial ET over Northeast China over the past three decades calculated from sparse meteorological point-based data remain large uncertain. In this paper, a recently proposed modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor (MS-PT) algorithm was applied to estimate ET of Northeast China during 1982-2010. Validation results show that the square of the correlation coefficients (R-2) for the six flux tower sites varies from 0.55 to 0.88 (p < 0.01), and the mean root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.92 mm/d. The ET estimated by MS-PT has an annual mean of 441.14 +/- 18 mm/year in Northeast China, with a decreasing trend from southeast coast to northwest inland. The ET also shows in both annual and seasonal linear trends over Northeast China during 1982-2010, although this trend seems to have ceased after 1998, which increased on average by 12.3 mm per decade pre-1998 (p < 0.1) and decreased with large interannual fluctuations post-1998. Importantly, our analysis on ET trends highlights a large difference from previous studies that the change of potential evapotranspiration (PET) plays a key role for the change of ET over Northeast China. Only in the western part of Northeast China does precipitation appear to be a major controlling influence on ET.

J	O'Connell, JL; Mishra, DR; Cotten, DL; Wang, L; Alber, M				O'Connell, Jessica L.; Mishra, Deepak R.; Cotten, David L.; Wang, Li; Alber, Merryl			The Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII): An inundation filter to flag flooded pixels and improve MODIS tidal marsh vegetation time-series analysis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing in tidal marshes can provide regional assessments of wetland extent, phenology, primary production, and carbon sequestration. However, periodic tidal flooding reduces spectral reflectance, especially in the near and short-wave infrared wavelengths. Consequently, marsh vegetation time-series products that lack tidal filtering, such as those provided by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), may not reflect true vegetation trends. We created a new Tidal Marsh Inundation Index (TMII) for processing daily 500-m MODIS surface reflectance data and calibrated it with a Spartina alterniflora salt marsh pixel on Sapelo Island, GA. Ground-truth data for TMII was extracted from a PhenoCam, which collected high frequency digital photography of the TMII calibration pixel. To identify the best wavelengths to include in the TMII, we compared goodness of fit metrics from generalized linear models (GLMs). Predictors for these GLMs included suites of normalized difference indices from the literature as well as other band combinations. We also explored including a phonology parameter that could scale TMII relative to vegetation development. Ultimately, TMII was based on the normalized difference of green and shortwave infrared reflectance in combination with a phenology parameter composed of the moving average of the normalized difference of near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance. This final index allowed a single optimized decision boundary to identify flooding across the annual growth cycle. When compared to ground-truth data from the PhenoCam, the TMII classified flooded conditions with 67-82% and dry conditions with 75-81% accuracy, respectively, across training, testing and validation datasets. We applied TMII to new S. alterniflora marsh MODIS pixels on Sapelo Island, GA as well as on Plum Island, MA. For these new pixels, TMII classified marsh flooding with 77-80% overall accuracy. We also demonstrated how users can apply TMII filtering in a MODIS workflow to create vegetation time-series composites within S. alterniflora, Spardrza patens and Juncus roemerianus marshes. We showed how a new user can validate and optimize TMII in their application, either by comparing it to inundation data or by validating the filtered vegetation time series against field data. We also compared TMII-filtered composites to the existing MODIS MOD13 16-d Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product. TMII-filtered composites generated less noisy time -series that fit field data better than MOD13. TMII filtering was most important on Sapelo Island, where the tide range was high and vegetation was sparse. Results were less dramatic when TMII was applied to different marsh species within the Gulf Coast sites with lower tidal ranges, but TMII-filtering still improved vegetation time series. Thus, preprocessing MODIS imagery with the TMII effectively identified most inundated pixels. The TMII represents a step forward for wetland remote sensing that will be useful for improved estimation of phonology, biomass and carbon storage in coastal marshes.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV	2017	201						34	46		10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.008								WOS:000412866400004

Envisat's Advanced Along-Track Spectral Radiometer (AATSR) features dual-view thermal infrared measured brightness temperature. Using bands 11 mu m and 12 mu m in nadir and forward (55) view and a total column water vapour (TCWV) product from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), we obtain four measurements per pixel. We retrieve three surface emissivities epsilon(lambda,theta) per pixel calculated from simulated surface temperatures related to 11 mu m/nadir view values. We define emissivity "classes" for different snow grain sizes from angular and spectral field measurements of snow grain size and emissivity above snow and ice from Hori et al. (2006, 2007): fine, medium, coarse, suncrust, and ice. Remaining pixels are either indistinct between classes, unclassified, or invalid. Temperatures above the freezing point label pixels as wet. Analysing 26 AATSR scenes in 2007 and 2008, we retrieve a high portion of classification in Greenland, Antarctica, and the sea ice of the Hudson Bay. Steep and heterogeneous topography may cause invalid and unclassified pixels in Eurasia. Close to coasts we generally find a higher snow temperature and a large number of wet pixels.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				NOV	2017	201						181	195		10.1016/j.rse.2017.09.006								WOS:000412866400014

Monsoon winds play similar roles in the upper oceanic circulations of the both seas. But the distinct patterns of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration are observed between the SCS and the AS. The Chl a concentration in the SCS is generally lower than that in the AS in summer (June-August); the summer Chl a concentration in the AS shows stronger interannual variation, compared with that in the SCS; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived data present higher atmospheric aerosol deposition and stronger wind speed in the AS. And it has also been found that good correlations exist between the index of the dust precipitation indicated by aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the Chl a concentration, or between wind and Chl a concentration. These imply that the wind and the dust precipitation bring more nutrients into the AS from the sky, the sub-layer or coast regions, inducing higher Chl a concentration. The results indicate that the wind velocity and the dust precipitation can play important roles in the Chl a concentration for the AS and the SCS in summer. However aerosol impact is weak on the biological productivity in the west SCS and wind-induced upwelling is the main source.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				NOV	2017	36	11					61	67		10.1007/s13131-017-1138-4								WOS:000414992900008

Influence of main forcing affecting the Tagus turbid plume under high river discharges using MODIS imagery	PLOS ONE												The role of river discharge, wind and tide on the extension and variability of the Tagus River plume was analyzed from 2003 to 2015. This study was performed combining daily images obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor located onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. Composites were generated by averaging pixels with the same forcing conditions. River discharge shows a strong relation with the extension of the Tagus plume. The plume grows with the increasing river discharge and express a two day lag caused by the long residence time of water within the estuary. The Tagus turbid plume was found to be smaller under northerly and easterly winds, than under southerly and westerly winds. It is suggested that upwelling favoring winds provoke the offshore movement of the plume material with a rapidly decrease in turbidity values whereas downwelling favoring winds retain plume material in the north coast close to the Tagus mouth. Eastern cross-shore (oceanward) winds spread the plume seaward and to the north following the coast geometry, whereas western cross-shore (landward) winds keep the plume material in both alongshore directions occupying a large part of the area enclosed by the bay. Low tides produce larger and more turbid plumes than high tides. In terms of fortnightly periodicity, the maximum plume extension corresponding to the highest turbidity is observed during and after spring tides. Minimum plume extension associated with the lowest turbidity occurs during and after neap tides.

Satellite imagery is useful for assessing particle transport from land to sea. However, in the oligotrophic and shallow waters of tropical lagoons, the bottom reflection of downwelling light usually hampers the use of classical optical algorithms. In order to address this issue, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and tested. The proposed application concerns the lagoon of New Caledoniathe second longest continuous coral reef in the worldwhich is frequently exposed to river plumes from ultramafic watersheds. The SVR model is based on a large training sample of in-situ turbidity values representative of the annual variability in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout lagoon (Western Coast of New Caledonia) during the 2014-2015 period and on coincident satellite reflectance values from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It was trained with reflectance and two other explanatory parametersbathymetry and bottom colour. This approach significantly improved the model's capacity for retrieving the in-situ turbidity range from MODIS images, as compared with algorithms dedicated to deep oligotrophic or turbid waters, which were shown to be inadequate. This SVR model is applicable to the whole shallow lagoon waters from the Western Coast of New Caledonia and it is now ready to be tested over other oligotrophic shallow lagoon waters worldwide.

However, the methods used to derive these products have to be evaluated, so the associated uncertainties are known. The performance of three atmospheric correction methods, the near infrared (NIR), the shortwave infrared (SWIR), and the Management Unit of the North Seas Mathematical Models with an additional modification (MUMM + SWIR), and derived chla products based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AQUA (MODIS) images acquired from 2002 to 2014 over the west coast of Canada and the United States were evaluated. The atmospherically corrected products and above-water reflectance were compared with in situ AERONET (N similar to 650) and above-water reflectance (N similar to 34) data, and the Ocean Color 3 MODIS (OC3M)-derived chla were compared with in situ chla measurements (N similar to 82). The statistical analysis indicated that the MUMM + SWIR method was the most appropriate for this region, with relatively good retrievals of the atmospheric products, improved retrieval of remote sensing reflectance with bias lower than 20% for the OC3M bands, and improved retrievals of chla (r = 0.83, slope = 0.89, logRMSE = 0.33 mg m(-3) for +/- 1 h). The poorest chla retrievals were achieved with the SWIR and NIR methods. These results represent the most comprehensive satellite data analysis of MODIS retrievals for this region and provide a framework for the MUMM + SWIR method that can be further tested in other coastal regions of the world.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1063	10.3390/rs9101063								WOS:000414650600093

A multi-scale high-resolution analysis of global sea surface temperature	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis presents daily SST estimates on a global 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees grid. The current version (Version 4.1, http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GHGMR-4FJ04) features the 1-km resolution MODIS retrievals, which are fused with AVHRR GAC, microwave, and in-situ SST data by applying internal correction for relative biases among the data sets. Only the night-time (dusk to dawn locally) satellite SST retrievals are used to estimate the foundation SST. The MUR SST values agree with the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) SST field to 0.36 degrees C on average, except in summer-time Arctic region where the existing SST analysis products are known to disagree with each other. The feature resolution of the MUR SST analysis is an order of magnitude higher than most existing analysis products. The Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) method allows the MUR analysis to use multiple synoptic time scales, including a 5-day data window used for reconstruction of mesoscale features and data windows of only few hours for the smaller scale features. Reconstruction of fast evolving small scale features and interpolation over persistent large data voids can be achieved simultaneously by the use of multiple synoptic windows in the multi-scale setting. The MRVA method is also a "mesh-less" interpolation procedure that avoids truncation of the geolocation data during gridding and binning of satellite samples. Future improvements of the MUR SST analysis will include ingestion of day-time MODIS retrievals as well as more recent high-resolution SST retrievals from VIIRS.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				OCT	2017	200						154	169		10.1016/j.rse.2017.07.029								WOS:000412607600012						
J	Ma, P; Dai, XY; Guo, ZY; Wei, C; Ma, WC				Ma, Pin; Dai, Xiaoyan; Guo, Zhongyang; Wei, Chao; Ma, Weichun			Detection of thermal pollution from power plants on China's eastern coast using remote sensing data	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												The acceleration of the industrialization process in China has increased the demand for electricity and triggered a power-plant building boom, especially along China's eastern coast, where the economy gets off early and enjoys a fast development. The thermal plumes, residual chlorine, nuclides and other pollutions produced by the thermal and nuclear power plants have exerted an impact on the coastal eco-environment. To monitor the thermal pollution from the power plants at Yueqing Bay on the eastern coast, in this research, the distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) surrounding the power plants is obtained by using the SST retrieval methods developed for Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), HJ-1B infrared sensor (IRS) and Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The comparison of the SST retrieval results before and after the operation of power plants indicates that the total area of sea waters that is impacted by the thermal discharge from the two power plants at Yueqing Bay is approximately 17.95 km(2), with the highest SST rise of 4.5 A degrees C appearing over the waters around the outlet of the Huaneng Yuhuan power plant on the eastern shore, whereas the highest SST rise around the Zheneng Yueqing power plant on the western shore reaches 3.8 A degrees C. The intensity and scope of influence of the thermal discharge mainly depend on the installed capacity of power plants, coastal terrain, and tide. Although the area where the SST rise is more than 3 A degrees C is not large, thermal discharge still has an impact on bay ecosystems due to the relatively closed nature of the bay environment. Due to the influence of rising water temperatures on the reproduction and individual evolution of fish, shrimp, crabs, shellfish and other aquatic creatures, in the long term, the thermal pollution from coastal power plants will affect the volume of natural fishery and biological resources throughout the waters. The quantitative retrieval results also suggest that relative to MODIS data, Landsat ETM+ and HJ-1B IRS data with a high spatial resolution are more applicable to the estimation of small-scale SST, and IRS data with a high temporal resolution are more helpful in the study of spatio-temporal variability of thermal plumes from coastal power plants.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				OCT	2017	31	8					1957	1975		10.1007/s00477-016-1293-8								WOS:000413233000005

In this study, five reanalyses (JRA-55, 20CRv2c, CFSR, ERA-Interim, and MERRA-2) are compared with NASA CERES-MODIS (CM)-derived cloud fractions (CFs), cloud water paths (CWPs), top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes over the Arctic (70 degrees-90 degrees N) over the period of 2000-12, and CloudSat-CALIPSO (CC)-derived CFs from 2006 to 2010. The monthly mean CFs in all reanalyses except JRA-55 are close to or slightly higher than the CC-derived CFs from May to September. However, wintertime CF cannot be confidently evaluated until instrument simulators are implemented in reanalysis products. The comparison between CM and CCCFs indicates that CM-derived CFs are reliable in summer but not in winter. Although the reanalysis CWPs follow the general seasonal variations of CM CWPs, their annual means are only half or even less than the CM-retrieved CWPs (126 g m(-2)). The annual mean differences in TOA and surface SW and LW fluxes between CERES EBAF and reanalyses are less than 6 W m(-2) for TOA radiative fluxes and 16 W m(-2) for surface radiative fluxes. All reanalyses show positive biases along the northern and eastern coasts of Greenland as a result of model elevation biases or possible CM clear-sky retrieval issues. The correlations between the reanalyses and CERES satellite retrievals indicate that all five reanalyses estimate radiative fluxes better than cloud properties, and MERRA-2 and JRA-55 exhibit comparatively higher correlations for Arctic cloud and radiation properties.																	0894-8755	1520-0442				OCT	2017	30	19					8007	8029		10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0722.1								WOS:000411436700021

WorldClim 2: new 1-km spatial resolution climate surfaces for global land areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												We created a new dataset of spatially interpolated monthly climate data for global land areas at a very high spatial resolution (approximately 1km(2)). We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970-2000, using data from between 9000 and 60000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5-15% (0.07-0.17 degrees C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.																	0899-8418	1097-0088				OCT	2017	37	12					4302	4315		10.1002/joc.5086								WOS:000412095400006

Wayne			Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa species in the greater Caribbean: Regional growth projections for ciguatera-associated dinoflagellates	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Satellite-derived sea surface temperature data from the MODIS Aqua instrument were used to project rates of growth for four Gambierdiscus and one Fukuyoa species, dinoflagellates associated with ciguatera fish poisoning. Dinoflagellate growth rates were modelled using experimental temperature vs. growth equations and projected bottom temperatures with light penetration and bathymetry masks. Daily projected growth rates for each species were used to calculate monthly, yearly and multiyear averages between 2003 and 2013. The resulting projections were then used to characterize patterns of regional Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa abundance and compare these to ciguatera fish poisoning incidences in the Greater Caribbean Region. Model output indicated the highest growth potential was in the shelf waters of the Caribbean Sea, with moderate growth in the Bahamas, southern Florida and Gulf of Mexico; the lowest growth potential was in the northern Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. south Atlantic coast. Mean projected growth rates generally coincided with distribution of ciguatera fish poisoning incidences in the region, with some exceptions in the southwestern Caribbean. The results of this study indicate spatial differences in Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa growth likely play a prominent role in governing the occurrence of ciguatera fish poisoning in the greater Caribbean. Growth and distribution models may be an effective tool for ciguatera risk assessment.

Water exchange between Algeciras Bay and the Strait of Gibraltar: A study based on HF coastal radar	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study analyses the water mass exchanges at subinertial scale between Algeciras Bay and the adjacent Strait of Gibraltar. The mechanisms triggering this exchange process is investigated with the aid of recently-acquired data on surface currents obtained using a system of HF coastal radars deployed on the eastern side of the Strait, and remotely-sensed images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll from the MODIS sensor of the Aqua satellite. HF radar data on surface currents are analyzed by the application of real empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition, which produces three EOF modes explaining more than 70% of the variance of the surface currents at the mouth of the Bay (modes 2, 3, and 6). Mode 2 is related to the fluctuations of the Atlantic Jet in the central zone of the Strait, mainly due to a combined effect of the atmospheric pressure fluctuations in the Western Mediterranean Sea and local wind in the eastern side of the Strait; mode 3 is related to the coastal currents induced by zonal wind forcing on the north-western coast of the Strait and Alboran Sea; and mode 6 seems to be related to water transport induced by winds blowing with a significant north component into and out of the Bay.

The resultant large amount of brine rejection leads to the formation of dense water. The dense water forms Antarctic bottom water, which is the densest water in the global overturning circulation and a key player in climate change as a significant sink for heat and carbon dioxide. In this study, an algorithm was developed that uses Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data (2012-present) to detect polynya area and estimates thin ice thickness by a method similar to that used to develop the algorithm for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) data. Landfast sea-ice areas were also detected using AMSR2 data. Ice production in the polynyas was estimated by a heat flux calculation using AMSR2 sea-ice data. In four major polynyas, AMSR2 ice production was compared with AMSR-E (2003-2011) ice production through comparison of them with Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) ice production. The comparison confirmed that the ice production from AMSR-E/2 data, which have higher spatial resolution than SSM/I-SSMIS data, can be used to analyze time series covering more than 10 years. For example, maps of annual ice production based on AMSR-E/2 data revealed detailed changes of the Mertz Polynya, where the ice production decreased significantly after the Mertz Glacier Tongue calving in 2010. Continuous monitoring of the coastal polynyas by the AMSR series sensors is essential for climate-change-related analyses in the Antarctic Ocean.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				SEP	2017	10	9			SI		3912	3922		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2731995								WOS:000412626400009

Future changes in summer MODIS-based enhanced vegetation index for the South-Central United States	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Evaluating the response of vegetation to climate change is relevant to improving the management of both human and natural systems. Here, we quantify the response of the MODIS-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to temperature, precipitation, and large-scale natural variability across the South-Central U.S. for summer (JJA) from 2000 to 2013. We find statistically significant relationships between climate and EVI that vary across the region and are distinct for each land cover type: the mean coefficient of determination (R-2) between EVI and climate is, greatest for pasture (0.61 +/- 0.13) and lowest for forest (0.55 +/- 0.14). Among the climate variables, three-month cumulative precipitation has the strongest influence on summer vegetation, particularly in semi-arid west Texas and eastern New Mexico. Summer monthly maximum temperature plays an important role in the eastern half of Texas and Oklahoma, moderated by the influence of both Atlantic and Pacific teleconnection indices over inter-annual time scales. Based on these relationships, we train, cross-validate, and, where statistically significant relationships exist, combine this multivariate predictive model with projected changes in teleconnection indices and statistically-downscaled temperature and precipitation from 16 CMIP5 global climate models to quantify future changes in EVI. As global mean temperature increases, projected EVI decreases, indicative of stressed and dry vegetation, particularly for grasslands as compared to other land types, and in Oklahoma and western, central and Gulf Coast Texas for mid- and end-of-century. These trends have potentially important implications for agriculture and the regional economy, as well as for ecosystems and endemic species that depend on vegetation.																	1574-9541	1878-0512				SEP	2017	41						64	73		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.07.007								WOS:000412261000007

Since a high concentrated condition of prey to whales can be obtained by physical structures, the foraging whale distribution can be an indicator of biological hotspot. Our main objective is verifying the coastal upwelling-southwestern East Sea as a productive biological hotspot based on the geographical distribution of minke whales. Among the cetacean research surveys of the National Institute of Fisheries Science since 1999, 9 years data for the minke whales available in the East Sea were used for this study. The regional primary productivity derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used for a proxy of biological productivity. Minke whales observed during the sighting surveys were mostly concentrated in May and found mostly (approximately 70%) in the southwestern coastal areas (< 300 m) where high chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were generally detected. Based on MODIS-derived primary productivity algorithm, the annual primary production (320 g C m(-2) y(-1)) estimated in the southwestern coastal region of the East Sea belongs to the highly productive coastal upwelling regions in the world. A change in the main spatial distribution of minke whales was found in recent years, which indicate that the major habitats of mink whales have been shifted into the north of the common coastal upwelling regions. This is consistent with the recently reported unprecedented coastal upwelling in the mid-eastern coast of Korea. Based on high phytoplankton productivity and high distribution of minke whales, the southwestern coastal regions can be considered as one of biological hotspots in the East Sea. These regions are important for ecosystem dynamics and the population biology of top marine predators, especially migratory whales and needed to be carefully managed from a resource management perspective.																	0967-0645	1879-0100				SEP	2017	143				SI		91	99		10.1016/j.dsr2.2017.06.005								WOS:000408783900010

Paracas dust storms: Sources, trajectories and associated meteorological conditions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Dust storms that develop along the Pisco-Ica desert in Southern Peru, locally known as "Paracas" winds have ecological, health and economic repercussions. Here we identify dust sources through MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and analyze HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particles Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model trajectories and dispersion patterns, along with concomitant synoptic-scale meteorological conditions from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR). Additionally, surface pressure data from the hourly METeorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) at Arica (18.5 degrees S, 70.3 degrees W) and Pisco (13.7 degrees S, 76.2 degrees W) were used to calculate Alongshore (sea-level) Pressure Gradient (APG) anomalies during Paracas dust storms, their duration and associated wind-speeds and wind directions. This study provides a review on the occurrence and strength of the Paracas dust storms as reported in the Pisco airfield for five-year period and their correspondence with MODIS true-color imagery in terms of dust-emission source areas. Our results show that most of the particle fluxes moving into the Ica-Pisco desert area during Paracas wind events originate over the coastal zone, where strong winds forced by steep APGs develop as the axis of a deep mid-troposphere trough sets in along north-central Chile. Direct relationships between Paracas wind intensity, number of active dust-emission sources and APGs are also documented, although the scarcity of simultaneous METAR/MODIS data for clearly observed MODIS dust plumes prevents any significant statistical inference. Synoptic-scale meteorological composites from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data show that Paracas wind events (steep APGs) are mostly associated with the strengthening of anticyclonic conditions in northern Chile, that can be attributed to cold air advection associated with the incoming trough. Compared to the MODIS images, HYSPLIT outputs were able to spatially reproduce trajectories and dust dispersion plumes during the Paracas wind storms. HYSPLIT trajectories revealed that part of the wind-eroded lithological material can be transported downwind several kilometers along the Peruvian coast and also deposited over the nearby coastal ocean, giving support to the presence of an aeolian signal in continental shelf sediments, of great importance for paleoenvironmental studies.

This study analyzes the aerosol properties over the western and eastern parts of the DS during the year 2013, using MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) for MODIS, which retrieves aerosol optical depth (ADD) data at a resolution of 1 km. The main goal of the study is to evaluate MAIAC over the study area and determine, for the first time, the prevailing aerosol spatial patterns. First, the MAIAC-derived ADD data was compared with data from three nearby AERONET sites (Nes Ziona - an urban site, and Sede Boker and Masada - two arid sites), and with the conventional Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) retrievals for the same days and locations, on a monthly basis throughout 2013. For the urban site, the correlation coefficient (r) for DT/DB products showed better performance than MAIAC (r = 0.80, 0.75, and 0.64 respectively) year-round. However, in the arid zones, MAIAC showed better correspondence to AERONET sites than the conventional retrievals (r = 0.58-0.60 and 0.48-0.50 respectively). We investigated the difference in ADD levels, and its variability, between the Dead Sea coasts on a seasonal basis and calculated monthly/seasonal ADD averages for presenting AOD patterns over arid zones. Thus, we demonstrated that aerosol concentrations show a strong preference for the western coast, particularly during the summer season. This preference, is most likely a result of local anthropogenic emissions combined with the typical seasonal synoptic conditions, the Mediterranean Sea breeze, and the region complex topography. Our results also indicate that a large industrial zone showed higher AOD levels compared to an adjacent reference-site, i.e., 13% during the winter season. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Landsat identifies aeolian dust emission dynamics at the landform scale	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The modelling of windblown mineral dust emissions remains a challenge. This is in part due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the data on which these models are based, but also because the processes and mechanisms of aeolian dust emission are not well understood. Satellite imagery has been used extensively in the study of dust from the late 1990s with important contributions being made in terms of sources, transport pathways and deposition areas. Using MODIS imagery, the Namib Desert has been identified as one of the largest sources of dust in southem Africa. The opening of the Landsat archive presents the opportunity to investigate these events at a higher spatial resolution (up to 15 x 15 m) than previously possible. Despite the low temporal resolution, we used Landsat imagery to identify 40 major dust episodes over the last 25 years that originated primarily from the ephemeral river valleys and pan complexes, providing new insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the dust sources from dryland surfaces. Examination of the imagery enabled the identification of local-scale landform source points to direct ground based testing of the surfaces responsible for dust emission. Emissivity tests were undertaken using a PI-SWERL portable wind tunnel in three of the major dust producing river systems along the Namib coast, namely the Kuiseb, Omaruru and Huab Rivers. Preliminary observations suggest that human impact on the hydrological systems in two of the river basins, to cater for the increasing demand of water, have dramatically altered the emission patterns of dust. The source areas of greatest dust emission are found to be located on recently deposited fluvial surfaces which are not active in the contemporary environment.

J	Chen, ZY; Pan, JY; Jiang, YW; Lin, H				Chen, Zhaoyun; Pan, Jiayi; Jiang, Yuwu; Lin, Hui			Far-reaching transport of Pearl River plume water by upwelling jet in the northeastern South China Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Satellite images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) show that there was a belt of turbid water appearing along an upwelling front near the Chinese coast of Guangdong, and indicate that the turbid water of the Pearl River plume water could be transported to a far-reaching area east of the Taiwan Bank. Numerical modeling results are consistent with the satellite observations, and reveal that a strong jet exists at the upwelling front with a speed as high as 0.8 m s(-1), which acts as a pathway for transporting the high-turbidity plume water. The dynamical analysis suggests that geostrophic equilibrium dominates in the upwelling front and plume areas, and the baroclinicity of the upwelling front resulting from the horizontal density gradient is responsible for the generation of the strong jet, which enhances the far-reaching transport of the terrigenous nutrient-rich water of the Pearl River plume. Model sensitivity analyses also confirm that this jet persists as long as the upwelling front exists, even when the wind subsides and becomes insignificant. Further idealized numerical model experiments indicate that the formation and persistence of the upwelling front jet depend on the forcing strength of the upwelling-favorable wind. The formation time of the jet varies from 15 to 158 has the stress of the upwelling-favorable wind changes from 0.2 to 0.01 N m(-2). With the persistent transport of the nutrient-rich plume water, biophysical activities can be promoted significantly in the far-reaching destination area of the oligotrophic water.

Cloud occurrences and cloud radiative effects (CREs) from CERES-CALIPSO-CloudSat-MODIS (CCCM) and CloudSat radar-lidar (RL) products	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Two kinds of cloud products obtained from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), CloudSat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are compared and analyzed in this study: Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)-CALIPSO-CloudSat-MODIS (CCCM) product and CloudSat radar-lidar products such as GEOPROF-LIDAR and FLXHR-LIDAR. Compared to GEOPROF-LIDAR, low-level (< 1 km) cloud occurrences in CCCM are larger over tropical oceans because the CCCM algorithm uses a more relaxed threshold of cloud-aerosol discrimination score for CALIPSO Vertical Feature Mask product. In contrast, midlevel (1-8 km) cloud occurrences in GEOPROF-LIDAR are larger than CCCM at high latitudes (>40 degrees). The difference occurs when hydrometeors are detected by CALIPSO lidar but are undetected by CloudSat radar. In the comparison of cloud radiative effects (CREs), global mean differences between CCCM and FLXHR-LIDAR are mostly smaller than 5 W m(-2), while noticeable regional differences are found. For example, CCCM shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) CREs are larger than FXLHR-LIDAR along the west coasts of Africa and America because the GEOPROF-LIDAR algorithm misses shallow marine boundary layer clouds. In addition, FLXHR-LIDAR SW CREs are larger than the CCCM counterpart over tropical oceans away from the west coasts of America. Over midlatitude storm-track regions, CCCM SW and LW CREs are larger than the FLXHR-LIDAR counterpart.

In this study, ten areas located along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula are investigated with respect to remotely sensed water quality indicators derived from NASA MODIS aboard of the satellite Aqua. We found that there was a strong seasonal trend with spatial heterogeneity. In specific, a strong six-month phase-lag was found between chlorophyll-a and total suspended solid owing to their inversed seasonality, which could be explained by different dynamics and environmental settings. Chlorophyll-a concentration seemed to be dominantly influenced by temperature, while total suspended solid was largely governed by local tidal forcing and bottom topography. This study demonstrated the potential and applicability of satellite products in coastal management, and highlighted find that remote-sensing would be a promising tool in resolving orthogonality of large spatio-temporal scale variabilities when combining with proper time series analyses.

We describe an approach that leverages coincident NASA A-train and the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data to quantify the relationships in the subtropical MBL derived at the native pixel and grid resolution. A new method for observing four subtropical oceanic regions that capture transitions from stratocumulus to trade cumulus is demonstrated, where stratocumulus and cumulus regimes are determined from infrared-based thermodynamic phase. Visible radiances are normally distributed within stratocumulus and are increasingly skewed away from the coast, where trade cumulus dominates. Increases in MBL depth, wind speed, and effective radius (r(e)), and reductions in 700-1000 hPa moist static energy differences and 700 and 850 hPa vertical velocity correspond with increases in visible radiance skewness. We posit that a more robust representation of the cloudy MBL is obtained using visible radiance rather than retrievals of optical thickness that are limited to a smaller subset of cumulus. The method using the combined A-train and MERRA data set has demonstrated that an increase in r(e) within shallow cumulus is strongly related to higher MBL wind speeds that further correspond to increased precipitation occurrence according to CloudSat, previously demonstrated with surface observations. Hence, the combined data sets have the potential of adding global context to process-level understanding of the MBL.

Factors Influencing the Distribution of Chl-a along Coastal Waters of East Peninsular Malaysia	SAINS MALAYSIANA												Determination of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) distribution in the coastal waters is important to understand the coastal environmental conditions. This study was conducted to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of Chl-a along coastal waters of east Peninsular Malaysia and factors influencing its variability using Chl-a data derived from Aqua MODIS satellite (1 km spatial resolution) from January 2006 to December 2012. Chl-a variability was described using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. In-situ data (temperature, salinity, density and nitrate) and rainfall data from the Department of Meteorology were analyzed using spatial interpolation to determine factors influencing the distribution of Chl-a. The seasonal progressions of Chl-a showed high value during northeast monsoon along the coast. This variability was described by four modes of the EOF analysis. The first mode (72.08% of total variance) indicated seasonal cycle with high variability along the coast. Second mode (17.03% of variance) explained the northeast monsoon with high variability from river mouth to the south. Third mode (2.39% of variance) indicated variability during southwest monsoon along the coast and much higher to the south. Mode 4 (1.93% of variance) explained the inter-monsoon period observed along the northern and southern coastline. Concentration and distribution of Chl-a were related to availability of nutrient influenced by rainfall. The thermohaline front was also observed to play an important role in accumulation of phytoplankton biomass during northeast and southwest monsoon.																	0126-6039					AUG	2017	46	8					1191	1200		10.17576/jsm-2017-4608-04								WOS:000415048400004						
J	Saksa, P; Safeeq, M; Dymond, S				Saksa, Philip; Safeeq, Mohammad; Dymond, Salli			Recent Patterns in Climate, Vegetation, and Forest Water Use in California Montane Watersheds	FORESTS												California has recently experienced one of the worst droughts on record, negatively impacting forest ecosystems across the state. As a major source of the region's water supply, it is important to evaluate the vegetation and water balance response of these montane forested watersheds to climate variability across the range of rain-to snow-dominated precipitation regimes. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) were used to capture the hydrologic drought signal, and MODIS vegetation indices (i.e., the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index) were used to evaluate the vegetation and evapotranspiration response in three headwater catchments. The study catchments comprised a low elevation rain-dominated site (Caspar Creek) on the northern California coast, a mid-elevation site with a mix of rain and snow (Providence Creek) in the California Sierra Nevada, and a high elevation snow-dominated site (Bull Creek) in the Sierra Nevada. Lowest SPI values occurred in the third drought year of 2014 for all sites. Lowest SRI was in 2014 for Caspar, but in 2015 for Providence and Bull, reflecting differences in snowpack-delayed runoff and subsurface storage capacity between the lower and higher elevation watersheds. The most accurate water balance closure using evapotranspiration estimates from vegetation indices was within 10% of measured precipitation at snow-dominated Bull. The rain-dominated Caspar watershed had the highest vegetation index values and annual evapotranspiration, with the lowest variability over the previous 13 years (2004-2016). Vegetation index values and annual evapotranspiration decreased with increasing elevation and snow contribution to precipitation. Both snow-influenced Sierra Nevada watersheds showed elevated vegetation and evapotranspiration responses to interannual climate variability. There remains a need for institutional support to expand long-term observations in remote forested mountain watersheds to monitor and research these changing and extreme environmental conditions in source watershed regions.

A modular ridge randomized neural network with differential evolutionary distributor applied to the estimation of sea ice thickness	SOFT COMPUTING												In this paper, a sequential intelligent methodology is implemented to estimate the sea-ice thickness along the Labrador coast of Canada based on spatio-temporal information from the moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer, and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth sensors. The proposed intelligent model comprises two separate sub-systems. In the first part of the model, clustering is performed to divide the studied region into a set of sub-regions, based on a number of features. Thereafter, this learning system serves as a distributor to dispatch the proper information to a set of estimation modules. The estimation modules utilize ridge randomized neural network to create a map between a set of features and sea-ice thickness. The proposed modular intelligent system is best suited for the considered case study as the amount of collected spatio-temporal information is large. To ascertain the veracity of the proposed technique, two different spatio-temporal databases are considered, which include the remotely sensed brightness temperature data at two different frequencies (low frequency, 6.9 GHz, and high frequency, 36.5 GHz) in addition to both atmospheric and oceanic variables coming from validated forecasting models. To numerically prove the accuracy and computational robustness of the designed sequential learning system, two different sets of comparative tests are conducted. In the first phase, the emphasis is put on evaluating the efficacy of the proposed modular framework using different clustering methods and using different types of estimators at the heart of the estimation modules. Thereafter, the modular estimator is prepared with standard neural identifiers to prove to what extent the modular estimator can increase the accuracy and robustness of the estimation.																	1432-7643	1433-7479				AUG	2017	21	16			SI		4635	4659		10.1007/s00500-016-2074-5								WOS:000407133600013

Spatial and seasonal distributions of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fronts (similar to 1-100 km) in the vicinity of main French rivers, Gironde and Loire, are explored over the continental shelf North of 45 degrees N in the Bay of Biscay. A high resolution (1 km spatial and daily temporal resolutions) dataset of 11 years' (2003-2013) remotely sensed SST by MODIS sensor onboard Aqua and Terra satellites has been investigated and compared with coastal numerical model experiments. The detection and characterization fronts with fluctuating amplitudes is achieved through the Singularity Analysis (i.e. the process of calculating the degree of regularity or irregularity of a function at each point in a domain). Seasonality of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay is then described based on the long-term satellite SST archive and coastal operational model simulations. The identified hot spots of higher frontal occurrences correspond on one hand to previously observed features (e.g. tidal fronts) but also reveal new features. These are investigated to identify fine-scale dynamical drivers. In winter, density fronts are prominent in a coastal strip where freshwater influence is important. In spring, this strip diminishes as plumes detach from the coast, while tidal fronts become apparent in other regions. In summer, tidal fronts in Ushant region and internal wave activity along the shelf break dominate. In autumn, coastal density fronts due to freshwater inputs reappear as these inputs increase, and reduced stratification causes a weakening of the Ushant and shelf break fronts. Additional information and an effort to dynamically interpret these fronts, based on a systematic investigation of the whole seasonal cycle and including modeling insights from coastal operational oceanography, complement the description of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				JUL 5	2017	144						65	79		10.1016/j.csr.2017.06.015								WOS:000407660600007

Spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a concentration in Makassar Strait using Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of satellite images	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Nine years of monthly data of MODIS derived chl-a around Makassar Strait of Indonesia were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a concentration. The variability was further analyzed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF). The first mode (62.08% of variance) showed variability of seasonal pattern. The second mode (5.75% of variance) showed variability during the Northwest monsoon and the Southeast monsoon. Meanwhile, the third mode (2.72% of variance) and the fourth mode (2.25% of variance) showed variability during the Transition monsoon I and II, respectively.The variability of chl-a along the Borneo Island is influenced by river runoff during the Northwest monsoon, while the variability of chl-a along the Sulawesi Island is induced by strong wind and current during the Southeast monsoon.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2017	46	7					1381	1389										WOS:000406894700018

Satellite remotely sensed LST has the advantages of global coverage and consistent periodicity, which overcomes the weakness of ground observations related to sparse distributions and costs. For human related studies and urban climatology, canopy layer urban heat island (CUHI) based on air temperatures is extremely important. This study has employed remote sensing methodology to produce monthly CUHI climatology maps during the period 2000-2013, revealing the spatiotemporal characteristics of daytime and nighttime CUHI during this period of rapid urbanization in Shanghai. Using stepwise linear regression, daytime and nighttime air temperatures at the four overpass times of Terra/Aqua were estimated based on time series of Terra/Aqua-MODIS LST and other auxiliary variables including enhanced vegetation index, normalized difference water index, solar zenith angle and distance to coast. The validation results indicate that the models produced an accuracy of 1.6-2.6 degrees C RMSE for the four overpass times of Terra/Aqua. The models based on Terra LST showed higher accuracy than those based on Aqua LST, and nighttime air temperature estimation had higher accuracy than daytime. The seasonal analysis shows daytime CUHI is strongest in summer and weakest in winter, while nighttime CUHI is weakest in summer and strongest in autumn. The annual mean daytime CUHI during 2000-2013 is 1.0 and 2.2 degrees C for Terra and Aqua overpass, respectively. The annual mean nighttime CUHI is about 1.0 degrees C for both Terra and Aqua overpass. The resultant CUHI climatology maps provide a spatiotemporal quantification of CUHI with emphasis on temperature gradients. This study has provided information of relevance to urban planners and environmental managers for assessing and monitoring urban thermal environments which are constantly being altered by natural and anthropogenic influences.																	2072-4292					JUL	2017	9	7							641	10.3390/rs9070641								WOS:000406676800004

An optical remote sensing approach for ecological monitoring of red and green Noctiluca scintillans	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An ecosystem disruptive bloom of red Noctiluca scintillans (hereafter Noctiluca) was observed in coastal waters of the north-western Bay of Bengal during April 2014. Based on the principle of phytoplankton group/species specific remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), a technique of detecting green Noctiluca and diatom was developed earlier using Rrs at 443, 488, and 531 nm of Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua (MODIS). This was appropriately modified to detect bloom of red Noctiluca in coastal waters of the Bay of Bengal. Additional Rrs data at longer wavelengths viz. 667 and 678 nm were included in the existing algorithm, and the spectral shapes were accounted to detect the bloom of red Noctiluca. The classification scheme discriminates red Noctiluca from the green form of the same species and diatom. Phytoplankton group/species products were generated using the modified approach and validated with the reported events of red and green Noctiluca blooms in the Indian coastal waters. The present study also highlights two specific results based on MODIS retrieved time-series phytoplankton group/species image analysis: first, the observation of coexistence of diatom, red, and green Noctiluca in coastal waters of the northwestern Bay of Bengal, and the second, phytoplankton community shift resulting in red/green Noctiluca proliferation following diatom.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							330	10.1007/s10661-017-6037-9								WOS:000404652900027	28601960

The test area is located near the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland where easterly winds are known to trigger intense coastal upwellings. The analysis is based on the comparison of motions of three drifters that follow the currents in the uppermost layer with a thickness of 2 m with MODIS-based sea surface temperature data and high-quality open sea wind time series. The presence of an upwelling event superseded the classic Ekman-type drift of the surface layer and considerably slowed down the average speed of surface currents in the region affected by the upwelled cold water jet and its filaments. The drifters tended to stay amidst the surrounding surface waters. The properties of mixing were evaluated using the daily rate of temperature change along several transects. The upwelled cooler water largely kept its identity during almost the entire duration of the upwelling event. Intense mixing started at a later stage of the upwelling and continued after the end of the event when the winds that have driven the entire process began to subside. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Osadchiev, A; Korshenko, E				Osadchiev, Alexander; Korshenko, Evgeniya			Small river plumes off the northeastern coast of the Black Sea under average climatic and flooding discharge conditions	OCEAN SCIENCE												This study focuses on the impact of discharges of small rivers on the delivery and fate of fluvial water and suspended matter at the northeastern part of the Black Sea under different local precipitation conditions. Several dozens of mountainous rivers flow into the sea at the study region, and most of them, except for several of the largest, have little annual runoff and affect adjacent coastal waters to a limited extent under average climatic conditions. However, the discharges of these small rivers are characterized by a quick response to precipitation events and can significantly increase during and shortly after heavy rains, which are frequent in the considered area. The delivery and fate of fluvial water and terrigenous sediments at the study region, under average climatic and rain-induced flooding conditions, were explored and compared using in situ data, satellite imagery, and numerical modeling. It was shown that the point-source spread of continental discharge dominated by several large rivers under average climatic conditions can change to the line-source discharge from numerous small rivers situated along the coast in response to heavy rains. The intense line-source runoff of water and suspended sediments forms a geostrophic alongshore current of turbid and freshened water, which induces the intense transport of suspended and dissolved constituents discharged with river waters in a northwestern direction. This process significantly influences water quality and causes active sediment load at large segments of the narrow shelf at the northeastern part of the Black Sea compared to average climatic discharge conditions.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variability of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in the Bohai Sea were investigated using 13-year (2000-2012) satellite-derived products from MODIS and SeaWiFS observations. Based on linear regression analysis, the results showed that the entire Bohai Sea experienced an increase in Chl-a on a long-term scale, with the largest increase in the central Bohai Sea and the smallest increase in the Bohai strait. Distinct seasonal patterns of Chl-a existed in different sub-regions of the Bohai Sea. A long-lasting Chl-a peak was observed from May to September in coastal waters (Liaodong bay, Qinhuangdao coast, and Bohai bay) and the central Bohai Sea, whereas Laizhou bay had relatively low Chl-a in early summer. In the Bohai strait, two pronounced Chl-a peaks occurred in March and September, but the lowest Chl-a was in summer. This pattern was quite different from those in other regions of the Bohai Sea. The water column condition (stratified or mixed) was likely an important physical factor that affects the seasonal pattern of Chl-a in the Bohai Sea. Meanwhile, increased human activity (e.g., river discharge) played a significant role in changing the Chl-a distribution in both coastal waters and the central Bohai Sea, especially in summer. The increasing trend of Chl-a in the Bohai Sea might be attributed to the increase in nutrient contents from riverine inputs. The Chl-a dynamics documented in this study provide basic knowledge for the future exploration of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem evolution in the Bohai Sea.

Previously KB HABs detection primarily relied on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS-A) satellite, depending on its remote sensing reflectance signal at the 678-nm chlorophyll fluorescence band (Rrs678) needed for normalized fluorescence height and related red band difference retrieval algorithms. VIIRS, MODIS-A's successor, does not have a 678-nm channel. Instead, our NN uses Rrs at 486-, 551-, and 671-nm VIIRS channels to retrieve phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm (a(ph443)). The retrieved a(ph443) images are next filtered by applying limits, defined by (i) low Rrs551-nm backscatter and (ii) a minimum a(ph443) value associated with KB HABs. The filtered residual images are then converted to show chlorophyll-a concentrations [Chla] and KB cell counts. VIIRS retrievals using our NN and five other retrieval algorithms were compared and evaluated against numerous in situ measurements made over the four-year 2012 to 2016 period, for which VIIRS data are available. These comparisons confirm the viability and higher retrieval accuracies of the NN technique, when combined with the filtering constraints, for effective detection of KB HABs. Analysis of these results as well as sequential satellite observations and recent field measurements underline the importance of short-term temporal variabilities on retrieval accuracies.

It provides livelihood to inhabitant and is known to be sensitive to climatic fluctuations. This study focuses on examining the impacts of temperature and precipitation variations on coastal forest. Two different regression methods, ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were employed to reveal the relationship between meteorological variables and forest dynamics. OLS regression analysis shows that changes in precipitation and temperature, over a span of 12 months, are responsible for 56% of NDVI variation. The forest, which is not particularly affected by the average monthly precipitation in most months, is observed to be affected by cumulative seasonal and annual precipitation explicitly. Temperature and precipitation almost equally impact on NDVI changes; about 50% of the NDVI variations is explained in OLS modeling, and about 74% of the NDVI variations is explained in GWR modeling. GWR analysis indicated that both precipitation and temperature characterize the spatial heterogeneity patterns of forest dynamics.

Therefore, measurement of SST has been done from ships, buoys, offshore platforms, and satellites. During past decades satellites are being increasingly used, because datasets over wide areas can be obtained. In this paper, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra and Aqua SST products were examined and validated for coastal waters in the Yellow Sea by using the in situ buoy data. A strict match-up method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of coastal area, resulting in 154 and 164 match-ups for Terra and Aqua, respectively. The MODIS SST agreed well with in situ buoy SST, with squared correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.989 for Terra, and 0.987 for Aqua. Relative to in situ SSTs, the satellite-derived SSTs had a bias of 0.23 degrees C and 0.06 degrees C, a standard deviation of 0.79 degrees C and 0.85 degrees C, and a root mean square error of 0.83 degrees C and 0.85 degrees C, for Terra and Aqua. The differences between MODIS and in situ SST exhibited apparent seasonal variations. The accuracy of MODIS SST products for spring and summer were lower than those for autumn andwinter, which could be caused by frequent sea fog along the southern coast of Shandong Peninsula. The SST bias approximately depended on wind velocity; low wind velocity could enhance the diurnal SST amplitude and the bulk-skin temperature difference. However, there is no significant dependence of the bias on air-sea temperature difference or surface flow velocity.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAY	2017	10	5	1				1667	1680		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2651951								WOS:000399682500001						
J	Kulshreshtha, A; Shanmugam, P				Kulshreshtha, Anuj; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Estimation of underwater visibility in coastal and inland waters using remote sensing data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An optical method is developed to estimate water transparency (or underwater visibility) in terms of Secchi depth (Z(sd)), which follows the remote sensing and contrast transmittance theory. The major factors governing the variation in Z(sd), namely, turbidity and length attenuation coefficient (1/(c + K-d), c = beam attenuation coefficient; K-d = diffuse attenuation coefficient at 531 nm), are obtained based on band rationing techniques. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (expressed as (R-rs(443) + R-rs(490))/ (R-rs(555) + R-rs(670)) contains essential information about the water column optical properties and thereby positively correlates to turbidity. The beam attenuation coefficient (c) at 531 nm is obtained by a linear relationship with turbidity. To derive the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm, K-d(490) is estimated as a function of reflectance ratio (R-rs(670)/R-rs(490)), which provides the bio-optical link between chlorophyll concentration and K-d(531). The present algorithm was applied to MODIS-Aqua images, and the results were evaluated by matchup comparisons between the remotely estimated Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) in coastal waters off Point Calimere and its adjoining regions on the southeast coast of India. The results showed the pattern of increasing Z(sd) from shallow turbid waters to deep clear waters. The statistical evaluation of the results showed that the percent mean relative error between the MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) values was within +/- 25%. A close agreement achieved in spatial contours of MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) for the month of January 2014 and August 2013 promises the model capability to yield accurate estimates of Zsd in coastal, estuarine, and inland waters. The spatial contours have been included to provide the best data visualization of the measured, modeled (in situ), and satellite-derived Z(sd) products. The modeled and satellite-derived Z(sd) values were compared with measurement data which yielded RMSE = 0.079, MRE = -0.016, and R-2 = 0.95 for the modeled Z(sd) and RMSE = 0.075, MRE = 0.020, and R-2 = 0.95 for the satellite-derived Z(sd) products.

An anomalous African dust event and its impact on aerosol radiative forcing on the Southwest Atlantic coast of Europe in February 2016	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A desert dust (DD) event that had its origin in North Africa occurred on the 20th-23rd of February 2016. The dust transport phenomenon was exceptional because of its unusual intensity during the coldest season. A historical dataset (2006-2015) of February meteorological scenarios using ECMWF fields, meteorological parameters, aerosol optical properties, surface 03 and AOD retrieved from MODIS at the El Arenosillo observatory (southwestern Spain) were analysed and compared with the levels during the DD event to highlight its exceptionality. Associated with a low-pressure system in Western North Africa, flows transported air from the Sahel to Algeria and consequently increased temperatures from the surface to 700 hPa by up to 7-9 degrees C relative to the last decade. These conditions favoured the formation of a Saharan air layer. Dust was transported to the north and reached the Western Mediterranean Basin and the Iberian Peninsula. The arrival of the DD event at El Arenosillo did not affect the surface weather conditions or ozone but did impact the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere (RFTOA). Aerosol radiative properties did not change relative to historical; however, the particle size and the amount of the aerosol were significantly higher. The DD event caused an increase (in absolute terms) of the mean aerosol RFTOA to a value of -8.1 W m(-2) (long-term climatological value similar to - 1.5 W m(-2)). The aerosol RFTOA was not very large relative other DD episodes; however, our analysis of the historical data concluded that the importance of this DD event lay in the month of occurrence. European phenological datasets related to extreme atmospheric events predominantly reflect changes that are probably associated with climate change. This work is an example of this phenomenon, showing an event that occurred in a hotspot, the Saharan desert, and its impact two thousand km away. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Particulate matter (PM) pollution from China is transported eastward to Korea and Japan and has been suggested to influence surface air quality on the West Coast of the United States. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to recent trends in Chinese emissions and transport. We reconciled different passive remote sensing points of view and found that while aerosol optical thickness (AOT) as an indicator of particulate pollution has increased from the start of the observation period (2000) to 2006-2007 from the main Chinese coastal outflow regions, since then there has been a 10-20% decrease in AOT (with respect to 2007). Reductions were observed in spring, summer, and fall seasons. No improvement in exported PM pollution is found for the winter season.

However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to recent trends in Chinese emissions and transport. We reconciled different passive remote sensing points of view and found that while aerosol optcial thickness (AOT) as an indicator of particulate pollution has increased to 2006-2007 in the main exit regions of China's coast, since then there has been a 10-20% decrease in AOT (with respect to 2007). Reductions were observed in spring, summer, and fall seasons. No improvement in exported particulate matter pollution is found for the winter season.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 28	2017	44	6					2941	2948		10.1002/2017GL072617								WOS:000399762700038						
J	Pan, YQ; Shen, F; Verhoef, W				Pan, Yanqun; Shen, Fang; Verhoef, Wouter			An improved spectral optimization algorithm for atmospheric correction over turbid coastal waters: A case study from the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing-based retrieval of the concentrations of water components relies largely on the accuracy of the atmospheric correction. Although a variety of atmospheric correction algorithms have been developed for turbid waters, the water-leaving reflectance is still underestimated in extremely turbid waters, such as in the Changjiang (Yangtze) estuary and the adjacent coast. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved algorithm that is based on a spectral optimization algorithm (ESOA) with a coupled water-atmosphere model. The model combines an aerosol model that is constructed from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observation data and a simple semi-empirical radiative transfer (SERT) model (Shen et al. 2010) for water component retrieval. Four unknown parameters are involved in the coupled model: the relative humidity (RH), fine-mode fraction (FMF), aerosol optical thickness in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength tau(a)(lambda(0)) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration (C-spm). These parameters are estimated by a global optimization approach that is based on a genetic algorithm (GA) without any initial inputs. Validation results of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) from matchups between Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and in situ data show that the algorithm has satisfactory accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the absolute percentage difference (APD) are 0.0089 and 35.12, respectively. By contrast, the R-rs(lambda) values retrieved from the same matchups using the GOCI data processing system (GDPS) have higher RMSE and APD of 0.0104 and 69.15, respectively. The ESOA method can be implemented conveniently within the open source code of SeaDAS (v7.1) as an alternative and operational tool for atmospheric correction of ocean color data, including GOCI, MERIS and MODIS, over highly turbid estuarine and coastal regions, such as the Yangtze estuary, the Hangzhou Bay and most of the coastal ocean in Eastern China.

J.; Jorba, Oriol; Garcia-Pando, Carlos Perez			Assimilation of MODIS Dark Target and Deep Blue observations in the dust aerosol component of NMMB-MONARCH version 1.0	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												A data assimilation capability has been built for the NMMB-MONARCH chemical weather prediction system, with a focus on mineral dust, a prominent type of aerosol. An ensemble-based Kalman filter technique (namely the local ensemble transform Kalman filter - LETKF) has been utilized to optimally combine model background and satellite retrievals. Our implementation of the ensemble is based on known uncertainties in the physical parametrizations of the dust emission scheme. Experiments showed that MODIS AOD retrievals using the Dark Target algorithm can help NMMB-MONARCH to better characterize atmospheric dust. This is particularly true for the analysis of the dust outflow in the Sahel region and over the African Atlantic coast. The assimilation of MODIS AOD retrievals based on the Deep Blue algorithm has a further positive impact in the analysis downwind from the strongest dust sources of the Sahara and in the Arabian Peninsula. An analysis-initialized forecast performs better (lower forecast error and higher correlation with observations) than a standard forecast, with the exception of underestimating dust in the long-range Atlantic transport and degradation of the temporal evolution of dust in some regions after day 1. Particularly relevant is the improved forecast over the Sahara throughout the forecast range thanks to the assimilation of Deep Blue retrievals over areas not easily covered by other observational datasets. The present study on mineral dust is a first step towards data assimilation with a complete aerosol prediction system that includes multiple aerosol species.

They can also contribute to exceedances of air quality standards and have negative impacts on human health. We present a case study of an intense wildfire plume from Siberia that affected the air quality across the Pacific Northwest on 6-10 July 2012. Using satellite measurements (MODIS True Colour RGB imagery and MODIS AOD), we track the wildfire smoke plume from its origin in Siberia to the Pacific Northwest where subsidence ahead of a subtropical Pacific High made the plume settle over the region. The normalized enhancement ratios of O-3 and PM1 relative to CO of 0.26 and 0.08 are consistent with a plume aged 6-10 days. The aerosol mass in the plume was mainly submicron in diameter (PM1 / PM2.5 = 0.96) and the part of the plume sampled at the Whistler High Elevation Monitoring Site (2182 m a.s.l.) was 88% organic material. Stable atmospheric conditions along the coast limited the initial entrainment of the plume and caused local anthropogenic emissions to build up. A synthesis of air quality from the regional surface monitoring networks describes changes in ambient O-3 and PM2.5 during the event and contrasts them to baseline air quality estimates from the AURAMS chemical transport model without wildfire emissions. Overall, the smoke plume contributed significantly to the exceedances in O-3 and PM2.5 air quality standards and objectives that occurred at several communities in the region during the event. Peak enhancements in 8 h O-3 of 34-44 ppbv and 24 h PM2.5 of 10-32 mu g m(-3) were attributed to the effects of the smoke plume across the Interior of British Columbia and at the Whistler Peak High Elevation Site. Lesser enhancements of 10-12 ppbv for 8 h O-3 and of 4-9 mu g m(-3) for 24 h PM2.5 occurred across coastal British Columbia and Washington State. The findings suggest that the large air quality impacts seen during this event were a combination of the efficient transport of the plume across the Pacific, favourable entrainment conditions across the BC interior, and the large scale of the Siberian wildfire emissions. A warming climate increases the risk of increased wildfire activity and events of this scale reoccurring under appropriate meteorological conditions.																	1680-7316	1680-7324				FEB 21	2017	17	4					2593	2611		10.5194/acp-17-2593-2017								WOS:000395137500001

In this study, AOD by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was compared to verify the source regions. Regionally, the effects of the long-range transport of pollutants from the eastern China on air quality in south Korea have become more significant over this period.																	1598-7132	2383-5346				FEB	2017	33	1					19	30		10.5572/KOSAE.2017.33.1.019								WOS:000408955600003

Satellite remote sensing can be a useful tool for the management of such types of marine hazards, namely oil spills, mainly owing to the synoptic view and the good trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, depending on the specific platform/sensor system used. In this paper, an innovative satellite-based technique for oil spill detection, based on the general robust satellite technique (RST) approach, is presented. It exploits the multi-temporal analysis of data acquired in the visible channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite in order to automatically and quickly detect the presence of oil spills on the sea surface, with an attempt to minimize "false detections" caused by spurious effects associated with, for instance, cloud edges, sun/satellite geometries, sea currents, etc. The oil spill event that occurred in June 2007 off the south coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea has been considered as a test case. The resulting data, the reliability of which has been evaluated by both carrying out a confutation analysis and comparing them with those provided by the application of another independent MODIS-based method, showcase the potential of RST in identifying the presence of oil with a high level of accuracy.

Time-series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were analyzed to obtain various phenological metrics for the period 2001-2015. MODIS-derived land surface temperatures were corrected for the sampling biases caused by cloud cover. Results indicate significant differences between West and East Greenland, in terms of both observed phenology during the study period, as well as the climatic response. The date of the start of season (SOS) was significantly earlier (24 days), length of season longer (25 days), and time-integrated NDVI higher in West Greenland. The sea ice concentration during May was found to have a significant effect on the date of the SOS only in West Greenland, with the strongest linkage detected in mid-western parts of Greenland.

J	Bulgarelli, B; Kiselev, V; Zibordi, G				Bulgarelli, Barbara; Kiselev, Viatcheslav; Zibordi, Giuseppe			Adjacency effects in satellite radiometric products from coastal waters: a theoretical analysis for the northern Adriatic Sea	APPLIED OPTICS												Biases induced by land perturbations in satellite-derived water-leaving radiance are theoretically estimated for typical observation conditions in a coastal area of the northern Adriatic Sea hosting the Aqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) validation site. Two different correction procedures are considered: not deriving (AC-1) or alternatively deriving (AC-2) the atmospheric properties from the remote sensing data. In both cases, biases due to adjacency effects largely increase by approaching the coast and with the satellite viewing angle. Conversely, the seasonal and spectral dependence of biases significantly differ between AC-1 and AC-2 schemes. For AC-1 schemes average biases are within +/- 5% throughout the transect at yellow-green wavelengths, but at the coast they can reach -21% and 34% at 412 and 670 nm, respectively, and exceed 100% at 865 nm. For AC-2 schemes, adjacency effects at those wavelengths from which atmospheric properties are inferred add significant perturbations. For the specific case of a correction scheme determining the atmospheric properties from the near-infrared region and by adopting a power-law spectral extrapolation of adjacency perturbations on the derived atmospheric radiance, average biases become all negative with values up to -60% and -74% at 412 and 670 nm at the coast, respectively. The seasonal trend of estimated biases at the AAOT is consistent with intra-annual variation of biases from match ups between insitu and satellite products derived with SeaDAS from SeaWiFS and MODIS data. Nevertheless, estimated biases at blue wavelengths exceed systematic differences determined from match-up analysis. This may be explained by uncertainties and approximations in the simulation procedure, and by mechanisms of compensation introduced by the turbid water correction algorithm implemented in SeaDAS.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s). To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 - MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of R-rs(lambda) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (005Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within similar to 25% of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 R(rs)4442) (similar to 17%) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 12%) from 0.3 to 7 mg m(-3) Chl a, but for R-rs(560)the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 (similar to 10%) compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 13%), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to 005Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values >14 g M-3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was >4 g m(-3). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Comparison of a simulation using a physics-based desert dust emission scheme with a numerical experiment using a simplified (minimal) emission scheme is included to highlight the advantages of the former. The model was found to reproduce well the synoptic meteorological conditions driving the dust outbreak: an omega-like pressure configuration associated with a cyclogenesis in the Atlantic coasts of Spain. The model performances in reproducing the atmospheric desert dust load were evaluated using a multi-platform observational dataset of aerosol and desert dust properties, including optical properties from satellite and ground-based sun photometers and lidars, plus in situ particulate matter mass concentration (PM) data. This comparison allowed us to investigate the model ability in reproducing both the horizontal and the vertical displacement of the dust plume, as well as its evolution in time. The comparison with satellite (MODIS-Terra) and sun photometers (AERONET) showed that the model is able to reproduce well the horizontal field of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its evolution in time (temporal correlation coefficient with AERONET of 0.85). On the vertical scale, the comparison with lidar data at a single site (Rome, Italy) confirms that the desert dust advection occurs in several, superimposed "pulses" as simulated by the model. Cross-analysis of the modeled AOD and desert dust emission fluxes further allowed for the source regions of the observed plumes to be inferred. The vertical displacement of the modeled dust plume was in rather good agreement with the lidar soundings, with correlation coefficients among aerosol extinction profiles up to 1 and mean discrepancy of about 50 %. The model-measurement comparison for PM10 and PM2.5 showed a good temporal matching, although it revealed a marked overestimation of PM10 and PM2.5 (of the order of 70% during the dust peak). For PM10, it was also possible to investigate the accordance between the model-and the measurement-based dust PM10, this confirming the model PM10 overestimation to be related to over-predicted dust mass up to a factor of 140 %. In all the model-measurement comparisons performed, the enhanced capabilities of the physics-based emission scheme with respect to its simplified, minimal version were evident and are documented.

Estimation of Air-Sea CO2 Exchange and Decadal Change of Surface Water fCO(2) in a Shallow Continental Shelf Using in Situ and Remote Sensing Data During Winter	ENVIRONMENT AND EARTH OBSERVATION: CASE STUDIES IN INDIA	Springer Remote Sensing Photogrammetry											The air-sea CO2 exchange (fCO(2)) was estimated in the outer estuary to offshore transition zone of the northern Bay of Bengal using in situ measurements and remote sensing data obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). The in situ measurements were done during winter months (December, January and February) of the year 2011-12. Sea surface CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)), sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a were measured in situ to develop an empirical relationship with fCO(2) but only the SST showed a significant correlation (r(2) = 0.55, n = 64, p < 0.05). This relationship was used to assess fCO(2) (water) and its temporal change in decadal scale from the year 2002-2003 to 2011-2012 of the winter months using remotely sensed SST data. The study area acted as a mild sink for atmospheric CO2 at the mean rate of -28 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) (MODIS derived) to -40 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) (AVHRR derived). An overall winter-to-winter increasing trend of fCO(2) was observed in the last decade which is accompanied by a similar decrease in the chlorophyll-a concentrations.																	2198-0721	2198-073X	978-3-319-46010-9; 978-3-319-46008-6				2017							123	135		10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9_9	10.1007/978-3-319-46010-9							WOS:000419229200011

The semi-analytical or empirical algorithms that work well in Case 1 waters encounter many problems in offshore areas where the water is often optically complex and presents difficulties for atmospheric correction. Zhejiang is one of the most developed provinces in eastern China, and its adjacent seas have been greatly affected by recent rapid economic development. Various islands and semi-closed bays along the Zhejiang coast promote the formation of muddy tidal flats. Moreover, large quantities of terrestrial substances coming down with the Yangtze River and other local rivers also have a great impact on the coastal waters of the province. MODIS, VIIRS and GOCI are three commonly used ocean color sensors covering the East China Sea. Several ocean color products such as remote-sensing reflectance (R) and the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) of the above three sensors on the Zhejiang coast have been evaluated. Cloud-free satellite images with synchronous field measurements taken between 2012 and 2015 were used for comparison. It is shown that there is a good correlation between the MODIS and GOCI spectral data, while some outliers were found in the VIIRS images. The low signal-to-noise ratio at short wavelengths in highly turbid waters also reduced the correlation between different sensors. In addition, it was possible to obtain more valid data with GOCI in shallow waters because of the use of an appropriate atmospheric correction algorithm. The standard Chl-a and TSM products of the three satellites were also evaluated, and it was found that the Chl-a and TSM concentrations calculated by the OC3 G and Case 2 algorithms, respectively, were more suitable for use in the study area. Moreover, GOCI has been proved to be effective for monitoring the diurnal dynamics in coastal waters, and the concentration of TSM had a good negative correlation with water level. Overall, compared with MODIS and VIIRS, GOCI is more effective for monitoring the fine changes and diurnal dynamics in the seas adjacent to Zhejiang Province.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104221K	10.1117/12.2278041								WOS:000418795400037

While matchups are usually good in open ocean waters, significant discrepancies are observed in coastal areas which are primarily due to the more complex atmospheres near the coast and therefore less accurate atmospheric correction. Satellite-derived water leaving radiances are determined by applying atmospheric correction procedures which include assumptions about the characteristics of atmospheric aerosols. At sea level, SeaPRISM makes direct measurements of nLw from the ocean, as well as observations of sky from which aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness, single scattering albedo, fraction of fine and coarse aerosols, and others are determined. Using NASA SeaDAS software for OC satellite data processing, characteristics of aerosols in atmospheric correction models for VIIRS sensor are explicitly retrieved and compared with the ones from AERONET-OC data, primarily in terms of aerosol optical depth (AOD), thus characterizing the validity of the aerosol models and evaluating possible errors and reasons for discrepancies. Comparisons are presented for the coastal site at CCNY's Long Island Sound Coastal Observatory (LISCO) and a less coastal WaveCIS Gulf of Mexico' AERONET-OC site with variable water and atmospheric conditions.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104220H	10.1117/12.2279150								WOS:000418795400011

The South China Sea (SCS) is almost an enclosed marginal sea and is part of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Both of them are tropical marginal seas, and have similar hydrological properties, such as high surface temperature, stable thermocline, deep euphotic zone, etc. Moreover, they are all greatly affected by East Asian monsoon and typhoons. However, there are also several significant differences between them. The current circulation structures in the South China Sea are more complex with significant season variations. A large amount of fresh water through river inputs is one of the remarkable hydrological characteristics in the Bay of Bengal. In addition, the Bay of Bengal has a large volume of precipitation. Therefore, it is naturally interesting to investigate the different response of the marine ecological properties represented by chlorophyll concentration to climate change. The Sea -Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mission have provided a successive, long-term observations of global ocean colorfrom space. In this study, we investigate the Chl-a trends in the BOB and SCS during the SeaWiFS and MODIS observation periods (1998-2010 and 2003-2016), respectively. In 1998-2010, Chl-a increased in the western central basin of BOB, while it decreased in almost all other parts. During 2003-2016, Chl-a significantly increased in the western part of BOB, and reduced in the southern part. In the SCS, Chl-a in almost the whole region increased during the SeaWiFS observation period. In 2003-2016, the major rising trends appeared in China and Vietnam coast, the Beibu Gulf, and the Gulf of Thailand. The Chl-a of the Straits of Malacca and the Karimata Straits showed downward trends. The rise in temperature might be the main cause of the Chl-a decrease in the BOB. The deepened MLD and/or decreasing SST may contribute to the increasing Chl-a of the BOB and SCS. Remarkably, coastal Chl-a has continued to rise over the past 19 years. The freshwater input might have significant effect on it.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 104221G	10.1117/12.2278330								WOS:000418795400034

A synthetic index of bimodality has been computed at pixel scale before and after 1994. No class in Cote d'Ivoire shows a change from a forest bimodal character to a savanna unimodal character. On the other hand, the only unimodal class in the entire series shows a minute inflexion toward a bimodal rhythm. In Benin, one notes greater stability between the two periods. The "regreening" that was observed in Sahel can be associated with a similar, yet not strongly marked, phenomenon in the Sudanian-Guinean transition.																	2279-7254						2017	50	1					588	600		10.1080/22797254.2017.1377051								WOS:000416070900001

Identification of Atmospheric Gravity Waves in Clouds over a Water Surface from MODIS Imagery	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												We suggest an algorithm for identification of manifestations of atmospheric gravity waves in clouds over a water surface in MODIS images with a spatial resolution of 1000 m. The algorithm is based on the Viola-Jones method. The regions of the world where these phenomena are the most frequent are identified. Repeatability of the manifestations of atmospheric gravity waves in clouds throughout a year is estimated over the coasts of the Arabian Peninsula and Australia, Mozambique Channel, and the Kurile Islands. The cloud types formed by atmospheric gravity waves are determined. The results of their identification in full-sized MODIS images of different regions of the planet are discussed.																	0869-5695	2070-0393				JAN	2017	30	1					44	49		10.1134/S102485601701002X								WOS:000408721400007

Temporal-space characterization of satellite sea surface temperature in tourist destinations: Partido de la Costa, Pinamar and Villa Gesell, Buenos Aires, Argentina	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												The coastal spaces are fragile and complex areas that receive strong pressure because of the many uses and activities that are developed in them. The tourism of sun and beaches is one of the main economic practices present in these spaces that value the physical-natural conditions and their environmental variables. Of all of them, the sea surface temperature (SST) has been the least studied variable, especially associated to tourist destinations. The coastal zone of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, concentrates numerous tourist centers like the Partido de la Costa, Pinamar and Villa Gesell that attract in the summer time, a great flow of population. The objective of the present paper was to perform a descriptive and comparative analysis of SST in these parties through the use of monthly satellite images obtained by the Aqua-MODIS satellite-sensor during the period 2003-2013. The results showed a spatial and seasonal behavior of the SST differentiated for the entire study area. The SST for the warm period (January-March) ranged between 21.5 - 24.5 degrees C and for the cold (July-September) between 9.4 - 11.5 degrees C. This difference was lower in the cold period, allowing distinguishing 3 thermal zones with variations smaller than 0.5 degrees C between them: Costa Norte, Costa Centro-Costa Sur, and Pinamar-Villa Gesell. The warm period presented more intense spatial thermal variations between the studied tourist destinations. Four thermal zones with 0.5 degrees C differences were identified: Costa Norte, Costa Centro, Costa Sur, and Pinamar-Villa Gesell.																	1133-0953	1988-8740					2017		48					43	54		10.4995/raet.2017.7134								WOS:000403813400004						
J	Jena, B				Jena, Babula			The effect of phytoplankton pigment composition and packaging on the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration from satellite observations in the Southern Ocean	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Antarctic waters are known to be optically unique and the standard empirical ocean colour algorithms applied to these waters may not address the regional bio-optical characteristics. This article sheds light on the performance of current empirical algorithms and a regionally optimized algorithm (ROA) for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration from Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Aqua-MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) in the Indian Ocean Sector of Southern Ocean (IOSO). Analysis indicated that empirical algorithms used for the retrieval of chl-a concentration from Aqua-MODIS and SeaWiFS underestimate by a factor varying from 2 to 2.9, resulting in underestimation when in situ chl-a exceeds about 0.3 mg m(-3). To explain these uncertainties, a study was carried out to understand the effect of phytoplankton pigment composition and pigment packaging on remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs,R-lambda), from the analysis of phytoplankton-specific absorption coefficient (a(ph,)*(lambda)). The spatial variation of phytoplankton groups analysed using diagnostics pigments (DP) indicated shifting of the phytoplankton community structure from offshore to coastal Antarctic, with a significant increasing trend for diatoms and a decreasing trend for haptophytes population. The diatomdominated population exhibits lower a(ph,*lambda) in the 405-510 nm region (with relative flattening in 443-489 nm) compared with the a(ph,)*(lambda) spectra of the haptophytes-dominated population that peaks near 443 nm. The flattening of a(ph,)*(lambda) spectra for the diatom-dominated population was attributed to its larger cell size, which leads to pigment packaging (intracellular shading) and in turn results in higher R-rs,R-lambda The relationship between pigment composition (normalized by chl-a) and blue: green absorption band ratios (a(ph),*(443): a(ph),*(555) and a(ph),*(489): a(ph),* (555)) corresponding to the Aqua-MODIS and SeaWiFS bands showed in-phase associations with most of the pigments such as 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, peridinin, and zeaxanthin. In contrast, the out-of-phase association observed between the blue: green absorption ratios and fucoxanthin indicated apparent deviations from the general pigment retrieval algorithms, which assumes that blue: green ratios vary in a systematic form with chl-a. The out-of-phase correspondence suggests that the increasing trend of fucoxanthin pigments towards the Antarctic coast was associated with the decreasing trend of blue: green absorption ratios and in turn results in higher R-rs,R-lambda Therefore, an increase in Rrs,. leads to underestimation of chl-a from Aqua-MODIS and SeaWiFS in the IOSO region.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	13					3763	3784		10.1080/01431161.2017.1308034								WOS:000399247300001

Satellite-derived CO2 flux in the surface seawater of the Austral Ocean south of Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A step by step algorithm for air-sea CO2 flux (F(CO2)) calculation from satellite parameters is presented in this study. Parameters used for F(CO2) calculation are: (1) sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS Aqua), (2) sea surface salinity (SSS) estimated from MODIS Aqua SST using multiple linear regression, (3) seawater CO2 fugacity (f(CO2sw)) estimated by MODIS Aqua SST and chl-a using feedforward neural networks, (4) atmospheric CO2 fugacity (f(CO2atm)) from the Cape Grim station, and (5) wind speed from the Quick and Advanced Scatterometer (QSCAT and ASCAT). In situ data provided by (1) the Surveillance de l'Ocean Austral - Monitoring the Southern Ocean (SURVOSTRAL) project, (2) the Integrated Marine Observed System (IMOS) project, and (3) Mesures a l'INterface Eau-aiR de la Variabilite des echanges de CO2 (MINERVE) project collected on the research vessel L'Astrolabe, are used to establish and validate the models. These models are then tested using remote sensing data. This work focus on the southern ocean from the south of Australia to the Antarctica coasts (between 43.5 degrees S and 67 degrees S), on the period of spring and Austral summer (from October to March, between 2002/2003 and 2014/2015). In each step, the result's precision of experiments was determined by the root mean square error (RMSE). Results show (1) an improvement of satellite SSS estimation with a precision of +/- 0.16 using SST and latitude, (2) an estimation of f(CO2sw) by satellite data with a good accuracy of +/- 9.45 mu atm (0.96 Pa), and (3) a calculation of F(CO2) using satellite data with a global RMSE of about +/- 3 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1). The interpolated F(CO2) shows that, in the period of austral spring and summer, this region absorbs the atmospheric CO2, and becomes a stronger sink of CO2 throughout the years (from an overall average absorption of about 2 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2002/2003 to about 7 mmol CO2 m(-2) day(-1) in 2014/2015).																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	6					1600	1625		10.1080/01431161.2017.1286054								WOS:000394651500007						
J	Freitas, FH; Siegel, DA; Maritorena, S; Fields, E				Freitas, Fernanda Henderikx; Siegel, David A.; Maritorena, Stephane; Fields, Erik			Satellite assessment of particulate matter and phytoplankton variations in the Santa Barbara Channel and its surrounding waters: Role of surface waves	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Satellite observations of chlorophyll in coastal waters are often described in terms of changes in productivity in response to regional upwelling processes while optical backscattering coefficients are more often linked to episodic inputs of suspended sediments from storm runoff. Here we show that the surface gravity wave resuspension of sediments has a larger role in controlling backscatter than previously considered. Almost 18 years of SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS, and VIIRS satellite imagery of the Santa Barbara Channel, California and its surrounding waters spectrally merged with the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena bio-optical model were used to assess the controls on suspended particle distributions. Analysis revealed that chlorophyll blooms in the warmer portions of the domain occur in phase with SST minima, usually in early spring, while blooms in the cooler regions lag SST minima and occur simultaneously to the strongest equatorward winds every year, often in the summer. Tight coupling between the optical variables was seen in offshore areas, as expected for productive waters. However, values of backscatter near the coast were primarily modulated by surface waves. This relationship holds throughout all seasons and is stronger within the 100 m isobath, but often extends tens of kilometers offshore. This forcing of particle resuspension by surface waves is likely a feature ubiquitous in all coastal oceans characterized by fine sediments. The implication of surface wave processes determining suspended particle loads far beyond the surf zone has large consequences for the interpretation of satellite ocean color signals in coastal waters and potentially redefines the extent of the littoral zone.

Analysis of Satellite SST Images of the Southeastern Baltic Sea	WATER RESOURCES												The results of comparative analysis of sea surface temperature variations along horizontal sections in the coastal zone are given. The data used had been taken by MODIS spectroradiometers (Aqua, Terra) in the Southeastern Baltic, in periods of coastal upwelling-in the periods of autumn differential cooling over coastal continental slopes (facilitating water subsidence along these slopes). Studying 135 SST images of coastal upwelling events in May-October 2000-2014 and four cooling events in October-November 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2009 revealed the specific features of the shape of horizontal temperature profiles on sea surface along sections over coastal continental slopes. In addition to the higher differences between water surface temperatures in the deep and coastal parts of the sea (up to 14 degrees C), upwelling features an appreciable distance from the cold-water core to the coast (up to 3-15 km) and a variable shape of horizontal profiles of water temperature on the sea surface along the sections. Conversely, during autumn differential cooling, water temperature difference on the surface is relatively small, the shape of the dependence of surface water temperature on the distance to the shore does not change over time, varies only slightly with the alongshore displacement of the section, and shows low sensitivity to bathymetry and even to wind effect. Thus, the analysis of the shape of the temperature on the sea surface along horizontal sections over coastal continental slopes enables the diagnostics of the regime of vertical water exchange in the coastal zone.

Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal ((w)) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. (w) relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7%. Despite some inaccuracies in (w) retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries' monitoring networks provided satisfactory results. The multi-sensor approach together with the multi-conditional algorithm presented here can be applied to the latest generation of ocean color sensors (namely Sentinel2/MSI and Sentinel3/OLCI) to study SPM dynamics in the coastal ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

The developed intelligent system consists of two main parts. The first part is a heuristic feature selection algorithm used for processing a database to select the most effective features. The second part is a hierarchical selective ensemble randomized neural network (HSE-RNN) that is used to create a nonlinear map between the selected features and sea-ice thickness. The required data for processing have been collected from two sensors, i.e. moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS), and advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth (AMSR-E) observing system. To evaluate the computational advantages of the proposed intelligent framework, it is given brightness temperatures data captured at two different frequencies (low frequency, 6.9GHz, and high frequency, 36.5GHz) in addition to both atmospheric and oceanic variables from forecasting models. The obtained results demonstrate the computational power of the developed intelligent algorithm for the estimation of sea-ice thickness along the Labrador coast.																	0924-669X	1573-7497				JAN	2017	46	1					16	33		10.1007/s10489-016-0815-x								WOS:000392405700002

The optical remote-sensing data with 250 m resolution acquired by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during 2002-2011 were used for statistical characterization of sea ice. A method based on bimodal histogram analysis of remote-sensing reflectance data was developed to discriminate ice from water. In general, ice extent information obtained from MODIS data agrees with the official ice chart data (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in situ measurements) and multi-sensor product containing data from microwave and infrared instruments (R-2>0.83). However, in case of severe winters and extremely mild winters there are differences in the dates when maximum ice extent is registered. MODIS data can be used for detailed analysis of ice extent in specific basins of Baltic Sea. Depending on the year, the ice season length in the Gulf of Riga ranged from 68 to 146 days, and the maximum ice extent varied greatly from 329 to 15,350 km(2). SIOP and number of ice days increased significantly in areas where the depth is less than 15 m. Based on negative-degree days and ice cover characteristics (SIOP and ice season length), three winter scenarios were defined: severe (2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011), medium (2004 and 2005), and mild (2007, 2008, and 2009).																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	3					617	638		10.1080/01431161.2016.1268734								WOS:000390870600001

This study evaluated the potential of an oyster Suitability Sites Occurrence Model (SSOM) to predict the status of littoral areas in the future due to sea warming. Data sources comprised Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 7 ETM+. The suitable sites were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 5 (most suitable). In the suitability model, score 5 had the highest proportion (35.8%) of oyster suitability which shrank to 16.2% with a 4 degrees C increase in sea temperature. Future increases in sea temperature are likely to cause shrinkage in the spatial extent of most suitable and suitable oyster sites. Thus changes in marine oyster suitability in littoral zones are predicted to worsen gradually as sea temperatures increase in the future. Differences in the recorded sea temperature of <= 6 degrees C within and between sites may influence spatial variations in oyster habitat due to future sea warming. Such concepts could form an alternative scientific basis for quantification of potential global climate change effects on biodiversity for marine systems policy adaptation analysis, aquaculture potential, and management.

Observations were obtained with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua). These four blooms were delineated by combining remote-sensing reflectance at 555 nm and normalized fluorescence line height. In 2004 and 2005, the WFS was affected by several hurricanes, including the category 5 storm Hurricane Katrina. These hurricanes led to increased river discharge and vertical mixing which favored bloom intensification and dispersion. No hurricanes passed over the WSF in 2006; however, storms in south Florida may have aided bloom intensification via increased river discharge. In 2011, a bloom appeared off Venice, Florida, where several small creeks discharge. The bloom moved south toward Charlotte Harbor where it intensified and lingered for several months as it received nutrients from riverine discharge and upwelling events. While it is difficult to identify initiation stages of a K. brevis bloom (< similar to 50; 000 cells L-1) using satellite imagery, the techniques used here provide information about bloom evolution (size, duration, and advection) and insight into factors affecting bloom dynamics.

Microphysical and optical characteristics of these clouds were studied as well as the impact of aerosols on these properties. Microphysical and optical cloud properties were derived using the algorithm SYRSOC (SYnergistic Remote Sensing Of Clouds). Ground-based in situ measurements of aerosol concentrations and the transport path of air masses at cloud level were investigated as well. The cloud properties were studied in dependence of the prevailing air mass at cloud level and season. We found higher cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) and smaller effective radii (r(eff)) with greater pollution. Median CDNC ranged from 60 cm(-3) in marine air masses to 160 cm(-3) in continental air. Median reff ranged from 8 mu m in polluted conditions to 10 mu m in marine air. Effective droplet size distributions were broader in marine than in continental cases. Cloud optical thickness (COT) and albedo were lower in cleaner air masses and higher in more polluted conditions, with medians ranging from 2.1 to 4.9 and 0.22 to 0.39, respectively. However, calculation of COT and albedo was strongly affected by liquid water path (LWP) and departure from adiabatic conditions. A comparison of SYRSOC results with MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations showed large differences for LWP and COT but good agreement for reff with a linear fit with slope near 1 and offset of -1 mu m.

The observation dataset includes observatory data, cloud-top temperature from MODIS, GPS sonde, and data from the Integrated Observation Platform for Marine Meteorology (IOPMM). The simulations are based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with four distinct parameter settings. Both the observations and simulations focus on the characteristics of the fog extent, boundary layer structure, and meteorological elements near the air-sea interface. Our main results are as follows: (1) The extent of mesoscale sea fog can be well simulated when the sea surface temperature has at least 0.5x0.5 horizontal resolution. (2) To accurately model the vertical structure of the sea fog, particularly the surface-based inversion, vertical levels must be added in the boundary layer. (3) When these model conditions are met, the simulations faithfully reproduce the measured downward shortwave radiation, downward longwave radiation, and surface sensible heat flux during the sea fog period.																	1006-8775					DEC	2016	22	4					497	507		10.16555/j.1006-8775.2016.04.005								WOS:000391740100005

Quantifying the human influence on fire ignition across the western USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Humans have a profound effect on fire regimes by increasing the frequency of ignitions. Although ignition is an integral component of understanding and predicting fire, to date fire models have not been able to isolate the ignition location, leading to inconsistent use of anthropogenic ignition proxies. Here, we identified fire ignitions from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Burned Area Product (2000-2012) to create the first remotely sensed, consistently derived, and regionally comprehensive fire ignition data set for the western United States. We quantified the spatial relationships between several anthropogenic land-use/disturbance features and ignition for ecoregions within the study area and used hierarchical partitioning to test how the anthropogenic predictors of fire ignition vary among ecoregions. The degree to which anthropogenic features predicted ignition varied considerably by ecoregion, with the strongest relationships found in the Marine West Coast Forest and North American Desert ecoregions. Similarly, the contribution of individual anthropogenic predictors varied greatly among ecoregions. Railroad corridors and agricultural presence tended to be the most important predictors of anthropogenic ignition, while population density and roads were generally poor predictors. Although human population has often been used as a proxy for ignitions at global scales, it is less important at regional scales when more specific land uses (e.g., agriculture) can be identified. The variability of ignition predictors among ecoregions suggests that human activities have heterogeneous impacts in altering fire regimes within different vegetation types and geographies.

J	Herrera, GV				Herrera, Graciela Velasco			Mexican forest fires and their decadal variations	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												A high forest fire season of two to three years is regularly observed each decade in Mexican forests. This seems to be related to the presence of the El Nino phenomenon and to the amount of total solar irradiance. In this study, the results of a multi-cross wavelet analysis are reported based on the occurrence of Mexican forest fires, El Nino and the total solar irradiance for the period 1970-2014. The analysis shows that Mexican forest fires and the strongest El Nino phenomena occur mostly around the minima of the solar cycle. This suggests that the total solar irradiance minima provide the appropriate climatological conditions for the occurrence of these forest fires. The next high season for Mexican forest fires could start in the next solar minimum, which will take place between the years 2017 and 2019. A complementary space analysis based on MODIS active fire data for Mexican forest fires from 2005 to 2014 shows that most of these fires occur in cedar and pine forests, on savannas and pasturelands, and in the central jungles of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

However, the use of these data for near-shore habitats is hindered by the proximity of the coast, therefore further investigation is needed. We compared remote-sensing SST from the MODIS sensor (aboard the Aqua satellite) to near-shore seawater temperature (ST) recorded in situ with data loggers at 5 locations in the western Mediterranean Sea. In situ ST data were collected at 5 m depth over a similar to 6 yr period and at depths below 5 m at 3 of the locations. We evaluated the suitability of MODIS to represent the temperature at shallow subtidal depths relative to different modes of variability. MODIS reproduced seasonal variability with high correlations (r > 0.98) and biases (0.59 +/- 0.03 degrees C) only slightly higher than the accuracy of the loggers (0.50 degrees C). MODIS also captured interannual variability with no systematic biases. When evaluated for intra-seasonal temperature variability, MODIS showed limited biases (up to 0.79 degrees C) with a tendency to overestimate the variability (between 4 and 64%) in both cold and warm seasons. Finally, MODIS over-/underestimated only the most extreme unseasonably cold/warm events (by 1.51 and -0.79 degrees C, respectively). The observed limited differences between the 2 methods can be explained by the particular hydro dynamics of the area and by methodological constraints. Overall, MODIS SST data proved to be a reliable proxy for near-shore ST in the western Mediterranean Sea, and are thus considered suitable for studies requiring temperature reconstruction in shallow near-shore environments.

MODIS-Aqua OC3M Chla concentrations showed a high correlation with the in situ data with slope close to unity and low root mean square error. In comparison, the ROMS model underestimated Chla, though the correlation was significant indicating that the model is capable of reproducing the trend in in situ Chla. Time Series trends in Chla were examined against wind driven Upwelling Indices (UIW) from April 2009 to December 2012 in north-eastern (Gujarat) and south-eastern (Kochi) coastal waters of the Arabian Sea. The annual peak in Chla along the Kochi coast during the summer monsoon was adequately captured by the model. It is well known that the peak in surface Chla along the Kochi and Gujarat coasts during the summer monsoon is the result of coastal upwelling, which the ROMS model was able to reproduce accurately. The maximum surface Chla along the Gujarat coast during the winter monsoon is due to convective mixing, which was also significantly captured by ROMS biophysical model. There was a lag of approximately one week between the maximum surface Chla and the peak in the Upwelling Index. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Citizen-based contributions can fill observational gaps and increase environmental stewardship amongst the public. For this purpose, tools and methods for citizen science need to (1) complement existing datasets; and (2) be affordable, while appealing to different user and developer groups. In this article, tools and methods developed in the 7th Framework Programme of European Union (EU FP 7) funded project Citclops (citizens' observatories for coast and ocean optical monitoring) are reviewed. Tools range from a stand-alone smartphone app to devices with Arduino and 3-D printing, and hence are attractive to a diversity of users; from the general public to more specified maker-and open labware movements. Standardization to common water quality parameters and methods allows long-term storage in regular marine data repositories, such as SeaDataNet and EMODnet, thereby providing open data access. Due to the given intercomparability to existing remote sensing datasets, these tools are ready to complement the marine datapool. In the future, such combined satellite and citizen observations may set measurements by the engaged public in a larger context and hence increase their individual meaning. In a wider sense, a synoptic use can support research, management authorities, and societies at large.				van der Woerd, Hans/K-9812-2013; Simon, Carine/L-1219-2014	van der Woerd, Hans/0000-0002-8901-7567; Simon, Carine/0000-0001-9951-5132; Bardaji, Raul/0000-0002-0803-3427; Piera, Jaume/0000-0001-5818-9836; Wernand, Marcel R./0000-0002-1331-9569												2072-4292					NOV	2016	8	11							879	10.3390/rs8110879								WOS:000388798400001

Variability in aerosol distribution and properties, as might result from changing emissions and transport processes, must be characterized. In this study, variations in aerosol loading across the eastern seaboard of the United States and the North Atlantic Ocean during 2002 to 2012 are analyzed to examine the impacts of anthropogenic emission control measures using monthly mean data from MODIS, AERONET, and IMPROVE observations and Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model simulation. MODIS observes a statistically significant negative trend in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the midlatitudes (-0.030 decade(-1)). Correlation analyses with surface AOD from AERONET sites in the upwind region combined with trend analysis from GOCART component AOD confirm that the observed decrease in the midlatitudes is chiefly associated with anthropogenic aerosols that exhibit significant negative trends from the eastern U.S. coast extending over the western North Atlantic. Additional analysis of IMPROVE surface PM2.5 observations demonstrates statistically significant negative trends in the anthropogenic components with decreasing mass concentrations over the eastern United States. Finally, a seasonal analysis of observational datasets is performed. The negative trend seen by MODIS is strongest during spring (MAM) and summer (JJA) months. This is supported by AERONET seasonal trends and is identified from IMPROVE seasonal trends as resulting from ammonium sulfate decreases during these seasons.

J	Bai, P; Gu, YZ; Li, PL; Wu, KJ				Bai Peng; Gu Yanzhen; Li Peiliang; Wu Kejian			Modelling the upwelling offthe east Hainan Island coast in summer 2010	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												A synoptic-scale upwelling event that developed offthe east coast of the Hainan Island (EHIU) in the summer of 2010 is defined well via processing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea surface temperature (SST) data. The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with high spatial resolution has been used to investigate this upwelling event. By comparing the ROMS results against tide station data, Argo float profiles and MODIS SST, it is confirmed that the ROMS reproduces the EHIU well. The cooler-water core (CWC) distinguished by waters < 27.5A degrees C in the EHIU, which occurred in the east Qiongzhou Strait mouth area and was bounded by a high temperature gradient, was the focus of this paper. Vertical structure of the CWC suggests that interaction between the westward flow and the bathymetry slope played a significant role in the formation of CWC. Numerical experiments indicated that the westward flow in the Qiongzhou Strait was the result of tidal rectification over variable topography (Shi et al., 2002), thus tides played a critical role on the development of the CWC. The negative wind stress curl that dominated the east Qiongzhou Strait mouth area suppressed the intensity of the CWC by 0.2-0.4A degrees C. Further, nonlinear interaction between tidal currents and wind stress enhanced vertical mixing greatly, which would benefit the development of the CWC.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				NOV	2016	34	6					1358	1373		10.1007/s00343-016-5147-5								WOS:000382885200020

Satellite measurements and images, NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) model products were also used in this study. Results showed that in 49 % of cases, cyclonic circulations over the Middle East deserts were the main transporter of dust particles into the atmosphere where then transferred to the SCRCS by southerly winds over the Alborz mountains in the lower troposphere and by westerly waves in the middle and upper troposphere. During the warm seasons, the surface heating lead to the development of mesoscale thermal low pressures over the hot deserts on the eastern regions of the Caspian Sea, like Turkmenistan and Qura Qum. Those heat lows were responsible for the 38% of the occurred events. Turbulence and instabilities in the lower troposphere were identified as the second important dust emitter to the atmosphere where those dust particles transported to the SCRCS with the strong northeasterly wind. The third pattern by 13 % of cases was belonging to the mesoscale thermal low pressure that was developed over the arid regions of Iran like Dasht-e-Kavir. Because of the nature of the turbulence in the lower troposphere and heat lows, the ascent of dust particles by these two mechanisms was limited to a shallow layer in the troposphere. The results of simulation with the WRF-CHEM model, analysis of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, and spatial zoning of atmospheric optical depth (AOD) confirmed the results of the synoptic study.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				OCT	2016	9	15							649	10.1007/s12517-016-2670-9								WOS:000385130200001

Performance of operational satellite bio-optical algorithms in different water types in the southeastern Arabian Sea	OCEANOLOGIA												The in situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and optically active substances (OAS) measured using hyperspectral radiometer, were used for optical classification of coastal waters in the southeastern Arabian Sea. The spectral R-rs showed three distinct water types, that were associated with the variability in OAS such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and volume scattering function at 650 nm (beta(650)). The water types were classified as Type-I, Type-II and Type-III respectively for the three R-rs spectra. The Type-I waters showed the peak R-rs in the blue band (470 nm), whereas in the case of Type-II and III waters the peak R-rs was at 560 and 570 nm respectively. The shifting of the peak R-rs at the longer wavelength was due to an increase in concentration of OAS. Further, we evaluated six bio-optical algorithms (OC3C, OC4O, OC4, OC4E, OC3M and OC4O2) used operationally to retrieve chl-a from Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS), Ocean Colour Temperature Scanner (OCTS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of- view Sensor (SeaWiFS), MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM2). For chl-a concentration greater than 1.0 mg m(-3), algorithms based on the reference band ratios 488/510/520 nm to 547/550/555/560/565 nm have to be considered. The assessment of algorithms showed better performance of OC3M and OC4. All the algorithms exhibited better performance in Type-I waters. However, the performance was poor in Type-II and Type-III waters which could be attributed to the significant co-variance of chl-a with CDOM.

Also, some coastal systems are characterized by the occurrence of large amounts of mucilaginous material of biologic origin (i.e. phytoplankton, bacteria), which aggregates and potentially traps other organisms and particles present in the water column. This study focuses on POM origin and spatio-temporal dynamics in the South-East coast of the Bay of Biscay, an area subject to mucilage occurrence. In order to investigate POM quantitative and qualitative (C and N elemental and isotopic ratios) characteristics, sampling was performed over an annual cycle at two sites experiencing different mucilage occurrence and river influence. Contribution of phytoplankton, terrestrial POM and anthropogenic POM to coastal-POM composition was calculated using a three-sources mixing model. Overall, phytoplankton dominated the coastal-POM composition at all seasons, sites and most of the depths (71.6 +/- 24.2%). Terrestrial-POM contribution was moderate (22.7 +/- 21.8%) and anthropogenic-POM contribution was usually negligible (5.7 +/- 7.4%). Both sites mainly exhibited similar vertical and temporal variations in terms of POM origin and dynamics: terrestrial-POM contribution increased with depth and was higher in winter at all depths and in autumn in bottom waters, compared to other seasons. The main differences between both sites were related to the vertical dynamics of the terrestrial contribution to the coastal POM. Horizontal, vertical and temporal variation of POM composition was linked to processes driving the sedimentary hydrodynamics: the river flow, the direction of the river plume and events of sediment resuspension/deposition. During the study period, the mucilage occurred only as flocs (small aggregates). The mucilage was of autochthonous origin and did not trap detectable amount of allochthonous material.

In order to clarify some of these processes, the "Algerian BAsin Circulation Unmanned Survey-ABACUS" project was proposed and realized through access to the JERICO Trans National Access (TNA) infrastructure between September and December 2014. In this framework, a deep glider cruise was carried out in the area between the Balearic Islands and the Algerian coast to establish a repeat line for monitoring of the basin circulation. During the mission a mesoscale eddy, identified on satellite altimetry maps, was sampled at high-spatial horizontal resolution (4 km) along its main axes and from the surface to 1000 m depth. Data were collected by a Slocum glider equipped with a pumped CTD and biochemical sensors that collected about 100 complete casts inside the eddy. In order to describe the structure of the eddy, in situ data were merged with next generation remotely sensed data: daily synoptic sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a) images from the MODIS satellites, as well as sea surface height and geostrophic velocities from AVISO. From its origin along the Algerian coast in the eastern part of the basin, the eddy propagated northwest at a mean speed of about 4 km/day, with a mean diameter of 112-130 km, mean amplitude of 15.7 cm; the eddy was clearly distinguished from the surrounding waters thanks to its higher SST and Chl-a values. Temperature and salinity values over the water column confirm the origin of the eddy from the Algerian Current (AC) showing the presence of recent Atlantic water in the surface layer and Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) in the deeper layer. The eddy footprint is clearly evident in the multiparametric vertical sections conducted along its main axis. Deepening of temperature, salinity and density isolines at the center of the eddy is associated with variations in Chl-a, oxygen concentration and turbidity patterns. In particular, at 50 m depth along the eddy borders, Chl-a values are higher (1.1-5.2 mu g/l) in comparison with the eddy center (0.5-0.7 mu g/l) with maximum values found in the southeastern sector of the eddy. Calculation of geostrophic velocities along transects and vertical quasi-geostrophic velocities (QG-w) over a regular 5 km grid from the glider data helped to describe the mechanisms and functioning of the eddy. QG-w presents an asyminetric pattern, with relatively strong downwelling in the western part of the eddy and upwelling in the southeastern part. This asymmetry in the vertical velocity pattern, which brings LIW into the euphotic layer as well as advection from the northeastern sector of the eddy, may explain the observed increases in Chl-a values.

J	Jo, YH; Kim, HC; Son, S; Kim, D				Jo, Young-Heon; Kim, Hyun-Cheol; Son, Seunghyun; Kim, Dohoon			Analysis of the timing of phase changes in the chlorophyll concentration in the East/Japan Sea	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Geographically heterogeneous linear and non-linear chlorophyll-a (CHL) trends in the East Sea/Japan Sea (EJS) region were analyzed based on monthly mean Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) CHL data from January 2003 to December 2012. The non-linear trends were derived from the residuals of decomposed CHL time series using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). To understand the general spatial and temporal variability of the non-linear CHL trends, a complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) was employed. The first two CEOF modes indicate that an upward CHL trend occurred in 2007 with 95.6% variance, whereas a downward CHL trend occurred in 2009 with 4.1% variance. Furthermore, the specific timing of the phase changes in CHL was calculated based on upward or downward non-linear trends of CHL for six major regions of interests. To examine the dominant forces in phase changes in CHL, the Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (MEI) was used. We determined that the local turning patterns of CHL over the last ten years were closely related to changes in ENSO events, which were also associated with changes in the total amount of fish catches off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. These results also suggest that the short-term total amount of fish catches may be predictable based on the remotely sensed non-linear CHL observations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rondeau-Genesse, G; Trudel, M; Leconte, R				Rondeau-Genesse, Gabriel; Trudel, Melanie; Leconte, Robert			Monitoring snow wetness in an Alpine Basin using combined C-band SAR and MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

MODIS L3 monthly composite data for both chlorophyll and SST of two consecutive years 2012 and 2013 were investigated to see the aftereffects of cyclone on these two parameters. Generally, during a cyclone vertical mixing of the water column uplifts nutrients to mixed layer depth that results in the increase in chlorophyll-a and decrease in sea surface temperature (SST). In this study a substantial increase in mean chlorophyll was observed in October, 2013 in comparison to 2012 (no severe cyclone was reported in Orissa-West Bengal coast). However, no significant change in SST was observed. Mean chlorophyll concentration in October 2012 was 3.12 +/- 1.97 mg m(-3), however, in October, 2013 it increased to 4.50 +/- 2.09 mg m(-3). Following this event, a huge increase in fish catch and Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) were also observed. Mean CPUE in October 2012 and 2013 was observed as 9.04 +/- 4.70 and 18.63 +/- 11.54 respectively. This increase in CPUE after cyclone Phailin might be due to enhanced productivity.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				SEP	2016	45	9					1094	1097										WOS:000389786800004

Although the timing and magnitude of high turbidity water export affect the coastal marine environment, for example, through impacts on biological productivity, little is known about the characteristics of this high turbidity water. In this paper, we therefore report on the spatial and temporal variations in high turbidity water off the Thule region in northwestern Greenland, based on remote sensing, reflectance data at a wavelength of 555 nm (Rrs555). The high turbidity area, identified on the basis of high reflectivity (Rrs555 >= 0.0070 sr(-1)), was generally distributed near the coast, where many outlet glaciers terminate in the ocean and on land. The extent of the high turbidity area exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variability, and its annual maximum extent was significantly correlated with summer air temperature. Assuming a linear relationship between the high turbidity area and summer temperature, annual maximum extent increases under the influence of increasing glacial meltwater discharge, as can be inferred from present and predicted future warming trends.

The sediment dispersal pattern and the annual net sediment flux presented evident seasonal variability. During wintertime, the prevailing strong northerly winds and the related high wave heights resuspended the sediment along the coast of the Huanghe Delta that was transported into the Laizhou Bay along its western coast and exported to the Bohai Strait through the eastern Laizhou Bay as enhanced by the coastal current. The wintertime contributed approximately 4.84 Mt of suspended sediment flux to the Yellow Sea, as higher than the flux in summertime by one order. In summertime, the less energetic environment together with the stratified water column was unfavorable to the sediment export to the Yellow Sea. As a result, the sediment delivered by the Huanghe to the sea in summertime mostly accumulated within the subaqueous delta, which acted as a primary source of sediment export to the Yellow Sea in wintertime.

Duncan			Dynamics and controls of urban heat sink and island phenomena in a desert city: Development of a local climate zone scheme using remotely-sensed inputs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												This study aims to determine the dynamics and controls Of Surface Urban Heat Sinks (SUHS) and Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) in desert cities, using Dubai as a case study. A Local Climate Zone (LCZ) schema was developed to subdivide the city into different zones based on similarities in land cover and urban geometry. Proximity to the Gulf Coast was also determined for each LCZ. The LCZs were then used to sample seasonal and daily imagery from the MODIS thermal sensor to determine Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations relative to desert sand. Canonical correlation techniques were then applied to determine which factors explained the variability between urban and desert LST. Our results indicate that the daytime SUHS effect is greatest during the summer months (typically similar to 3.0 degrees C) with the strongest cooling effects in open high-rise zones of the city. In contrast, the night-time SUHI effect is greatest during the winter months (typically similar to 3.5 degrees C) with the strongest warming effects in compact mid-rise zones of the city. Proximity to the Arabian Gulf had the largest influence on both SUHS and SUHI phenomena, promoting daytime cooling in the summer months and night-time warming in the winter months. However, other parameters associated with the urban environment such as building height had an influence on daytime cooling, with larger buildings promoting shade and variations in airflow. Likewise, other parameters such as sky view factor contributed to night-time warming, with higher temperatures associated with limited views of the sky. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yi, KP; Bao, YL				Yi, Kunpeng; Bao, Yulong			Estimates of Wildfire Emissions in Boreal Forests of China	FORESTS												Wildfire emissions in the boreal forests yield an important contribution to the chemical budget of the troposphere. To assess the contribution of wildfire to the emissions of atmospheric trace species in the Great Xing'an Mountains (GXM), which is also the most severe fire-prone boreal forest region in China, we estimated various wildfire activities by combining explicit spatio-temporal remote sensing data with fire-induced emission models. We observed 9998 fire scars with 46,096 km(2) in the GXM between the years 1986 and 2010. The years 1987 and 2003 contributed 33.2% and 22.9%, respectively, in burned area during the 25 years. Fire activity is the strongest in May. Most large fires occurred in the north region of the GXM between 50 degrees N and 54 degrees N latitude due to much drier weather and higher fire danger in the northern region than in the southern region of the study domain. Evergreen and deciduous needleleaf forest and deciduous broadleaf forest are the main sources of emissions, accounting for 84%, 81%, 84%, 87%, 89%, 86%, 85% and 74% of the total annual CO2, CH4, CO, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, BC and NOx emissions, respectively. Wildfire emissions from shrub, grassland and cropland only account for a small fraction of the total emissions level (approximately 4%-11%). Comparisons of our results with other published estimates of wildfire emissions show reasonable agreement.																	1999-4907					AUG	2016	7	8							158	10.3390/f7080158								WOS:000382470000007

Emphasis is placed on the influence of climate fluctuations, namely El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). Additional satellite data on wind, boat-based hydrographic profiles, and regional climate indices are used to identify the influence of climate variability on the generation of anomalous turbid river plumes. The evolution of salinity at a coastal station on the 90 m isobath between the Itata and Biobio Rivers shows a freshwater surface layer with salinity <32.5 and 5-10 m thick during major plume events in 2002, 2005 and 2006. Surface salinity minima are correlated with peaks in turbidy from the normalized water leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw(555)), both representing turbid river plumes. EOF analysis reveals that major turbid plume events occurred primarily during warm phases of the ENSO and PDO, and negative phases of the AAO, when storm tracks are further north. Anomalously large turbid plumes extend long distances offshore (similar to 70-80 km), and individual plumes coalesce into a continuous plume along the coast that covers the entire continental shelf. Season-specific correlation analyses reveal an increased influence of the AAO on river plumes south of Punta Lavapie in spring-summer (negative correlation). North of this major cape, ENSO and PDO indices have a dominant influence on plumes with positive correlations with the nLw(555) signal in winter (and negative in summer). We discuss the biogeochemical implications of plume events and the importance of long-term and high-resolution ocean color observations for studying the temporal evolution of river plumes.

Changes in Sahelian annual vegetation growth and phenology since 1960: A modeling approach	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												In semi-arid areas like the Sahel, vegetation is particularly sensitive to climate variability and can play an important role in surface-atmosphere coupling. After a wet period extending from 1950 to 1970, the Sahel experienced a severe drought in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a partial recovery of rainfall and a "re-greening" of vegetation beginning in the 1990s. This study explores how the multidecadal variability of Sahelian rainfall and particularly the drought period have affected vegetation phenology and growth since 1960. The STEP model, which is specifically designed to simulate the Sahelian annual vegetation, including the dry season processes, is run over an area extending from 13 degrees N to 18 degrees N and from 20 degrees W to 20 degrees E. Mean values, interannual variability and phenological characteristics of the Sahelian annual grasslands simulated by STEP are in good agreement with MODIS derived production and phenology over the 2001-2014 period, which demonstrates the skill of the model and allows the analysis of vegetation changes and variability over the last 50 years. It was found that droughts in the 1970s and 1980s shortened the mean vegetation cycle and reduced its amplitude and that, despite the rainfall recovery since the 1990s, the current conditions for green and dry vegetation are still below pre-drought conditions. While the decrease in vegetation production has been largely homogeneous during droughts, vegetation recovery has been heterogeneous over the Sahel since 1990, with specific changes near the western coast and at the eastern edge of the West African monsoon area. Since 1970, the Sahel also experienced an increased interannual variability in vegetation mass and phenology. In terms of phenology, region-averaged End and Length of Season are the most variable, while maximum date and Start of Season are the least variable, although the latter displays a high variability locally.

GRADHIST - A method for detection and analysis of oceanic fronts from remote sensing data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Oceanic shelf sea fronts have significant effects on local dynamics, ecology and climate. An assessment of the impact of climate change on frontal positions and frontal gradients requires reliable reference data and the possibility to monitor oceanic fronts. Therefore, the development of algorithms which automatically detect frontal positions from Earth Observation (EO) data is an important tool to analyse long EO time series, i.e. to process big data volumes. The development of GRADHIST was driven by the need to generate a climatology for North Sea fronts. GRADHIST is a new algorithm for the detection and mapping of oceanic fronts, which is based on a combination and refinement of the gradient algorithm of Canny (1986) and the histogram algorithm of Cayula and Cornillon (1992). GRADHIST preserves the main principles of both algorithms and can be applied to various ocean parameters as well as to different sensors with very little effort. GRADHIST was validated and tested using both synthetic and real data and applied to sea surface temperature and ocean colour parameters retrieved from satellite data; i.e. data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer), AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer). Selected results and statistical analysis of a new North Sea climatology for oceanic fronts are presented and discussed.

J	Norris, PM; da Silva, AM				Norris, Peter M.; da Silva, Arlindo M.			Monte Carlo Bayesian inference on a statistical model of sub-gridcolumn moisture variability using high-resolution cloud observations. Part 2: Sensitivity tests and results	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Part 1 of this series presented a Monte Carlo Bayesian method for constraining a complex statistical model of global circulation model (GCM) sub-gridcolumn moisture variability using high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud data, thereby permitting parameter estimation and cloud data assimilation for large-scale models. This article performs some basic testing of this new approach, verifying that it does indeed reduce mean and standard deviation biases significantly with respect to the assimilated MODIS cloud optical depth, brightness temperature and cloud-top pressure and that it also improves the simulated rotational-Raman scattering cloud optical centroid pressure (OCP) against independent (non-assimilated) retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Of particular interest, the Monte Carlo method does show skill in the especially difficult case where the background state is clear but cloudy observations exist. In traditional linearized data assimilation methods, a subsaturated background cannot produce clouds via any infinitesimal equilibrium perturbation, but the Monte Carlo approach allows non-gradient-based jumps into regions of non-zero cloud probability. In the example provided, the method is able to restore marine stratocumulus near the Californian coast, where the background state has a clear swath. This article also examines a number of algorithmic and physical sensitivities of the new method and provides guidance for its cost-effective implementation. One obvious difficulty for the method, and other cloud data assimilation methods as well, is the lack of information content in passive-radiometer-retrieved cloud observables on cloud vertical structure, beyond cloud-top pressure and optical thickness, thus necessitating strong dependence on the background vertical moisture structure. It is found that a simple flow-dependent correlation modification from Riishojgaard provides some help in this respect, by better honouring inversion structures in the background state.																	0035-9009	1477-870X				JUL	2016	142	699	B				2528	2540		10.1002/qj.2844								WOS:000385367000026

Chronic, Anthropogenic Hydrocarbon Discharges in the Gulf of Mexico	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was used to obtain more precise estimates of the magnitude of the chronic hydrocarbon discharges described in qualitative pollution reports associated with the production and transportation network of the U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The National Response Center (NRCen) oil pollution reports were collected and filtered for the period of 2001 to 2012 to determine which of the reports coincided with archived SAR images. Some of the images covered multiple reports and some of the oil discharges described in one report could be observed in more than one image. In all, 177 reports could be investigated from 137 SAR images collected on or near the corresponding report dates. Further analysis found that oil slicks observed in 66 of these SAR images could be attributed to 67 of the reported incidents. Objective measurements indicated that the area of these transient oil slicks visible in SAR images was, on average, significantly larger than what was reported to the NRCen. The only recurring point source for oil slicks was the former site of the Taylor offshore platform. Here chronic, oil slicks were observed that were consistently much larger than other anthropogenic discharges. The SAR images of floating oil discharged from the Taylor site were verified by visual inspection from a boat and aerial photography. For some of the oil slicks discharged from the Taylor site, the accuracy of SAR images for detecting oil slick areas was validated by comparing SAR results to Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. These results show that surveillance by SAR would improve accuracy for estimates of chronic anthropogenic oil pollution, particularly where continuous discharges are on-going.

This study assessed aquaculture suitability sites using dominant indicators of marine ecological dynamics on Japanese scallop culture in Funka and Mutsu Bays, Japan as comparative examples. Data sources comprised of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), four dimensional-variational (4D-VAR) data assimilation system, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), in situ and buoy measurements. The suitable sites were ranked on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 8 (most suitable). In the most suitable sites in aquaculture operational areas, Funka Bay had a high proportion (51.1%) than Mutsu Bay (13.7%) for the best performed model. Peaks of aquaculture suitability scores were attributed to potential effects of currents. Extreme sea temperatures (>24 degrees C) in summer 2010 were associated with low performance of the 2010 model in Mutsu Bay and mortality of scallops based on sea temperature-depth visualizations. Future global warming effects are likely to decrease the most suitable culture sites in Funka Bay and loss of similar areas in Mutsu Bay. Thus, change in marine environment influences scallop culture development. Such concepts could form scientific basis for aquaculture planning on designated system of larval distribution and stock management of cultured species to minimize mortality and economic losses.

In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4-7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2-6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these -disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the -27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.																	2150-8925					JUN	2016	7	6							e01366	10.1002/ecs2.1366								WOS:000378523100028

The Sensitivity of SeaWiFS Ocean Color Retrievals to Aerosol Amount and Type	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												As atmospheric reflectance dominates top-of-the-atmosphere radiance over ocean, atmospheric correction is a critical component of ocean color retrievals. This paper explores the operational Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) algorithm atmospheric correction with similar to 13 000 coincident surface-based aerosol measurements. Aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD(440)) is overestimated for AOD below similar to 0.1-0.15 and is increasingly underestimated at higher AOD; also, single-scattering albedo (SSA) appears overestimated when the actual value <similar to 0.96. AOD(440) and its spectral slope tend to be overestimated preferentially for coarse-mode particles. Sensitivity analysis shows that changes in these factors lead to systematic differences in derived ocean water-leaving reflectance (R-rs) at 440 nm. The standard SeaWiFS algorithm compensates for AOD anomalies in the presence of nonabsorbing, medium-size-dominated aerosols. However, at low AOD and with absorbing aerosols, in situ observations and previous case studies demonstrate that retrieved R-rs is sensitive to spectral AOD and possibly also SSA anomalies. Stratifying the dataset by aerosol-type proxies shows the dependence of the AOD anomaly and resulting R-rs patterns on aerosol type, though the correlation with the SSA anomaly is too subtle to be quantified with these data. Retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl) are affected in a complex way by R-rs differences, and these effects occur preferentially at high and low Chl values. Absorbing aerosol effects are likely to be most important over biologically productive waters near coasts and along major aerosol transport pathways. These results suggest that future ocean color spacecraft missions aiming to cover the range of naturally occurring and anthropogenic aerosols, especially at wavelengths shorter than 440 nm, will require better aerosol amount and type constraints.

The aim of the study was to better understand the spatial and temporal variations in surface snow properties. Samples were collected twice daily during a traverse in 2007-08 to capture regional variability. Local variability was assessed by sampling in 10 x 10m grids (5m spacing) at selected locations. The particle size and shape distributions for each site were analysed through digital image analysis. Snow particle size variability is complex at different scales, and shows an internal variability of 0.18-3.31 mm depending on the sample type (surface, grid or pit). Relationships were verified between particle size and both elevation and distance to the coast (moisture source). Regional seasonal changes were also identified, particularly on the lower elevations of the polar plateau.

J	Fu, YZ; Xu, SG; Liu, JW				Fu, Yanzhao; Xu, Shiguo; Liu, Jianwei			Temporal-spatial variations and developing trends of Chlorophyll-a in the Bohai Sea, China	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The patterns of sea surface Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) have regional and dynamic features. An understanding of the Chl-a dynamics and whether its trends in the past will be persistent in the future is important for restoration of ecosystem. Spatial and temporal variations of sea surface Chl-a concentrations in the Bohai Sea were investigated with data remotely sensed by MODIS from 2003 to 2014. The goals of this research are to identify the phytoplankton dynamics and detect their correlation with environmental changes and anthropogenic activities. Based on an indicator system built with Mann-Kendall Test and Hurst Exponent, our research shows that the Chl-a concentration in the surface layer is heterogeneous in both temporal and spatial scale. It is higher in costal zones, particularly near the Qinhuangdao coast. The occurrence of spring and summer blooms has a one-month time lag from south to north. An increasing trend that was persistent is evident offshore and a decreasing trend that was persistent is seen near the coast, which may indicate an expansion of eutrophication from coast to deep sea. The seasonality of the phytoplankton bloom is basically driven by vertical structure of water column. Climate and mariculture activity are significant correlated with the Chl-a trends. River discharge and suspended sediment also influence Chl-a. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous approaches for the detection of KB HABs in the WFS primarily used observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS-A) satellite. They depended on the remote sensing reflectance signal at the 678 nm chlorophyll fluorescence band (Rrs678) needed for both the normalized fluorescence height (nFLH) and Red Band Difference algorithms (RBD) currently used. VIIRS which has replaced MODIS-A, unfortunately does not have a 678 nm fluorescence channel so we customized the NN approach to retrieve phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm (aph443) using only Rrs measurements from existing VIIRS channels at 486, 551 and 671 nm. The aph443 values in these retrieved VIIRS images, can in turn be correlated to chlorophyll-a concentrations [Chla] and KB cell counts. To retrieve KB values, the VIIRS NN retrieved aph443 images are filtered by applying limiting constraints, defined by (i) low backscatter at Rrs 551 nm and (ii) a minimum aph443 value known to be associated with KB HABs in the WFS. The resulting filtered residual images, are then used to delineate and quantify the existing KB HABs. Comparisons with KB HABs satellite retrievals obtained using other techniques, including nFLH, as well as with in situ measurements reported over a four year period, confirm the viability of the NN technique, when combined with the filtering constraints devised, for effective detection of KB HABs.																	2072-4292					MAY	2016	8	5							377	10.3390/rs8050377								WOS:000378406400021						
J	Kim, DW; Jo, YH; Choi, JK; Choi, JG; Bi, HS				Kim, Dae-Won; Jo, Young-Heon; Choi, Jong-Kuk; Choi, Jang-Geun; Bi, Hongsheng			Physical processes leading to the development of an anomalously large Cochlodinium polykrikoides bloom in the East sea/Japan sea	HARMFUL ALGAE												An anomalously large Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) was observed in the southwest coast of the East/Japan Sea (hereafter the East Sea) during the summer of 2013. During this time period, the presence of Cochlodinium polykrikoides (C polykrikoides) was detected by the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and validated by in-situ observations. GOCI observations have been available since 2011, thus allowing to examine various stages of the physical condition of the developing C polykrikoides bloom, there by other multi-satellite and buoy measurements obtained between 2011 and 2013. Research results indicate that this HAB is related to four processes: the transport of C polykrikoides from the south coast of Korea to the HAB area; a relatively high insolation; continuous coastal upwelling; and a favorable Sea Surface Temperature (SST) for C.polykrikoide growth. In examination of the main transport mechanisms, geostrophic current measurements were used to estimate the flow trajectories, showing water from the south coast to the HAB area off the southeast coast of Korea. Result shows that ninety percent of the water from the south coast reached the HAB area in 2013. Furthermore, to examine the insolation mechanism, the Photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) value was derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer(MODIS), showing that PAR values were relatively high in the HAB area during HAB period (47 Ein m(-1) day(-1)). Moreover, Upwelling age (UA) was calculated in order to investigate the strength of coastal upwelling events, which were found to support relatively high UA values during the HAB period. The mean UA value during the HAB period was 1.01, higher than those in 2011 and 2012 which were 0.61 and 0.76, respectively. Finally, SST in the HAB area was also analyzed to examine which conditions were most favorable for HAB growth. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the four mechanisms can explain the relative contributions of the anomalously HAB development observed off the southeast coast of Korea.

Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Cloud Cover and Fog Inundation in Coastal California: Ecological Implications	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in coastal California where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during otherwise warm and dry summer months. Summer fog and stratus can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets and often have different spatial and temporal patterns. Here, this study uses remote sensing datasets to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of cloud cover over California's northern Channel Islands. The authors found marine stratus to be persistent from May to September across the years 2001-12. Stratus clouds were both most frequent and had the greatest spatial extent in July. Clouds typically formed in the evening and dissipated by the following early afternoon. This study presents a novel method to downscale satellite imagery using atmospheric observations and discriminate patterns of fog from those of stratus and help explain patterns of fog deposition previously studied on the islands. The outcomes of this study contribute significantly to the ability to quantify the occurrence of coastal fog at biologically meaningful spatial and temporal scales that can improve the understanding of cloud-ecosystem interactions, species distributions, and coastal ecohydrology.

Impact of Land-Use and Land-Cover Change on urban air quality in representative cities of China	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												The atmospheric particulate pollution in China is getting worse. Land-Use and Land-Cover Change (LUCC) is a key factor that affects atmospheric particulate pollution. Understanding the response of particulate pollution to LUCC is necessary for environmental protection. Eight representative cities in China, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Urumqi were selected to analyze the relationship between particulate pollution and LUCC. The MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) aerosol product (MOD04) was used to estimate atmospheric particulate pollution for nearly 10 years, from 2001 to 2010. Six land-use types, water, woodland, grassland, cultivated land, urban, and unused land, were obtained from the MODIS land cover product (MOD12), where the LUCC of each category was estimated. The response of particulate pollution to LUCC was analyzed from the above mentioned two types of data. Moreover, the impacts of time-lag and urban type changes on particulate pollution were also considered. Analysis results showed that due to natural factors, or human activities such as urban sprawl or deforestation, etc., the response of particulate pollution to LUCC shows obvious differences in different areas. The correlation between particulate pollution and LUCC is lower in coastal areas but higher in inland areas. The dominant factor affecting urban air quality in LUCC changes from ocean, to woodland, to urban land, and eventually into grassland or unused land when moving from the coast to inland China.

In Saadiyat and Ras Ghanada reefs similar to 40% of the corals showed signs of bleaching. In contrast, only 15% of the corals were affected on Delma reef. Bleaching threshold temperatures for these sites were established using remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data recorded by MODIS-Aqua. The calculated threshold temperatures varied between locations (34.48 degrees C, 34.55 degrees C, 35.05 degrees C), resulting in site-specific deviations in the numbers of days during which these thresholds were exceeded. Hence, the less severe bleaching of Delma reef might be explained by the lower relative heat stress experienced by this coral community. However, the dominance of Porites spp. that is associated with the long-term exposure of Delma reef to elevated temperatures, as well as the more pristine setting may have additionally contributed to the higher coral bleaching threshold for this site.

Seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of suspended sediment at the mouth of the Amazon river: The role of continental and oceanic forcing, and implications for coastal geomorphology and mud bank formation	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Fine-grained sediments supplied to the Ocean by the Amazon River and their transport under the influence of continental and oceanic forcing drives the geomorphic change along the 1500 km-long coast northward to the Orinoco River delta. The aim of this study is to give an encompassing view of the sediment dynamics in the shallow coastal waters from the Amazon River mouth to the Capes region (northern part of the Amapa region of Brazil and eastern part of French Guiana), where large mud banks are formed. Mud banks are the overarching features in the dynamics of the Amazon-Orinoco coast. They start migrating northward in the Capes region. Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations were calculated from satellite products (MODIS Aqua and Terra) acquired over the period 2000-2013. The Census-X11 decomposition method used to discriminate short-term, seasonal and long-term time components of the SPM variability has rendered possible a robust analysis of the impact of continental and oceanic forcing. Continental forcing agents considered are the Amazon River water discharge, SPM concentration and sediment discharge. Oceanic forcing comprises modelled data of wind speed and direction, wave height and direction, and currents. A 150 km-long area of accretion is detected at Cabo Norte that may be linked with a reported increase in the river's sediment discharge concurrent with the satellite data study period. We also assess the rate of mud bank migration north of Cabo Norte, and highlight its variability. Although we confirm a 2 km y(-1) migration rate, in agreement with other authors, we show that this velocity may be up to 5 km y(-1) along the Cabo Orange region, and we highlight the effect of water discharge by major rivers debouching on this coastal mud belt in modulating such rates. Finally, we propose a refined sediment transport pattern map of the region based on our results and of previous studies in the area such as the AMASSEDS programme, and discuss the relationship between sediment transport and accumulation patterns and the coastal geomorphology of this region.

Kipp; Barth, John A.; Tufillaro, Nicholas			Optics of the offshore Columbia River plume from glider observations and satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The Columbia River (CR) is the largest source of freshwater along the U.S. Pacific coast. The resultant plume is often transported southward and offshore forming a large buoyant feature off Oregon and northern California in spring-summer-the offshore CR plume. Observations from autonomous underwater gliders and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery are used to characterize the optics of the offshore CR plume off Newport, Oregon. Vertical sections, under contrasting river flow conditions, reveal a low-salinity and warm surface layer of similar to 20-25 m (fresher in spring and warmer in summer), high Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) concentration, and backscatter, and associated with the base of the plume high chlorophyll fluorescence. Plume characteristics vary in the offshore direction as the warm and fresh surface layer thickens progressively to an average 30-40 m of depth 270-310 km offshore; CDOM, backscatter, and chlorophyll fluorescence decrease in the upper 20 m and increase at subsurface levels (30-50 m depth). MODIS normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw(lambda)) spectra for CR plume cases show enhanced water-leaving radiance at green bands (as compared to no-CR plume cases) up to similar to 154 km from shore. Farther offshore, the spectral shapes for both cases are very similar, and consequently, a contrasting color signature of low-salinity plume water is practically imperceptible from ocean color remote sensing. Empirical algorithms based on multivariate regression analyses of nLw(lambda) plus SST data produce more accurate results detecting offshore plume waters than previous studies using single visible bands (e.g., a(dg)(412) or nLw(555)).

Response of SO2 and particulate air pollution to local and regional emission controls: A case study in Maryland	EARTHS FUTURE												This paper addresses the questions of what effect local regulations can have on pollutants with different lifetimes and how surface observations and remotely sensed data can be used to determine the impacts. We investigated the decadal trends of tropospheric sulfur dioxide (SO2) and aerosol pollution over Maryland and its surrounding states, using surface, aircraft, and satellite measurements. Aircraft measurements indicated fewer isolated SO2 plumes observed in summers, a similar to 40% decrease of column SO2, and a similar to 20% decrease of atmospheric optical depth (AOD) over Maryland after the implementation of local regulations on sulfur emissions from power plants (similar to 90% reduction from 2010). Surface observations of SO2 and particulate matter ( PM) concentrations in Maryland show similar trends. OMI SO2 and MODIS AOD observations were used to investigate the column contents of air pollutants over the eastern U.S.; these indicate decreasing trends in column SO2 (similar to 60% decrease) and AOD (similar to 20% decrease). The decrease of upwind SO2 emissions also reduced aerosol loadings over the downwind Atlantic Ocean near the coast by similar to 20%, while indiscernible changes of the SO2 column were observed. A step change of SO2 emissions in Maryland starting in 2009-2010 had an immediate and profound benefit in terms of local surface SO2 concentrations but a modest impact on aerosol pollution, indicating that short-lived pollutants are effectively controlled locally, while long-lived pollutants require regional measures.

Characterization of aerosol episodes in the greater Mediterranean Sea area from satellite observations (2000-2007)	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												An algorithm able to identify and characterize episodes of different aerosol types above sea surfaces of the greater Mediterranean basin (GMB), including the Black Sea and the Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Iberia and northwest Africa, is presented in this study. Based on this algorithm, five types of intense (strong and extreme) aerosol episodes in the GMB are identified and characterized using daily aerosol optical properties from satellite measurements, namely MODIS-Terra, Earth Probe (EP)-TOMS and OMI-Aura. These aerosol episodes are: (i) biomass-burning/urban-industrial (BU), (ii) desert dust (DD), (iii) dust/sea-salt (DSS), (iv) mixed (MX) and (v) undetermined (UN). The identification and characterization is made with our algorithm using a variety of aerosol properties, namely aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (a), fine fraction (FF), effective radius (r(eff)) and Aerosol Index (AI). During the study period (2000-2007), the most frequent aerosol episodes are DD, observed primarily in the western and central Mediterranean Sea, and off the northern African coasts, 7 times/year for strong episodes and 4 times/year for extreme ones, on average. The DD episodes yield 40% of all types of strong aerosol episodes in the study region, while they account for 71.5% of all extreme episodes. The frequency of occurrence of strong episodes exhibits specific geographical patterns, for example the BU are mostly observed along the coasts of southern Europe and off the Atlantic coasts of Portugal, the MX episodes off the Spanish Mediterranean coast and over the Adriatic and northern Aegean Sea, while the DSS ones over the western and central Mediterranean Sea. On the other hand, the extreme episodes for all but DD aerosol display more patchy spatial patterns. The strong episodes exhibit AOD at 550 nm as high as 1.6 in the southernmost parts of central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, which rise up to 5 for the extreme, mainly DD and DSS, episodes. Although more than 90% of all aerosol episodes last I day, there are few cases, mainly extreme DD episodes, which last up to 4 days. Independently of their type, the Mediterranean aerosol episodes occur more frequently in spring (strong and extreme episodes) and summer (strong episodes) and most rarely during winter. A significant year by year variability of Mediterranean aerosol episodes has been identified, more in terms of their frequency than intensity. An analysis of 5-day back trajectories for the most extreme episodes provides confidence on the obtained results of the algorithm, based on the revealed origin and track of air masses causing the episodes. The 25 and 6% of all strong and extreme episodes, respectively, are MX, thus highlighting the co-existence of different aerosol types in the greater Mediterranean. The intensity of both MX and DSS episodes exhibits similar patterns to those of DD strong ones, indicating that desert dust is a determinant factor for the intensity of aerosol episodes in the Mediterranean, including DSS and MX episodes.

A combined GLAS and MODIS estimation of the global distribution of mean forest canopy height	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping the global distribution of forest canopy height is important for estimating forest biomass and terrestrial carbon flux. In this study, we present a global map of mean forest canopy height at 500 m spatial resolution obtained by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data acquired from 2005 to 2006 and 13 ancillary variables, including seven climatic variables and six remote sensing variables (nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance at red and NIR bands, tree cover, anisotropic factor, accumulated Enhanced Vegetation Index, and elevation). The original contributions of this study include the following: (1) The wavelet method was applied to complement the GLA14 product to identify the ground peak and the top-canopy peak. We found that it was useful for dealing with waveforms with low reconstruction accuracy. (2) GLAS data from the leafless season were not used for non evergreen forest because the height retrieval results exhibited underestimation and strong variations. (3) The an isotropic factor (ANIF), an indicator related to surface structure, was included as an ancillary variable for the first time and was determined to be important for height modeling in the Asian and North American regions. (4) The balanced random forest (BRF) algorithm was applied to register GLAS mean forest canopy height to a 500 m grid considering the small proportion of extreme height classes (tall and short trees), and it achieved good performance in terms of modeling accuracy (RMSE = 2.75 to 4.45 m) and preserving data variation. An inter-comparison among three global forest height maps [the present study, Lefsky (2010), and Simard et al. (2011)] was implemented in a pixel-by-pixel manner. High agreement (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.49 m) was determined between the present study and Simard et al., whereas the result from Lefsky was notably different from the other two results (R-2 = 0.14, RMSE = 8.92 m, compared with the present study; R-2 = 0.11, RMSE 11.19 m, compared with Simard et al.). Large disparities were generally associated with evergreen broadleaf forests in South America, deciduous needleleaf forests in Europe and Russian North Asia, and evergreen needleleaf forests on the West Coast of North America. Differences in the height metric were a main factor affecting the disparities among the three results. Validation against field survey data acquired from the Distributed Active Archive Center indicated the accuracy of our mean forest canopy height map (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 4.68 m, n = 59).

J	Gherboudj, I; Ghedira, H				Gherboudj, Imen; Ghedira, Hosni			Assessment of solar energy potential over the United Arab Emirates using remote sensing and weather forecast data	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												This research proposes innovative maps to describe the land relative suitability indices for the implementation of solar energy systems (PV and CSP) over the United Arab Emirates. These maps have been developed by combining the solar irradiances maps (global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance) with the effects of the land constraints (land slope, land use and land accessibility to the transportation infrastructure) and weather conditions (airborne dust properties, wind speed, relative humidity, air temperature). Remote sensing, weather forecast models and geospatial information system (GIS) offer excellent tools for estimating and monitoring the aforementioned data at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Indeed, these data have acceptable accuracy to provide a good understanding of the degree of exposure to these data over each location. Our results highlight the potential for using the considered tools to estimate the UAE land capability map, dust/relative-humidity/air-temperature risk map and finally the land relative suitability index for both PV and CSP power plants setting. The obtained results confirm that PV power plants are more appropriate for the UAE context than CSP power plants. In fact, the most suitable areas for PV power plants are located in the eastern side of the country, an area which represents 9.7% of the UAE's total land area. As for the CSP power plants, their most suitable areas are located on the coast nearby Abu-Dhabi and the extreme south of the UAE, with an area that represents 1%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mendes, R; Sousa, MC; deCastro, M; Gomez-Gesteira, M; Dias, JM				Mendes, Renato; Sousa, Magda Catarina; deCastro, Maite; Gomez-Gesteira, Moncho; Dias, Joao Miguel			New insights into the Western Iberian Buoyant Plume: Interaction between the Douro and Minho River plumes under winter conditions	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The Douro and Minho Rivers are the most important freshwater contributors on the northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Although their interaction is poorly understood, it is well known that they generate the Western Iberian Buoyant Plume (WIBP). This study aims to research the interaction of the Douro and Minho estuarine plumes under winter conditions, with a focus on the changes induced in normal WIBP patterns. Additionally, it will assess the impact of these changes on the Rias Baixas dynamics. An integrated analysis of the dispersion of these plumes was performed through hydrodynamic and Lagrangian numerical simulations of representative winter conditions for January and February 2010. Several simulations were carried out to study the interaction between plumes and their direct and indirect influence on coastal circulation. Under downwelling-favorable winds, the interaction between the Douro and Minho plumes is clear. Both plumes tend to be confined against the coast, as Ekman transport generates a buoyant coastal band with high surface currents. Douro estuary inflow reaches the Minho River coastal region and interacts with the Minho plume to modify freshwater fate. The Douro estuarine plume plays an important role in stabilizing WIBP, by preventing small-scale eddy generation and, consequently, the offshore freshwater transport. In addition, the Douro River has been shown to have a crucial influence on plume stratification, by enhancing the water exchange with the Rias de Vigo and Pontevedra.

Estimation of Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide and Air-Sea Fluxes in Hooghly Estuary Based on In Situ and Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												An empirical model is developed and used with remotely sensed predictors: sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), to compute surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2w)) and air-sea fluxes of CO2 in the Hooghly estuary and its adjacent coastal oceans. In situ observations used here were based on measurements carried out in this region during winter and summer periods in 2008. The estimated pCO(2w) compares well with the in situ observations at root mean square error +/- 18 mu atm. In winter, estimated pCO(2w) ranges between 320 and 500 mu atm with large values (> 400 mu atm) on the south-western and south-eastern flanks of the coastal domain and lower values (340-375 mu atm) on the main-channel. In summer, it remained spatially uniform at 450 mu atm. Extrapolation of the results over the study region based on the Moderate Imaging Specroradiometer (MODIS) measured SST and Chl-a suggests that the region is a strong source of atmospheric CO2 during the summer with net release of 0.095 Tg C year(-1) (equivalent to mean flux of 90 molC m(-2) year(-1)) and is a weak source during the winter with net release of 0.006 Tg C yr(-1) (0.5 molC m(-2) year(-1)) from the geographical extent of 6000 Km(2) area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				FEB	2016	44	1					135	143		10.1007/s12524-015-0459-z								WOS:000373626200014						
J	Parinussa, RM; Lakshmi, V; Johnson, F; Sharma, A				Parinussa, Robert M.; Lakshmi, Venkat; Johnson, Fiona; Sharma, Ashish			Comparing and Combining Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature Products for Improved Hydrological Applications	REMOTE SENSING												Land surface temperature (LST) is an important variable that provides a valuable connection between the energy and water budget and is strongly linked to land surface hydrology. Space-borne remote sensing provides a consistent means for regularly observing LST using thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave observations each with unique strengths and weaknesses. The spatial resolution of TIR based LST observations is around 1 km, a major advantage when compared to passive microwave observations (around 10 km). However, a major advantage of passive microwaves is their cloud penetrating capability making them all-weather sensors whereas TIR observations are routinely masked under the presence of clouds and aerosols. In this study, a relatively simple combination approach that benefits from the cloud penetrating capacity of passive microwave sensors was proposed. In the first step, TIR and passive microwave LST products were compared over Australia for both anomalies and raw timeseries. A very high agreement was shown over the vast majority of the country with R-2 typically ranging from 0.50 to 0.75 for the anomalies and from 0.80 to 1.00 for the raw timeseries. Then, the scalability of the passive microwave based LST product was examined and a pixel based merging approach through linear scaling was proposed. The individual and merged LST products were further compared against independent LST from the re-analysis model outputs. This comparison revealed that the TIR based LST product agrees best with the re-analysis data (R-2 0.26 for anomalies and R-2 0.76 for raw data), followed by the passive microwave LST product (R-2 0.16 for anomalies and R-2 0.66 for raw data) and the combined LST product (R-2 0.18 for anomalies and R-2 0.62 for raw data). It should be noted that the drop in performance comes with an increased revisit frequency of approximately 20% compared to the revised frequency of the TIR alone. Additionally, this comparison against re-analysis data was subdivided over Australia's major climate zones and revealed that the relative agreement between the individual and combined LST products against the re-analysis data is consistent over these climate zones. These results are also consistent for both the anomalies and the raw time series. Finally, two examples were provided that demonstrate the proposed merging approach including an example for the Hunter Valley floods along Australia's central coast that experienced significant flooding in April 2015.

Long-term monitoring of biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the northern Gulf of Mexico - A methodological approach using MODIS	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT					2014 ForestSAT Conference	NOV 04-07, 2014	Riva del Garda, ITALY					Accurate and efficient monitoring is critically important for the effective restoration and conservation of threatened tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast. The high carbon sequestration potential, habitat for important wildlife and fish, and numerous ecosystem services make these tidal wetlands highly valuable both ecologically and economically to Gulf Coast communities. Our study developed a new methodological approach for mapping biophysical health of coastal tidal wetland habitats in terms of green leaf area index (GLAI), canopy level chlorophyll content (CHL), vegetation fraction (VF), and above ground green biomass (GBM). We measured these biophysical characteristics in tidal wetlands of the northern Gulf of Mexico using a combination of ground data collected from field surveys during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 and NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m and 500 m images. Additionally, we compared and evaluated the performances of both in situ proximal and satellite remote sensing measurements in terms of their potential for mapping the wetland biophysical characteristics. MODIS-based models proved superior at the landscape level compared to models developed from in situ proximal sensing, as species level signals seemed to be diluted at coarser spatial scales. We selected Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) for MODIS 250 m and Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) for MODIS 500 m to map biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands. Time-series composites and phenological information derived using the MODIS based models captured the impact of the selected disturbances in the last decade on the ecological and physiological status of the tidal wetland habitats in the Gulf Coast. This is the first study to employ MODIS data to analyze the biophysical characteristics of tidal wetlands in the Gulf Coast, which, in turn, has the potential to improve our ability to predict their productivity and carbon sequestration potential. These techniques could also be used to assess the success of previous and ongoing tidal wetland restoration projects, and evaluate the productivity of marshes under threat from developmental activity, sea level rise, and industrial pollution.

J	He, SY; Huang, DJ; Zeng, DY				He, Shuangyan; Huang, Daji; Zeng, Dingyong			Double SST fronts observed from MODIS data in the East China Sea off the Zhejiang-Fujian coast, China	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												We report a double coastal front system off the Zhejiang (Zhe) and Fujian (Min) Provinces in the East China Sea in winter. In addition to the well-known Zhe-Min offshore coastal front along 50 m isobath, a secondary near-shore coastal thermal front along 20 m isobath is also apparent in December and January. The fronts were observed by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at monthly mean nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) during 2000-2013 in terms of SST gradients. Our results showed temporal and spatial variations of the two fronts as follows: (1) both offshore front and near-shore front often co-exist between 26.5 degrees N and 29.5 degrees N in December and between 28.0 degrees N and 29.5 degrees N in January. However, only the offshore front is apparent in November and February. (2) The near-shore front is narrow (4-16 km), while the offshore front is three to four times wider (16-48 km). (3) In contrast to the well-known offshore front which exists throughout the winter with a strong intensity, the near-shore front has a shorter lifetime with a weak intensity, and has been overlooked by previous studies. Finally, we proposed that the bottom bathymetric gradients may play an important role in the frontogenesis of the double fronts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This research utilizes field surveys and analyses of multi-resolution remote sensing images to clarify the impact on landscapes caused by this disaster and also to monitor the subsequent survival and recovery process in the Sendai Bay region. MODIS data (250 m resolution) were employed to map the overall extent of inundation and damage on the regional landscape scale. The major damage caused by the tsunami, destruction of coastal pine forests and inundation of rice paddies on the plain, was identified at this level. Progressively finer-scale analyses were then implemented using SPOT/HRG-2 (10 m resolution) data, GeoEye-1 fine-resolution data (0.5 m), very fine-resolution aerial photographs (10 cm) and LiDAR. These results demonstrated the minute details of the damage and recovery process down to the level of individual groves and trees. The results of the research show that on the wide-scale regional level, plant communities on rocky cliffs along the rias-style Sanriku Coast survived relatively intact, but coastal forests and other vegetations on sandy beaches and other low-lying coasts were severely damaged. Finer-scale analyses of a coastal pine forest in the Sendai Bay area showed that local topography influenced the patterns of damage and survival for individual trees. At the finest level, damaged pine forests and sandy beach vegetation could be seen recovering only a little more than a year after the disaster. Continuous monitoring using fieldwork and remote sensing is required for balanced regional strategies that provide for economic and social recovery as well as restoration of vegetation, biodiversity and vital ecotones.																	2191-0707		978-4-431-56448-5; 978-4-431-56446-1				2016							253	269		10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5_16	10.1007/978-4-431-56448-5							WOS:000402094400017

Impact of rapid urbanization on the microclimate of Indian cities: a case study for the city of Bhubaneswar	LAND SURFACE AND CRYOSPHERE REMOTE SENSING III	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Land Surface and Cryosphere Remote Sensing III	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			The impact of rapid urbanization in cities on their microclimate is at present a great cause of global concern. One of the major consequences is the unexpected rise in temperatures in the cities compared to their surrounding areas, termed as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Over the past many years, several Indian cities are under severe stress owing to such extreme anomalous changes in their micro-meteorological conditions making them unfriendly for habitation. Presented here is a case study on Bhubaneswar - one such city on the east coast of India undergoing rapid urbanization in recent times. In this study, Land Surface Temperatures (LST) from MODIS Terra and Aqua instruments at 1 km(2) spatial resolution along with the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change data from Landsat was used over a 25 km radius about the city for a 15 years' period from 2000 to 2014. Preliminary analyses indicate spatio-temporal changes in LULC to be one of the primary and significant factors responsible for changes in the UHI effect over the city. Investigations on the spatio-temporal variations in LST across the city and its relationship with vegetation cover indicate that over-exploitation of various resources demanded by a fast growing population has led to significant changes in LULC patterns in the last few years. Analysis of the changes in the urban energy balance and resulting UHI effect across the city under various urban growth scenarios and different proportions of green urban area are in progress.

After recalibrating and validating the form with the highest correlation coefficient between reflectance and TSS concentration and other TSS retrieval models that have been successful applied in many places, we found that the quadratic model of the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) shows the highest performance. QRLTSS model based on Landsat OLI, ETM+ and TM can explained about 71% of the TSS concentration variation (4.3 similar to 577.2 mg/L) in the five regions and has a high and acceptable validation accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) of 21.5-25mg/L and mean relative error (MRE) of 27.2-32.2%. We concluded that QRLTSS model can be used to quantify the TSS concentration of multiple estuaries and coasts of south China which would be helpful to understand the temporal and spatial variation of TSS in a large region. QRLTSS model should be applied to Landsat imagery for further validation in the future. The approach proposed in the paper also could promote the research work of establishing regional and uniform TSS retrieval model forward.																	2380-8039		978-1-5090-1479-8				2016																		WOS:000389576700032

MODIS-Aqua Data based Detection and Classification of Algal Blooms along the Coast of India using RLS Classifier	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS	Procedia Computer Science				6th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications (ICACC)	SEP 06-08, 2016	Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol, Kochi, INDIA		Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol			In the field of marine biology, researches reveal that there exists a constant increase in Algal bloom (AB) count, along the coast of India. This work aims at detecting and classifying six most frequently appearing algal blooms in this region (viz.: Trichodesmium erythraeum, Noctiluca scintillans/miliaris, Cocholodinium ploykrikoides, Chattonella marina and Karenia mikimotoi blooms). The uniqueness of ocean's optical properties such as remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)) during bloom period serve as the underlying features on whose grounds classification is performed. These parameters are acquired from Aqua/MODIS sensor measurements and Regularized least squares classifier is used in GURLS library for classification. An overall classification accuracy of 94.37% is obtained using both R-rs and nL(w) features, which is superior to the previously conducted studies for monitoring ABs using optical properties of water. Given a MODIS image, a map is developed wherein the pixels with ABs are highlighted and the causative species is recognized. A MODIS image is available every two days and hence frequent generation of AB moitoring maps is possible, which is of great significance in the fisheries industry. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Interannual and Seasonal Dynamics in Lipidic Signatures of Trichiurus lepturus	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC FOOD PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY												Interannual and seasonal (premonsoon, monsoon, and postmonsoon) variability in the lipid, fatty acids, and total cholesterol content of ribbon fish, Trichiurus lepturus were determined for a period of 4 years (2008-2011) along the southwest (SW) and southeast (SE) coasts of India. The lipidic compositions were studied along with chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained from MODIS and Sea WiFS. The lipid content shows seasonal fluctuations with higher values in the postmonsoon season along the SE coast and during the monsoon in the SW coast. Among polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dominated over eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) throughout the seasons except in winter on the SE coast. The health indices such as atherogenic/thrombogenicity indices, total cholesterol, and hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic ratio of ribbon fish were found to be ideal, which contributed toward its parameters to be qualified as a potential health food.																	1049-8850	1547-0636					2016	25	6					811	823		10.1080/10498850.2014.935541								WOS:000383446600004

Strong and extreme desert dust (DD) episodes are identified at 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution, over the period March 2000-February 2013, through the implementation of an updated objective and dynamic algorithm. According to the algorithm, strong DD episodes occurring at a specific place correspond to cases in which the daily aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD(550 nm)) exceeds or equals the long-term mean AOD(550 nm) (Mean) plus two standard deviations (SD), which is also smaller than Mean+4xSD. Extreme DD episodes correspond to cases in which the daily AOD(550 nm) value equals or exceeds Mean+4xSD. For the identification of DD episodes, additional optical properties (Angstrom exponent, fine fraction, effective radius and aerosol index) derived by the MODIS-Terra & Aqua (also AOD retrievals), OMI-Aura and EPTOMS databases are used as inputs. According to the algorithm using MODIS-Terra data, over the period March 2000-February 2013, strong DD episodes occur more frequently (up to 9.9 episodes year(-1)) over the western Mediterranean, while the corresponding frequencies for the extreme ones are smaller (up to 3.3 episodes year(-1), central Mediterranean Sea). In contrast to their frequency, dust episodes are more intense (AODs up to 4.1), over the central and eastern Mediterranean Sea, off the northern African coasts. Slightly lower frequencies and higher intensities are found when the satellite algorithm operates based on MODIS-Aqua retrievals, for the period 2003-2012. The consistency of the algorithm is successfully tested through the application of an alternative methodology for the determination of DD episodes, which produced similar features of the episodes' frequency and intensity, with just slightly higher frequencies and lower intensities. The performance of the satellite algorithm is assessed against surface-based daily data from 109 sun-photometric (AERONET) and 22 PM10 stations. The agreement between AERONET and MODIS AOD is satisfactory (R = 0.505 0.750) and improves considerably when MODIS level 3 retrievals with higher sub-grid spatial representativeness and homogeneity are considered. Through the comparison against PM10 concentrations, it is found that the presence of dust is justified in all ground stations with success scores ranging from 68 to 97 %. However, poor agreement is evident between satellite and ground PM10 observations in the western parts of the Mediterranean, which is attributed to the desert dust outbreaks' vertical extension and the high altitude of dust presence. The CALIOP vertical profiles of pure and polluted dust observations and the associated total backscatter coefficient at 532 nm (beta(532 nm)), indicate that dust particles are mainly detected between 0.5 and 6 km, though they can reach 8 km between the parallels 32 and 38 degrees N in warm seasons. An increased number of CALIOP dust records at higher altitudes is observed with increased latitude, northwards to 40 degrees N, revealing an ascending mode of the dust transport. However, the overall intensity of DD episodes is maximum (up to 0.006 km(-1) sr(-1)) below 2 km and at the southern parts of the study region (30-34 degrees N). Additionally, the average thickness of dust layers gradually decreases from 4 to 2 km, moving from south to north. In spring, dust layers of moderate-to-high beta(532) nm values (similar to 0.004 km(-1) sr(-1) /are detected over the Mediterranean (35-42 degrees N), extending from 2 to 4 km. Over the western Mediterranean, dust layers are observed between 2 and 6 km, while their base height is decreased down to 0.5 km for increasing longitudes underlying the role of topography and thermal convection. The vertical profiles of CALIOP beta(532) nm confirm the multilayered structure of the Mediterranean desert dust outbreaks on both annual and seasonal bases, with several dust layers of variable geometrical characteristics and intensities. A detailed analysis of the vertical structure of specific DD episodes using CALIOP profiles reveals that the consideration of the dust vertical structure is necessary when attempting comparisons between columnar MODIS AOD retrievals and ground PM10 concentrations.

Monitoring and tracking the trans-Pacific transport of aerosols using multi-satellite aerosol optical depth composites	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The primary goal of this study was to generate a near-real time (NRT) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product capable of providing a comprehensive understanding of the aerosol spatial distribution over the Pacific Ocean, in order to better monitor and track the trans-Pacific transport of aerosols. Therefore, we developed a NRT product that takes advantage of observations from both low-earth orbiting and geostationary satellites. In particular, we utilize AOD products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellites. Then, we combine these AOD products with our own retrieval algorithms developed for the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-15) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT-2) to generate a NRT daily AOD composite product. We present examples of the daily AOD composite product for a case study of trans-Pacific transport of Asian pollution and dust aerosols in mid-March 2014. Overall, the new product successfully tracks this aerosol plume during its trans-Pacific transport to the west coast of North America as the frequent geostationary observations lead to a greater coverage of cloud-free AOD retrievals equator-ward of about 35 degrees N, while the polar-orbiting satellites provide a greater coverage of AOD poleward of 35 degrees N. However, we note several areas across the domain of interest from Asia to North America where the GOES-15 and MTSAT-2 retrieval algorithms can introduce significant uncertainties into the new product.																	1867-1381	1867-8548					2016	9	6					2463	2482		10.5194/amt-9-2463-2016								WOS:000379397100002

The rainband features around typhoon eyes were first delineated using wavelet analysis, and then the wind speeds were estimated by feature tracking using quasi-concurrent multi-sensor images. It was found that the feature tracking-estimated wind speeds are reasonable compared with the maximum wind speed reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which accounts for the radial dependence of wind speed using the Rankine combined vortex approximation. In a specific case, with the aid of Doppler radar observations near the northern coast of Taiwan, wind speed estimation based on the multi-sensor also shows consistent results. This study demonstrates that the local wind distribution of cyclonic winds around typhoon eyes at different radial distances from the typhoon centres may be derived from rainband feature tracking using quasi-concurrent multi-sensor images. This technique may offer useful wind information for typhoon simulations and forecasting.

In addition, to understand the long-term seasonal variability, chl-a retrieved from the MERIS-CC algorithm was overlaid on monthly mean chl-a time series data from MODIS. Comparison of chl-a using MERIS-CC to that measured in situ showed wide scatter around the linear trend line. We observed that chl-a from MERIS-CC was underestimated for two-thirds of the observations, whereas with MODIS and MERIS it was 51% and 44%, respectively. Statistical analysis showed an improved performance in chl-a retrieval using the operational OC4E algorithm as compared to that of MERIS-CC. The time series analysis showed a good match between in situ chl-a and that derived from MODIS using the OC3M algorithm, whereas the MERIS-CC algorithm showed inconsistency in match-up with regard to both magnitude and trend. This inconsistency was more prominent during the low-chl-a scenario during the northern winter. We infer that algorithms such as OC4E and OC3M that use bands from the blue and green regions of the spectrum offer better chlorophyll retrieval in high-TSM or -CDOM concentration waters in comparison with CoastColour, which uses all bands across the spectrum.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2016	37	9			SI		2066	2076		10.1080/01431161.2015.1129564								WOS:000375461300007

Radar and optical mapping of surge persistence and marsh dieback along the New Jersey Mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This study combined a radar-based time series of Hurricane Sandy surge and estimated persistence with optical sensor-based marsh condition change to assess potential causal linkages of surge persistence and marsh condition change along the New Jersey Atlantic Ocean coast. Results based on processed TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images indicated that surge flooding persisted for 12 h past landfall in marshes from Great Bay to Great Egg Harbor Bay and up to 59 h after landfall in many back-barrier lagoon marshes. Marsh condition change (i.e. loss of green marsh vegetation) was assessed from optical satellite images (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) collected before and after Hurricane Sandy. High change in condition often showed spatial correspondence, with high surge persistence in marsh surrounding the lagoon portion of Great Bay, while in contrast, low change and high persistence spatial correspondence dominated the interior marshes of the Great Bay and Great Egg Harbor Bay estuaries. Salinity measurements suggest that these areas were influenced by freshwater discharges after landfall possibly mitigating damage. Back-barrier marshes outside these regions exhibited mixed correspondences. In some cases, topographic features supporting longer surge persistence suggested that non-correspondence between radar and optical data-based results may be due to differential resilience; however, in many cases, reference information was lacking to determine a reason for non-correspondence.

Potential application of VIIRS Day/Night Band for monitoring nighttime surface PM2.5 air quality from space	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A pilot study is conducted to illustrate the potential of using radiance data collected by the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite for particulate matter (PM) air quality monitoring at night. The study focuses on the moonless and cloudless nights in Atlanta, Georgia during August-October 2012. We show with radiative transfer calculations that DNB at night is sensitive to the change of aerosols and much less sensitive to the change of water vapor in the atmosphere illuminated by common outdoor light bulbs at the surface. We further show both qualitatively that the contrast of DNB images can indicate the change of air quality at the urban scale, and quantitatively that change of light intensity during the night (as characterized by VIIRS DNB) reflects the change of surface PM2.5. Compared to four meteorological variables (u and v components of surface wind speed, surface pressure, and columnar water vapor amount) that can be obtained from surface measurements, the DNB light intensity is the only variable that shows either the largest or second largest correlation with surface PM2.5 measured at 5 different sites. A simple multivariate regression model with consideration of the change of DNB light intensity can yield improved estimate of surface PM2.5 as compared to the model with consideration of meteorological variables only. Cross validation of this DNB-based regression model shows that the estimated surface PM2.5 concentration has nearly no bias and a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.67 with respect to the corresponding hourly observed surface PM2.5 concentration. Furthermore, ground-based observations support that surface PM2.5 concentration at the VIIRS night overpass (similar to 1:00 am local) time is representative of daily-mean PM2.5 air quality (R = 0.82 and mean bias of -0.1 mu g m(-3)). While the potential appears promising, mapping surface PM2.5 from space with visible light at night still face various challenges and the strategies to address some of these challenges are elaborated for future studies.

J	Paulino, C; Segura, M; Chacon, G				Paulino, Carlos; Segura, Marceliano; Chacon, German			Spatial variability of jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) fishery related to remotely sensed SST and chlorophyll-a concentration (2004-2012)	FISHERIES RESEARCH												An analysis was performed on the spatial distribution of the industrial Jumbo flying squid fishery within and outside the Peruvian exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in relation to sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The locations of vessels were derived from the satellite tracking system (SISESAT) of the Instituto del Mar del Peru. Monthly environmental information came from the MODIS sensor of 4km spatial resolution for the period 2004-2012. Fishing operations data were divided into three periods based on their distance to shore consequential to the fishing regulations from January 2004 to October 2010, November 2010 to December 2011 and 2012. During the first period, two monthly patterns of spatial distribution were identified; from January to July fishing was along the coast from Paita (05 degrees S) to San Juan de Marcona (15 degrees 22'S) and later it was more concentrated in the northern area between Chimbote and Paita from August to December. In the second period, fishing operations formed small concentrations and widely dispersed points of fishing as a result of fishing restrictions within 80 nautical miles introduced in November 2010. In 2012 the fleet was located outside the EEZ. The highest concentrations of the fleet were found between 30 and 90 nautical miles offshore. The highest concentrations of squid were located from Paita-Chimbote (05 degrees-09 degrees S) and Callao-San Juan de Marcona (12 degrees 3'-15 degrees 22'S). Fishing operations were conducted in a wide range of SST between 14.1 degrees and 26.8 degrees C, with the highest incidence in temperatures between 18.4 to 22 degrees C and with a tendency to be located more frequently in areas with higher temperatures in recent years. Regarding chlorophylla, the fleet fished between chlorophyll-a concentrations of 0-9.5 mg/m3 within the EEZ, and from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/m3 outside the EEZ. Distribution patterns of the fleet in relation to anomalies of sea surface temperature in the area El Nino 1 + 2, with respect to latitude and cyclic monthly SST variability, were also observed.

An accurate and robust method to extract water bodies is critical to effectively manage these irreplaceable resources. Conventional methods are frequently limited in terms of the uncertainty related to the coarse resolution and regional reflectance heterogeneity of satellite images. The fuzzy clustering method (FCM) considering local spatial information has a proven capability to compensate for these limitations. Nevertheless, this technique is highly sensitive to immense false signals in original satellite images. Therefore, a systematic surface water extraction method by taking advantage of the complementarity between a water index (WI) and a modified FCM (WIMFCM) was designed in this study to improve the water extraction accuracy, the rationale of which is a background reflectance bias correction. Applications were performed to sixteen test sites varying from coasts to inland waters to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of the WIMFCM using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Results showed the WIMFCM improved the accuracy of water extraction in comparison to alternative methods in terms of kappa coefficients (KCs) and total classification errors (TEs). Overall, the mean KC of the WIMFCM was 0.94 and its mean TE was 1139%, compared with original WI (KC = 0.89, TE = 19.84%) and a support vector machine (SVM) method (KC = 0.89, TE = 22.39%). In addition, a seasonal analysis revealed the WIMFCM could maintain consistent reliability throughout the year, demonstrating its potential for accurate dynamic water monitoring associated with seasonal water probability mask. Additional tests using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed the WIMFCM could be extended to large-scale regions, as well as be used in near-real time surface water body extraction. The findings of this study offer a new method to improve target detection accuracy under reflectance heterogeneous environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MODIS L3 monthly composite data for both chlorophyll and SST of two consecutive years 2012 and 2013 were investigated to see the aftereffects of cyclone on these two parameters. Generally, during a cyclone vertical mixing of the water column uplifts nutrients to mixed layer depth that results in the increase in chlorophyll-a and decrease in sea surface temperature (SST). In this study a substantial increase in mean chlorophyll was observed in October, 2013 in comparison to 2012 (no severe cyclone was reported in Orissa-West Bengal coast). However, no significant change in SST was observed. Mean chlorophyll concentration in October 2012 was 3.12 +/- 1.97 mg m(-3), however, in October, 2013 it increased to 4.50 +/- 2.09 mg m(-3). Following this event, a huge increase in fish catch and Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) were also observed. Mean CPUE in October 2012 and 2013 was observed as 9.04 +/- 4.70 and 18.63 +/- 11.54 respectively. This increase in CPUE after cyclone Phailin might be due to enhanced productivity.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				DEC	2015	44	12					1897	1900										WOS:000380525100011

We present a microwave satellite-based approach for mapping fractional surface water (FW) globally at 25-km resolution. The approach employs a land cover-supported, atmospherically-corrected dynamic mixture model applied to 20+ years (1992-2013) of combined, daily, passive/active microwave remote sensing data. The resulting product, known as Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), shows strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water and inundated wetlands comprising open plant canopies. SWAMPS' FW compares favorably (R-2 = 91%-94%) with higher-resolution, global-scale maps of open water from MODIS and SRTM-MOD44W. Correspondence of SWAMPS with open water and wetland products from satellite SAR in Alaska and the Amazon deteriorates when exposed wetlands or inundated forests captured by the SAR products were added to the open water fraction reflecting SWAMPS' inability to detect water underneath the soil surface or beneath closed forest canopies. Except for a brief period of drying during the first 4 years of observation, the inundation extent for the global domain excluding the coast was largely stable. Regionally, inundation in North America is advancing while inundation is on the retreat in Tropical Africa and North Eurasia. SWAMPS provides a consistent and long-term global record of daily FW dynamics, with documented accuracies suitable for hydrologic assessment and global change-related investigations.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16688	16732		10.3390/rs71215843								WOS:000367534000046

Based on the initial oil spill locations detected from the first available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image acquired on June 11, 2011, we performed a numerical experiment to simulate the potential oil spill beaching area with the General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) model. The model was driven by ocean surface currents from an operational ocean model (Navy Coastal Ocean Model) and surface winds from operational scatterometer measurements (the Advanced Scatterometer). Under the forcing of wind and ocean currents, some of the oil spills reached land along the coast of Qinhuangdao within 12 days. The results also demonstrate that the ocean currents are likely to carry the remaining oil spills along the Bohai coast towards the northeast. The predicted oil spill beaching area was verified by reported in-situ measurements and former studies based on MODIS observations.

Seasonal changes in species composition	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												This study reports a year-round recruitment of spat of four commercial bivalve species; Pteria sterna, Euvola vogdesi, Pinctada mazatlanica and Pinna rugosa collected in the region of Puerto Penasco, north-eastern coast of the Gulf of California. Bimonthly recruitment of commercial bivalve spat on netlon((R)) collectors was evaluated for six sites from June 2007 to August 2008. To describe spat recruitment abundances with environmental parameters, sea surface temperature (degrees C) and surface chlorophyll a concentration (mgm(-3)) were characterized by means of monthly Aqua/MODIS satellite data. For each species a repeated measures anova was used to evaluate differences in the number of spat between months, sites and depths. Maximum sea surface temperature was recorded in August-September (similar to 31.5 degrees C) and the minimum in January-February (similar to 15 degrees C), while the minimum surface chlorophyll a was observed in June-September (mean range=1.5-2mgm(-3)) and the maximum in January-March (mean range=2-5mgm(-3)). Spat recruitment showed distinct patterns; P. sterna can be characterized as having a Winter-Spring pattern, E. vogdesi a winter pattern, while P. mazatlanica and P. rugosa a summer spat recruitment pattern. This information constitutes part of the fundamental data needed for the development of aquaculture and conservation initiatives in the region based on wild spat supply.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				DEC	2015	46	12					2829	2840		10.1111/are.12435								WOS:000363594500001						
J	Das, SK; Chatterjee, A; Ghosh, SK; Raha, S				Das, Sanat Kumar; Chatterjee, Abhijit; Ghosh, Sanjay K.; Raha, Sibaji			An integrated campaign for investigation of winter-time continental haze over Indo-Gangetic Basin and its radiative effects	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												An outflow of continental haze occurs from Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) in the North to Bay of Bengal (BoB) in the South. An integrated campaign was organized to investigate this continental haze during December 2013-February 2014 at source and remote regions within IGB to quantify its radiative effects. Measurements were carried out at three locations in eastern India; 1) Kalas Island, Sundarban (21.68 degrees N, 88.57 degrees E) - an isolated island along the north-east coast of BoB, 2) Kolkata (22.57 degrees N, 88.42 degrees E) - an urban metropolis and 3) Siliguri (26.70 degrees N, 88.35 degrees E) - an urban region at the foothills of eastern Himalayas. Ground-based AOD (at 0.5 mu m) is observed to be maximum (1.25 +/- 0.18) over Kolkata followed by Siliguri (0.60 +/- 0.17) and minimum over Sundarban (0.53 +/- 0.18). Black carbon concentration is found to be maximum at Kolkata (21.6 +/- 6.6 mu g . m(-3)) with almost equal concentrations at Siliguri (12.6 +/- 5.2 mu g . m(-3)) and Sundarban (12.3 +/- 3.0 mu g . m(-3)). Combination of MODIS-AOD and back-trajectories analysis shows an outflow of winter-time continental haze originating from central IGB and venting out through Sundarban towards BoB. This continental haze with high extinction coefficient is identified up to central BoB using CALIPSO observations and is found to contribute similar to 75% to marine AOD over central BoB. This haze produces significantly high aerosol radiative forcing within the atmosphere over Kolkata (75.4 Wm(-2)) as well as over Siliguri and Sundarban (40 Wm(-2)) indicating large forcing over entire IGB, from foothills of the Himalayas to coastal region. This winter-time continental haze also causes about similar radiative heating (1.5 K . day(-1)) from Siliguri to Sundarban which is enhanced over Kolkata (3 K . day(-1)) due to large emission of local urban aerosols. This high aerosol heating over entire IGB and coastal region of BoB can have considerable impact on the monsoonal circulation and more importantly, such haze transported over to BoB can significantly affect the marine hydrological cycle.

Our method uses algorithms developed to extract patterns in large datasets of time-sequential data. We use short time-series of QuikSCAT surface winds, MODIS sea surface temperature and surface chlorophyll a associated with each in situ chlorophyll a profile, as well as the season and bottom depth of the in situ station to discover patterns that can be used to classify new data into 12 profile classes. We first fill in missing MODIS data using a conditional random field model so that cloudy days are not excluded. The most likely profile is then predicted using all the available data. We apply our method to the St Helena Bay area, a region within the productive Benguela Current upwelling system. A profile is predicted for each day and each pixel of 4 km resolution satellite image for 16 consecutive months. Each profile is used in a broad-band photosynthesis model to produce a daily three-dimensional estimate of gross primary production. An average production rate of 3.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) was obtained for the area, which shows very good agreement with other estimates from the region. The results show persistent high productivity near the surface throughout the year with the exception of the winter months. Deeper in the water column productivity is more seasonal. The 16 month time-series highlights the interannual, seasonal and daily variability of the system. By linking physical processes to the distribution of phytoplankton at appropriate spatio-temporal scales, we can now more rigorously investigate bottom-up driven impacts on ecosystems characterised by short-term variability.

The effects on vegetation and human settlements in the affected areas were enormous. This study presents the results of an analysis estimating the long-term recovery using two longitudinal remotely sensed dataset: 1. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index (MODIS EVI), a dataset accounting for change in the landscape and vegetation; and 2. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Optical Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS) night-time light data in order to estimate the effects on human and economic activities. It is evident from the results of this study that the night-time light and vegetation index datasets can both be beneficial in identifying changes caused by natural disasters and can be used to track recovery. The results using night-time light indicates a large loss of lighted area but also a rapid recovery of night-time light after the tsunami. Already in year 2005-2006, the levels of lighted area and sum of the lighting (SOL) intensity reached the same levels as pre-tsunami. For MODIS vegetation index, a drop can be observed in 2005/2006 on locations close to the coastline using 1 year temporal resolution; however, when utilizing the 16 day temporal resolution, the impact of the tsunami is illustrated as a dramatic drop, mostly in pixels located within 3km from the coast. Following the drop in vegetation index due to the tsunami, it was observed that most pixels exhibited at least some level of recovery in 2 years after the event.

WRF multi-physics simulation of clouds in the African region	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been used to simulate clouds, and their effects on precipitation and radiation, in Africa. The results have been compared with observational databases, mainly based on satellite measurements. The Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP) has been used to consistently compare simulated clouds with satellite data, allowing us to evaluate not only the total cloud cover but also the cloud amount of different cloud types, classified according to their optical thickness and cloud-top pressure. Nine WRF simulations, for the 2002-2006 period, were carried out to evaluate the influence on cloud cover of different physical parametrizations and model configurations. In general, model simulations show similar results, underestimating total cloud cover in most of the studied region. In the tropical convective area, high clouds are underestimated, but the net effect on the radiation is partially compensated by the overestimation of cloud optical depth. Major differences appear over subtropical areas dominated by marine boundary-layer clouds, mainly off the coast of Namibia. In this area, simulations show too many thick clouds and too few clouds with lower optical thickness. The net result is an underestimation of low cloud cover. Also, the transition from stratocumulus to shallow cumulus away from the coast is not realistically modelled.

Validation of standard and alternative satellite ocean-color chlorophyll products off Western Iberia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) product validation off the Western Iberian coast is here undertaken by directly comparing remote sensing data with in situ surface reference values. Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities.

J	Shimada, S; Ohsawa, T; Kogaki, T; Steinfeld, G; Heinemann, D				Shimada, Susumu; Ohsawa, Teruo; Kogaki, Tetsuya; Steinfeld, Gerald; Heinemann, Detlev			Effects of sea surface temperature accuracy on offshore wind resource assessment using a mesoscale model	WIND ENERGY												Offshore wind simulations were performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model driven by three different sea surface temperature (SST) datasets for Japanese coastal waters to investigate the effect of the SST accuracies on offshore wind simulations. First, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final analysis (FNL) (1 degrees x1 degrees grid resolution) and the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) (0.05 degrees x0.05 degrees grid resolution) datasets were compared with in situ measurements. The results show a decrease in accuracy of these datasets toward the coast from the open ocean. Aiming at an improved accuracy of SST data, we developed a new high-resolution SST dataset (0.02 degrees x0.02 degrees grid resolution). The new dataset referred to as MOSST is based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product, provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). MOSST was confirmed to be more accurate than FNL and OSTIA for the coastal waters. Then, WRF simulations were carried out for 1year with a 2km grid resolution and by using the FNL, OSTIA and MOSST datasets. The use of the OSTIA dataset for a WRF simulation was found to improve the accuracy when compared with the FNL dataset, and further improvement was obtained when the MOSST dataset was applied. The sensitivity of wind speed and wind energy density to SST is also discussed. We conclude that the use of an accurate SST is a key factor not only for realistic offshore wind simulations near the surface but also for accurate wind resource assessments at the hub height of wind turbines.

Particulate matter concentration mapping from MODIS satellite data: a Vietnamese case study	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Particulate Matter (PM) pollution is one of the most important air quality concerns in Vietnam. In this study, we integrate ground-based measurements, meteorological and satellite data to map temporal PM concentrations at a 10 x 10 km grid for the entire of Vietnam. We specifically used MODIS Aqua and Terra data and developed statistically-significant regression models to map and extend the ground-based PM concentrations. We validated our models over diverse geographic provinces i.e., North East, Red River Delta, North Central Coast and South Central Coast in Vietnam. Validation suggested good results for satellite-derived PM2.5 data compared to ground-based PM2.5 (n = 285, r(2) = 0.411, RMSE = 20.299 mu g m(-3) and RE = 39.789%). Further, validation of satellite-derived PM2.5 on two independent datasets for North East and South Central Coast suggested similar results (n = 40, r(2) = 0.455, RMSE = 21.512 mu g m(-3), RE = 45.236% and n = 45, r(2) = 0.444, RMSE = 8.551 mu g m(-3), RE = 46.446% respectively). Also, our satellite-derived PM2.5 maps were able to replicate seasonal and spatial trends of ground-based measurements in four different regions. Our results highlight the potential use of MODIS datasets for PM estimation at a regional scale in Vietnam. However, model limitation in capturing maximal or minimal PM2.5 peaks needs further investigations on ground data, atmospheric conditions and physical aspects.																	1748-9326					SEP	2015	10	9							095016	10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/095016								WOS:000367141000044

Aerosol climatology and discrimination of aerosol types retrieved from MODIS, MISR and OMI over Durban (29.88 degrees S, 31.02 degrees E), South Africa	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The present study represents the characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from multiple satellite sensors (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)) during 2003-2013 over an urban -coastal region, Durban (DBN; 29.88 degrees S, 31.02 degrees E, 46 m degrees asl), situated on the east coast of South Africa. An intercomparison and validation of AOD is performed against the AOD measurements from ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Sunphotometer. The results revealed that MISR-AERONET comparison indicated strong correlation compared to MODIS-AERONET comparison. Also, the comparison between MODIS and MISR AODs noticed significant positive correlation over DBN with the overestimation of latter by former. Highest AOD characterizes during the spring (September-November) followed by summer (December-February) and autumn (March-May) with the lowest AOD observed during the winter (June-August) season. The Angstrom exponent (AE(470-600)) indicates predominance of fine-mode aerosols during spring and summer and dominance of coarse-mode aerosols in winter. A HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model is used to locate the origin of airmass transport and understand the variability of aerosol source regions. Finally, the relationship between AOD and AE has been examined to classify different aerosol types and showed seasonal				Yin, Yan/I-8350-2014; VENKATARAMAN, SIVAKUMAR/B-4570-2009	Yin, Yan/0000-0002-8391-2712; VENKATARAMAN, SIVAKUMAR/0000-0003-2462-681X												1352-2310	1873-2844				SEP	2015	117						9	18		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.06.058								WOS:000365360300002						
J	Huang, Z; Feng, M				Huang, Zhi; Feng, Ming			Remotely sensed spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Leeuwin Current is an anomalous poleward-flowing eastern boundary current that transports warm tropical waters southward and imposes significant ecological influences on the coastal marine ecosystems off Western Australia. In this study, we attempt to map the spatial structure of the sea surface temperature (SST) signature of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS satellite data, which is used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current for the period July 2002 to December 2012. A topographic Position Index (TPI) method is used to map the Leeuwin Current's SST signature from the MODIS SST images. The semi-automatic classification process involves automatically identifying areas occupied by warm SST waters of the Leeuwin Current and manually discarding detached Leeuwin Current features. The TPI mapping results enabled us to quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST signature, including its spatial structure, extent, and cross-shelf migration, as well as its associated surface chlorophyll a characteristics. This study showed that the TPI mapping is able to capture the complex spatial structures of the Leeuwin Current, including its meanders, offshoots and eddies along its path, as reflected in the SST data. Using an eddy-resolving, data-assimilating numerical ocean model, we were able to relate the Leeuwin Current's SST signature with its surface current speed signature, though generally the speed signature is on the offshore side of the SST signature by about 25 to 30 km. Temporal wavelet analyses indicated that the variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST structure is dominated by seasonal cycle. During austral winter, the warm SST signature of the current is close to the shelf break, having greater spatial extent and higher chlorophyll a concentrations. In contrast, during austral summer, the SST signature of the current moves offshore, with reduced spatial extent and chlorophyll a concentrations. The Leeuwin Current also has notable inter-annual variation, to a large extent in response to ENSO variability in the Pacific. In El Nino years the current's SST signature tends to have reduced spatial extent, move further inshore, and increase its chlorophyll a concentrations. The opposite occurs during the La Nina years, especially after the unprecedented 2010-11 La Nina/Ningaloo Nino event when there was a significant reduction of the surface chlorophyll a concentration within the Leeuwin Current's SST signature. The mapping method developed in this study will be also useful in detecting climate driven variability of other ocean boundary current systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Measurement-based estimates of direct radiative effects of absorbing aerosols above clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The elevated layers of absorbing smoke aerosols from western African (e.g., Gabon and Congo) biomass burning activities have been frequently observed above low-level stratocumulus clouds off the African coast, which presents an excellent natural laboratory for studying the effects of aerosols above clouds (AAC) on regional energy balance in tropical and subtropical environments. Using spatially and temporally collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System data sets, the top-of-atmosphere shortwave aerosol direct shortwave radiative effects (ARE) of absorbing aerosols above low-level water clouds in the southeast Atlantic Ocean was examined in this study. The regional averaged instantaneous ARE has been estimated to be 36.720.5Wm(-2) (regional meanstandard deviation) along with a mean positive OMI Aerosol Index at 1.3 in August 2006 based on multisensors measurements. The highest magnitude of instantaneous ARE can even reach 138.2Wm(-2). We assess that the 660nm cloud optical depth (COD) values of 8-12 is the critical value above (below) which aerosol absorption (scattering) effect dominates and further produces positive (negative) ARE values. The results further show that ARE values are more sensitive to aerosols above lower COD values than cases for higher COD values. This is among the first studies to provide quantitative estimates of shortwave ARE due to AAC events from an observational perspective.

J	Li, J; Carlson, BE; Rossow, WB; Lacis, AA; Zhang, YC				Li, Jing; Carlson, Barbara E.; Rossow, William B.; Lacis, Andrew A.; Zhang, Yuanchong			An Intercomparison of the Spatiotemporal Variability of Satellite- and Ground-Based Cloud Datasets Using Spectral Analysis Techniques	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Because of the importance of clouds in modulating Earth's energy budget, it is critical to understand their variability in space and time for climate and modeling studies. This study examines the consistency of the spatiotemporal variability of cloud amount (CA) and cloud-top pressure (CTP) represented by five 7-yr satellite datasets from the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) cloud assessment project, and total cloud fraction observation from the Extended Edited Cloud Reports Archive (EECRA). Two spectral analysis techniques, namely combined maximum covariance analysis (CMCA) and combined principal component analysis (CPCA), are used to extract the dominant modes of variability from the combined datasets, and the resulting spatial patterns are compared in parallel. The results indicate that the datasets achieve overall excellent agreement on both seasonal and interannual scales of variability, with the correlations between the spatial patterns mostly above 0.6 and often above 0.8. For seasonal variability, the largest differences are found in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and near the South African coast for CA and in the Sahel region for CTP, where some differences in the phase and strength of the seasonal cycle are found. On interannual scales, global cloud variability is mostly associated with major climate modes, including El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the Indian Ocean dipole mode (IODM), and the datasets also agree reasonably well. The good agreement across the datasets supports the conclusion that they are describing cloud variations with these climate modes.																	0894-8755	1520-0442				JUL	2015	28	14					5716	5736		10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00537.1								WOS:000359637800013

The SST product is comprised of four sets of data including eight-hour and daily average SST data of 1 km resolution, and is based on the four infrared (IR) satellite SST data acquired by advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multifunctional Transport Satellites-2 (MTSAT-2) Imager and Meteorological Imager (MI), two microwave radiometer SSTs acquired by Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and WindSAT with in-situ temperature data. These input satellite and in-situ SST data are merged by using the optimal interpolation (OI) algorithm. The root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of satellite and in-situ data are used as a weighting value in the OI algorithm. As a pilot product, four SST data sets were generated daily from January to December 2013. In the comparison between the SSTs measured by moored buoys and the daily mean KIOST SSTs, the estimated RMSE was 0.71A degrees C and the bias value was-0.08A degrees C. The largest RMSE and bias were 0.86 and-0.26A degrees C respectively, observed at a buoy site in the boundary region of warm and cold waters with increased physical variability in the Sea of Japan/East Sea. Other site near the coasts shows a lower RMSE value of 0.60A degrees C than those at the open waters. To investigate the spatial distributions of SST, the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) product was used in the comparison of temperature gradients, and it was shown that the KIOST SST product represents well the water mass structures around the Korean Peninsula. The KIOST SST product generated from both satellite and buoy data is expected to make substantial contribution to the Korea Operational Oceanographic System (KOOS) as an input parameter for data assimilation.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUL	2015	34	7					74	88		10.1007/s13131-015-0694-8								WOS:000358256500008

The present study analyzed the spatial-temporal variations of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration under the influence of discharge from the Yangtze River, based on remotely sensed Chl-a concentrations. The study area was initially zoned to quantitatively investigate the spatial variation patterns of Chl-a. Then, the temporal variation of Chl-a in each zone was simulated by a sinusoidal curve model. The results showed that in the inshore waters, the terrigenous discharge was the predominant driving force determining the pattern of Chl-a, which brings the risk of red tide disasters; while in the open sea areas, Chl-a was mainly affected by meteorological factors. Furthermore, a diversity of spatial and temporal variations of Chl-a existed based on the degree of influences from discharge. The diluted water extended from inshore to the east of Jeju Island. This process affected the Chl-a concentration flowing through the area, and had a potential impact on the marine environment. The Chl-a from September to November showed an obvious response to the discharge from July to September with a lag of 1 to 2 months.																	1660-4601					MAY	2015	12	5					5420	5438		10.3390/ijerph120505420								WOS:000359190300057	26006121

Could those decline be alleviated by deploying artificial reefs (ARs) in suitable areas? This study investigates effects of a big project conducted in December 2007 that deployed ARs in the southwestern part of Daya Bay. The ARs cover a total dimension of 966.10 x 2850.60 m(2) and surface area of 91,500 m2. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of ecological factors, including Chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl-a), nutrients, attaching organisms and nekton resources, on and around the ARs using both satellite (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) and in situ data. Results showed that the potential affected area of ARs in Daya Bay reached a distance of 4.9 km in the water depth of 12.0-15.2 m. In the study area, Chl-a level reached 2.93 mg m(-2) during the post-AR period (2008-2012), that was higher than the pre-AR period (2002-2007) (2.37 mg m(-2)). Nekton biomass increased by 4.66-16.22 times compared with that in the pre-AR survey, and the species diversity increased by 15%-23%. This parallel trend suggested that ARs might have contribution to the increase in nekton biomass. Long-term observations shall be conducted to understand the response of phytoplankton to ARs.

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), products were retrieved from the sensor data that demonstrates the spatio-temporal variability of phytoplankton concentration in the northern Arabian sea near the coastline and open sea water of Pakistan, India, Iran and Oman. High concentration of Chl-a, were observed during two periods August to September and February to March respectively. It was also revealed that Chl-a, concentration was almost identical between the latitude 20 and 21 degrees N throughout the year.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				APR	2015	47	2					797	805										WOS:000355343000052

This extraordinary event provoked a dramatic perturbation of the water column. In order to understand and quantify the environmental impacts caused, a regular multidisciplinary monitoring was carried out using remote sensing sensors. In this context, we performed the systematic processing of every MODIS and MERIS and selected high resolution Worldview-2 imagery to provide information on the concentration of a number of biological, physical and chemical parameters. On the other hand, the eruption provided an exceptional source of tracer that allowed the study a variety of oceanographic structures. Specifically, the Canary Islands belong to a very active zone of long-lived eddies. Such structures are usually monitored using sea level anomaly fields. However these products have coarse spatial resolution and they are not suitable to perform submesoscale studies. Thanks to the volcanic tracer, detailed studies were undertaken with ocean colour imagery allowing, using the diffuse attenuation coefficient, to monitor the process of filamentation and axisymmetrization predicted by theoretical studies and numerical modelling. In our work, a novel 2-step segmentation methodology has been developed. The approach incorporates different segmentation algorithms and region growing techniques. In particular, the first step obtains an initial eddy segmentation using thresholding or clustering methods and, next, the fine detail is achieved by the iterative identification of the points to grow and the subsequent application of watershed or thresholding strategies. The methodology has demonstrated an excellent performance and robustness and it has proven to properly capture the eddy and its filaments.

The nitrate algorithms have been built up based on the three-dimensional regressions between SST, chl a, and nitrate in situ data using linear, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and paraboloid function fittings. Among these four functions, paraboloid was found to be better with the highest co-efficient of determination (postmonsoon: R-2=0.711, n=357; summer: R-2=0.635, n=302; premonsoon: R-2=0.829, n=249; and monsoon: R-2=0.692, n=272) for all seasons. Based on these fittings, seasonal nitrate images were generated using the concurrent satellite data of SST from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and chlorophyll (chl) from Ocean Color Monitor (OCM-2) and MODIS. The best retrieval of modeled nitrate (R-2=0.527, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.72, and mean normalized bias (MNB)=0.821) was observed for the postmonsoon season due to the better retrieval of both SST MODIS (28 February 2012, R-2=0.651, RMSE=2.037, and MNB=0.068) and chl OCM-2 (R2 =0.534, RMSE=0.317, and MNB=0.27). Present results confirm that the chl OCM-2 and SSTMODIS retrieve nitrate well than the MODIS-derived chl and SST largely due to the better retrieval of chl by OCM-2 than MODIS.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2015	187	4							176	10.1007/s10661-015-4340-x								WOS:000352113200002	25762424

Monitoring and trend mapping of sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS data: a case study of Mumbai coast	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in monitoring ecosystem health in the marine and coastal environment. Coastal ecosystem is largely dependent on ambient temperature and temperature fronts for marine/coastal habitat and its sustainability. Hence, thermal pollution is seen as a severe threat for ecological health of coastal waters across the world. Mumbai is one of the largest metropolises of the world and faces severe domestic and industrial effluent disposal problem, of which thermal pollution is a major issue with policy-makers and environmental stakeholders. This study attempts to understand the long-term SST variation in the coastal waters off Mumbai, on the western coast of India, and to identify thermal pollution zones. Analysis of SST trends in the near-coastal waters for the pre-and postmonsoon seasons from the year 2004 to the year 2010 has been carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Thermal Infra-red (TIR) bands. SST is calculated with the help of bands 31 and 32 using split window method. Several statistical operations were then applied to find the seasonal averages in SST and the standard deviation of SST in the study area. Maximumvariation in SSTwas found within a perpendicular distance of 5 km from the shoreline during the study period. Also, a warm water mass was found to form consistently off coast during the winter months. Several anthropogenic sources of thermal pollution could be identified which were found to impact various locations along the coast.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2015	187	4								10.1007/s10661-015-4386-9								WOS:000350685000012	25743152					
J	Good, E				Good, Elizabeth			Daily minimum and maximum surface air temperatures from geostationary satellite data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Observations of daily minimum and maximum land air temperatures, Tmin and Tmax, have traditionally been obtained through in situ observations at meteorological stations. While the station network is extensive, many land masses are poorly observed. Moreover, observations at stations are point observations and may not be representative of air temperatures at neighboring locations. Satellites provide the means to observe surface skin temperatures at spatial scales of tens of meters to kilometers. But although skin and near-surface air temperatures may be strongly coupled, the two quantities can differ by several degrees over land, where the magnitude of the difference is variable in both space and time. This study describes a method for estimating daily Tmin and Tmax at the pixel scale using geostationary satellite data, providing spatially detailed observations for areas unobserved in situ. A dynamic multiple linear regression model is developed using daily minimum and maximum land surface temperature (LSTmin and LSTmax), fraction of vegetation, distance from coast, latitude, urban fraction, and elevation as predictors. The method is demonstrated over Europe for 2012-2013; evaluation with collocated station observations indicates a mean satellite-minus-station bias of 0.0 to 0.5 degrees C with root-mean-square difference of 2.3 to 2.7 degrees C. The data derived here are not designed to replace traditional gridded station air temperature data sets, but to augment them. Satellite surface temperature data usually have larger uncertainties than in situ data sets, but they can offer spatial detail and coverage that the latter may not provide.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 27	2015	120	6					2306	2324		10.1002/2014JD022438								WOS:000353061800009						
J	Son, S; Wang, MH				Son, SeungHyun; Wang, Menghua			Diffuse attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation K-d(PAR) for global open ocean and coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite-based observations of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling spectral irradiance at the wavelength of 490 nm, K-d(490) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), K-d(PAR) in the ocean can play important roles for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models. Since existing K-d(PAR) models for the satellite ocean color data have wide regional variations, we need to improve the K-d(PAR) algorithm for global ocean applications. In this study, we propose a new blended K-d(PAR) model for both open oceans and turbid coastal waters. The new method has been assessed using in situ optical measurements from the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-Optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) database. Next, the new method is applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to derive Kd(PAR) products, and is compared with in situ measureinents. Results show that there are significant improvements in model-derived K-d(PAR) values using the new approach compared to those from some existing K-d(PAR) algorithms. In addition, matchup comparisons between MODIS-derived and in situ-measured K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean show a good agreement with mean and median ratios of 1.109 and 1.035, respectively. Synoptic maps of MODIS- and VIIRS-derived Kd(PAR) data generated using the new method provide very similar and consistent spatial patterns in the U.S. East Coast region, although there are some slight differences between two satellite-derived K-d(PAR) images (similar to 1-5% higher in VIIRS K-d(PAR) compared with those from MODIS-Aqua in the shallow water region), which are possibly due to differences in spectral bands and sensor performance (e.g., calibrations). Monthly maps of VIIRS-derived K-d(PAR) data for the global ocean are also generated using the new Kd(PAR) model, and provide spatial and temporal K-d(PAR) distributions that show consistent results with those from previous studies. Thus, results show that satellite-derived K-d(PAR) data using the new K-d(PAR) model, e.g., from MODIS and VIIRS, can provide more accurate K-d(PAR) data to science communities, in particular, as an important input for ocean-atmospheric circulation, biogeochemical, and ecosystem models.

Most ocean circulation is mesoscale (scales of 50-500 km and 10-100 days), and the energy in mesoscale circulation is at least one order of magnitude greater than general circulation; therefore, the study of mesoscale oceanic structures (MOS) is crucial to ocean dynamics, making it especially useful for analyzing global changes. The detection of MOS, such as upwellings or eddies, from satellites images is significant for marine environmental studies and coastal resource management. In this paper, we present an object-based image analysis (OBIA) system which segments and classifies regions contained in sea-viewing field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS)Aqua sensor satellite images into MOS. After color clustering and hierarchical data format (HDF) file processing, the OBIA system segments images and extracts image descriptors, producing primary regions. Then, it merges regions, recalculating image descriptors for MOS identification and definition. First, regions are labeled by a human-expert, who identifies MOS: upwellings, eddies, cool, and warm eddies. Labeled regions are then classified by learning algorithms (i.e., decision tree, Bayesian network, artificial neural network, genetic algorithm, and near neighbor algorithm) from selected features. Finally, the OBIA system enables images to be queried from the user interface and retrieved by means of fuzzy descriptors and oceanic structures. We tested our system with images from the Canary Islands and the North West African coast.

Dust-storm dynamics over Sistan region, Iran: Seasonality, transport characteristics and affected areas	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The present work examines the seasonality, dust-plume altitudinal variation and affected areas for dust storms originated from the Sistan region, southeastern Iran during the summer Uune-September) months of the period 2001-2012 synthesizing local meteorological records, satellite observations (TOMS, OMI, METEOSAT, MODIS) and HYSPLIT forward trajectories. Dust-storm days (356 in total) are associated with visibility below 1 km at Zabol, Iran meteorological station with higher frequency and intensity in June and July. Monthly-mean composite maps of TOMS and OMI Al show high (>3-3.5) values over Sistan and nearby downwind areas. HYSPLIT forward-trajectory analysis at 500 m for air masses originated from Sistan on the dust-storm days shows that they usually follow an anti-clockwise transport direction at elevations usually below 2 km, initially moving southwards and then shifting to east-northeast when they are approaching the Arabian Sea coast. This is the result of the influence of the local topography and formation of thermal low-pressure systems over the arid lands. It is found that in few cases the dust storms from Sistan affect central/south Arabian Sea and India, while they control the aerosol loading over northernmost Arabian Sea. The Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI) images, which represent brightness temperature reduction due to dust presence over land, are used at specific periods of persistent dust storms over Sistan, confirming the main pathways of the dust plumes and illustrating the importance of the region as one of the most active dust sources in southwest Asia.

A total of 15 datasets prepared during 2009-11 covered cruise data and all monthly datasets, nine datasets followed with better results with paraboloid function, and others followed linear, Gaussian, and Lorentzian function regression fits. Data collection through cruises (397 points), monthly (482 points) coastal sampling, total monthly and cruise (879 points) covering four seasons were used, and the three-dimensional (3D)-paraboloid function showed better results during the seasonal scale study with the R-2 values 0.670, 0.635, 0.465, and 0.693 for the postmonsoon, summer, premonsoon, and monsoon seasons respectively. In the current study, there has been considerable improvement in R-2 (0.670 with 236 points) than the earlier study using postmonsoon data (0.560 with 105 data points). Through this algorithm, a nitrate map was generated for 11 March 2011 using Oceansat-2 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) and MODIS-aqua-derived chlorophyll and SST data, respectively. The retrieved nitrate map has been validated with in situ dataset of the same date with an R-2 value of 0.718, which suggests that the developed nitrate algorithm was statistically significant with mean normalized bias (MNB) = 0.078, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.412, and standard error of estimate (SEE) = +/- 0.4032, and the algorithm was observed to be working satisfactorily over the SW Bay of Bengal region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					398	406		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00270.1								WOS:000350575300017

A regional parameterization of euphotic depth from diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm was developed in order to improve the accuracy of VGPM. An empirical algorithm using the fluorescence line height to retrieve chlorophyll-a concentration was also employed for the estuarine waters. The modified VGPM was applied to MODIS data for primary productivity estimation. The results indicated a higher productivity in summer and autumn. The average values of the primary productivity in summer and autumn were over 300 mg m(-2) day(-1) while in spring and winter, the values were about 250 mg m(-2) day(-1).																	1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2015	38	2					506	518		10.1007/s12237-014-9830-5								WOS:000348789300008

While there are no optical properties that allow direct estimation of inorganic nitrogen, its correlation with other biogeochemical variables may permit its inference from satellite data. Here we report a new method for estimating monthly mean surface nitrate concentrations employing local multiple linear regressions on a global 1 degrees by 1 degrees resolution grid, using satellite-derived sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, and modeled mixed layer depth. Our method is able to reproduce the interannual variability of independent in situ nitrate observations at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series, the Hawaii Ocean Time series, the California coast, and the southern New Zealand region. Our new method is shown to be more accurate than previous algorithms and thus can provide improved information on temporal and spatial nutrient variations beyond the climatological mean at regional and global scales.

J	van der Linden, R; Fink, AH; Redl, R				van der Linden, Roderick; Fink, Andreas H.; Redl, Robert			Satellite-based climatology of low-level continental clouds in southern West Africa during the summer monsoon season	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Synoptic observations and various satellite products have been utilized for computing climatologies of low-level stratus over southern West Africa for the wet monsoon seasons July-September of 2006-2011. Previous studies found inconsistencies between satellite cloud products; climate models often fail to reproduce the extensive stratus decks. Therefore, a better observational reference and an understanding of its limitations are urgently needed to better validate models. Most detailed information of the spatiotemporal characteristics of low-level clouds was obtained from two Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite-based data sets. However, CALIPSO and CloudSat cross sections of cloud occurrence frequency suggest that both MSG products underestimate the low-level cloudiness over Nigeria due to shielding by abundant upper level and midlevel clouds and reveal that the stratus is lower over the continent than over the ocean. The Terra Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer product appears to overestimate the morning extent of low-level clouds. The climatology presented here shows that the zone of abundant low-level stratiform clouds is at its diurnal minimum south of 6-7 degrees N around sunset (similar to 1800 UTC). Thereafter, it starts to spread inland and reaches its maximum northward extent of 10-11 degrees N between 0900 and 1000 UTC. The maximum affected area is approximately 800,000km(2). After about 1000 UTC, the northern boundary gets fragmented due to the breakup of stratus decks into fair-weather cumuli. The stratus is most frequent around Cape Palmas, over Ivory Coast, and at the windward sides of the Mampong Range (Ghana) and Oshogbo Hills (Nigeria).

Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) and MODIS-Terra sensors-derived chlorophyll images have been generated over the study area during October 2013. There has been observation of drastic change in the chlorophyll concentration of the north-western Bay of Bengal water with effect of the cyclone "Phailin," which hit Gopalpur, Odisha coast on 12 October night at around 21: 00 h IST. The postcyclone images of Oceansat-2 OCM data and retrieved chlorophyll concentration were observed to be very high, 3.0-4.0 mg/m(3) in coastal water, which was around 0.5-1.0 mg/m(3) during precyclone. Similarly, the postcyclone chlorophyll was around 0.80-1.50 mg/m(3) in the offshore water, unusually high compared to precyclone concentration (<0.60 mg/m(3)). The cyclone track of India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been superimposed on chlorophyll images and observed as proxy along the chlorophyll front with algal bloom features. There has been observation of cooling in the northern Bay of Bengal and off Odisha coast with impact of the induced upwelling, entrainment and mixing of the water column, as evident from the sea surface temperature (SST) data analysis. Interesting features such as cold core eddies and fronts have been visualized. This study is important to assess the impact of Phailin cyclone on ocean productivity on the local and basin scale and its deviation from seasonal trend as well.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				FEB	2015	8	2					539	549		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2347036								WOS:000352277100010

Monthly level 3 and daily level 1 images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Satellite (MODIS) derived SST and chl-a from July 2002 to June 2011 around the archipelagic waters of Spermonde Indonesia were used to investigate the relationship between SST and chl-a and to forecast the potential fishing ground of Rastrelliger kanagurta. The results indicated that there was positive correlation between SST and chl-a (R=0.3, p<0.05). Positive correlation was also found between SST and chl-a with the catch of R. kanagurta (R=0.7, p<0.05). The potential fishing grounds of R. kanagurta were found located along the coast (at accuracy of 76.9%). This study indicated that, with the integration of remote sensing technology, statistical modeling and geographic information systems (GIS) technique were able to determine the relationship between SST and chl-a and also able to forecast aggregation of R. kanagurta. This may contribute in decision making and reducing search hunting time and cost in fishing activities.																	0126-6039					FEB	2015	44	2					225	232		10.17576/jsm-2015-4402-09								WOS:000352086200009

One of the most important water quality parameters that can be assessed in coastal waters and river estuaries using remote sensing techniques is suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It regulates primary production and has substantial influence on the migration of pollutants, temperature, and marine life. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) images were used to retrieve the SSC along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. MODIS of 250 m resolution data were utilized because they have the highest spatial resolution of all the MODIS bands. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns with fast motor boats, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. The goal of this article is to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) to retrieve SSC from satellite remote sensing imagery. ANN function as an intelligent structure to model a variety of nonlinear relationships because iteration-based inversion methods need long computation times for common usage. Using a validation data set and a testing data set, the network could be validated. The learning process was more efficient which resulted in a shorter learning time. The validation data set played a vital role as a stopping criterion during the training procedure to overcome the overtraining problem. A robust relationship between MODIS bands 1 and 2 and in situ data was established based on a three-layer ANN with six neurons in the hidden layer. Root mean squared error and R-2 values for this model were 0.853 and 0.969 mg/L, respectively, for all data. Results of this study reveal that the SSC in the Caspian Sea gradually decreases from west to east.

Greg			Multi-satellite time series of inherent optical properties in the California Current	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Satellite ocean color radiometry is a powerful method to study ocean biology but the relationships between satellite measurements and the in situ ocean properties are not well understood. Moreover, the measurements made with one satellite sensor may not be directly compatible with similar measurements from another sensor. We estimate inherent optical properties (IOPs) in the California Current by applying empirically optimized versions of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) of Lee et al. (2002) to satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from four ocean color sensors (OCTS, SeaWiFS, MODISA and MERIS). The set of estimated IOPs includes the total absorption coefficient at 490 nm (a490), phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 440 nm (aph440), absorption by dissolved and detrital organic matter at 440 nm (adg440) and particle backscattering coefficient at 490 nm (bbp490). The empirical inversion models are created by minimizing the deviations between satellite match-ups with in situ measurements and between the estimates of individual overlapping satellite sensors. The derived empirical algorithms were then applied to satellite Level-3 daily Rrs to create merged multi-sensor time series of the near-surface optical characteristics in the California Current region for a time period of over 16 years (November 1996-December 2012). Due to the limited number of in situ match-ups and their uneven distribution as well as the large errors in the satellite-derived Rrs, the uncertainty in the retrieved lOPs is still significant and difficult to quantify. The merged time series show the dominant annual cycle but also significant variability at interannual time scales. The ratio of adg440 to aph440 is around 1 in the transition zone, is > 1 in the coastal zone and generally <I offshore. adg440 decreases towards south and towards offshore. The long-term (similar to 16 years) trend in aph440, representative of phytoplankton biomass, shows a significant (P < 0.01) increasing trend in a wide band (similar to 500 km) along the coast and a significant decreasing trends in the oligotrophic North Pacific gyre. The trend of increasing aph440 in the upwelling areas off California is positively correlated with the increasing wind speed along the coast. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is an important indicator to reveal the condition of forest systems and has a significant importance for ecosystem models as a main input. The aim of this study is to estimate the percent tree cover of various forest stands in a Mediterranean environment based on an empirical relationship between tree coverage and remotely sensed data in Goksu Watershed located at the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. A regression tree algorithm was used to simulate spatial fractions of Pinus nigra, Cedrus libani, Pinus brutia, Juniperus excelsa and Quercus cerris using multi-temporal LANDSAT TM/ETM data as predictor variables and land cover information. Two scenes of high resolution GeoEye-1 images were employed for training and testing the model. The predictor variables were incorporated in addition to biophysical variables estimated from the LANDSAT TM/ETMdata. Additionally, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was incorporated to LANDSAT TM/ETM band settings as a biophysical variable. Stepwise linear regression (SLR) was applied for selecting the relevant bands to employ in regression tree process. SLR-selected variables produced accurate results in the model with a high correlation coefficient of 0.80. The output values ranged from 0 to 100 %. The different tree species were mapped in 30 m resolution in respect to elevation. Percent tree cover map as a final output was derived using LANDSAT TM/ETM image over Goksu Watershed and the biophysical variables. The results were tested using high spatial resolution GeoEye-1 images. Thus, the combination of the RT algorithm and higher resolution data for percent tree cover mapping were tested and examined in a complex Mediterranean environment.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2015	187	2							4	10.1007/s10661-014-4151-5								WOS:000349012200004	25604062

Results show seasonal snow covers 13% of the region, and intermittent snow covers 25%. The lower elevation boundaries of intermittent and seasonal snow zones increase from north-west to south-east. Intermittent snow is primarily found where average winter land surface temperatures are above freezing, whereas seasonal snow is primarily where winter temperatures are below freezing. However, temperatures at the boundary between intermittent and seasonal snow exhibit high regional variability, with average winter seasonal snow zone temperatures above freezing in west coast mountain ranges. Snow cover extent at peak accumulation is most variable at the upper elevations of the intermittent snow zone, highlighting the sensitivity of this snow zone boundary to climate conditions.

MULTI-SCALE MONITORING OF LANDSCAPE CHANGE AFTER THE 2011 TSUNAMI	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Great East Japan Earthquake (magnitude 9.0; occurred on 11th March 2011) and subsequent huge tsunami caused widespread damage along the Pacific Ocean coast of eastern Honshu, Japan. This research utilizes multi-resolution remote sensing images to clarify the impact on landscapes caused by this disaster, and also to monitor the subsequent survival and recovery process in the Sendai Bay region. The coastal landscape in the target area features a narrow strip of coastal sand barrier, historically stabilized by planted pine groves; backed by a low-lying plain that has traditionally been diked and converted to irrigated rice paddies. Farmsteads on the flat alluvial plain are surrounded by groves called "Igune", consisting primarily of conifers. MODIS data (250 m resolution) were employed to map the overall extent of inundation and damage on the regional landscape scale. The major damage caused by the tsunami, destruction of coastal pine forests and inundation or rice paddies on the plain, was identified at this level. Progressively finer scale analysis were then implemented using SPOT/HRG-2 (10 m resolution) data; GeoEye-1 fine resolution data (0.5 m) and very fine resolution aerial photographs (10 cm) and LiDAR. These results demonstrated the minute details of the damage and recovery process. Some patches of pine forest, for example, were seen to have survived, and some coastal plant communities were already recovering only a year after the disaster. Continuous monitoring using field work and remote sensing is required for balanced regional strategies that provide for economic and social recovery and as well as restoration of vegetation, biodiversity and vital ecosystem services.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					805	809		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-805-2015								WOS:000380531900119

GENERATING A LONG-TERM SERIES OF SST AND CHLOROPHYLL-A FOR THE COAST OF IRELAND	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The use of remote sensing has increased greatly in recent years due to technological advances and its advantages in comparison with traditional methods. In the case of Ireland however the use of these techniques is not well established and only 17% of remote sensing studies are related to marine and coastal environments. As a first step, and taking into account that fisheries and aquaculture plays an important economic and social role in Ireland, a database of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) relating to the ICES fisheries management areas is being generated. Up to now three different products have been produced. These products correspond to the annual SST Climatology and annual SST Anomalies from 1982 to 2014, as well as the annual Chl-a Climatology taking into account the different life span of CZCS (1982-1986), SeaWIFS (1997-2010), MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS-Aqua (2002-2014). Initially, the Chl-a Climatology was produced for each sensor individually while the creation of a continuous Chl-a series will be investigated in the future. Analysing the SST trends highlighted an increasing trend in SST values in Irish waters, a trend which was more pronounced in the northern areas (+0.54 degrees C in the last 10 years). Although there are differences between sensors, Chl-a concentration seems to present higher values in the Celtic Sea since 2009. Analysing the ICES Divisions individually highlighted that coastal areas presented the highest Chl-a concentrations, involving a clear differentiation in the optical properties of coastal and oceanic waters.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					933	940		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-933-2015								WOS:000380531900139

FISHING FORECASTING SYSTEM IN ADRIATIC SEA - A MODEL APPROACH BASED ON A NORMALIZED SCALAR PRODUCT OF THE SST GRADIENT AND CHL GRADIENT VECTORS	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 26-31, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				By mapping the concentration of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and the temperature of the sea surface (SST), satellite images reveal the complex dynamics of marine waters and prove to be a very powerful tool when used to detect potential fishing areas, significantly reducing the time of the search, the fuel consumption and the human effort, and simultaneously increasing the CPUE (catch per unit effort). In the present work, various techniques of multi-sensor, multi-resolution and multi-temporal data fusion are applied to multi-spectral satellite image data of MODIS-AQUA, MODIS-TERRA and VIIRS sensors, in order to detect "fronts" of chlorophyll concentration and temperature on the sea surface. According to the physical model of the phenomena, these fronts are generated by the upwelling of cold waters rich of nutrients (phytoplankton) which correspond to areas with a high concentration of pelagic fish and are characterized by high values of local gradients of SST and CHL with anti-parallel orientation. An automatic procedure has been developed to calibrate and validate the production in near-real time of daily maps of expected good fishing grounds to be provided to the FEDERPESCA fleet. The same procedure could be optimized also for other seas.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2257	2260										WOS:000371696702089

Seasonal and Inter-Annual Variability of Sea Surface Temperature at the East Coast Fishing Area off Peninsular Malaysia	2015 UKM FST POSTGRADUATE COLLOQUIUM	AIP Conference Proceedings				UKM FST Postgraduate Colloquium	APR 15-16, 2015	Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Selangor, MALAYSIA		Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol			Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to study a time-series of the aqua MODIS data imageries in the exclusive economic zone of east coast off Peninsular Malaysia. Temporal and spatial characteristics were examined to determine the dominant pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) variability from January 2003 to December 2011. The data were analysed from daily Level 1A (1km spatial resolution) to monthly composites Level 3 data using SeaDAS and ERDAS imagine software. Four modes was obtained from the analysis with the highest variance (7.9%) represented by mode 1 which explained the seasonal cycle. Mode 2 (5.11 % of total variance) showed positive and negative peak signal during March and April and in October and November with variability near the Kelantan and Pahang waters that indicated the inter monsoon. Mode 3 (3.8 % of variance) shows variability near the Terengganu, Kelantan and Johor waters to the open sea during July and August and in May and June representing the Southwest monsoon. Mode 4 (3.36 %) showed positive signal during November and December with strong signal near Pahang and Kelantan waters while weak signal was detected near Terengganu and Kelantan's open sea representing the Northeast monsoon. The SST variability was influenced by the monsoonal system which originated by the wind forcing condition that influences circulation in the study area.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1325-2				2015	1678								060022	10.1063/1.4931349								WOS:000371822200164

Neural Network Algorithms for Retrieval of Harmful Algal Blooms in the West Florida Shelf from VIIRS Satellite Observations and comparisons with other techniques, without the need for a fluorescence channel	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2015	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 23, 2015	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE				New approaches are described that use of the Ocean Color Remote Sensing Reflectance readings (OC Rrs) available from the existing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) bands to detect and retrieve Karenia brevis (KB) Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) that frequently plague the coasts of the West Florida Shelf (WFS). Unfortunately, VIIRS, unlike MODIS, does not have a 678 nm channel to detect Chlorophyll fluorescence, which is used in the normalized fluorescence height (nFLH) algorithm which has been shown to help in effectively detecting and tracking KB HABs. We report on using neural network (NN) algorithms, reported by us, and trained, using a wide range of suitably parametrized synthetic data typical of coastal waters, to form a multiband inversion algorithm which models the relationship between Rrs values at the 486, 551 and 671nm VIIRS bands against the values of phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)), CDOM absorption, non-algal particles (NAP) absorption and the particulate backscattering bb(p) coefficients, all at 443nm and permitting retrievals of these parameters. The NN retrieved a(ph443) in the WFS is in turn filtered by known limiting conditions on Chlorophyll concentration [Chla] and low backscatter properties associated with KB HABS in the WFS and used to identify, delineate and quantify them. Comparisons with in-situ measurements and other techniques including nFLH confirm the viability of both the NN retrievals and the filtering approaches devised.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-848-4				2015	9638								96380B	10.1117/12.2195339								WOS:000367320800009

The regime of aerosol asymmetry parameter over Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East based on MODIS satellite data: evaluation against surface AERONET measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Atmospheric particulates are a significant forcing agent for the radiative energy budget of the Earth-atmosphere system. The particulates' interaction with radiation, which defines their climate effect, is strongly dependent on their optical properties. In the present work, we study one of the most important optical properties of aerosols, the asymmetry parameter (g(aer)), over sea surfaces of the region comprising North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, and the Mediterranean Basin. These areas are of great interest, because of the variety of aerosol types they host, both anthropogenic and natural. Using satellite data from the collection 051 of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer, Terra and Aqua), we investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the asymmetry parameter. We generally find significant spatial variability, with larger values over regions dominated by larger size particles, e.g., outside the Atlantic coasts of northwestern Africa, where desert-dust outflow takes place. The g(aer) values tend to decrease with increasing wavelength, especially over areas dominated by small particulates. The intra-annual variability is found to be small in desert-dust areas, with maximum values during summer, while in all other areas larger values are reported during the cold season and smaller during the warm. Significant intra-annual and inter-annual variability is observed around the Black Sea. However, the inter-annual trends of g(aer) are found to be generally small. Although satellite data have the advantage of broad geographical coverage, they have to be validated against reliable surface measurements. Therefore, we compare satellite-measured values with g(aer) values measured at 69 stations of the global surface AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network), located within our region of interest. This way, we provide some insight on the quality and reliability of MODIS data. We report generally better agreement at the wavelength of 860 nm (correlation coefficient R up to 0.47), while at all wavelengths the results of the comparison were better for spring and summer.

J	Tang, JM				Tang, Junmei			Dynamic linkages between vegetation phenology and seasonal changes in water quality in the Choptank watershed, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												One of the greatest challenges in water-quality management is to understand the many complex interactions between landscape structure and nutrient transport. This study analysed the relationship between the inter-annual vegetation phenologies and seasonal change of water quality in the Choptank Basin, a typical agricultural tributary of the Chesapeake Bay (along the east coast of USA), using blended images from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. Cross-Correlogram Spectral Matching (CCSM) was applied to explain the correlation between seasonal nitrate discharge and phenologies of different crop types as well as forest. Nitrate discharges from forest-dominated watersheds are reduced as the forest greens up with an increasing percentage above the predefined enhanced vegetation index (EVI) threshold values. The crop-dominant watersheds have higher correlations than the forest-dominant watersheds between seasonal nitrate discharge and vegetation phenologies. The correlations between seasonal water quality and vegetation phenology in forest-dominant watershed have less variance than those of crop-dominant watersheds. The highest correlations were found between EVI and water quality at one or two months 'later', e.g. between the 'earlier' green-up and the 'later' nutrient discharge. This work could be applied to guide farmland planning to effectively control the non-point source pollution.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2015	36	12					3041	3057		10.1080/01431161.2015.1055603								WOS:000357295800002

The spatial attribute of oceanographic data makes them highly suitable for GIS analysis as GIS provides a natural framework for the acquisition, storage, and analysis of georeferenced data. In the present study we estimate the recent SST trends using a satellite-based climatology to characterize changes in sea surface temperature along Kerala coast since 1985. These SST variations are mapped using thermal infrared remote sensing and microwave remote sensing satellites through day and night. SST measurements derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 26 years (1985 to 2010) period were examined. The trend analysis of annual mean SST shows that inter-annual mode of SST variations dominates. An increasing trend of SST is observed in the off shore area of Kerala coast. The increasing trend about 0.2 degrees C per decade is observed in the study area. The higher rate of increment of SST in Kerala coast may be attributed to rapid industrialization, increase in air temperature. The SST analysis for Lakshadweep islands is also done and the results are compared with that of Kerala coast. It is found that the SST of Kerala coast is higher during day time and lower during night time which may be influenced by the presence of landmass nearby. While the SST variations of Lakshadweep area are part of the regional scale factors. (C) 2015 The Authors.

J	Kampf, J				Kaempf, J.			Phytoplankton blooms on the western shelf of Tasmania: evidence of a highly productive ecosystem	OCEAN SCIENCE												Satellite-derived chlorophyll a data using the standard NASA-OC3 ( ocean colour) algorithm are strongly biased by coloured dissolved organic matter and suspended sediment of river discharges, which is a particular problem for the western Tasmanian shelf. This work reconstructs phytoplankton blooms in the study region using a quadratic regression between OC3 data and chlorophyll fluorescence based on the fluorescence line height (FLH) data. This regression is derived from satellite data of the nearby Bonney upwelling region, which is devoid of river influences. To this end, analyses of 10 years of MODIS-aqua satellite data reveal the existence of a highly productive ecosystem on the western Tasmanian shelf. The region normally experiences two phytoplankton blooms per annum. The first bloom occurs during late austral summer months as a consequence of upwelling-favourable coastal winds. Hence, the western Tasmanian shelf forms a previously unknown upwelling centre of the regional upwelling system, known as Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System. The second phytoplankton bloom is a classical spring bloom also developing in the adjacent Tasman Sea. The author postulates that this region forms another important biological hot spot for the regional marine ecosystem.

J	Gupta, M				Gupta, Mukesh			Contribution of Raman Scattering in Remote Sensing Retrieval of Suspended Sediment Concentration by Empirical Modeling	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												In this paper, the author investigates the effect of Raman scattering on remotely sensed suspended sediment concentration (SSC) through the analysis of various SSC retrieval models in the coastal waters (Case 2) of the Bay of Bengal. A higher Raman contribution is observed in waters containing less SSC and chlorophyll-a concentration. Tassan's model, which used three wavelengths, i.e., 490, 555, and 670 nm, is able to account for Raman contribution at three emission wavelengths. The analysis showed the highest similar to 14% fraction in the computed SSC and 8.4% fraction in the reflectance (at 555 nm) due to Raman scattering. A fraction of similar to 14% in the SSC due to Raman scattering is significant and should be addressed in SSC retrieval models. More channels (wavelengths) are required to adequately account for the Raman contribution for estimating SSC from the remote sensing reflectance. The inclusion of blue and infrared wavelengths in the empirical models of SSC retrieval is suggested as a topic of future research, because the excitation and emission do occur at these respective wavelengths.

Using field spectral and TSS data (5.8-577.2 mg/l) collected from estuary and coast of China, we calibrated (N = 40) and validated (N = 20) the 6 TSS retrieval models in forms of single band (B1 or B2), difference of the two bands, sediment index, band ratio and log-ratio by the least-squares technique. Results showed that the quadratic model of log-ratio is of the best accuracy (Calibration: R-2 = 0.752, N = 40. Validation: TSS > 31 mg/l, RMSE = 37.9 mg/l, N = 12; TSS <= 31 mg/l, RMSE = 3.25 mg/l, N = 8). We also found that the spectral log-ratio values increased with the increasing of TSS when TSS < 31 mg/l, but decreased with increasing TSS when TSS > 31 mg/l. The findings of quadratic curve vertex (log-ratio: similar to 1.58) in the proposed TSS model indicated that the spectral log-ratio may be sensitive to TSS of both low and high concentrations. We further applied the preferred model to retrieve TSS concentration from the MODIS 250-m images in turbid estuarial and clear coastal waters, and obtained a good mapping accuracy from the result (TSS > 31 mg/l: RMSE = 38.6 mg/l, MRE = 24.7%, N = 17; TSS <= 31 mg/l: RMSE = 2.1 mg/l, MRE = 19.5%, N = 11). The vertex-based methodology of TSS model developed in the study is applicable in mapping TSS concentrations that are of a wide range variation in estuarine and coastal water bodies based on MODIS 250-m image, and as well to maximize its application potential due to high imaging frequency (two times during daytime) and appropriate space resolution of MODIS images. Therefore, the method can be used to detect the high temporal variability of TSS during tidal cycle. As such, the application of MODIS-water quality detection technology can be extended to coastal sediment movement. (C) 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

Species distribution modelling for Rhipicephalus microplus (Acari: Ixodidae) in Benin, West Africa: Comparing datasets and modelling algorithms	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE												Rhipicephalus microplus is one of the most widely distributed and economically important ticks, transmitting Babesia bigemina, B. bovis and Anaplasma marginale. It was recently introduced to West Africa on live animals originating from Brazil. Knowing the precise environmental suitability for the tick would allow veterinary health officials to draft vector control strategies for different regions of the country. To test the performance of modelling algorithms and different sets of environmental explanatory variables, species distribution models for this tick species in Benin were developed using generalized linear models, linear discriminant analysis and random forests. The training data for these models were a dataset containing reported absence or presence in 104 farms, randomly selected across Benin. These farms were sampled at the end of the rainy season, which corresponds with an annual peak in tick abundance. Two environmental datasets for the country of Benin were compared: one based on interpolated climate data (WorldClim) and one based on remotely sensed images (MODIS). The pixel size for both environmental datasets was 1 km. Highly suitable areas occurred mainly along the warmer and humid coast extending northwards to central Benin. The northern hot and drier areas were found to be unsuitable. The models developed and tested on data from the entire country were generally found to perform well, having an AUC value greater than 0.92. Although statistically significant, only small differences in accuracy measures were found between the modelling algorithms, or between the environmental datasets. The resulting risk maps differed nonetheless. Models based on interpolated climate suggested gradual variations in habitat suitability, while those based on remotely sensed data indicated a sharper contrast between suitable and unsuitable areas, and a patchy distribution of the suitable areas. Remotely sensed data yielded more spatial detail in the predictions. When computing accuracy measures on a subset of data along the invasion front, the modelling technique Random Forest outperformed the other modelling approaches, and results with MODIS-derived variables were better than those using WorldClim data. The high environmental suitability for R. microplus in the southern half of Benin raises concern at the regional level for animal health, including its potential to substantially alter transmission risk of Babesia bovis. The northern part of Benin appeared overall of low environmental suitability. Continuous surveillance in the transition zone however remains relevant, in relation to important cattle movements in the region, and to the invasive character of R. microplus. (C) 2014 The Authors.

This island is in the transport passage of the continental outflow to the Pacific Ocean when the East Asia monsoon prevails in the winter and spring. The campaign period was for March and April 2011, which corresponded to heating and non-heating periods in northern China. The effect of BC emission source regions on BC measured at Changdao Island between the heating and non-heating periods was determined by integrating the total potential source contribution function (TPSCF) model with the new monthly emission inventory in 2010 and the fire counts retrieved from MODIS during the campaign. BC concentrations were determined to be highest for similar times of day for both the heating and non-heating periods: 4.27 mu g m(-3) at 8:00 AM and 3.06 mu g m(-3) at 9:00 AM, respectively. The probable source regions for BC were primarily located in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces (and in other neighboring provinces) for both periods. However, the source regions for the non-heating period extended more to the north and southwest than those of the heating period. TPSCF values were correlated with the emission rates from residential, industry, transportation, and power plants sources in the anthropogenic emission inventory. This correlation provides an indirect and qualitative process to verify the emission inventory. In the heating period, the predominant source was the residential source in the emission inventory, and this source had a significant effect on the BC concentration. The differing peak concentrations between the two periods may be observed because of the increased residential heating during the heating period, which suggested that the measures employed by the government and environmental managers to reduce the emissions of pollutants should be stricter in the identified source regions during the heating period.

Sixty eight multi-purpose dams, accounting for 71 billion m(3) of active volume in total, have been built since the 1960s. It is estimated that an additional sixty seven dams with 68 billion m(3) of active volume will be operational in the next ten years, resulting in highly regulated downstream flows. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was analyzed based on the MODIS satellite sensor images (temporal solution of 16-days), which indicates that the flood protected areas has increased nearly three times in the past 14 years (from 2000 to 2014) in the upper part of the Vietnam Mekong Delta. Flood prevention systems were built to increase rice production from two to three crops a year and to protect residential areas in the floodplain. This development has caused a significant reduction in water retention capacity of the floodplain and higher water levels in adjacent areas. Changes in historical water levels along the lower Mekong River ranging from the most upstream (Kratie) to the middle (Kampong Cham, Phnom Penh, Tan Chau, Chau Doc and Can Tho) and the coast station (Vam Kenh) were also analyzed. Historical alterations in water level patterns (maximum, minimum, rise rate, fall rate and fluctuations) over time were then associated with the development of either dams or flood prevention systems. Rise rates at the Kratie station in the upper part of the floodplain gradually decreased by 25% between 1960 and 2013, but remained rather constant at Phnom Penh, the middle of the floodplain. In the lower part of the floodplain, alterations to water levels, rise rates and fall rates have been higher since 2006, and this corresponds to the operation of flood prevention projects in the Vietnam Mekong Delta. The impact of existing upstream dams on the Vietnam Mekong Delta is currently buffered by the Tonle Sap Lake and Cambodian floodplains. It can be concluded that the development of flood prevention systems is currently a key driver of water level changes in the delta.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							18	27										WOS:000398996200004

Observation of a turbid plume using MODIS imagery: The case of Douro estuary (Portugal)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Douro is one of the longest rivers in the Iberian Peninsula and represents the most important freshwater input into the Atlantic Ocean in the northwestern Portuguese coast. In order to fill the gaps on the comprehension of the spatial variability of the Douro estuarine plume, an innovative methodology was applied to observe and characterize this plume and its spatial and temporal variability. Using images of normalized water-leaving radiance at 555 nm from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) in combination with long-term concurrent wind, tidal and river discharge data (2003-2011), this work evaluates the effect of the main drivers (river discharge, wind and tide) on the plume features. Expected strong relationships between river discharge and turbid levels were detected. A circular pattern is well distinct off Douro estuary when the flow exceeds 500 m(3) s(-1). Under upwelling favorable winds and high river discharge regime, an offshore expansion is observed. During southerly winds, there is a plume confinement to the coast. Easterly winds produce a bulge formation with an offshore detachment from the coast while westerly winds tend to confine freshwater close to the shoreline and decrease the cross-shore advection. Under high river discharges, a remarkable tidal influence in the near-field regions is observed close to the coast and near the river mouth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Why do satellite imageries show exceptionally high chlorophyll in the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Bay during the Norteast Monsoon?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and the Palk Bay (PB) are two least studied marine environments located between India and Sri Lanka. Exceptionally high chlorophyll a concentration in the GoM and the PB during the Northeast Monsoon (November-February) is a consistent feature in satellite imageries, which has been attributed to the intrusion of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) waters. The analyses of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and field chlorophyll data collected from 30 locations in the Indian sector of the GoM and the PB in January 2011 showed significant overestimations in the satellite data. This error was much higher in the PB (60-80 %) as compared to the GoM (18-28 %). The multivariate analyses evidenced that the exceptionally high satellite chlorophyll in the PB is contributed largely by turbidity, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and bottom reflectance. The paper cautions that though MODIS is superior in estimating chlorophyll a in optically complex waters, there are still chances of overestimations in regions like the PB.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2014	186	11					7781	7792		10.1007/s10661-014-3966-4								WOS:000343051400061	25142503

Variation of ice crystal size, shape, and asymmetry parameter in tops of tropical deep convective clouds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The variation of ice crystal properties in the tops of deep convective clouds off the north coast of Australia is analyzed. Cloud optical thickness, ice effective radius, aspect ratio of ice crystal components, crystal distortion parameter and asymmetry parameter are simultaneously retrieved from combined measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) satellite instruments. The data are divided into periods with alternating weak and strong convection. Mostly plate-like particle components with aspect ratios closer to unity and lower asymmetry parameters characterize strongly convective periods, while weakly convective periods generally show lower aspect ratios, relatively more column-like shapes and somewhat greater asymmetry parameters. Results for strongly convective periods show that, with increasing cloud top temperature, the distortion parameter generally decreases, while the asymmetry parameter and effective radius increase. For one of the strongly convective periods, the rate at which effective radii increase with cloud top temperature is more than double that of the other periods, while the temperature dependence of the other microphysical quantities for this period is substantially weaker. Atmospheric state analysis indicates that these differences are concurrent with differences in middle-to-upper tropospheric zonal wind shear. The observed variation of microphysical properties may have significant effects on the shortwave radiative fluxes and cloud absorption associated with deep convection. Additionally, MODIS collection 5 effective radii are estimated to be biased small with an artificially narrow range. Collection 6 products are expected to have less severe biases that depend on cloud top temperature and atmospheric conditions.

Both the quantity of the uplifted dust and its spatio-temporal evolution are examined using satellite observations and a numerical simulation. The dust emission during this event was initiated by a mesoscale cold pool emanating from mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that developed over northern Niger and Mali on 3 August. This event is one of several exceptional northward surges of the West African Monsoon (WAM) during the 2006 wet season. We examine the propagation of the cold pool and associated dust lofting using high temporal resolution false-colour dust product images from the Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (MSG-SEVIRI). Observations from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) are used to characterize the vertical structure of the dust cloud as it spreads over the Sahara and across the Atlantic coast. The European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (ECMWF-AMMA) special reanalysis was used to describe the synoptic conditions that accompanied this event. Furthermore, a numerical simulation using the mesoscale model MesoNH was performed to estimate the emissions and the westward transport of dust during this event. MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) satellite imagery has then been used to track the dust plume across the Atlantic Ocean to Barbados, where comparisons are made with the local dust record there. The dusty cold pool covered southern Algeria and a large part of northern Mali and western Niger attaining a total area close to 2 x 10(6) km(2). It extended over 2-3 km in altitude and had an AOD on the order of 1.5 and an estimated total dust load of about 1.5 Tg on average. Following daytime heating, the dusty cold pool and associated northward surge of moisture favoured the development of new convection and additional precipitation over the Sahara. The northward extension of the dusty cold pool was accompanied by a collapse of the Saharan heat-low, a characteristic feature of monsoon surges. A model-estimated quantity of 0.4 Tg of the dust produced during this event was subjected to westward transport toward the Atlantic Ocean after being mixed upward in the thickening boundary layer by the daytime heating over the Sahara to altitudes as high as 5-6 km. The arrival of the dust plume in Barbados in the Caribbean Sea 9 days after its departure from the west coast of Africa was characterized by a peak in dust concentration of 48.5 mu g m(-3).

Estuaries located in the northeastern part of the Texas coast receive more rainfall than estuaries in the southwestern part, and consequently greater runoff and concomitant freshwater inflow. Extreme inter-annual variability of precipitation caused by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events is another characteristic of the Texas coast. During El Nino periods, salinities in Texas estuaries decrease because of increased precipitation and increased freshwater inflow to the coast. During La Nina periods, salinities increase due to drier climatic conditions and reduced freshwater inflow. The combination of the climatic gradient and temporal variability of freshwater inflow drive changes in the frequency, timing, duration, and magnitude of river flows to coastal waters, which in turn control the salinity, nutrients, organic matter, and sediments in Texas estuaries. Chlorophyll biomass, as an indicator of primary production, was estimated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from July 2002 to December 2011 for all Texas estuaries. The climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean delivers a cascading signal via freshwater inflow changes to estuaries that effects primary production subsequently. The maximum correlation was found at the 5th lag (month) with correlation coefficient (rho) being 0.45 (NINO3.4 is fixed as a reference). The combination of the local climatic gradient and quasi-periodic natural variability in ENSO has been influencing estuarine ecosystem dynamics over decadal scales in this region. The present study demonstrates that freshwater inflow is an important driver in maintaining primary productivity of Texas estuaries, which is required to maintain estuarine health and sustainability.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2014					68		65	73		10.2112/SI68-009.1								WOS:000347145600010

Andrea; Li, Edward; Wong, Alexander			Sea Ice Surface Temperature Estimation Using MODIS and AMSR-E Data Within a Guided Variational Model Along the Labrador Coast	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING					IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 21-26, 2013	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc				In this study, a new method, entitled as the multi-modality guided variational (MGV) method, is proposed, in which the data from a passive microwave sensor is used jointly with the data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate the sea ice surface temperature (IST). The method augments existing sea IST values from the MODIS IST map, while filling in areas in the MODIS image that may be sparsely sampled due to the cloud cover, or due to increased spacing between the pixels at the swath edges. The former issue is particularly problematic in the marginal ice zone, where the atmospheric conditions often lead to persistent cloud cover. The sea IST is of interest because it can be used to estimate the sea ice thickness, an important parameter for shipping, climate change, and weather forecasting applications. The impact of the MGV method is checked through a comparison between the sea ice thickness calculated using the swath surface temperature and that calculated using the surface temperature from MGV. Using the operational ice charts as a guideline, it is found that the sea ice thickness values calculated using the MGV surface temperature are realistic, and there is a 16% increase in the number of sea ice thickness data points available when the MGV method is used as compared to when the swath data are used.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				SEP	2014	7	9			SI		3685	3694		10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2292795								WOS:000344992200002

These fronts generally attract fish and may therefore be targeted by marine top-predators. In the southern Benguela upwelling system, such fronts might be used as environmental cues by foraging seabirds. In this study we analyzed high-frequency foraging tracks (GPS, 1 s sampling) of Cape gannets Morus capensis from two colonies located on the west and east coast of South Africa in relation to mesoscale fronts detected on daily high-resolution chlorophyll-a maps (MODIS, 1 km). We tested the association of (i) searching behavior and (ii) diving activity of foraging birds with mesoscale fronts. We found that Cape gannets shift from transiting to area-restricted search mode (ARS) at a distance from fronts ranging between 2 and 11 km (median is 6.7 km). This suggests that Cape gannets may be able to sense fronts (smell or vision) or other predators, and that such detection triggers an intensified investigation of their surroundings (i.e. ARS). Also we found that diving probability increases near fronts in 11 out of 20 tracks investigated (55%), suggesting that Cape gannets substantially use fronts for feeding; in the remaining cases (45%), birds may have used other cues for feeding including fishing vessels, particularly for gannets breeding on the west coast. We demonstrated in this study that oceanographic structures such as mesoscale fronts are important environmental cues used by a foraging seabird within the rich waters of an upwelling system. There is now need for further investigations on how Cape gannets actually detect these fronts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Storm-Surge Flooding on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska	ARCTIC												Coastal regions of Alaska are regularly affected by intense storms of ocean origin, the frequency and intensity of which are expected to increase as a result of global climate change. The Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), situated in western Alaska on the eastern edge of the Bering Sea, is one of the largest deltaic systems in North America. Its low relief makes it especially susceptible to storm-driven flood tides and increases in sea level. Little information exists on the extent of flooding caused by storm surges in western Alaska and its effects on salinization, shoreline erosion, permafrost thaw, vegetation, wildlife, and the subsistence-based economy. In this paper, we summarize storm flooding events in the Bering Sea region of western Alaska during 1913-2011 and map both the extent of inland flooding caused by autumn storms on the central YKD, using Radarsat-1 and MODIS satellite imagery, and the drift lines, using high-resolution IKONOS satellite imagery and field surveys. The largest storm surges occurred in autumn and were associated with high tides and strong (>65 km hr(-1)) southwest winds. Maximum inland extent of flooding from storm surges was 30.3 km in 2005, 27.4 km in 2006, and 32.3 km in 2011, with total flood area covering 47.1%, 32.5%, and 39.4% of the 6730 km(2) study area, respectively. Peak stages for the 2005 and 2011 storms were 3.1 m and 3.3 m above mean sea level (amsl), respectively-almost as high as the 3.5 m amsl elevation estimated for the largest storm observed (in November 1974). Several historically abandoned village sites lie within the area of inundation of the largest flood events. With projected sea level rise, large storms are expected to become more frequent and cover larger areas, with deleterious effects on freshwater ponds, non-saline habitats, permafrost, and landscapes used by nesting birds and local people.																	0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	2014	67	3					360	374		10.14430/arctic4403								WOS:000343641200006

Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measurements computed from in-water radiometry profiles along with a(CDOM)(lambda) data are applied to develop several types of algorithms for the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color satellite sensors, which involve least squares linear regression of a(CDOM)(X) with (1)R-rs band ratios, (2) quasi-analytical algorithm-based (QAA-based) products of total absorption coefficients, (3) multiple R-rs bands within a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis, and (4) diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d). The relative error (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) for the MLR retrievals of a(CDOM)(275), a(CDOM)(355), a(CDOM)(380), a(CDOM)(412) and a(CDOM)(443) for our study region range from 20.4 to 23.9% for MODIS-Aqua and 27.3-30% for SeaWiFS. Because of the narrower range of CDOM spectral slope values, the MAPD for the MLR S-275:295 and S-300:600 algorithms are much lower ranging from 9.9% and 9.1% for SeaWiFS, respectively, and 8.7% and 9.7% for MODIS, respectively. Multi-year, seasonal and spatial MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS distributions of Claw, S-275:295 and S-300:600 processed with these algorithms are consistent with field measurements and the processes that impact CDOM levels along the continental shelf of the northeastern U.S. Several satellite data processing factors correlate with higher uncertainty in satellite retrievals of a(CDOM), S-275:295 and S-300.600 within the coastal ocean, including solar zenith angle, sensor viewing angle, and atmospheric products applied for atmospheric corrections. Algorithms that include ultraviolet R-rs bands provide a better fit to field measurements than algorithms without the ultraviolet R-rs bands. This suggests that satellite sensors with ultraviolet capability could provide better retrievals of CDOM. Because of the strong correlations between CDOM parameters and DOM constituents in the coastal ocean, satellite observations of CDOM parameters can be applied to study the distributions, sources and sinks of DOM, which are relevant for understanding the carbon cycle, modeling the Earth system, and to discern how the Earth is changing.

The impacts of the great Mississippi/Atchafalaya River flood on the oceanography of the Atchafalaya Shelf	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Rivers are the primary means by which water, sediment, and dissolved material are transported from the continents to the ocean. Despite previous advances, much remains to be learned about the dynamics of large shelf-discharging rivers, and their functional differences with deep water-discharging rivers, particularly with respect to the distribution of sediments in the coastal zone. The great Mississippi/Atchafalaya River flood of 2011 provided an excellent opportunity to examine the impacts of a large, shelf-discharging river on the coastal ocean, and the role that event pulses from such rivers play in the delivery of sediment to the inner continental shelf. Vessel-based surveys were conducted on the inner-continental shelf within the Atchafalaya and Mississippi River plume regions, providing in situ measurements of salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, particle size, and current velocity profiles. MODIS satellite images and Be-7 measurements were used to assist in data interpretation. We demonstrate that the Atchafalaya River plume produced intense vertical gradients in temperature, salinity, oxygen and turbidity. This occurred despite the shallow bathymetry of this system and the presence of winds, which alternated between onshore to offshore, and that might have otherwise mixed systems with less freshwater. Sedimentation rates along the inner-continental shelf were about 5-10 times greater than those measured previously during smaller "typical" floods. This large deposit is likely to be preserved, at least in the near term, because sedimentation occurred beyond normal depths of wave reworking and the intense stratification induced by this flood likely reduced mixing at the time of sedimentation. A sediment budget for this system reveals that sediment fluxes to the coastal zone during 2011 were similar to those observed in previous years, suggesting that this system is supply limited, rather than transport limited. As such, we postulate that the major impact of this flood was to change the location of the depocenter of Atchafalaya River sediments, rather than increase the annual flux of sediments to the coastal zone. These findings imply that extreme flood events may not be an ideal analog for coastal restoration along this deltaic coast. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Alkawri, A; Gamoyo, M				Alkawri, Abdulsalam; Gamoyo, Majambo			Remote sensing of phytoplankton distribution in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Analysis of high-resolution 4 km sea surface temperature, Chlorophyll a (Chl a), and wind datasets provides a detailed description of the spatio-temporal seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on-board aqua platform (MODIS Aqua) data andsynoptic observations in the Red Sea, Chl a varies from north to south, with the northern part appearing to be oligotrophic. This is likely due to the absence of strong mixing and low nutrient intrusion in comparison to the southern part during winter. In the Gulf of Aden, the emergence of upwelling cell is clearly evident along the coast of Yemen, and is only distinct from the summer-autumn seasons. Most notable is the pulsating nature of the upwelling, with warm and cold events clearly distinguished with phytoplankton response to this physical forcing also evident. The phytoplankton biomass distribution varies considerably between the two regions of study. In both study areas, water temperature and prevailing winds control nutrient concentrations.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				SEP	2014	33	9					93	99		10.1007/s13131-014-0527-1								WOS:000341334500011

The Lake Manzala of Egypt: an ambiguous future	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Lake Manzala of Egypt has a relatively short history and its future, however, is uncertain. The lake which was the biggest coastal wetland along the Mediterranean Coast is moving toward its disappearance by two opposite forces, one of them is the shrinking of the water body by siltation of sediments coming from agricultural lands and the abundance of weeds and swamp vegetation as well as the drying practices for agriculture, whereas the other force incorporates the removal of the coastal sand bar separating the lake from the Mediterranean Sea by erosion, which should eventually lead to the conversion of the lake into a coastal embayment instead of being a closed coastal lagoon. The study provided a spatiotemporal change analysis of the lake using remotely sensed data.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				SEP	2014	72	6					1801	1809		10.1007/s12665-014-3088-x								WOS:000341083800004

Coscinodiscus radiatus, Chaetoceros lorenzianus and the pennate diatom Thalassiothrix frauenfeldii was investigated in the context of its impact on phytoplankton and microzooplankton (the loricate ciliate tintinnids) in the coastal regions of Sagar Island, the western part of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India. Both number (15-18 species) and cell densities (12.3 x 10(3) cells l(-1) to 11.4 x 10(5) cells l(-1)) of phytoplankton species increased during peak bloom phase, exhibiting moderately high species diversity (H' = 2.86), richness (R' = 6.38) and evenness (E' = 0.80). The diatom bloom, which existed for a week, had a negative impact on the tintinnid community in terms of drastic changes in species diversity index (1.09-0.004) and population density (582.5 x 10(3) to 50 x 10(3) ind m(-3)). The bloom is suggested to have been driven by the aquaculture activities and river effluents resulting high nutrient concentrations in this region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll maps have been interpreted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, LL; Wang, YP				Li, Lili; Wang, Yunpeng			What drives the aerosol distribution in Guangdong - the most developed province in Southern China?	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												This paper uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over Guangdong, the most developed province in China, during 2010-2012. Linear regression and self-organizing maps (SOM) are used to investigate the relationship between AOT and its affecting factors, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), elevation, urbanized land fraction, and several socio-economic variables. Results show that the highest values of tau(0.55) mainly occur over the rapidly-developing Pearl River Delta (PRD) region and the eastern coast. Seasonal averaged AOT is highest in summer (0.416), followed by spring (0.351), winter (0.292), and autumn (0.254). From unary linear regression and SOM analysis, AOT is shown to be strongly negatively correlated to NDVI (R(2=)0.782) and elevation (R(2=)0.731), and positively correlated with socio-economic factors, especially GDP, industry and vehicle density (R-2 above 0.73), but not primary industry. Multiple linear regression between AOT and the contributing factors shows much higher R-2 values (>0.8), indicative of the clear relationships between AOT and variables.

Shibly; Takewaka, Satoshi			Analyses on phenological and morphological variations of mangrove forests along the southwest coast of Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Drastic changes in river discharge and salinity levels are threatening the phenology and morphology of the coastal mangrove forests of the Sundarbans of Bangladesh. We have used AVHRR GIMMS (1985-2006) and MODIS (2005-2010) satellite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to identify the temporal variation of the phenology of the mangroves. Linear interpolation and Fourier-based adjustment were applied to remove noise from the NDVI time series. Then linear regression analysis on a single area (8 km ae center dot 8 km) and a composite of 36 areas for three NDVI statistics the annual minimum, annual average, and annual maximum were performed--over the time periods 1985-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2006 and 2005-2010 to identify possible functional changes in NDVI time series around the Sundarbans. Furthermore, we used fourteen LANDSAT images spanning the period 1989-2010 to estimate the spatiotemporal rate of shoreline changes over the three time periods 1989-2000, 2000-2006, and 2006-2010. A decreasing trend in the annual minimum NDVI was observed in most of the areas of the Sundarbans for the period 1990-2000. During the years 2000-2006, the trends of the three NDVI statistics became significantly positive, indicating an improvement of the mangrove phenology. In the period 2005-2010, a decreasing trend in all the NDVI variables was again dominant. The coast underwent rapid erosion from 1989-2000 and 2006-2010. However, the rate substantially declined between 2000 and 2006, when accretion was dominant. The advent of the upstream Farakka barrage caused a significant reduction in the Ganges-Gorai River discharge and increased the salinity in and around the Sundarbans. Our study concludes that this may be responsible for the degradation of mangrove phenology and accelerated erosion in the earlier and recent periods. In the interim, 2000-2006, improved river discharge and salinity levels due to the Ganges water sharing agreement (1996) and dredging of the Gorai River bed (1998-1999) enhanced the mangrove phenology and helped the coast to gain land.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2014	18	4					339	357		10.1007/s11852-014-0321-4								WOS:000340375400003

Annual variability in leaf area index and isoprene and monoterpene emissions during drought years in Texas	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												A pathway through which drought may affect estimates of emissions of isoprene and other biogenic volatile organic compounds is through changes in leaf area index (LA!), a key input parameter for biogenic emissions models. Spatial and temporal variations of an LAI product derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the relative impact Of LAI versus meteorological fields and soil moisture on emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes were examined using the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) for four climate regions in eastern Texas. The four regions had diverse land cover and climatology during 2006-2011, years with recurring extreme to exceptional drought. Maximum monthly interannual LAI variations exceeded 20% in the North and South Central regions, but were less than 20% in East Texas and Upper Coast. Estimates of isoprene and monoterpene emissions in the two central regions were lower by as much as -24% due to significant reductions of LAI during droughts in 2006 and 2011. Maximum interannual variability in estimated monthly isoprene emissions exceeded 30%. Reductions in LAI during drought may be accompanied by increases in temperature and surface insolation that exert competing effects on biogenic emissions estimates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of river run-off on water clarity across the central Great Barrier Reef	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Changes in water clarity across the shallow continental shelf of the central Great Barrier Reef were investigated from ten years of daily river load, oceanographic and MODIS-Aqua data. Mean photic depth (i.e., the depth of 10% of surface irradiance) was related to river loads after statistical removal of wave and tidal effects. Across the 25,000 km(2) area, photic depth was strongly related to river freshwater and phosphorus loads (R-2 = 0.65 and 0.51, respectively). In the six wetter years, photic depth was reduced by 19.8% and below water quality guidelines for 156 days, compared to 9 days in the drier years. After onset of the seasonal river floods, photic depth was reduced for on average 6-8 months, gradually returning to clearer baseline values. Relationships were strongest inshore and midshelf (similar to 12-80 km from the coast), and weaker near the chronically turbid coast. The data show that reductions in river loads would measurably improve shelf water clarity, with significant ecosystem health benefits. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Monitoring of ocean surface algal blooms in coastal and oceanic waters around India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) sensor MODIS-Aqua provides an important tool for reliable observations of the changing ocean surface algal bloom paradigms in coastal and oceanic waters around India. A time series of the MODIS-Aqua-derived OSABI (ocean surface algal bloom index) and its seasonal composite images report new information and comprehensive pictures of these blooms and their evolution stages in a wide variety of events occurred at different times of the years from 2003 to 2011, providing the first large area survey of such phenomena around India. For most of the years, the results show a strong seasonal pattern of surface algal blooms elucidated by certain physical and meteorological conditions. The extent of these blooms reaches a maximum in winter (November-February) and a minimum in summer (June-September), especially in the northern Arabian Sea. Their spatial distribution and retention period are also significantly increased in the recent years. The increased spatial distribution and intensity of these blooms in the northern Arabian Sea in winter are likely caused by enhanced cooling, increased convective mixing, favorable winds, and atmospheric deposition of the mineral aerosols (from surrounding deserts) of the post-southwest monsoon period. The southward Oman coastal current and southwestward winds become apparently responsible for their extension up to the central Arabian Sea. Strong upwelling along this coast further triggers their initiation and growth. Though there is a warming condition associated with increased sea surface height anomalies along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka in winter, surface algal bloom patches are still persistent along these coasts due to northeast monsoonal winds, enhanced precipitation, and subsequent nutrient enrichment in these areas. The occurrence of the surface algal blooms in the northern Bay of Bengal coincides with a region of the well-known Ganges-Brahmaputra Estuarine Frontal (GBEF) system, which increases supply of nutrients in addition to the land-derived inputs triggering surface algal blooms in this region. Low density (initiation stage) of such blooms observed in clear oceanic waters southeast and northeast of Sri Lanka may be caused by the vertical mixing processes (strong monsoonal winds) and the occurrence of Indian Ocean Dipole events. Findings based on the analyses of time series satellite data indicate that the new information on surface algal blooms will have important bearing on regional fisheries, ecosystem and environmental studies, and implications of climate change scenarios.

J	Petus, C; Collier, C; Devlin, M; Rasheed, M; McKenna, S				Petus, Caroline; Collier, Catherine; Devlin, Michelle; Rasheed, Michael; McKenna, Skye			Using MODIS data for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health: A case study in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Stretching more than 2000 km along the Queensland coast, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBR) shelters over 43,000 square km of seagrass meadows. Despite the status of marine protected area and World Heritage listing of the GBR, local seagrass meadows are under stress from reduced water quality levels; with reduction in the amount of light available for seagrass photosynthesis defined as the primary cause of seagrass loss throughout the GBR. Methods have been developed to map GBR plume water types by using MODE quasi-true colour (hereafter true colour) images reclassified in function of their dominant colour. These data can be used as an interpretative tool for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health (as defined in this study by the seagrass area and abundance) at different spatial and temporal scales. We tested this method in Cleveland Bay, in the northern GBR, where substantial loss in seagrass area and biomass was detected by annual monitoring from 2007 to 2011. A strong correlation was found between bay-wide seagrass meadow area and biomass and exposure to turbid Primary (sediment-dominated) water type. There was also a strong correlation between the changes of biomass and area of individual meadows and exposure of seagrass ecosystems to Primary water type over the 5-year period. Seagrass meadows were also grouped according to the dominant species within each meadow, irrespective of location within Cleveland Bay. These consolidated community types did not correlate well with the exposure to Primary water type, and this is likely to be due to local environmental conditions with the individual meadows that comprise these groupings. This study proved that remote sensing data provide the synoptic window and repetitivity required to investigate changes in water quality conditions over time. Remote sensing data provide an opportunity to investigate the risk of marine-coastal ecosystems to light limitation due to increased water turbidity when in situ water quality data is not available or is insufficient.

Seasonal variations of total suspended matter (TSM) in the Gulf of Khambhat, west coast of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES					5th Indian National Conference on Harbour and Ocean Engineering (INCHOE)	FEB 05-07, 2014	CSIR NIO, Goa, INDIA		CSIR NIO			Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is an important parameter for determining the water quality in coastal regions as it is responsible for the reduction in the light available to the aquatic vegetation which subsequently alters the health and quality of the water body. In the present study, total suspended matter (TSM) was derived from multi-temporal MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) Terra images. Red-band reflectance with a spatial resolution of 250 m was used to study the sediment dynamics of the macro-tidal region of the Gulf of Khambhat for 2009 (drought year) and 2010 (rain fed year). This has been done after establishing a significant correlation of 0.8 with in-situ TSM data. Through this study, the relative contribution of the physical factors (rainfall and tides) in the spatial and temporal distribution of total suspended matter concentrations of Gulf of Khambhat has been demonstrated.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2014	43	7					1202	1209										WOS:000209743200014

MODIS-Aqua sensor data (1.1 km) of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a, and geostrophic current fields were analyzed during the sampling periods. In the northern part of the study area the pattern of the thermohaline structure shows subsurface intrusion of modified subarctic water, especially during February and April of both years. To the south, in July and October 2011, evident indications of subtropical subsurface water were found. The geostrophic current fields in February and April show a surface southward flow along the coast, which changes direction towards the North Pole in July and October. In spring, the satellite-derived SST showed negative anomalies of up to 4.5 degrees C in the coastal zone, corresponding to cold upwelled water rising to the surface from a depth of 60-70 m. Based on the results, the study area can be considered the southern boundary of the transition zone between the subarctic and subtropical waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, with marked seasonality.																	0185-3880					JUN	2014	40	2					89	112		10.7773/cm.v40i2.2314								WOS:000342238600002

Much of the focus has gone into determining which interpolation method is best suited for creating gridded climate surfaces, which often a covariate such as elevation (Digital Elevation Model, DEM) is used to improve the interpolation accuracy. One key area where little research has addressed is in determining which covariate best improves the accuracy in the interpolation. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out in determining which covariates were most suitable for interpolating climatic variables (e.g. precipitation, mean temperature, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature). We compiled data for each climate variable from 1950 to 1999 from approximately 500 weather stations across the Western United States (32 degrees to 49 degrees latitude and -124.7 degrees to -112.9 degrees longitude). In addition, we examined the uncertainty of the interpolated climate surface. Specifically, Thin Plate Spline (TPS) was used as the interpolation method since it is one of the most popular interpolation techniques to generate climate surfaces. We considered several covariates, including DEM, slope, distance to coast (Euclidean distance), aspect, solar potential, radar, and two Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A tenfold cross-validation was applied to determine the uncertainty of the interpolation based on each covariate. In general, the leading covariate for precipitation was radar, while DEM was the leading covariate for maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures. A comparison to other products such as PRISM and WorldClim showed strong agreement across large geographic areas but climate surfaces generated in this study (ClimSurf) had greater variability at high elevation regions, such as in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.																	0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN	2014	34	7					2258	2268		10.1002/joc.3835								WOS:000337558200011						
J	Potter, C				Potter, Christopher			Monitoring the production of Central California coastal rangelands using satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												There is a long history of livestock grazing on the California Central Coast, dating back over 150 years. In this study, methods were reviewed and results presented for analysis of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor data to monitor year-to-year variation of forage production on Central Coast rangelands around Big Sur, California. Time series plots from 2000 to 2012 of vegetation greenness for ten rangeland sites showed similar inter-annual patterns in satellite yield index (SYI) values. Most sites reached their maximum greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments, 2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive rangelands at the expense of forested lands.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2014	18	3					213	220		10.1007/s11852-014-0308-1								WOS:000336739500006

Environmental monitoring of El Hierro Island submarine volcano, by combining low and high resolution satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												El Hierro Island, located at the Canary Islands Archipelago in the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been rocked by thousands of tremors and earthquakes since July 2011. Finally, an underwater volcanic eruption started 300 m below sea level on October 10, 2011. Since then, regular multidisciplinary monitoring has been carried out in order to quantify the environmental impacts caused by the submarine eruption. Thanks to this natural tracer release, multisensorial satellite imagery obtained from MODIS and MERIS sensors have been processed to monitor the volcano activity and to provide information on the concentration of biological, chemical and physical marine parameters. Specifically, low resolution satellite estimations of optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration under these abnormal conditions have been assessed. These remote sensing data have played a fundamental role during field campaigns guiding the oceanographic vessel to the appropriate sampling areas. In addition, to analyze El Hierro submarine volcano area, WorldView-2 high resolution satellite spectral bands were atmospherically and deglinted processed prior to obtain a high-resolution optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient model. This novel algorithm was developed using a matchup data set with MERIS and MODIS data, in situ transmittances measurements and a seawater radiative transfer model. Multisensor and multitemporal imagery processed from satellite remote sensing sensors have demonstrated to be a powerful tool for monitoring the submarine volcanic activities, such as discolored seawater, floating material and volcanic plume, having shown the capabilities to improve the understanding of submarine volcanic processes.

Those studies mainly calculate the area of NDVI, and get the information of the time, area, scope, floating path of Ulva. prolifera by using threshold segmentation method. The feasibility of monitoring Ulva. prolifera information based on MODIS data and the macroscopic regularity of the outburst of Ulva. prolifera was elementally studied. The results showed that Ulva. prolifera first generated in the middle of May or early June, the time, area, scope of Ulva. prolifera reached a maximum, but the relative crowding density was earlier or later when Ulva. prolifera developed into a outburst. Finally, Ulva. prolifera died away after existing for 71 days in the late July or the early August. Wholly, the floating path moved to the northwest from off the coast to offshore. Based on those aspects above, the outburst of Ulva. prolifera in 2008 and 2009 was more serious than others.																	1000-0593					MAY	2014	34	5					1312	1318		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)05-1312-07								WOS:000337932900033

The results show noticeable differences in cloud water over land and over ocean, as well as latitudinal variations. Large values of cloud water are mainly distributed over the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, eastern ITCZ, regions off the west coast of the continents as well as tropical rain forest. Cloud water path (CWP), liquid water path (LWP), and ice water path (IWP) from these datasets show a relatively good agreement in distributions and zonal means. The results of trend analyzing show an increasing trend in CWP, and also a significant increasing trend of LWP can be found in the dataset of ISCCP, ERA-Interim, and CFSR over the ocean. Besides the long-term variation trend, rises of cloud water are found when temperature and water vapor exhibit a positive anomaly. EOF analyses are also applied to the anomalies of cloud water, the first dominate mode of CWP and IWP are similar, and a phase change can be found in the LWP time coefficient around 1999 in ISCCP and CFSR and around 2002 in ERA-Interim.

(Kees); Rembold, Felix			Historical extension of operational NDVI products for livestock insurance in Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Droughts induce livestock losses that severely affect Kenyan pastoralists. Recent index insurance schemes have the potential of being a viable tool for insuring pastoralists against drought-related risk. Such schemes require as input a forage scarcity (or drought) index that can be reliably updated in near realtime, and that strongly relates to livestock mortality. Generally, a long record (>25 years) of the index is needed to correctly estimate mortality risk and calculate the related insurance premium. Data from current operational satellites used for large-scale vegetation monitoring span over a maximum of 15 years, a time period that is considered insufficient for accurate premium computation. This study examines how operational NDVI datasets compare to, and could be combined with the non-operational recently constructed 30-year GIMMS AVHRR record (1981-2011) to provide a near-real time drought index with a long term archive for the arid lands of Kenya. We compared six freely available, near-real time NDVI products: five from MODIS and one from SPOT-VEGETATION. Prior to comparison, all datasets were averaged in time for the two vegetative seasons in Kenya, and aggregated spatially at the administrative division level at which the insurance is offered. The feasibility of extending the resulting aggregated drought indices back in time was assessed using jackknifed R2 statistics (leave-one-year-out) for the overlapping period 2002-2011. We found that division-specific models were more effective than a global model for linking the division-level temporal variability of the index between NDVI products. Based on our results, good scope exists for historically extending the aggregated drought index, thus providing a longer operational record for insurance purposes. We showed that this extension may have large effects on the calculated insurance premium. Finally, we discuss several possible improvements to the drought index. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Scott, KA; Buehner, M; Carrieres, T				Scott, K. Andrea; Buehner, Mark; Carrieres, Tom			An Assessment of Sea-Ice Thickness Along the Labrador Coast From AMSR-E and MODIS Data for Operational Data Assimilation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												In this paper, sea-ice thickness values are calculated along the Labrador coast using data from two sensors representative of those available for operational data assimilation. Data from the first sensor, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are used to calculate the ice thickness using a heat balance equation. Relationships between the MODIS ice thickness and polarization ratio from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) are used to calculate the thickness of thin ice (less than 0.2 m) from the AMSR-E data. This is done for each frequency on the AMSR-E sensor in the range of 6.9-36.5 GHz. Through comparison with data from ice charts, it is found that the errors are lowest for thickness values calculated from low-frequency AMSR-E data. The accuracies of the ice thickness from MODIS, AMSR-E, operational ice charts, and two moored upward looking sonars are further assessed using the triple collocation method. It is found that the error associated with ice thickness from AMSR-E is the lowest and the error associated with ice thickness from MODIS is the highest. While the MODIS data represent the small-scale variability of the sea-ice thickness better than the AMSR-E data, the MODIS data can produce spurious values of ice thickness due to unmasked clouds. To use ice thickness from MODIS in an automated algorithm, quality control would need to be applied to the MODIS data to remove unmasked clouds which lead to spurious values of thick ice. The errors calculated for the ice thickness from AMSR-E, which are calculated based on a relationship calibrated with MODIS ice thickness from a clear-sky day, indicate that these data would be useful for operational data assimilation.

Despite the established importance of mangroves to the coastal environment, degradation of this system continues mainly due to anthropogenic pressure. Over the past few decades, satellite remote sensing has been used to map and monitor changes of mangrove forests worldwide. This study was aimed at characterizing the health status of the Indian mangrove on the basis of multiyear, multi-season, remote sensing data. Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) from Systeme Pour I Observation de la Terre - Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) coinciding with the stress period (March - May) for one decade (1999 - 2008) was subjected to maximum value compositing (MVC). This was used to develop a four-category health index status based on threshold values. Results showed that around 38 % and 27 % of tibial mangrove in India belonged to very-healthy and healthy categories, respectively. In general the health index was lower in western coast mangroves compared to east coast. The health index was highest for the island mangrove systems (Andaman and Nicobar), and lowest along the Gujarat coast.																	0564-3295					MAY	2014	55	2					245	253										WOS:000331430100009

The aim of this study is to investigate temporal variations in total suspended matter (TSM) distribution along a coastal region using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), the world's first geostationary ocean color observation satellite. TSM concentrations and water-leaving reflectance measured on the coastal water surface in southern Gyeonggi Bay were used to develop an empirical TSM algorithm. TSM maps were generated from the GOCI images at hourly intervals to examine temporal variations in TSM concentrations. Validation of the maps (via comparisons with in situ measurements) showed that the empirical TSM algorithm had been effectively employed. A comparison with the MODIS-derived TSM concentration also supported the reliability of the maps. GOCI-derived TSM at 1-h intervals successfully represented hourly variations in TSM according to the tidal status. In conclusion, the temporal dynamics of sediment movement with the tidal cycle can be effectively estimated on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula using GOCI.

J	Zhu, GP; Peterson, AT				Zhu, Gengping; Peterson, A. Townsend			Potential Geographic Distribution of the Novel Avian-Origin Influenza A (H7N9) Virus	PLOS ONE												Background: In late March 2013, a new avian-origin influenza virus emerged in eastern China. This H7N9 subtype virus has since infected 240 people and killed 60, and has awakened global concern as a potential pandemic threat. Ecological niche modeling has seen increasing applications as a useful tool in mapping geographic potential and risk of disease transmission. Methodology/Principals: We developed two datasets based on seasonal variation in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the MODIS sensor to characterize environmental dimensions of H7N9 virus. One-third of well-documented cases was used to test robustness of models calibrated based on the remaining two-thirds, and model significance was tested using partial ROC approaches. A final niche model was calibrated using all records available. Conclusions/Significance: Central-eastern China appears to represent an area of high risk for H7N9 spread, but suitable areas were distributed more spottily in the north and only along the coast in the south; highly suitable areas also were identified in western Taiwan. Areas identified as presenting high risk for H7N9 spread tend to present consistent NDVI values through the year, whereas unsuitable areas show greater seasonal variation.					Peterson, A.

J	Potter, C				Potter, Christopher			Microclimate influences on vegetation water availability and net primary production in coastal ecosystems of Central California	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Field sampling and satellite remote sensing were used to test the hypothesis that site microclimate variability leading to divergent soil water use by vegetation types is closely associated with variability in annual net primary productivity (NPP) at the landscape scale. A simulation model based on satellite observations of seasonal phenology was used to estimate NPP of grassland, shrubland, and conifer forest vegetation types on the Central California coast near Big Sur. Daily microclimate at the soil surface was monitored over 4 years (2008-2011) for each vegetation type to infer soil moisture controls on plant production. Grassland soils were found to have lower soil organic matter content and were subjected to extreme radiation and wind events, and thereby dry-down faster with daily spring-summer warming than do shrubland or redwood forest soils. This reduced moisture microclimate affected the water stress on grassland plants to reduce NPP fluxes from April to October each year on the Central Coast far sooner than for shrubland or redwood stands. Results from this study suggested that the satellite-observed canopy greenness variations represented can be used to quantify plant production in coastal ecosystems at the landscape scale of defined microclimate variation.

J	Kim, YH; Im, J; Ha, HK; Choi, JK; Ha, S				Kim, Yong Hoon; Im, Jungho; Ha, Ho Kyung; Choi, Jong-Kuk; Ha, Sunghyun			Machine learning approaches to coastal water quality monitoring using GOCI satellite data	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Since coastal waters are one of the most vulnerable marine systems to environmental pollution, it is very important to operationally monitor coastal water quality. This study attempts to estimate two major water quality indicators, chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations, in coastal environments on the west coast of South Korea using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite data. Three machine learning approaches including random forest, Cubist, and support vector regression (SVR) were evaluated for coastal water quality estimation. In situ measurements (63 samples) collected during four days in 2011 and 2012 were used as reference data. Due to the limited number of samples, leave-one-out cross validation (CV) was used to assess the performance of the water quality estimation models. Results show that SVR outperformed the other two machine learning approaches, yielding calibration R-2 of 0.91 and CV root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 1.74 mg/m(3) (40.7%) for chl-a, and calibration R-2 of 0.98 and CV RMSE of 11.42 g/m(3) (63.1%) for SPM when using GOCI-derived radiance data. Relative importance of the predictor variables was examined. When GOCI-derived radiance data were used, the ratio of band 2 to band 4 and bands 6 and 5 were the most influential input variables in predicting chl-a and SPM concentrations, respectively. Hourly available GOCI images were useful to discuss spatiotemporal distributions of the water quality parameters with tidal phases in the west coast of Korea.

J	Son, S; Kim, YH; Kwon, JI; Kim, HC; Park, KS				Son, SeungHyun; Kim, Yong Hoon; Kwon, Jae-Il; Kim, Hae-Cheol; Park, Kwang-Soon			Characterization of spatial and temporal variation of suspended sediments in the Yellow and East China Seas using satellite ocean color data	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												Total suspended sediment (TSS) data concentrations are retrieved from two sets of satellite ocean color data (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)) using an existing regional model to characterize spatial and temporal variation of TSS in the Yellow and East China Seas. MODIS-derived TSS maps show that TSS concentrations are, in general, high along the Korean and Chinese coasts including the Bohai Sea and the Yangtz River estuary, and lower in the middle of the Yellow Sea and the southeastern area of the East China Sea. The monthly average of 10-year MODIS data reveals that TSS values are highest during winter (January to February) and lowest in summer (July to August). Short-term TSS concentrations retrieved from GOCI data showed the dominant influence of semi-diurnal tidal changes on sediment dynamics through temporal (hourly) and spatial distribution in coastal zones of the Yellow sea. The results presented here demonstrate that the satellite-derived TSS products can be utilized as an application tool for future studies on long- and short-term sediment dynamics of turbid coastal waters. In particular, GOCI observations provide unique important capabilities to characterize and quantify the water properties at high temporal (hourly) and spatial (0.5 km) resolutions in the turbid coastal waters of the Yellow Sea and its vicinities.																	1548-1603	1943-7226				MAR 4	2014	51	2			SI		212	226		10.1080/15481603.2014.895580								WOS:000333870200007

Mesoscale and Nutrient Conditions Associated with the Massive 2008 Cochlodinium polykrikoides Bloom in the Sea of Oman/Arabian Gulf	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Cochlodinium polykrikoides formed large blooms in the coastal waters of Oman from October 2008 through mid-January 2009, and satellite images from Aqua-MODIS and region-wide reports suggest that this bloom was found throughout the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman for more than 10 months. The unusual occurrence of this species appears to have supplanted the more regularly occurring bloom species, Noctiluca scintillans, in 2008-2009. For the first 2 weeks of the coastal Omani bloom, C. polykrikoides abundance was near monospecific proportions, with cell densities ranging from 4.6 x 10(3) to 9 x 10(6) cells L-1 and very high levels of chlorophyll a (78.0 mu g L-1) were also recorded. The regional progression of the bloom likely began with stronger than normal upwelling along the Iranian and northern Omani coasts during the southwest monsoon in late summer, followed by discharge of unusually warm coastal plume water along the coast of Oman with the reversal of monsoonal winds in late October. The occurrence and persistence of high densities of C. polykrikoides in Oman coastal water were also significantly influenced by an elevated nutrient load and warmer than normal temperatures. Concentrations of nutrients, especially NH4 (+), urea, PO4 (3-), and organic nitrogen and phosphorus, were manyfold higher than observed in the year prior or since. These findings suggest that mesoscale features were important in bloom dynamics more regionally, but locally the bloom was sustained by nutrient enrichment supplemented by its mixotrophic capabilities.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				MAR	2014	37	2					325	338		10.1007/s12237-013-9693-1								WOS:000334170400006						
J	Teggi, S; Despini, F				Teggi, Sergio; Despini, Francesca			Estimation of subpixel MODIS water temperature near coastlines using the SWTI algorithm	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite derived water surface temperature maps are widely used in many environmental studies and applications. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is among the widely used sensors in this field and sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the standard quantities derived from MODIS imagery. However, MODIS SST maps have limited applications in near-shore and coastal environments due to inadequate spatial resolution of 1 km. This problem means that the MODIS pixels closer than 1 km from the shore are mixed pixels, i.e. they include by both water and land, and must be discarded from the SST map. In this work SWTI (Sharpening Water Thermal Imagery) methods were applied to MODIS thermal imagery for the first time. The information required by SWTI regarding cover fractions and perpendicular vegetation index was obtained from the MODIS images in the Visible-Near Infrared bands at a spatial resolution of 250 m. In this way, the SST MODIS maps were extended to a minimum distance of 250 m from the shore. The SWTI results were evaluated using as a reference the SST computed from two ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) images acquired simultaneously to the MODE images and covering the same areas. The applied validation methodology provides an evaluation of the deviations introduced by SWTI separated from the pre-existing differences between MODIS SST and ASTER SST upscaled to 250 m. For sea coast environments, SWTI was able to compute the SST of more than 80% of the pixels close to the shore at a spatial resolution of 250 m. This represents an increase of 67% compared to the number of pixels obtainable using a simple downscaling method based on polynomial interpolation; in areas with lagoons and estuaries the increases were + 70% and + 60% respectively. The ASTER SST comparison showed that the SST bias and the unsystematic deviation introduced by SWTI were Delta(s) <= 0.45 K and sigma(epsilon(S)) <= 0.88 K respectively, corresponding to a total deviation TD <= 0.97 K. SWTI is written in the IDL language and could be adapted for automatic application to MODIS images. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, RK; Shanmugam, P				Singh, Rakesh Kumar; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			A novel method for estimation of aerosol radiance and its extrapolation in the atmospheric correction of satellite data over optically complex oceanic waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Atmospheric correction of satellite ocean color imagery in sediment-laden and algal bloom waters remains to be a challenging task because of the inefficiency of present methods to accurately assess aerosol radiances in the near-infrared (NIR) bands and extrapolate these into the visible spectrum. This study presents a novel method for estimation and extrapolation of aerosol radiances in MODIS-Aqua bands over optically complex oceanic waters dominated by suspended sediments and algal blooms. The Rayleigh-corrected radiance at 748 nm, after correcting the influence of the elevated radiance contributed by suspended sediments and algal blooms, is employed in the present method to estimate aerosol radiance in a MODIS-Aqua band centered at 531 nm. Then, the normalized Gaussian distribution function is used to extrapolate aerosol radiance over the entire wavebands (from 412 to 748 nm). This method retrieves water-leaving radiances L-w(lambda) nearly comparable to those of the NIR scheme for extremely clear waters (chlorophyll <0.15 mg m(-3)) with an error of <5% which is an acceptable limit for such waters. Evaluation of the performance of the new method with NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes using in-situ L-w(lambda) measurements from highly turbid waters off Point Calimere (on the southeast coast of India) and other regional waters (NOMAD in-situ L-w(lambda) data) shows an apparent improvement in L-w(lambda) retrievals with the new method over NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes (i.e., with a decrease in mean relative error by 22.59% and 23.06% respectively). The performance of the new method is demonstrated for several MODIS-Aqua imageries of optically contrasted and complex waters (containing different in-water and floating algal blooms), and yields physically realistic water-leaving (or surface-leaving) radiances in all visible bands. By contrast, the NIR and NIR-SWIR switching schemes show large distortions in L-w(lambda) structures with large negative values across the visible bands. These results suggest that the new method will have important implications for satellite remote sensing of optically complex waters, since the accuracy of bio-geophysical products derived from such data mainly depends on the water-leaving radiance products delivered by the atmospheric correction algorithm.

Due to short time terrestrial formation, shallow buried depth and high salinity groundwater, soil salinization is serious and has negative influence on crop growth stages in the Yellow River delta. Traditional method for phenology detection using situ data is far more costly and time consuming, moreover, hard to available for all the fields. Soil salinization differs from place to place. The phenological stage varies from low salinization area to high salinization area. MODIS data provides the possibility for regional dynamic monitoring in a timely and accurate way due to its repeated acquisition and broad area coverage. Aim of this study is to detect major phenology and analyze the spatial distribution characters of phenology affected by soil salinization for winter wheat in the Yellow River delta region based on the MODIS NDVI time-series data. Savitzky-Golay filter procedure was selected to denoise. Decision tree method was used to classify winter wheat from other crops and natural vegetation before phenology detection. Phenology was specified by using defined dynamic threshold method. The phenology of green-up stage, heading stage, and harvesting stage was detected. This study concludes that green-up date generally came in early March, headed in early May and harvested in early June. The overall average green-up date occurred in March 4, heading date in May 7 and harvesting date in June 2. The detection result was consistent with the ground observations result on the whole. The spatial distribution of phenology showed a gradual postponement from inland to coast. Heading date and harvesting stage inland might be about 3 days in advance than those near the sea. Green-up stage inland might be about 6 to 10 days earlier than near the coast. Green-up stage was significantly influenced by soil salinity comparing to heading date and harvesting date. Method proposed in this paper can be used in phenology detection for winter wheat in Yellow River delta region, which has important guiding significance for crop condition evaluation and phenology detection in other coastal salinization area.																	2334-3168						2014							489	493										WOS:000363278300098

Strong evaporation rates above the current core and the Retroflection reduce the number of cloud-free observations from Infra-Red sensors, while microwave radiometers and altimeters measurements suffer from the proximity of the current to the coast in the northern region. Infra-Red observations of the Agulhas Current significantly improved with the launch of the Meteosat Second Generation satellite, but Infra-Red Sea Surface Temperature datasets still suffer from inadequate cloud masking algorithms, particularly in regions of strong temperature gradient. Despite both Sea Surface Height and Sea Surface Temperature observations being severely compromised in the northern Agulhas current, a synergetic use of merged altimetry and high frequency Infra-Red Sea Surface Temperature imagery provides a means to track deep-sea eddies, document their influence on the Agulhas Current and helps us improve our understanding of the Agulhas Current variability.

In this line of thought, the IcePAC project aims to offer, in the actual context of climate change, concise and both spatially and temporally precise information on sea ice most probable behavior, especially along the coastal regions, where high-resolution information is hardly available. To achieve that goal, we propose two probabilistic models based on frequency analysis. First, a regional scale (12.5 km) model built from passive microwave imagery will provide ice probability information for the complete spatial domain. Secondly, a local scale (250 m) model, built using optical MODIS and SAR Radarsat-1 ice maps data will help give precise information along the coastal regions.

Automatic Detection of Marine Surfactants by MODIS Sunglint Imagery: A Study Case of Biogenic Films off the Southeastern Coast of Brazil	OCEAN REMOTE SENSING AND MONITORING FROM SPACE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Ocean Remote Sensing and Monitoring from Space	OCT 15-16, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	SPIE, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm, Minist Earth Sci				Global monitoring of marine surfactants is important for understanding the heat, particle, momentum, and gas exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. Observing the sunglint, i.e., the specular reflection between Sun, sea surface, and sensor, which intensity depends on the geometry of acquisition, has the potential to improve surfactants detection. The basis of the approach is that surfactants modify surface roughness, therefore the probability distribution of observing reflection by wave facets in the sensor field-of-view. An automatic method to detect surfactants from optical imagery under Sun glint conditions is presented. The method consists in comparing modeled normalized radiance (for clean water and surfactant contaminated water) with observed values. Application to MODIS imagery acquired off the Southwest Coast of Brazil in January 2003 demonstrates the method's feasibility, revealing the presence of biogenic films formed by Trichodesmium colonies. The presence of the N-2 fixing cyanobacteria was verified independently from in-situ measurements and ocean color remote sensing. An advantage of the glint-based method over detection methods using SAR imagery is the good spatial resolution (250 m) and the capability to detect surfactants at low wind speeds (< 2 m/s), impractical to SAR sensors due to the absence of Bragg scattering. Discriminating the type of surfactant, i.e., biogenic versus mineral, requires additional information, such as spectral marine reflectance.

The spectral characteristics of C. polykrikoides red tides were that increased phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm and pigment backscattering 555 nm resulted in a steeper slope between 488 and 555 nm with a hinge point at 488 (or 490) nm. On the other hand, non-red tide water, typically were presented by broader radiance spectra between the blue and green bands were associated with reduced pigment absorption and backscattering. The analysis of ocean color imageries that captured C. polykrikoides red tide blooms showed discolored waters with enhanced pigment concentrations, high chlorophyll, fluorescence, absorption at 443 nm. However, most red tide detection algorithms found a large number of false positive but only a small number of true positive areas. These proposed algorithms are not useful to distinguish true red tide water from complex non-red tide water. Our proposed method substantially reduces the false signal rate (false positive) from strong absorption at short wavelengths and provide a more reliable and robust detection of C. polykrikoides blooms in the SCK from the space.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610P	10.1117/12.2068978								WOS:000348837900017

The GOCI has a local coverage area of the western Pacific Ocean including Bohai, Yellow Sea and East Sea of China. Jiaozhou Bay is a semienclosed basin in the western part of the Yellow Sea, which is an important representative of gulf ecosystem in the North Temperate Zone. The GOCI data can provide useful information with an-hour temporal and 500-m spatial resolutions for monitoring oceanic and atmospheric process in Jiaozhou Bay. The performance of the atmospheric and optical algorithms of GOCI was evaluated by comparing with the simultaneous data from MODIS/Aqua. The match-up products include remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and chlorophyll-a concentration ([chl-a]) and they were derived by GDPS software for GOCI data and SeaDAS software for MODIS and GOCI data, respectively, using default atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms. Our analyses show that GOCI products (i.e., R-rs(490), R-rs(555) and [chl-a]) are compared well with MODIS products. GOCI shows a potential capability of oceanography investigations in Jiaozhou Bay and Qingdao coastal area. The consistency of Rrs between GOCI and MODIS is relatively good but significant difference was observed in [chl-a] especially in Jiaozhou Bay. Moreover, it is suggested to improve GOCI standard atmospheric correction algorithm for high turbid water and cloud detection to increase data utilization.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								926118	10.1117/12.2069114								WOS:000348837900028

To get a general spatial picture of the water quality of the Romanian coast, it is not only time consuming, but also hard to measure with traditional in situ sampling. To solve these issues, methods have been developed to use close range spectral measurements for accurate and cheap assessments in real-time for the concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, Total Suspended Matter and water transparency. This paper presents the applicability of a state-of-the-art hand-held hyper-spectral sensor and a simple water transparency indicator for monitoring water quality. The fieldwork was conducted during the summer of 2013 on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea. The same techniques are used to calculate these parameters from satellite images (MODIS). The validation results and potential applications of the instruments will be discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-302-1				2014	9239								UNSP 923913	10.1117/12.2067415								WOS:000348312800029

Remote sensing of the El Hierro submarine volcanic eruption plume	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Submarine volcanic eruptions took place at the island El Hierro (Canary Islands) between October 2011 and March 2012. The event produced plumes of discoloured waters due to the discharge of volcanic matter, magmatic gases, and hydrothermal fluids. The expelled materials, which behaved like oceanic tracers, were detected from the site of the volcano to the open sea by remote-sensing techniques using different level-2 (L2) products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. In order to assess the effect of the anomalous turbidity, three atmospheric correction schemes were evaluated: SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) standard, near-infrared-shortwave-infrared (NIR-SWIR), and Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM). The comparison between them verified that the SeaDAS standard atmospheric correction was the most suitable. The downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) was used as a measure of plume intensity in comparison with other submarine volcanic eruptions. The MODIS-derived K-d(490) values verified that the intensity of the El Hierro plume was moderate. Only in some specific situations did the values barely exceed 0.4 m (1). The remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) was used for the characterization of the affected waters. The R-rs spectra also allowed a comparison with other volcanic and sulphide events reported in previous studies. Similarities were found, both with submarine volcanic eruptions in the southwestern Pacific and with sulphide events at the Namibian coast, in composition and properties of optically active water constituents. A classification schema based on K-d(490) values and R-rs ratios was developed and used in connection with MODIS red-green-blue (RGB) composites as well as surface current velocities from altimeter missions to investigate the spatio-temporal development of the volcanic plume. The spreading and transport of volcanic material observed at the ocean surface was caused by the predominant surface currents coupled with different mesoscale eddies. Discoloured waters were identified more than 200 km away from the eruption site. Field data from oceanographic surveys verified the high concentration of sulphur compounds in affected waters and confirmed the overestimation by the MODIS default algorithm of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the volcanic plume.

However, clouds are transparent to microwaves, and satellites with L-band radiometers have recently been put into orbit to monitor sea surface salinity (SSS). Previous studies have used the mixing of fluvial colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) near coasts, where the mixing is approximately conservative over short time scales, to estimate SSS. In this study, the usual relationship between CDOM and salinity in the ECS has been used in reverse to estimate CDOM from remotely sensed SSS in the ECS and compare that CDOM with MODIS data. The SSS data used are 7 day composites from NASA's Aquarius/SAC-D satellite which has an L-band radiometer. The challenges in using this approach are that 1) Aquarius SSS has coarse spatial resolution (150 km), and 2) the ECS has numerous anthropogenic sources of radiofrequency interference which adds noise to the L-band signal for the SSS retrievals. Despite the limits in the method, CDOM distribution in the ECS can be estimated under cloudy conditions. In addition to all-weather retrievals, an additional advantage of the approach is that the algorithm provides an estimate of CDOM absorption that is unaffected by the spectrally similar detritus absorption that can confound optical remote sensing estimates of CDOM.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-048-8				2014	9111								UNSP 91110A	10.1117/12.2052951								WOS:000343862700008						
J	Karimova, S				Karimova, Svetlana			Hydrological fronts seen in visible and infrared MODIS imagery of the Black Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This article presents an examination of hydrological fronts in the Black Sea based on visible and infrared Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) imagery obtained during 2008-2013. First the images were preliminarily treated (e.g. via applying a median filter) and then the fronts were detected using the Sobel operator. Further processing of the fields of the gradient norm thus obtained helped determine the generalized results of the front density for different years and seasons. On analysis of such results it was shown that the strongest thermal and optical fronts in the Black Sea are located in the near-coastal area. Nevertheless, analysis of the front density contrasts in the open sea was discovered to be very helpful as well, because it provided important information on the trajectories of the main macro- and mesoscale circulation patterns in the basin such as the Rim Current, Batumi eddy, and eddies of the Anatolian coast.

Effect of optically active substances and atmospheric correction schemes on remote-sensing reflectance at a coastal site off Kochi	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The present study focused on understanding the variability of optically active substances (OASs) and their effect on spectral remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). Furthermore, the effect of atmospheric correction schemes on the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from satellite data was also analysed. The OASs considered here are chl-a, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and total suspended matter (TSM). Satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite was used for this study. The two atmospheric correction schemes considered were: multi-scattering with two-band model selection NIR correction (hereon referred as 'A1') and Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models (MUMM) correction and MUMM NIR calculation (hereafter referred as 'A2'). The default MODIS bio-optical algorithm (OC3M) was used for the retrieval of chl-a. Analysis of OASs showed that chl-a was the major light-absorbing component, with highly variable distribution (0.006-25.85 mg m(-3)). Absorption due to CDOM at 440 nm (aCDOM440) varied from 0.002 to 0.31 m(-1) whereas TSM varied from 0.005 to 33.44 mg l(-1). The highest concentration of chl-a was observed from August to November (i. e. end of the southwest monsoon and beginning of the northeast monsoon), which was attributed to coastal upwelling. The average value of aCDOM440 was found to be lower than the global mean. A significant negative relationship between aCDOM440 and salinity during the southwest monsoon indicated that much of the CDOM during this season was derived from river discharge. Spectral Rrs was found to be strongly linked to the variability in chl-a concentration, indicating that chl-a was the major light-absorbing component. Satellite-derived spectral Rrs was in good agreement with that in situ when chl-a concentration was lower than 5 mg m(-3). The validation of chl-a, derived from in situ Rrs, showed moderate performance (correlation coefficient, R-2 = 0.64; log(10)(RMSE) = 0.434; absolute percentage difference (APD) = 43.6% and relative percentage difference (RPD) = 42.33%). However the accuracy of the algorithm was still within acceptable limits. The statistical analysis for atmospheric correction schemes showed improved mean ratio of measured to estimated chl-a ('r' = 1.6), log10(RMSE) (0.49), APD (25.46%), and RPD (17.57%) in the case of A1 as compared with A2, whereas in the case of A2, R-2 (0.56), slope (0.26), and intercept (0.27) were better as compared with A1. The two atmospheric correction schemes did not show any significant statistical difference. However the default atmospheric correction scheme (A1) was found to be performing comparatively better probably due to the fact that the concentration of TSM and CDOM was much lower to overcome the impact of chl-a.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	14			SI		5434	5447		10.1080/01431161.2014.926420								WOS:000340477400011						
J	Hope, A; Fouad, G; Granovskaya, Y				Hope, Allen; Fouad, Geoffrey; Granovskaya, Yelena			Evaluating drought response of Southern Cape Indigenous Forests, South Africa, using MODIS data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Indigenous forests in South Africa cover less than 0.5% of the total land area but are a valued resource under threat from fragmentation, fires, exploitation, and climate change. The largest indigenous forest complex is located along the southern coast of the Western Cape Province. This complex is made up of sub-forests distinguished by different structural and edaphoclimatic attributes. It has been hypothesized that these sub-forests exhibit different resistance to stressors, such as drought. A time series of MODIS 250 m enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data were used to characterize the foliage condition of the three distinctive sub-forests before, during, and after a severe drought in 2009. The goal was to determine how these sub-forests responded to this disturbance. EVI anomalies for the drought and post-drought periods were calculated using annual median EVI values, since removal of outliers based on quality control flags that accompany the MODIS products or noise-filtering techniques proved to be ineffective. Results of the study indicated that pre-drought foliage density EVI was not controlled by differences in water availability, but may have been due to other edaphoclimatic or structural attributes. Maximum foliage loss occurred one year after the driest year, indicating the cumulative effects of drought stress on forest production and retention of foliage. The hypothesized stress resistance capacity of the three sub-forests was found to correspond to their rate of post-drought recovery. There is a need to tie these satellite observations of forest drought response to ground observations of forest condition, growth, and specific site attributes.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	13					4852	4864		10.1080/01431161.2014.930205								WOS:000340105700015						
J	Shen, F; Zhou, YX; Peng, XY; Chen, YL				Shen, Fang; Zhou, Yunxuan; Peng, Xiangyi; Chen, Yuli			Satellite multi-sensor mapping of suspended particulate matter in turbid estuarine and coastal ocean, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In this work, five ocean-colour sensors, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Terra satellite (Terra MODIS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua satellite (Aqua MODIS), Medium Range Imaging Spectrometer aboard the Environmental Satellite (Envisat MERIS), Medium Resolution Spectral Imager aboard the FY-3 satellite (FY-3 MERSI), and Geostationary Ocean Colour Imager (GOCI), were selected to examine the compatibility of an algorithm proposed for suspended particulate matter (SPM) retrieval and concordance of satellite products retrieved from different ocean-colour sensors. The results could effectively increase revisit frequency and complement a temporal gap of time series satellites that may exist between on-orbit and off-orbit. Using in situ measurements from 17 cruise campaigns between 2004 and 2012, the SPM retrieval algorithm was recalibrated so as to be universal and adapted for multi-sensor retrievals. An inter-comparison of multi-sensor-derived products showed that GOCI-derived SPM and Envisat MERIS-derived SPM had the best fitting on a 1:1 scatterplot, with a statistic regression slope of 0.9617 and an intercept of 0.0041 (in units of g l(-1)), respectively. SPM products derived from three sensors with nearly synchronous transit, Envisat MERIS, Terra MODIS, and FY-3 MERSI, exhibited excellent accordance with mean differences of 0.056, 0.057, and 0.013 g l(-1) in three field fixed stations, respectively, in the Yangtze estuary. Terra MODIS-derived SPM with GOCI-derived SPM, except in the high SPM waters of Hangzhou Bay, and Aqua MODIS-derived SPM with GOCI-derived SPM, except in the moderate SPM waters of the South Branch and south of the Subei Coast, showed a good correspondence. Meanwhile, synchronous multi-sensor-derived SPM with concurrent in situ SPM time series observed in fixed field stations mostly displayed a good correspondence. Results suggest that the algorithm is feasible and compatible for SPM retrieval by multiple sensors.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4173	4192		10.1080/01431161.2014.916053								WOS:000337623200017

The uncertainties of these products are poorly quantified in the Yellow Sea (YS) and East China Sea (ECS), which are well known for their optical complexity and turbidity in terms of both oceanic and atmospheric optical properties. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the primary ocean-color products from three major ocean-color satellites, namely the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Through match-up analysis with in situ data, it is found that satellite retrievals of the spectral remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) at the blue-green and green bands from MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS have the lowest uncertainties with a median of the absolute percentage of difference (APD(m)) of 15-27% and root-mean-square-error (RMS) of 0.0021-0.0039 sr(-1), whereas the R-rs(lambda) uncertainty at 412 nm is the highest (APD(m) 47-62%, RMS 0.0027-0.0041 sr(-1)). The uncertainties of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) tau(a), diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance at 490 nm K-d(490), concentrations of suspended particulate sediment concentration (SPM) and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) were also quantified. It is demonstrated that with appropriate in-water algorithms specifically developed for turbid waters rather than the standard ones adopted in the operational satellite data processing chain, the uncertainties of satellite-derived properties of K-d(490), SPM, and Chl-a may decrease significantly to the level of 20-30%, which is true for the majority of the study area. This validation activity advocates for (1) the improvement of the atmosphere correction algorithms with the regional aerosol optical model, (2) switching to regional in-water algorithms over turbid coastal waters, and (3) continuous support of the dedicated in situ data collection effort for the validation task.

Understanding the sensitivity of these data is important since these phenomena are projected to increase as climate changes. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data were used to study the observed patterns of forest disturbance at different spatial scales in temperate forest (US Gulf Coast) produced by tropical cyclones Charley (2004), Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), and Gustav (2008), and in tropical rainforests (Australia) produced by cyclone Yasi (2011). The severity of forest disturbance was quantified by applying spectral mixture analysis to the MODIS and Landsat coverages. Field studies were used to verify and compare the results. At the local scale Landsat data was sensitive to forest disturbance both within and between forest types. Higher tree mortality was observed in tropical rainforests than in temperate forests. This observation may be explained by forest type characteristics such as stem density, forest adaptation, and depth of root systems. At the species level, Landsat showed a gradient of forest resilience to tropical cyclone winds that agreed with observational field studies. At the landscape scale, the observed topographic effects on disturbance patterns were well represented by the MODIS data. Positive covariance was observed between surface orientation and slope on the severity of disturbance. Greater levels of disturbance were observed on windward surfaces with steeper slopes. Finally, at the regional scale, MODIS reproduced the pattern of forest damage associated with cyclone winds. The highest level of forest disturbance was observed on the right side of the cyclone track in the northern hemisphere (US Gulf Coast forest ecosystems) and on the left side in the southern hemisphere (Australian rainforest). At the regional scale, forest disturbance was positively associated with the decrease of wind speeds in an inland direction. Tropical cyclone surface winds explained 20% of forest disturbance, although characteristics of cumulative processes could cause this to be underestimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In general a very good agreement between them was found with positive bias (RMSD) not higher than 0.49 degrees C (1.31 degrees C) and R-2 not less than 0.78. The MODIS-based SST data set, having a wide spatial coverage and relatively high spatial resolution enables one to study spatial, seasonal and inter-annual SST variations unavailable from sparse in situ measurements in the Curonian Lagoon. In addition satellite SST maps allow monitoring main spatio-temporal characteristics of mesoscale frontal features associated with the Curonian Lagoon coastal plume and coastal upwelling in the SE Baltic influencing coastal and lagoon ecosystems. The satellite infrared measurements and results obtained in near-shore waters in this study are unique and should be useful to researchers of near-shore water dynamics in other coastal regions of the world.

Vegetation types were come from MODIS product MCD12Q1 in 2004. The slope of liner regression equation was used to analyze the change trend of NDVI. The results showed that NDVIs in vegetation growing seasons showed a trend of fluctuating increase from 1998 to 2012. The lowest annual average NDVI in growing seasons was 0.49 in 1999, and the highest NDVI was 0.59 in 2012. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between annual average NDVI and mean precipitation was 0.893, the average NDVIs were related to precipitation more closely than to air temperature. The spatial distribution of NDVI in Hebei Province presented a trend of decrease from middle area to both sides. There were two areas with high NDVI values and two areas with low NDVI values. The highest average NDVI value 0.77 appeared in the southeast of Yanshan Mountains, especially near Wuling Mountain. The lowest NDVI value 0.01 appeared in the eastern coast of Hebei Province. Broadleaf forest had the highest average NDVI value 0.68 in growing seasons, followed by shrubland with NDVI value 0.64. The lowest NDVI 0.13 was in sparsely vegetated land or wetlands. The area of NDVI decrease in vegetation growing season accounted for 9.16%, while that of NDVI increase accounted for 90.84%, indicating that NDVI showed an increasing trend from 1998 to 2012. The areas with rapid NDVI increase were distributed in farming land of North China Plain, Taihang and Yanshan Mountainous regions. The areas with rapid NDVI decrease were mainly distributed in Bashang Plateau region, Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan cities belt, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Handan cities, indicating that vegetation in these regions presented a trend of deterioration. The reasons were also analyzed.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900087

Single source surface energy balance model was used to derive surface energy balance parameters. Agro climatic region wise monthly information of terrestrial, energy balance and meteorological parameters were derived during June-September from decadal analysis of MODIS data (2003-2012) over India (68-100 degrees E, 5-40 degrees N) at 5 km spatial resolution. Information on rainfall was obtained from gridded rainfall data (1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution) from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The spatiotemporal variability of the parameters such as rainfall, evapotranspiration (ET), evaporative fraction (EF), soil water index (SWI), land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature (T-a) showed strong influence on seasonal LE fluctuation. LE showed positive linear coupling with ET (0.52 <R-2 <= 0.91), EF (0.79 <= R-2 <= 0.96), SWI (0.80 <= R-2 <= 0.93) and negative exponential coupling with LST (0.63 <= R-2 <= 0.87), T-a (0.55 < R-2 <= 0.83). The pixel based knowledge of the parameters was incorporated into hierarchical decision rule algorithm and pixel-by-pixel segmentation of monthly coupling of LE versus parameters (ET, EF, SWI, LST, T-a) was generated. The rainfall zonations in a spatiotemporal domain were done based on the LE couplings that clearly demarcated the highest (West Coast Plains and Hills Region, Himalayan region), moderate (Gangetic Plains and Hills Regions, and the Plateau and Hills Regions) and lowest rainfall (Western dry region) areas. The transition of zone-wise availability of rainfall (both surplus and deficient) can be very well understood from the seasonal dynamics of the LE couplings.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						339	345		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-339-2014								WOS:000368425300053

TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY ALONG THE EAST COAST OF INDIA USING OCEANSAT-2 OCEAN COLOUR MONITOR (OCM)	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Primary Productivity is the ultimate source of energy for all organisms in an ecosystem. It is associated with the food production and the global carbon cycle. Sensors on remote platforms (satellites) are capable of estimating the Chlorophyll-a concentration in surface waters by measurement of spectral changes of the upwelling light. From these data, which connected with other remotely sensed data, it is possible to use algorithms to estimate the primary production. In this paper, an initial attempt is made to estimate the Primary Productivity along the east coast of India. Vertically Generalized Productivity Model (VGPM) which is a depth (euphotic depth) integrated model is used for the estimation. The common input variables or geophysical parameters used for the model are chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), vertically diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd-490), Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR), and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The chlorophyll-a and Kd-490 parameters were estimated using Oceansat-2 OCM data whereas PAR and SST were taken from MODIS-aqua data. Oceansat-2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) data for the year 2013 is used in the analysis to compute the primary productivity using the weekly (8-day) data products of all the parameters as mentioned above. These products were inter compared with the MODIS Weekly (8-day) Primary Productivity products which were estimated at a global scale using the modified Vertically Generalized Productivity Model (VGPM) with which uses the exponential function of Sea surface temperature (SST).																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1049	1053		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1049-2014								WOS:000368425300165

The images were obtained by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) between September 2004 and December 2010. As a result of the analysis performed, it was discovered that there are four main non-stationary eddy types which can be frequently observed in such imagery: near-shore anticyclonic eddies, mushroom-like currents, eddies of the Anatolian coast, and eddy chains. For each type of eddy, spatio-temporal parameters were retrieved such as areas of the most frequent generation and typical length scale, as well as their seasonality. Every non-stationary eddy type was shown to have its own area of location. Analysis of eddy spatial scale revealed that anticyclonic eddies of all types were greater in size than cyclonic ones (on average 52km for anticyclones and 36km for cyclones).

A Coastal Seawater Temperature Dataset for Biogeographical Studies: Large Biases between In Situ and Remotely-Sensed Data Sets around the Coast of South Africa	PLOS ONE												Gridded SST products developed particularly for offshore regions are increasingly being applied close to the coast for biogeographical applications. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the dangers of doing so through a comparison of reprocessed MODIS Terra and Pathfinder v5.2 SSTs, both at 4 km resolution, with instrumental in situ temperatures taken within 400 m from the coast. We report large biases of up to +6 degrees C in places between satellite-derived and in situ climatological temperatures for 87 sites spanning the entire ca. 2 700 km of the South African coastline. Although biases are predominantly warm (i.e. the satellite SSTs being higher), smaller or even cold biases also appear in places, especially along the southern and western coasts of the country. We also demonstrate the presence of gradients in temperature biases along shore-normal transects - generally SSTs extracted close to the shore demonstrate a smaller bias with respect to the in situ temperatures. Contributing towards the magnitude of the biases are factors such as SST data source, proximity to the shore, the presence/absence of upwelling cells or coastal embayments. Despite the generally large biases, from a biogeographical perspective, species distribution retains a correlative relationship with underlying spatial patterns in SST, but in order to arrive at a causal understanding of the determinants of biogeographical patterns we suggest that in shallow, inshore marine habitats, temperature is best measured directly.

Remote sensing of surface visibility from space: A look at the United States East Coast	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Measurement of surface visibility is important for the management of air quality, human health, and transportation. Currently, visibility measurements are only available through ground-based instrumentation, such as the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and therefore lack spatial coverage. In analogy to the recent work of using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) to derive surface dry aerosol mass concentration at continental-to-global scale for cloud-free conditions, this study evaluates the potential of AOD retrieved from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for deriving surface visibility. For this purpose of evaluation the truncated (up to similar to 16 km or 10 miles) and discrete (at the interval no less than 0.4 km or 1/4 mile) visibility data from hourly operational weather reports are not suitable, and the ASOS-measured one-minute raw surface extinction coefficient (b(ext)) values have to be used. Consequently, a method for quality control on the b(ext) data is first developed to eliminate frequent problems such as extraneous points, poor calibration, and bad formatting, after which reliable b(ext) data are obtained to estimate the surface visibility. Subsequent analysis of the AOD and b(ext) relationship on the East Coast of the United States reveals their average linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.61 for all twelve (2000-2011) years of data at 32 ASOS stations, with the highest R value in summer and the lowest values in fall and winter. Incorporation of the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 (GEOS-5) modeled vertical profile of aerosols into the derivation of visibility from AOD is evaluated for two methods, one scaling the modeled surface b(ext) with the ratio of MODIS AOD to the modeled AOD, and another scaling the ratio of modeled AOD in the boundary layer to total columnar AOD with the MODIS AOD and assuming well-mixed aerosol extinction in the boundary layer. Analysis with three summers (2003-2004, 2006) of available GEOS-5 data and ASOS data reveals that the second method is superior, and generates a regression model that, after independent evaluation for summer 2005, is found to be statistically robust with R of 0.70 and a mean bias of 0.32 km in derived visibility. This study is among the first to demonstrate the potential of using satellite-based aerosol product over land to operationally derive surface visibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

S.; Rajeev, K.; Thampi, Bijoy V.; Nair, Sandhya K.; Mohan, Mannil			Multi-year observations of the spatial and vertical distribution of aerosols and the genesis of abnormal variations in aerosol loading over the Arabian Sea during Asian summer monsoon season	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												Intense aerosol plumes engulf a vast region of the Arabian Sea during the Asian summer monsoon season (ASM: June-September). The largest value of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm in this region generally occurs in July when the mean ADD attains its annual peak value of > 0.8. However, the ADD over this region is abnormally large during the ASM in some years, especially during the June-July period. Long term satellite observations using MODE reveal that the largest ADD during the 11-year period of March 2000-February 2011 occurred in June 2008 with a regional mean AOD of 1.1, which was similar to 97% larger than that of the corresponding long term mean value in June and similar to 49% larger than that in July. The availability of CALIPSO data since June 2006 provides a unique opportunity to quantify the role of continental aerosols transported from the West Asian desert regions in the genesis of the above abnormality over the Arabian Sea. We examine the spatial and vertical distributions of aerosols over the Arabian Sea and adjoining continents using multi-year data from MODIS and CALIPSO and explore the genesis of the above abnormal enhancement in AOD. The observed anomalies in AOD are substantially larger than that can be attributed to changes in wind-generated sea salt aerosols. The CALIPSO observations show that the anomalous enhancement in aerosol loading over the Arabian Sea during June 2008 was primarily caused by an enhancement in aerosol abundance in the altitude range of 14 km with a distinctly large volume depolarization ratio of > 0.25, clearly indicating the dominance of highly non-spherical mineral dust. Although the aerosol loading over the Arabian Sea during the ASM is observed to be mainly caused by the mineral dust transported from the West Asian Deserts at northwest of the Arabian Sea, the abnormal enhancement in the observed AOD during June 2008 was primarily caused by a distinct increase in dust storms over the northern continents and subsequent transport into the Arabian Sea.

J	Recondo, C; Peon, JJ; Zapico, E; Pendas, E				Recondo, Carmen; Jose Peon, Juan; Zapico, Eva; Pendas, Enrique			Empirical models for estimating daily surface water vapour pressure, air temperature, and humidity using MODIS and spatiotemporal variables. Applications to peninsular Spain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In this article, we present empirical models for estimating daily surface water vapour pressure (e(0)), air temperature (T-a), and relative humidity (RH) over cloud-free land areas in peninsular Spain using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatiotemporal variables. The models were obtained and validated using daily mean, maximum, and minimum e(0), T-a, and RH data (year 2010) from 331 ground-level meteorological stations and the diurnal Terra-MODIS data in peninsular Spain, but the methodology can easily be extrapolated and used to obtain algorithms for other regions around the world. The best e(0) models are based on total precipitable water (W) estimations obtained by MOD05 or IMAPP WVNIR products and the spatiotemporal variables of longitude (), distance to the coast (d(coast)), and Julian day (JD). Other models based on Sobrino's W algorithm or on Recondo's e(0) algorithm for Asturias (in northern Spain) were also tested. The best T-a models are based on land surface temperature (LST) obtained by the MOD11 LST or IMAPP LST products and on other remote-sensing variables, such as W and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the spatiotemporal variables , JD, and height (h). Models based on Sobrino's LST algorithms were also tested. RH can be derived directly from e(0) and T-a or from models similar to those used to obtain e(0) and T-a. Models based on the NASA standard products MOD05 and MOD11 LST are slightly better than those based on IMAPP products, but the advantage of IMAPP products for our purposes is that they can be generated in almost real time from the data obtained by the MODIS antenna at the University of Oviedo. IMAPP models obtain the following: R-2=0.83-0.79-0.70 and RSE=1.62-1.59-1.76 hPa for e(0mean), e(0max), and e(0min); and R-2=0.91-0.91-0.80 and RSE=1.96-2.25-3.00K for T-mean, T-max, and T-min. Worse results are obtained for RH: R-2=0.49-0.39 and RSE=7.21-9.75% for RHmin and RHmean, with no correlation found for RHmax. Model validations yield R-2 and RSE values similar to those obtained in the models, with an RMSD=1.86-1.99-2.21 hPa for e(0mean), e(0max), and e(0min); an RMSD=2.05-2.40-2.95K for T-mean, T-max, and T-min; and RMSD=8-11% for RHmin and RHmean. The bias is small in all cases:<0.2 hPa for e(0), 0.1K for T-a, and|1|% for RH. From the results of this article, we propose substituting the traditionally used RH variable with the e(0) variable to be used as meteorological variable in environmental risk models such as, for example, fire risk models.

Detection of Salt Marsh Vegetation Stress and Recovery after the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in Barataria Bay, Gulf of Mexico Using AVIRIS Data	PLOS ONE												The British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico was the biggest oil spill in US history. To assess the impact of the oil spill on the saltmarsh plant community, we examined Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data flown over Barataria Bay, Louisiana in September 2010 and August 2011. Oil contamination was mapped using oil absorption features in pixel spectra and used to examine impact of oil along the oiled shorelines. Results showed that vegetation stress was restricted to the tidal zone extending 14 m inland from the shoreline in September 2010. Four indexes of plant stress and three indexes of canopy water content all consistently showed that stress was highest in pixels next to the shoreline and decreased with increasing distance from the shoreline. Index values along the oiled shoreline were significantly lower than those along the oil-free shoreline. Regression of index values with respect to distance from oil showed that in 2011, index values were no longer correlated with proximity to oil suggesting that the marsh was on its way to recovery. Change detection between the two dates showed that areas denuded of vegetation after the oil impact experienced varying degrees of re-vegetation in the following year. This recovery was poorest in the first three pixels adjacent to the shoreline. This study illustrates the usefulness of high spatial resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy to map actual locations where oil from the spill reached the shore and then to assess its impacts on the plant community. We demonstrate that post-oiling trends in terms of plant health and mortality could be detected and monitored, including recovery of these saltmarsh meadows one year after the oil spill.

Sea Surface Heat Fluxes and Fortnightly Modulation of the Surface Temperature within the Ballenas Channel, Gulf of California	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Sea surface temperature (SST) and meteorological information from July 2004 to July 2005 for Alcatraz Bay, which is located within the Ballenas Channel (BC) in the Gulf of California, was used to investigate the occurrence of sudden and. drastic drops of almost 7 degrees C in the SST. This occurrence was previously observed in the analysis of SST time series that were recorded simultaneously in six bays along the western coast of the BC. Contrary to previous observations, wind speed showed a weak seasonal variability, with a directionality that departed from the typical monsoonal behavior of wind throughout the Gulf. Although the presented ocean surface heat flux calculations were obtained from coastal data, the results are in agreement with previous estimates, as the net heat flux mainly went into the sea for the whole year, with an annual mean heat gain of 197 W m(-2). SST analysis showed that along with a marked seasonal cycle, there are also four main periods of variability: quarter-diurnal, semidiurnal, diurnal, and fortnightly, corresponding to the main timescales of variability induced by tides. The sudden and drastic drops observed in the SST are clearly related to the intensification of the vertical mixing that is induced by tides and are enhanced at a fortnightly tidal period. MODIS-Aqua SST imagery was used as a supporting, indirect evidence of the mesoscale representativeness of our results, which we suggest can be considered valid for the whole BC.

J	Zhang, SP; Yi, L				Zhang, Suping; Yi, Li			A Comprehensive Dynamic Threshold Algorithm for Daytime Sea Fog Retrieval over the Chinese Adjacent Seas	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												Sea fog influences human activities over oceans. It is somewhat difficult to separate sea fog from marine boundary stratus (low stratus and stratocumulus) by satellites due to their microphysical similarities and shared spectral features. For the purpose of improving sea fog detection over the Chinese adjacent seas where fog is common during the spring-summer seasons, the vertical structures of fog and stratus were analyzed using ground-based soundings, resulting in the observation of very explicit discrepancies between them, in terms of TAT - SST (TAT, the temperature at tops of fog or stratus; SST, the sea surface temperature). Based on these discrepancies and on previous related studies, we suggest a comprehensive dynamic threshold algorithm. The method combines real-time brightness temperature from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer channel 31 (similar to 11 mu m) with climatological monthly mean SSTs to produce a threshold that is monthly-dependent. The retrieved results are generally consistent with the observations from meteorological stations near the coast, on islands and from ships, and the scores of validation by conventional methods are promising. The distribution patterns of the retrieved sea fog frequency in May and June from 2006 to 2010 are both compatible with that from ship-based observations and exhibit more details that are consistent with our understanding of sea fog characteristics. This study is helpful for marine weather service and the improvement of models for sea fog forecasting.																	0033-4553	1420-9136				NOV	2013	170	11					1931	1944		10.1007/s00024-013-0641-6								WOS:000326093600016

Comparison between optical and acoustical estimation of suspended sediment concentration: Field study from a muddy coast	OCEAN ENGINEERING												The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a 1.5 MHz Pulse-coherent Acoustic Doppler Profiler (PCADP) to measure suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in a muddy environment where SSC varies over several orders of magnitude. Two seasonal deployments were conducted south of the Atchafalaya-Vermilion Bay system along the Louisiana coast, USA. During a low discharge period of the Atchafalaya River, acoustical estimates of SSC were in good agreement with OBSs deployed. The second deployment was conducted during a high discharge period of the Atchafalaya River. The passage of a cold front across the coast resulted in a rapid advection of the river plume to the study area. High sensitivity of the OBS to fine-grained suspended sediments led to high values from the OBS readings. On the other hand, the PCADP barely sensed the transportation of fine-grained sediments and significantly responded to the combined wave and current shear stress close to sea bed. To reduce the influence of temporal variation of grain size distribution, acoustical backscatter measurements were calibrated over a time span of a few hours.

The knowledge of their spatial distribution and their scales of variability is fundamental for management and scientific reasons, but has been limited by the scarcity of observations. During 2009 and 2010, in-situ data (CTD and turbidity profiles, and water and bottom sediment samples) were collected at 26 sites during six repeated cruises and from three fixed instruments deployed in the frame of the FREPLATA/FFEM experiment. In this paper we complement the analysis of this in-situ data base with 10 years of daily intermediate resolution (1 km) MODIS-Aqua observations processed for surface suspended matter using the IFREMER algorithm for coastal turbid waters. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive characterization of the annual mean suspended matter concentration distribution, to study its variability on seasonal time scale and to identify the involved physical mechanisms. The comparison between the statistics of the direct and remote sensed data is satisfactory, showing a good agreement in the magnitude and spatial distribution of the mean suspended sediments concentration, its standard deviation, so as the seasonal variability. Our data show that all along the year the concentration of surface suspended matter maximizes along the southern coast of the upper and intermediate estuary and at the tips of Samborombon Bay. This fact is linked in part with the higher solid discharge of the Parana River - flowing along the southern coast - compared to the Uruguay River which flows following the northern coast. The former receives most of the sediments load to the Rio de la Plata from the Bermejo River. The observed mean pattern is also related to the stronger tidal currents along the southern coast of the estuary and at the tips of Samborombon Bay, which act re-suspending sediments near the bottom. Then, wind waves during storms enhance vertical mixing, increasing the surface concentration. The concentration of suspended sediments rapidly falls seawards the Barra del Indio shoal, in the area of the salt wedge. In the outer estuary, suspended matter concentration is also strongly associated to the wind-forced motion of the freshwater plume. Suspended matter concentration exhibits a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer, that cannot be fully explained in terms of the seasonal cycle of the solid discharge of the tributaries, but seems to be related to a raise in the frequency of the storms in winter, increasing the frequency of strong winds and higher wind waves, and the associated re-suspension and mixing.

Multi-linear regression analysis was performed to estimate SSS and the Brown and Minnet algorithm was used for the SST. The extracted parameters were validated using in situ measurement taken with Hydro-Lab equipment. The extracted parameters from MODIS images reveal the signature values which establish the relationships between these parameters, and thus delineating the potential fish zonation (PFZ) map. These developed models will help for accurate monitoring of large coverage areas at low cost and within short period of time. Furthermore, such models will allow the prediction of the total fish catch in different seasons, thus contributing to fish industry management and marketing. This research recommends the use of PFZ map for mass scale fish harvesting in short time for larger areas. Finally, the research has developed a potential fish zone model amalgamating all the above parameters. The PFZ mapping was carried out off the coast of Semporna, Sabah as there were sufficient fish catch data for accuracy assessment. The R was computed as 0.93 and the higher fish catch areas have coincided very well with the higher PFZ values, meaning the tool is ready for use for operational near real-time fish forecasting.

Spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the coastal Gulf of Alaska, 1998-2011, using cloud-free reconstructions of SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua data	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the coastal Gulf of Alaska (GOA) using a 14-year time series of cloud-free reconstructions of SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua chl-a data. Coast-wide and regional relationships between chl-a and likely environmental drivers, including anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST), photosynthetically-available radiation (PAR), sea surface height (SSHa), freshwater discharge, and coastal upwelling were explored. Coast-wide chl-a showed strong seasonal variability with pronounced spring and fall blooms, but both the magnitude and the seasonal patterns showed considerable interannual variability. Coast-wide annual chl-a anomalies were positive in years with elevated PAR, low SST, and a reduction in downwelling-favorable winds - conditions that are indicative of reduced cyclonic circulation associated with a weak Aleutian Low. The apparent negative effect of strong cyclonic circulation in the GOA on chl-a levels was further supported by negative relationships between elevated sea levels and coast-wide chl-a in both the spring and fall. If chl-a concentrations in the coastal GOA reflect productivity, these results are contrary to the prevailing view that strong cyclonic circulation enhances productivity in the GOA. The variability in the chl-a in each of four distinct and spatially contiguous regions that differed in the timing and magnitude of the spring and fall blooms was associated with different combinations of environmental variables.

Dust emission controls on the lower Kuiseb River valley, Central Namib	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Global contemporary dust research has identified large inland basins as significant sources of mineral aerosols in the atmosphere. Smaller fluvial sources have received lesser attention despite their global prevalence. To determine the emissive potential of any dust source requires the identification the hydrologic, synoptic and meteorologic state of the system. This study considers the Kuiseb River, which is a significant dust source in southern Africa, and clearly highlights the fluvial-aeolian link in the emission process and emphasises the supply limited nature of such sources. MODIS satellite imagery combined with synoptic circulation and wind speed data were analysed to establish emission frequency in the context of climatology and flood frequency data. Twenty-two emission events were detected between 2005 and 2008, occurring from April to August, driven by north easterly winds largely associated with west coast troughs and berg winds. The ephemeral flooding of the Kuiseb River was identified as the most likely contributor of sediment to the lower reaches while topographic channelling may enhance the wind flow.

Assessment of MODIS-Aqua chlorophyll-a algorithms in coastal and shelf waters of the eastern Arabian Sea	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The use of ocean colour remote sensing to facilitate the monitoring of phytoplankton biomass in coastal waters is hampered by the high variability in absorption and scattering from substances other than phytoplankton. The eastern Arabian Sea coastal shelf is influenced by river run-off, winter convection and monsoon upwelling. Bio-optical parameters were measured along this coast from March 2009 to June 2011, to characterise the optical water type and validate three Chlorophyll-a (Chla) algorithms applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua (MODIS-Aqua) data against in situ measurements. Ocean Colour 3 band ratio (OC3M), Garver-Siegel-Maritorena Model (GSM) and Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP) Chla algorithms were evaluated. OC3M performed better than GSM and GIOP in all regions and overall, was within 11% of in situ Chla. GSM was within 24% of in situ Chla and GIOP on average was 55% lower. OC3M was less affected by errors in remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) and by spectral variations in absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)(lambda)) of coloured dissolved organic material (CDOM) and total suspended matter (TSM) compared to the other algorithms. A nine year Chla time series from 2002 to 2011 was generated to assess regional differences between OC3M and GSM. This showed that in the north eastern shelf, maximum Chla occurred during the winter monsoon from December to February, where GSM consistently gave higher Chla compared to OC3M. In the south eastern shelf, maximum Chla occurred in June to July during the summer monsoon upwelling, and OC3M yielded higher Chla compared to GSM. OC3M currently provides the most accurate Chla estimates for the eastern Arabian Sea coastal waters. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, C; Jiang, H; Zhang, Y				Chen, Cheng; Jiang, Hong; Zhang, Yu			Anthropogenic impact on spring bloom dynamics in the Yangtze River Estuary based on SeaWiFS mission (1998-2010) and MODIS (2003-2010) observations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Nutrient output from the Yangtze River to the sea has increased dramatically since the 1960s, and over the past 50 years more than 50,000 reservoirs on the Yangtze River basin have had little impact on water discharge, but have drastically reduced the annual river-to-sea sediment flux, especially after 2000. This can be presumed to have a close link with the 73% (accumulated incidences) of algal bloom reported on China's eastern coast which have taken place in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and its adjacent waters from 2000 to 2009. A conceptual view explains that the algal bloom zone varies between the YRE and mid-shelf waters of the East China Sea, where the optimum balance of light availability and nutrient supply exists. A reduction in turbidity with declining river-to-sea sediment load around the YRE would provide a deeper euphotic layer for the growth of phytoplankton, which is stimulated by eutrophication following increased river-to-sea sewage. Although the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) represents an immature state of ocean colour remote sensing, especially in coastal waters, in general, SeaWiFS serves as a useful tool to highlight the geographical spread and intensity of spring bloom dynamics at the basin scale in the YRE. We suggest that the problem of skin effect bias in spaceborne observation is minimal and that satellite-derived pigment data should be mainly from phytoplankton production when estimating Chl-a during the spring bloom season in the YRE by analysis of bio-optical properties of spring bloom waters. Comparisons between in situ and simultaneous SeaWiFS-derived Chl-a suggest that SeaWiFS standard Chl-a data show comparable results with ship survey data, with a mean ratio (in situ to satellite ratio) of 1.28 +/- 0.78 (R-2=0.71, n=14, p< 0.001) in spring blooms. We took the seasonal average Chl-a in our defined multi-year highly productive zone in the YRE (28 degrees 3032 degrees N, 122 degrees 123 degrees 30 degrees E, A) compared with its neighbouring region B from 1998 to 2010, and determined a linear least-squares fit to the trend line. Further analysis in the form of t-tests was run for four seasonal periods, MarchApril, MayJune (spring bloom season), JulyAugust, and SeptemberOctober. The SeaWiFS-derived 13-year Chl-a mean slope in the spring bloom season is significantly (P=0.012) increasing by 0.212mgm(3) per year. However, such a trend in other seasons is not significant and there is also no significant variation in B over all seasons. Our results show that there is a positive relationship between the annual mean of Chl-a in the spring bloom season in A and annual sewage water discharge at the Yangtze River basin, and similarly a negative relationship between Chl-a and annual river sediment flux was found from 1998 to 2010. Variation in 3-year sediment flux, sewage water discharge, and Chl-a was 25% (+/- 18%), 15% (+/- 5%), and 14% (+/- 6%), respectively. This result supports the findings of previous studies that human activity has a measurable effect on coastal phytoplankton biomass and that the eutrophication effect seems to stimulate increased Chl-a in the spring bloom season, but not on the enhancement of annual Chl-a levels in the YRE.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				AUG 10	2013	34	15					5296	5316		10.1080/01431161.2013.786851								WOS:000318765000003

The Malaspina Dragon: A newly-discovered pattern of the early spring bloom in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												MERIS and MODIS ocean colour satellite imagery of the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada shows a recurring pattern which suggests seeding of the early spring bloom from deep, glacial inlets to the north. We call the pattern the "Malaspina Dragon" after its shape in satellite imagery in 2005, 2008 and 2009 shortly after it enters the Strait. It appears to have been active in five of the nine years, 2003-2011. We use the satellite imagery to determine a start date for the main spring bloom in the Strait of Georgia in each year, and show that in the five "Dragon" years the spring bloom occurred nearly 4 weeks earlier than in the remaining four, suggesting that seeding from inlets may be a significant factor controlling timing. In 2009 and 2010, the presence and evolution of the bloom was confirmed using an ocean glider, and in 2010 and 2011, recording fluorometers provided surface data. Ship samples in 2009 showed that the bloom forming the Dragon pattern consisted of diatoms (Thalassiosira spp.) similar to those that form the main spring bloom in the Strait.

We moored artificial collectors in six sites from June 2007 to August 2008 and replaced them every 2months. We used monthly (July 2002-September 2011) sea surface temperature (SST, degrees C) and surface chlorophyll-a concentration (SSChl, mgm(-3)) Aqua/MODIS satellite data to describe seasonal environmental behaviour study area. Also, we recorded bottom temperature at each site every 4h, and every 2months measured sea surface salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen. We used a repeated measures anova to evaluate differences in the number of recruited spat between main factors, and analysed the presence of multimodal spat shell size frequency distributions. Overall, spat recruitment was negatively correlated with seawater temperature and showed higher spat recruitment abundances throughout winter, which is the season with the highest surface chlorophyll a concentration. We estimated multimodal shell size frequency distributions characterized by more than one modal size. The natural collection of A. ventricosus spat on artificial collectors in the area can be successfully performed over a protracted period (November-December to May-June). Our results extend the area where collection of A. ventricosus spat can be successful.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2013	44	9					1383	1398		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2012.03143.x								WOS:000322814000006

Formulation of TKE based empirical diffusivity relations from turbulence measurements and incorporation in a Lagrangian particle dispersion model	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												In this paper a turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) based empirical formulation for turbulent diffusion is developed from ultra sonic anemometer measurements at a tropical coastal site Kalpakkam situated on the southeast coast of India. The diffusivity relationship is validated against an independent observation from SODAR. This formulation for turbulent diffusion is incorporated in a particle trajectory model FLEXPART-WRF. Under this formulation the turbulent component of the motion of pseudo particles in the model can be related to the TKE. Two case studies of dispersion simulation are carried out by incorporating the new relationship in FLEXPART-WRF. In the first case the simulated plume spread is compared against a real smoke plume from an accidental oil tank fire obtained from satellite image (MODIS-TERRA). In the second case, observed plume in the Hanford tracer experiment is simulated and normalized concentration profiles at different arcs are compared with that of the simulation. Results demonstrate that the simulated TKE using Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino scheme in the Weather Research & Forecasting along with the new relationships for TKE apportionment simulate the dispersion pattern better than the Hanna scheme based on surface layer parameterization.																	1567-7419					AUG	2013	13	4					353	369		10.1007/s10652-013-9273-8								WOS:000321916600003

We present satellite observations showing that the event had its origin north of the mouth of the Amazon in an area not previously associated with Sargassum growth. A significant concentration of Sargassum was detected in April, when it was centred at about 7 degrees N latitude and 45 degrees W longitude. By July it had spread to the coast of Africa in the east and to the Lesser Antilles and the Caribbean in the west. We have previously used images from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to show the value of satellite observations in tracking patterns of Sargassum. For the years 2003-2010, we were able to determine the seasonal distribution over the range of 20 degrees-40 degrees N latitude and 100 degrees-40 degrees W longitude covering the Sargasso Sea' region of the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2011, satellite data showed a large shift in the distribution, whose cause is unclear.																	2150-704X					AUG 1	2013	4	8					764	773		10.1080/2150704X.2013.796433								WOS:000320642900005

We suggest a novel method involving Envisat retrievals followed by application of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Earth Observation Link Stand-Alone (EOLISA) catalogue for the calculation of cloud cover (CC) of tropical storms. In particular, we focus on the northeast monsoon, which is less studied as compared with the more regularly investigated southwest monsoon. We found that the CC was of the order of 946,598km(2) on 23 November 2011. In contrast, we also calculated the CC of tropical cyclone Thane that occurred on 31 December 2011, which was found to be 1,222,224km(2) an increase of 197.5%. To further increase CC calculation accuracy, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals were used simultaneously over both visible and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectra. The precipitable water levels were analysed using Tool for High-resolution Observation Review (THOR) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) retrievals. Envisat data were then used to track Thane's trajectory. These multiple-image analyses are coupled with large-eddy simulation runs large velocities from sheared eddies were obtained at landfall. The runs were simultaneously performed over two locales on 29 December 2011 first at Karaikal, where the impact of Thane was severe, and then at Chennai, where the cyclone's fury had become somewhat curtailed. This procedural analysis, coupled with model simulations, can be used effectively by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) personnel and decision-makers of the municipal corporations of vulnerable cities along coastal Tamil Nadu.																	0143-1161					JUL 20	2013	34	14					4933	4950		10.1080/01431161.2013.783249								WOS:000317728600004						
J	Barnes, BB; Hu, CM				Barnes, Brian B.; Hu, Chuanmin			A Hybrid Cloud Detection Algorithm to Improve MODIS Sea Surface Temperature Data Quality and Coverage Over the Eastern Gulf of Mexico	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Cloud contamination can lead to significant biases in sea surface temperature (SST) as estimated from satellite measurements. The effectiveness of four cloud detection algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in retaining valid SST data and masking cloud-contaminated data was assessed for all 2125 daytime and nighttime images during 2010 over the eastern Gulf of Mexico and including the east coast of Florida. None of the cloud detection algorithms was found to be sufficient to reliably differentiate clouds from valid SST, particularly during anomalously cold events. The strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm were identified, and a new hybrid cloud detection algorithm was developed to maximize valid data retention while excluding cloud-contaminated pixels. The hybrid algorithm was based on a decision tree, which includes a set of rules to use existing algorithms in different ways according to time and location. Comparing with > 10 000 concurrent in situ SST measurements from buoys, images processed with the hybrid algorithm showed increases in data capture and improved accuracy statistics over most existing algorithms. In particular, while keeping the same accuracy, the hybrid algorithm resulted in nearly 20% more SST retrievals than the most accurate algorithm (Quality SST) currently being used for operational processing. The increases in both data coverage and SST range should improve MODIS data products for more reliable SST retrievals in near real time, thus enhancing the ocean observing capacity to detect anomaly events and study short-and long-term SST changes in coastal environments.																	0196-2892					JUN	2013	51	6	1				3273	3285		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2223217								WOS:000320940600006

Rama			Ship-Borne Measurements of Columnar and Surface Aerosol Loading over the Bay of Bengal during W-ICARB Campaign: Role of Airmass Transport, Latitudinal and Longitudinal Gradients	AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH												The present study analyzes simultaneous and collocated measurements of spectral columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the variations in total mass concentration of near surface aerosols in the marine atmosphere over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the winter phase of the Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB) expedition of December and January 2008/2009 on board the Oceanographic Research Vessel (ORV) of Sagar Kanya. High AOD(500) values (> 0.8) are found close to coastal regions in the western and northern BoB due to outflow of aerosols and pollutants from the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). In these regions, the (sic)ngstrom exponent a380-1020 values are also found to be high (similar to 1.2-1.3), indicating relative abundance of accumulation-mode continental aerosols. Low AOD(500) (0.1-0.2) values are observed in central and southern BoB, far away from the mainland. The AOD(500) and total aerosol mass loading increased along with the latitude. The total mass concentration is found to vary between 15 mu g/m3 and 45 mu g/m(3), with higher loadings near the east coast and northern parts of the BoB. NCEP reanalysis of the data with winds at 925 hPa, along with airmass trajectories calculated using the HYSPLIT model, suggest transport of continental aerosols from central and northern India over the BoB at lower heights, and mineral dust aerosol transport from arid regions in the west of India at higher altitudes; while the increase in aerosol loading over eastern BoB was strongly affected by airmasses originating from Southeast Asia. The spatial correlation map between the MODIS and MISR AOD data is analyzed, revealing a strong correlation between the two datasets. The influence of wind speed and continental airmass on AOD is also examined, which provides information on the effects of the adjoining landmass on the marine aerosol field.

In this study, more than 60 dust storms that occurred during the period 2003-2011 are investigated on the basis of MODIS satellite images, and 12 of the dust storms are selected for synoptic analysis using the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis Data. The potential dust sources in the Middle East and south-west Asian region (20A degrees E to 80A degrees E, 5A degrees N to 50A degrees N) are analyzed and used in the synoptic analysis. Dust storms in the region can be grouped into two main categories, i.e., the Shamal dust storms and the frontal dust storms. Synoptic systems, associated with the two categories, are distinguished and the frequency of the patterns is identified. For 68% of the Shamal dust storms, a high pressure system is situated between 0A degrees E to 30A degrees E and 27A degrees N to 45A degrees N, and a low pressure system between 50A degrees E to 70A degrees E and 23A degrees N to 43A degrees N. For 86% of the frontal dust storms, a high is located between 51A degrees E to 67A degrees E and 18A degrees N to 33A degrees N and a low between 28A degrees E to 48A degrees E and 32A degrees N to 43A degrees N. Three main patterns for Shamal dust storms are identified, which represent about 60% of the Shamal dust storms. This analysis confirms that the Shamal is related to the anticyclones located over northern Africa to Eastern Europe and the monsoon trough over Iraq, southern Iran, Pakistan and the Indian Subcontinent. The analysis also shows that the main dust sink for the frontal dust storms in Tigris and Euphrates alluvial plain extends from center of Iraq to west and center of Iran and, in most severe cases, to northern Iran and the southern coast of the Caspian Sea.

J	Katlane, R; Nechad, B; Ruddick, K; Zargouni, F				Katlane, Rim; Nechad, Bouchra; Ruddick, Kevin; Zargouni, Fouad			Optical remote sensing of turbidity and total suspended matter in the Gulf of Gabes	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Optical remote sensing was used to provide scientific information to support environmental management in the Gulf of Gabes that is located in the southeastern coast of Tunisia. This region is characterized by shallow continental shelf subjected to semi-diurnal tides. Industrial activities in this area since the early 1970s may have contributed to the degradation of the biodiversity of the ecosystem with eutrophication problems and disappearance of benthic and planktonic species. To assess the long-term effect of anthropogenic and natural discharges on the Gulf of Gabes, the optical environment of the coastal waters is assessed from in situ measurements of total suspended matter concentration (TSM), Secchi depth and turbidity (TU). This monitoring requires regular seaborne measurements (monthly), which is very expensive and difficult to obtain. The objective of the present study is the evaluation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) AQUA data compared with two sampling campaigns realized at the study area. To map turbidity data from MODIS images, a semi-empirical algorithm was applied at band 667 nm. This bio-optical algorithm has already been calibrated and validated on the Belgian coast. The validation of this algorithm on the Gulf of Gabes using in situ measurements of turbidity and remotely sensed turbidity obtained from MODIS imagery shows a correlation coefficient of 68.9%. Seasonal and annual average maps for TSM and TU were then computed over the Gulf of Gabes using MODIS imagery. The obtained results of TSM and TU from remotely sensed data are conformable with those obtained through the analysis of in situ measurements. Therefore, remote sensing techniques offer a better and efficient tool for mapping and monitoring turbidity over the whole region.																	1866-7511					MAY	2013	6	5					1527	1535		10.1007/s12517-011-0438-9								WOS:000318443000019

Seasonal variability of chlorophyll-a and oceanographic conditions in Sabah waters in relation to Asian monsoon-a remote sensing study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study was conducted to investigate the influence of Asian monsoon on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content in Sabah waters and to identify the related oceanographic conditions that caused phytoplankton blooms at the eastern and western coasts of Sabah, Malaysia. A series of remote sensing measurements including surface Chl-a, sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, wind speed, wind stress curl, and Ekman pumping were analyzed to study the oceanographic conditions that lead to large-scale nutrients enrichment in the surface layer. The results showed that the Chl-a content increased at the northwest coast from December to April due to strong northeasterly wind and coastal upwelling in Kota Kinabalu water. The southwest coast (Labuan water) maintained high concentrations throughout the year due to the effect of Padas River discharge during the rainy season and the changing direction of Baram River plume during the northeast monsoon (NEM). However, with the continuous supply of nutrients from the upwelling area, the high Chl-a batches were maintained at the offshore water off Labuan for a longer time during NEM. On the other side, the northeast coast illustrated a high Chl-a in Sandakan water during NEM, whereas the northern tip off Kudat did not show a pronounced change throughout the year. The southeast coast (Tawau water) was highly influenced by the direction of the surface water transport between the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas and the prevailing surface currents. The study demonstrates the presence of seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Sabah waters which will aid in forecasting the possible biological response and could further assist in marine resource managements.

This paper is focused on the formulation of DEM based on the GOCART aerosol model, along with its integration and execution into the air quality model. It also addresses the testing of the module and its evaluation by contrasting results against satellite products such as MODIS and CALIPSO and ground-level observations of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and concentration levels of PM10 for different periods in July 2007. DEM was found capable of reproducing the spatial (horizontal and vertical) and temporal profiles of Saharan dust outbreaks into the Mediterranean basin and the Atlantic coast of Africa. Moreover, it was observed that its combination with CMAQ increased the correlation degree between observed and modelled PM10 concentrations at the selected monitoring locations. DEM also enhanced CMAQ capabilities to reproduce observed AOT, although significant underestimations remain. The implementation of CMAQ + DEM succeeded in capturing Saharan dust transport into the Iberian Peninsula, with contributions up to 25 and 14 mu g m(-3) in 1 h and 24 h average PM10 respectively. The general improvement of total PM10 predictions in Spain are however moderate. The analysis of model performance for the main PM components points out that remaining PM10 underestimation is due to dust local sources missing in the inventories and misrepresentation of organic aerosol processes, which constitutes the main areas for future improvement of CMAQ capabilities to simulate particulate matter within SERCA.

Radiometric normalization for change detection in peatlands: a modified temporal invariant cluster approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Radiometric normalization is a vital stage in any change detection study due to the complex interactions of radiance and irradiance between the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Compensation for variables such as sun's angle, surface profile, atmospheric conditions, and sensor calibration coefficients are essential in achieving a radiometrically stable data base of multi-temporal, multi-spectral imagery for a change detection study. In this study, five Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images taken over the east coast of Ireland in 2001 were geometrically corrected and topographically normalized for further processing and analysis. Assessment of various vegetation indices showed that the enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) gave the highest accuracy in identifying the various vegetation types and habitats in the Wicklow Mountains National Park. The initial analysis of radiometric normalization with temporal invariant clusters (TICs) gave poor results due to the spectral heterogeneity of urban pixels within each image. A revised TIC subset normalized method was developed using regional growth parameters in urban environments to limit the spatial and spectral extent of pixels used in the TIC scene normalization process. Correlation analysis between the TIC-subset-normalized ETM+ data and Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) absolute corrected data produced coefficient of determination (R-2) values between 0.88 and 0.98. Such results demonstrated the robustness of the TIC subset normalization procedure when correcting for atmospheric variability between images while maintaining spectral integrity. Statistical analysis on master slave and TIC-subset-normalized slave data using cumulative distribution curves derived from image histograms showed an 86.93% reduction in the maximum difference between master and slave data due to the TIC subset normalization process. This procedure of radiometric normalization is suitable in landscapes with a low density of spectrally stable targets.

MODIS-based corn grain yield estimation model incorporating crop phenology information	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A crop yield estimation model using time-series MODIS WDRVI was developed. The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the "Shape-Model Fitting Method". MODIS WDRVI taken 7-10 days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10% especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Bloom of Hemidiscus hardmannianus (Bacillariophyceae) and Its Impact on Water Quality and Plankton Community Structure in a Mangrove Wetland	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												An intense monospecies bloom of the centric diatom Hemidiscus hardmannianus (Greville) Mann. (Bacillariophyceae) occurred in the coastal waters of Sundarban mangrove wetland, India on 22 July, 2010. The species was abruptly flourished (mean density 8.86x106cells/L) resulting intense green coloration of water. The greatest impoverishment of diversity and density of phytoplankton, micro- and mesozooplankton community was observed during the bloom. The phytoplankton community showed an extreme reduction in diversity (12 species to one) and sharp decrease in standing stock (12.84x103 to 8.86x106cells/L) during this period. The late bloom condition coincided with sudden and huge arrival of a clupoid fish Hilsa ilisha which forms the most potential fisheries in Sundarban deltaic region. An attempt has been made to correlate the satellite remote sensing-derived information to the bloom conditions. The MODIS-Aqua derived chlorophyll and TMI satellite derived sea surface temperature and wind speed maps have been interpreted.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				APR	2013	41	4					333	339		10.1002/clen.201200012								WOS:000317288800005						
J	Ciappa, A; Pietranera, L				Ciappa, Achille; Pietranera, Luca			High resolution observations of the Terra Nova Bay polynya using COSMO-SkyMed X-SAR and other satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												In this study we analysed a combination of high and coarse resolution X-band COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes collected during two periods in July and September 2011 over the Terra Nova Bay (Antarctica). High resolution (5 m per pixel) and lower resolution SAR (100 m) acquired over intervals of the order of minutes provided both, fine details and a full large-scale view of the polynya. The analysis was supported by several Ice Surface Temperature (IST) maps per day obtained from the thermal band of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and some additional C-band Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) scenes available during the July period. The dataset revealed two major openings around 2000 km(2) occurred in the July period and one opening around 2500 km2 in the September period. The SAR analysis revealed that the polynya area is clearly distinguished from the sea ice pack offshore during the growing and closing phase. During the opening phase, the open polynya area was characterized by newly formed frazil ice organized as ice streaks parallel to the wind direction and separated by a distance of between 300 and 800 m. Waves of length between 30 and 70 m were noted on the streaks of frazil ice and on the frazil and grease ice accumulated at the polynya border. The early stage of the growing phase was indicated by the uniform distance of the ice streaks near the border of the polynya, while convergence was an indication that the wind was slowing down and that the growing phase was at a late stage. The closing phase was characterized by the progressive freezing of the open polynya area from the downwind border toward the coast. The results of this analysis suggest that the detection of the polynya area from thermal infrared or microwave temperatures is more effective during the growing phase, when large areas of unfrozen water are present within the polynya, than during the closing phase when large areas of thin sea-ice prevail.

J	Le, CF; Hu, CM; Cannizzaro, J; English, D; Muller-Karger, F; Lee, Z				Le, Chengfeng; Hu, Chuanmin; Cannizzaro, Jennifer; English, David; Muller-Karger, Frank; Lee, Zhongping			Evaluation of chlorophyll-a remote sensing algorithms for an optically complex estuary	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla in mg m(-3)) in optically complex waters using remote sensing is difficult because traditional empirical (e.g., OCx blue/green band ratios) or semi-analytical algorithms (e.g., GSM or QAA) rely on blue-green wavelengths where water constituents other than phytoplankton often dominate the optical properties and satellite-derived reflectance in these wavelengths often contains substantial uncertainties. Some recent attempts have been made to derive Chla based on red and near-infrared wavelengths to avoid such problems. Using in situ data collected from 9 cruises between 1998 and 2010 in Tampa Bay, a large estuary (similar to 1000 km(2)) located in Florida (U.S.A.), we first tested three Chla algorithms, where each algorithm derived Chla as a function of independent variable x = Rrs(lambda(2))/Rrs(lambda(1)), x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)] * Rrs(lambda(3)), and x = [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)]/[Rrs(lambda(4))(-1) - Rrs(lambda(3))(-1)], respectively. Here Rrs(lambda) is the remote sensing reflectance, lambda is the wavelength from 660 to 760 nm, and the positions of the these wavelengths were determined using an objective method while the functional forms of Chla=f(x) were determined through regression between Chla and x. A synthetic chlorophyll index (SCI) using 4 green-red MERIS wavelengths was also tested. Using field measured Rrs(lambda) data, all these algorithms showed the potentials to retrieve Chla between similar to 2 and similar to 80 mg m(-3), with 2-band algorithms showing the best performance. However, when satellite-derived Rrs(lambda) data were used, none of the four algorithms was applicable to MODIS in this estuary, and only a 2-band algorithm in the form of Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) was applicable to MERIS, with other algorithms significantly degraded. The coefficients of the 2-band algorithm for MERIS were determined through regression between in situ Chla and MERIS-derived Rrs(709)/Rrs(665), with the final form of Chla = 10.55x(1.51). The algorithm yielded mean relative errors of 35.3% for Chla between 1.0 and 30.0 mg m(-3) when an in situ dataset from the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) was used to tune the algorithm coefficients, which was further validated using another independent dataset. Spatial Chla patterns derived from MERIS for both low and high concentrations also showed reasonable agreement with in situ measurements. In contrast, 3-band and 4-band algorithms yielded significant patchiness in spatial patterns that differed from in situ measurements. Tests in Chesapeake Bay (located on the east coast of the U.S.A.) showed reasonable spatial patterns of Chla using the Rrs(709)/Rrs(665) approach, with a mean relative error of 34.7% for Chla ranging between 1.6 and 21.5 mg m(-3), suggesting that the approach may be generally applicable to other turbid estuaries once algorithm coefficients are adjusted using local data.

The eddy was generated after a sudden increase of the trade winds causing an enhanced southward flow and upwelling at the coast of Senegal. After this wind burst event, an extremely nonlinear cyclonic eddy with a radius of about 10 to 20 km evolved downstream of Cap-Vert with Rossby number larger than one. Our analysis suggests that the eddy was generated by flow separation at the headland of Cap-Vert. The eddy was tracked on its way into the open North Atlantic Ocean from satellites over 31 days via its sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a (CHL) signature and by a satellite-tracked surface drifter. The satellite images show that this small-scale eddy transported nutrients from the upwelling region westward into the oligotrophic North Atlantic thus giving rise to enhanced CHL concentration there. Maximum CHL concentration was encountered few days after vortex generation, which is consistent with a delayed plankton growth following nutrient supply into the euphotic zone within the eddy. Furthermore, the eddy was imaged by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the Envisat satellite. It is shown that the radar signatures of cold eddies result from damping of short surface waves by biogenic surface films which arise from surface-active material secreted by the biota in the cold eddy as well as by the change of the stability of the air-sea interface.

J	Badosa, J; Haeffelin, M; Chepfer, H				Badosa, Jordi; Haeffelin, Martial; Chepfer, Helene			Scales of spatial and temporal variation of solar irradiance on Reunion tropical island	SOLAR ENERGY												Tropical islands, such as Reunion Island (21 degrees S, 55.5 degrees E) in the southwestern Indian Ocean, have significant solar resource that is highly variable in both spatial and temporal scales because of heterogeneous and rapidly changing cloudiness. The characterization of this variability is essential to enhance penetration of solar energy systems, such as photovoltaic or thermal farms. This work focuses on the large-scale, meso-scale and local-scale variability in cloudiness and surface solar irradiance at different temporal scales. Vertical velocity at 500 hPa from ERA-Interim reanalyses are used to study large-scale subsidence. CALIPSO, MODIS and Meteosat-7 satellite observations are used to study cloud properties and associated irradiances at the meso-scale. Solar irradiance measurements at seven Meteo-France stations around Reunion Island are used to investigate three meteorologically-distinct regions, namely the windward and leeward coasts, and the coasts parallel to the general trade wind direction. Day-to-day variations in daily irradiation values and diurnal-scale variability of solar irradiances are seasonally dependent. Winter seasons are characterized by large-scale atmospheric subsidence and broken low-level cloudiness, while in summer, clouds are found both at low and high altitudes. Three parameters are introduced to characterize solar irradiance diurnal cycle regimes. Five physically-sensible regimes are found, identified as clear, morning clear, overcast, afternoon clear, and random cloudiness. Regime occurrences have marked seasonal dependencies and vary significantly between the windward, leeward and lateral coasts. In winter and early summer, when cloudiness is driven predominantly by local (thermal, orographic) processes, the aggregated solar daily irradiation (average of the seven ground stations) remains near 80% of the clear-sky irradiation. In late summer, this values drops below 65% as large-scale overcast systems regularly affect the entire island. The station-to-station dis-correlation distance in terms of daily clear-sky index, defined as the distance for which the correlation coefficient drops to 0.5, is 62 km in summer and 29 km in winter. For hourly clear-sky indexes, the station-to-station dis-correlation distances is 4 and 3 km, for summer and winter, respectively. Accordingly, aggregate analyses show that compensation effects are more important at hourly than daily time scales. The measurements also reveal that the atmosphere over the island tends to be clearer in the morning than in the afternoon while over the ocean surrounding the island, the opposite is true. These results provide insights and tools to help develop improved diurnal-scale solar irradiance forecast systems for tropical islands. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

LST anomaly is defined as a region that presents either positive or negative reconstructed LST value. The environmental assessment of USA indicated that only for the 25 % of the study area (Mississippi drainage basin), the LST is predicted by the H, LAT, LON. Regions with milled climatic pattern were identified in the West Coast while the coldest climatic pattern is observed for Mid USA.

However, there were limited localized studies in the Arabian Gulf and satellite-based tools have not been adapted to local dusty climate. In this study, in situ measurements were collected to validate existing ocean color algorithms and develop new models for better adapting to the environmental conditions of the Abu Dhabi coast. Secchi disk depth (SDD) from February to April 2010 at 117 stations were collected, 35 of which were retained after strict data quality control. SDD varied in the range of 1.67 similar to 10.97 m. "Concurrent" MODIS derived diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 (K(d_)490) was used to estimate SDD. Two models were established. Both models have shown their potential to detect water turbidity over Abu Dhabi coast. More in situ measurements are required to assess and improve the performance of the newly established models.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-40-4				2013																		WOS:000334165801057

Satellite images provide reliable important information on oceanographic conditions and simultaneously support marine environmental monitoring and assessment. Monthly images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite (MODIS-Aqua) derived chl-a and SST from July 2002 to June 2011 around archipelagic waters of Spermonde Indonesia were used to investigate the relationship between SST and chl-a. While the daily data were used to produce the potential fishing ground maps of Rastrelliger kanagurta at the study area. Climatological images showed that the SST during the Southeast monsoon is lower thanthe Northwest monsoon, while chl-a during the Southeast monsoon is higher than the Northwest monsoonand isscattered along the coast. SST and chl-a showed an inverse correlation, with coefficient of correlation at R = 0.542. Preferred range of R. kanagurta were 30.75 +/- 0.(21)degrees C for SST and 0.31 +/- 0.10 mg m(-3) for chl-a. Potential fishing grounds were found located around the coast. This study indicates that satellite image is able to determine the relationship between SST and chl-a and identify aggregation grounds of R. kanagurta.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1199-9				2013	1571						466	472		10.1063/1.4858699								WOS:000331836300079

Spatial Distribution of Rastrelliger kanagurta (Cuvier 1817) in the South China Sea Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)	2013 UKM FST POSTGRADUATE COLLOQUIUM	AIP Conference Proceedings				Universiti-Kebangsaan-Malaysia, Faculty-of-Science-and-Technology Postgraduate Colloquium	JUL 03-04, 2013	Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Bangi, MALAYSIA		Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol			Rastrelliger kanagurta inhabits the South China Sea, where it is the most abundant commercial fish. Understanding distribution of this species is important. Objective of this study is to describe the relationship between spatial distribution of R. kanagurta and its local environmental factors. Chlorophyll-a distribution and sea surface temperature was obtained from Aqua MODIS satellite image. Fisheries data of 2007 to 2010 were obtained from the Southeast Asean Fisheries Department Center (SEAFDEC). These data were analyzed in relation to physical and environmental factors to establish the spatial-temporal distribution of the species. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated from the fisheries data and used as abundance index. Kernel Density maps of the abundance were created. The result showed that the abundance generated by Kernel Density analysis at 10.0 to 12.0 were associated with chlorophyll-a concentration of 0.4 +/- 0.1 mg/m(3) and sea surface temperature of 27.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C at offshore of Pahang coast. The density maps showed that the increase of R. kanagurta abundance was occurred in October. The environmental factors in South China Sea played an important role on R. kanagurta's density patterns. This study indicated the capability of GIS and satellite image to indicate aggregation area of R. kanagurta.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1199-9				2013	1571						473	479		10.1063/1.4858700								WOS:000331836300080

MODIS 1B data of Terra satellite at 13:19 28/09/2011 is selected. The study area is between 21.0 degrees N similar to 23.0 degrees N and 117.0 degrees E similar to 123.0 degrees E ([2]).To begin with, the author has retrieved the atmospheric transmittance and modified its impact factors from the MODIS data. Then the author calculated the vegetation coverage through the calculating vegetation index and respectively estimated the Surface Emissivity according to the type of vegetation coverage. Finally, the LST was retrieved by adopting the Split-Window Algorithm and then the author analyzed the influence of clouds on the retrieval of LST.																			978-1-4673-6079-1; 978-1-4673-6077-7				2013							697	700										WOS:000331070300156

In this study, we demonstrate the synergistic measurements of aloft aerosol plumes by a ground-based NOAA-CREST lidar network (CLN) along the US East Coast, the AERONET-sun/sky radiometer network at lidar sites, and satellite observations. During the plume intrusion period on March 6, 2012, the CLN and AERONET measurements were consistent in illustrating the onset of dust aerosol plumes. We observed two-layers of aerosol located at 1.0 similar to 8.0 km altitude. The column-average volume size distributions show increasing concentration of both fine- and coarse-modes aerosols, but are dominated by the coarse-mode. Direct lidar inversions illustrate that the aerosol plume layers contributed up to 70% of the total AOD. NOAA-HYSPLIT back-trajectories and CALIPSO observations indicate the trans-Pacific transport of Asian-dust at 3 - 8 km altitude to the US East Coast. Meanwhile, the NOAA-HMS fire and smoke products illustrate the transport and possible mixture of dust with fine-mode smoke particles from the middle and southwestern US. The small Angstrom exponents of MODIS/Aqua in the US East Coast imply the dominance of coarse-mode particles. Accordingly, the upper layer of coarse mode aerosols is most likely transported from the East Asia, while the lower layer at 1-3 km altitude probably consists of continental dust particles from the western US mixed with fine-mode smoke particles. In addition, the transport and vertical structure of aerosol are investigated with the NAAPS global aerosol transport model.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9762-8				2013	8894								88940K	10.1117/12.2029281								WOS:000328459000014

In situ sea water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a and the atmospheric wind stresses at the Constanta shore station (44(0)14' N, 28(0)38'E) and on the Romanian Black Sea shelf were used to study the up-welling, algal bloom and hypoxia events that occurred in 2010. The highly productive zones in the Western Black Sea coast are usually associated with the up-welling phenomena which contribute to the heterogeneous distribution of chlorophyll-a, suspended and dissolved organic matter. The occurrence and extent of these events during 2010 are validated with MODIS - AQUA satellite images (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chl_a) and with the results of the regional forecast system for the Western Black Sea. The unusual high values of air temperatures recorded in the summer of 2010 and the limited deep water mixing lead to the high values of sea water temperature (26-28 degrees C) favoring the strong algal bloom on the southern part of the Romanian Black Sea Coast. The low oxygen concentration (a minimum of 34.80 mu M recorded at Constanta) was measured from the coast up to 16 km offshore in the sea upper layer, causing the local hypwda event observed in the shallow water near the coast.

J	Gurova, E; Lehmann, A; Ivanov, A				Gurova, Evgenia; Lehmann, Andreas; Ivanov, Andrei			Upwelling dynamics in the Baltic Sea studied by a combined SAR/infrared satellite data and circulation model analysis	OCEANOLOGIA												Data from the space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard the Envisat satellite and MODIS spectroradiometers on board the Terra/Aqua satellites, and the high resolution Sea Ice-Ocean Model of the Baltic Sea (BSIOM) have been used to investigate two upwelling events in the SE Baltic Sea. The combined analysis was applied to the upwelling events in July 2006 along the coasts of the Baltic States, and in June 2008 along the Polish coast and Hel Peninsula. Comparisons indicated good agreement between the sea surface temperatures and roughness signatures detected in satellite imagery and model results. It is shown that BSIOM can simulate upwelling events realistically. The utilization of modelled hydrodynamics and wind stress data together with SAR and SST information provides an extended analysis and deeper understanding of the upwelling processes in the Baltic Sea. During the active phase of upwelling when the wind is strong, the resulting coastal jet is controlled by vorticity dynamics related to depth variations in the direction of the flow. Typical upwelling patterns are related to the meandering coastal jet and thus associated with topographic features. The longshore transport of the coastal jet is of the order of 10(4) m s(-1), and the offshore transport at the surface is of the order of 10(3) m s(-1), which respectively correspond to the total and largest river runoff to the Baltic Sea.

As part of the VIIRS mission Ocean Calibration and Validation Team, we have created a web-based automated match up tool that provides access to searchable fields for date, site, and products, and creates matchups between satellites (MODIS, VIIRS), and in-situ measurements (HyperPRO and SeaPRISM). The goal is to evaluate the standard VIIRS ocean color products produced by the IDPS and available through NOAA's CLASS data system. Comparisons are made with MODIS data for the same location, and VIIRS data processed using the NRL Automated Processing System (APS) used to produce operational products for the Navy. Results are shown for the first year of VIIRS data matching the satellite data with the data from Platform Eureka SeaPRISM off L. A.

Satellite views of the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton blooms in the eastern China seas over the past 14 yr (1998-2011)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The eastern China seas are some of the largest marginal seas in the world, where high primary productivity and phytoplankton blooms are often observed. However, little is known about their systematic variation of phytoplankton blooms on large spatial and long temporal scales due to the difficulty of monitoring bloom events by field measurement. In this study, we investigated the seasonal and interannual variability and long-term changes in phytoplankton blooms in the eastern China seas using a 14 yr (1998-2011) time series of satellite ocean colour data. To ensure a proper satellite dataset to figure out the bloom events, we validated and corrected the satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration (chl a) using extensive in situ datasets from two large cruises. The correlation coefficients between the satellite retrieval data and the in situ chl a on the logarithmic scale were 0.85 and 0.72 for the SeaWiFS and Aqua/MODIS data, respectively. Although satellites generally overestimate the chl a, especially in highly turbid waters, both the in situ and satellite data show that the overestimation of satellite-derived chl a has an upper limit value (10 mu g L-1), which can be used as a threshold for the identification of phytoplankton blooms to avoid the false blooms resulting from turbid waters. Taking 10 mu g L-1 as the threshold, we present the spatial-temporal variability of phytoplankton blooms in the eastern China seas over the past 14 yr. Most blooms occur in the Changjiang Estuary and along the coasts of Zhejiang, with a maximal frequency of 20% (about 73 days per year). The coasts of the northern Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea also have high-frequency blooms (up to 20 %). The blooms show significant seasonal variation, with most occurring in spring (April-June) and summer (July-September). The study also revealed a doubling in bloom intensity in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea during the past 14 yr. The nutrient supply in the eastern China seas might be a major controlling factor in bloom variation. The time series in situ nutrient datasets show that both the nitrate and phosphate concentrations increased more than twofold between 1998 and 2005 in the Yellow Sea. This might be the reason for the doubling of the bloom intensity index in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. In contrast, there has been no significant long-term increase or decrease in the Changjiang Estuary, which might be regulated by the Changjiang River discharge. These results offer a foundation for the study of the influence of phytoplankton blooms on the carbon flux estimation and biogeochemical processes in the eastern China seas.

However, measuring these variables has proven to be challenging because appropriate techniques have not yet been developed and extensive datasets of field estimates are lacking. The goal of this study was to estimate the relationship between field-observed snow particle-size parameters from across the East Antarctic ice sheet and a suite of spatial datasets (i.e. topography, remote-sensing data) using a principal component analysis (PCA). Five snow particle-size parameters were correlated to spatial datasets of the following five groups: (1) relief properties such as elevation and slope; (2) remote-sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors; (3) spatially interpolated data (i.e. 10 m maps of temperature and approximate snow accumulation in kg m(-2) a(-1)); (4) field-retrieved data on surface roughness; and (5) in situ elevation and distance from the coast. The results show that the relief parameter slope correlated best with the snow particle length and area (r=0.76, r=0.80). Further, the PCA indicated that the different remote-sensing parameters correlated differently with the size parameters and that the most common parameter in visual analysis, particle length (grain diameter), is not always the optimal parameter to characterize the snow particle size as, for example, area correlates better to slope and aspect than length.

Multisensor data and thermodynamic sea-ice model based sea-ice thickness chart with application to the Kara Sea, Arctic Russia	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												We introduce a method to construct an ice thickness chart using two satellite datasets and a one-dimensional high-resolution thermodynamic snow and sea-ice model (HIGHTSI). Thin-ice thickness up to 40 cm is retrieved using MODIS ice surface temperature data. For thicker ice, thickness is retrieved from a combination of SAR image and background level ice thickness chart H-i provided by HIGHTSI. Because H-i is inherently static, we utilize passive microwave data based sea-ice concentration charts to introduce mesoscale ice dynamics into H-i. In order to create the thickness chart, the value of modified H-i is scaled by a factor which depends on the magnitude of backscattering coefficient sigma(0). The proposed method is effective in cold winter conditions. We calculated a series of ice thickness charts covering the Kara Sea, Arctic Russia, during winter 2008/09. The ice thickness charts were validated against Russian ice charts. Our method gave realistic results in the thickness range 30-120 cm and was uncertain for the detection of thinner-ice areas. Due to the limitations in our reference dataset, more validation work is needed to establish the accuracy in more detail. Our thickness charts can be used for operational purposes and in climate studies.

J	Makynen, M; Cheng, B; Simila, M				Makynen, Marko; Cheng, Bin; Simila, Markku			On the accuracy of thin-ice thickness retrieval using MODIS thermal imagery over Arctic first-year ice	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												We have studied the accuracy of ice thickness (h(i)) retrieval based on night-time MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) ice surface temperature (T-s) images and HIRLAM (High Resolution Limited Area Model) weather forcing data from the Arctic. The study area is the Kara Sea and eastern part of the Barents Sea, and the study period spans November-April 2008-11 with 199 h(i) charts. For cloud masking of the MODIS data we had to use manual methods in order to improve detection of thin clouds and ice fog. The accuracy analysis of the retrieved h(i) was conducted with different methods, taking into account the inaccuracy of the HIRLAM weather forcing data. Maximum reliable h(i) under different air-temperature and wind-speed ranges was 35-50 cm under typical weather conditions (air temperature <-20 degrees C, wind speed <5 m s(-1)) present in the MODIS data. The accuracy is best for the 15-30 cm thickness range, similar to 38%. The largest h(i) uncertainty comes from air temperature data. Our ice-thickness limits are more conservative than those in previous studies where numerical weather prediction model data were not used in the h(i) retrieval. Our study gives new detailed insight into the capability of T-s-based h(i) retrieval in the Arctic marginal seas during freeze-up and wintertime, and should also benefit work where MODIS h(i) charts are used.

Reducing CO2 from shipping - do non-CO2 effects matter?	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Shipping is a growing sector in the global economy, and it contributions to global CO2 emissions are expected to increase. CO2 emissions from the world shipping fleet will likely be regulated in the near future, and studies have shown that significant emission reductions can be achieved at low cost. Regulations are being discussed for both existing ships as well as for future additions to the fleet. In this study a plausible CO2 emission reduction inventory is constructed for the cargo fleet existing in 2010, as well as for container ships, bulk ships and tankers separately. In the reduction inventories, CO2 emissions are reduced by 25-32% relative to baseline by applying 15 technical and operational emission reduction measures in accordance with a ship-type-specific cost-effectiveness criterion, and 9 other emission compounds are changed as a technical implication of reducing CO2. The overall climate and environmental effects of the changes to all 10 emission components in the reduction inventory are assessed using a chemical transport model, radiative forcing (RF) models and a simple climate model. We find substantial environmental and health benefits with up to 5% reduction in surface ozone levels, 15% reductions in surface sulfate and 10% reductions in wet deposition of sulfate in certain regions exposed to heavy ship traffic. The major ship types show distinctly different contributions in specific locations. For instance, the container fleet contributes 50% of the sulfate decline on the west coast of North America. The global radiative forcing from a 1 yr emission equal to the difference between baseline and reduction inventory shows an initial strong positive forcing from non-CO2 compounds. This warming effect is due to reduced cooling by aerosols and methane. After approximately 25 yr, the non-CO2 forcing is balanced by the CO2 forcing. For the global mean temperature change, we find a shift from warming to cooling after approximately 60 yr. The major ship types show significant differences in the short-term radiative forcing. For instance, the direct SO4 forcing from tankers is 30% higher than for container and bulk. The net long-term effects on RF are similar due to similar CO2 forcing. We assess an emission scenario where the reduction inventory is sustained on the fleet as it steadily diminishes over time due to scrapping and disappears in 2040. We find a net temperature increase lasting until approximately 2080. We conclude that changes in non-CO2 emission does matter significantly if reductions of CO2 emissions are made on the year 2010 cargo shipping fleet. In sum, we find that emission changes motivated by CO2 reductions in shipping will be beneficial from a long-term climate perspective, and that there are positive environmental and health effects identified as concentrations of key short-lived pollutants are reduced.

Retrieval of aerosol microphysical and optical properties above liquid clouds from POLDER/PARASOL polarization measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Most of the current aerosol retrievals from passive sensors are restricted to cloud-free scenes, which strongly reduces our ability to monitor the aerosol properties at a global scale and to estimate their radiative forcing. The presence of aerosol above clouds (AAC) affects the polarized light reflected by the cloud layer, as shown by the spaceborne measurements provided by the POlarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) instrument on the PARASOL satellite. In a previous work, a first retrieval method was developed for AAC scenes and evaluated for biomass-burning aerosols transported over stratocumulus clouds. The method was restricted to the use of observations acquired at forward scattering angles (90-120 degrees) where polarized measurements are highly sensitive to fine-mode particle scattering. Non-spherical particles in the coarse mode, such as mineral dust particles, do not much polarize light and cannot be handled with this method. In this paper, we present new developments that allow retrieving also the properties of mineral dust particles above clouds. These particles do not much polarize light but strongly reduce the polarized cloud bow generated by the liquid cloud layer beneath and observed for scattering angles around 140 degrees. The spectral attenuation can be used to qualitatively identify the nature of the particles (i.e. accumulation mode versus coarse mode, i.e. mineral dust particles versus biomass-burning aerosols), whereas the magnitude of the attenuation is related to the optical thickness of the aerosol layer. We also use the polarized measurements acquired in the cloud bow to improve the retrieval of both the biomass-burning aerosol properties and the cloud microphysical properties. We provide accurate polarized radiance calculations for AAC scenes and evaluate the contribution of the POLDER polarization measurements for the simultaneous retrieval of the aerosol and cloud properties. We investigate various scenes with mineral dust particles and biomass-burning aerosols above clouds. For clouds, our results confirm that the droplet size distribution is narrow in high-latitude ocean regions and that the droplet effective radii retrieved from both polarization measurements and from total radiance measurements are generally close for AAC scenes (departures smaller than 2 mu m). We found that the magnitude of the primary cloud bow cannot be accurately estimated with a plane parallel transfer radiative code. The errors for the modeling of the polarized cloud bow are between 4 and 8% for homogenous cloudy scenes, as shown by a 3-D radiative transfer code. These effects only weakly impact the retrieval of the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) performed with a mineral dust particle model for which the microphysical properties are entirely known (relative error smaller than 6 %). We show that the POLDER polarization measurements allow retrieving the AOT, the fine-mode particle size, the Angstrom exponent and the fraction of spherical particles. However, the complex refractive index and the coarse-mode particle size cannot be accurately retrieved with the present polarization measurements. Our complete and accurate algorithm cannot be applied to process large amounts of data, so a simpler algorithm was developed to retrieve the AOT and the Angstrom exponent above clouds in an operational way. Illustrations are provided for July-August 2008 near the African coast. Large mean AOTs above clouds at 0.865 mu m (> 0. 3) are retrieved for oceanic regions near the coasts of South Africa that correspond to biomass-burning aerosols, whereas even larger mean AOTs above clouds for mineral dust particles (> 0.6) are also retrieved near the coasts of Senegal. For these regions and time period, the direct AAC radiative forcing is likely to be significant. The final aim of this work is the global monitoring of the AAC properties and the estimation of the direct aerosol radiative forcing in cloudy scenes.

Elbrus, Caucasus Mountains, Russia on 5 May 2009 to develop a method for dating and "provenancing" of desert dust events recorded in snow pack	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A significant desert dust deposition event occurred on Mt. Elbrus, Caucasus Mountains, Russia on 5 May 2009, where the deposited dust later appeared as a brown layer in the snow pack. An examination of dust transportation history and analysis of chemical and physical properties of the deposited dust were used to develop a new approach for high-resolution "provenancing" of dust deposition events recorded in snow pack using multiple independent techniques. A combination of SEVIRI red-green-blue composite imagery, MODIS atmospheric optical depth fields derived using the Deep Blue algorithm, air mass trajectories derived with HYSPLIT model and analysis of meteorological data enabled identification of dust source regions with high temporal (hours) and spatial (ca. 100 km) resolution. Dust, deposited on 5 May 2009, originated in the foothills of the Djebel Akhdar in eastern Libya where dust sources were activated by the intrusion of cold air from the Mediterranean Sea and Saharan low pressure system and transported to the Caucasus along the eastern Mediterranean coast, Syria and Turkey. Particles with an average diameter below 8 mu m accounted for 90% of the measured particles in the sample with a mean of 3.58 mu m, median 2.48 mu m. The chemical signature of this long-travelled dust was significantly different from the locally-produced dust and close to that of soils collected in a palaeolake in the source region, in concentrations of hematite. Potential addition of dust from a secondary source in northern Mesopotamia introduced uncertainty in the "provenancing" of dust from this event. Nevertheless, the approach adopted here enables other dust horizons in the snowpack to be linked to specific dust transport events recorded in remote sensing and meteorological data archives.

Monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the era of diminishing resources: A case study of the U.S. West Coast	HARMFUL ALGAE												Spatial and temporal decorrelation scales in phytoplankton bloom magnitudes are reviewed with the goal of informing the design of efficient and informative observing networks for monitoring of potentially harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the U.S. West Coast. Our analysis of historic MODIS Fluorescent Line Height data shows that, unlike several previous studies, seasonal timing of phytoplankton blooms off the U.S. West Coast propagates from South to North. In situ data show that temporal decorrelation scales are shortest off Northern California (similar to 4 days) and longest in the Southern California Bight (similar to 17 days). In a cross-shore direction, we find that variability in the near-shore biomass is decoupled from biomass further offshore (similar to 2-4 km). Our review of the cloud cover gap statistics suggests that satellite data provide reasonably inexpensive information about bloom events, particularly at seasonal to inter-annual scales, but is insufficient to capture many event-scale blooms. Absent adequate satellite data, in situ monitoring becomes essential. Existing networks of automated monitoring sites from piers and moorings off the California coast is insufficient to describe regional variability in blooms, but is likely informative of bloom magnitudes in the immediate proximity of observation stations. We suggest that a more effective network will have a combination of shore-based stations and a few (5-10) offshore moorings. Shore-based stations should be located in proximity to sensitive HAB targets. This would provide monitoring of existing conditions and guide decision-making about beach closures and aquaculture management practices. Offshore stations can serve as proxy for regional conditions and can be used to issue early warnings of potential HAB conditions developing in a specific region. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

F.; Ho, Tung-Yuan; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo; Liu, Hongbin			Remote sensing of picophytoplankton distribution in the northern South China Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												By using a global data set (NOMAD), improved algorithms were developed for deducing from ocean color remote sensing data the concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, total chlorophyll alpha (TChl_alpha), zeaxanthin (Zea) and fucoxanthin (Fuco), and the associated primary phytoplankton groups, namely, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, haptophytes and diatoms, in the oceans. A modified classification for the waters of the world's ocean based on the dominant phytoplankton group was then devised. By using a local data set from the northern South China Sea (NSCS), algorithms were also developed for assessing the cell abundances of picophytoplankton, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and pico-eukaryotes, in this region. These algorithms were then applied to the remotely sensed data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer at Aqua sensor (MODIS-Aqua) to study the abundances and the distributional patterns of picophytoplankton in the entire NSCS. The results agreed well with field observations, which were available only from selected locations in the study area. On a basin scale, the results were consistent with expected variations in phytoplankton pigments, phytoplankton community composition, and picophytoplankton biomass, in response to the major known environmental phenomena in the NSCS, such as the progressive increase in biological productivity towards the coast, the runoff from the Pearl River, higher biological productivity in the wintertime, upwelling around the Taiwan Bank, winter upwelling northwest of the Luzon Island, and the transformation and dissipation of internal waves off the Dongsha Atoll. This work represents the first effort in estimating the cell abundances of the principal picophytoplankton groups in the oceans from space. The general application of this approach to the global ocean needs to be further validated and calibrated with a more extensive data base from field observations in other parts of the oceans.

The results indicated that high concentration areas of SSC did not directly surround the Yangtze estuary but concentrated northwards considerably along the coast about 100km. The driving of Taiwan warm current, the southward drift of SSC along the coast and also the river discharges should be the mixed reasons for this northward concentration of SSC. The coastal current also drove the SSC along the coast to the high concentration area of SSC. The first EOF pattern, demonstrated by EOF analysis, explains the dominant distribution pattern of SSC in the study area. This controlling pattern should be caused by the joint effects of northeast wind, the coastal current and Taiwan warm current. The SSC dispersed and extended with a wide range from 122 degrees E to 126 degrees E (about 400km), and from 30 degrees N to 34 degrees N (about 440km). SSC in spring of 2010 and 2011 was obviously higher than that in the previous three years. It suggested that the suspended sediment and associate contaminant, discharged from the Yangtze River, was increasing in recent two years. Stronger northeast wind has significant and negative influence on the SSC.																			978-0-7695-4923-1; 978-1-4673-4893-5				2013							607	611		10.1109/ISDEA.2012.147								WOS:000319283600140

The study is focused in coastal watersheds in the Mississippi Gulf Coast, although one of the test cases focuses in an inland watershed located in northeastern Mississippi, USA. The decision support tools (DSTs) into which the NASA datasets were assimilated were the Soil Water & Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF). These DSTs are endorsed by several US government agencies (EPA, FEMA, USGS) for water resources management strategies. These models use physiographic and meteorological data extensively. Precipitation gages and USGS gage stations in the region were used to calibrate several HSPF and SWAT model applications. Land use and topographical datasets were swapped to assess model output sensitivities. NASA-LIS meteorological data were introduced in the calibrated model applications for simulation of watershed hydrology for a time period in which no weather data were available (1997-2006). The performance of the NASA datasets in the context of hydrological modeling was assessed through comparison of measured and model-simulated hydrographs. Overall, NASA datasets were as useful as standard land use, topographical, and meteorological datasets. Moreover, NASA datasets were used for performing analyses that the standard datasets could not made possible, e.g., introduction of land use dynamics into hydrological simulations.																			978-1-4666-1925-8; 978-1-4666-1924-1				2013							1	19		10.4018/978-1-4666-1924-1.ch001	10.4018/978-1-4666-1924-1							WOS:000419560400002

Satellite-based detection and monitoring of phytoplankton blooms along the Oregon coast	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We have applied a normalized difference algorithm to 8 day composite chlorophyll-a (CHL) and fluorescence line height (FLH) imagery obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua spacecraft in order to detect and monitor phytoplankton blooms in the Oregon coastal region. The resulting bloom products, termed CHLrel and FLHrel, respectively, describe the onset and advection of algal blooms as a function of the percent relative change observed in standard 8 day CHL or FLH imagery over time. Bloom product performance was optimized to consider local time scales of biological variability (days) and cloud cover. Comparison of CHLrel and FLHrel retrievals to in situ mooring data collected off the central Oregon coast from summer 2009 through winter 2010 shows that the products are a robust means to detect bloom events during the summer upwelling season. Evaluation of winter performance was inconclusive due to persistent cloud cover and limited in situ chl-a records. Pairing the products with coincident in situ physical proxies provides a tool to elucidate the conditions that induce bloom onset and identify the physical mechanisms that affect bloom advection, persistence, and decay. These products offer an excellent foundation for remote bloom detection and monitoring in this region, and the methods developed herein are applicable to any region with sufficient CHL and FLH coverage.

Vertical distribution and column optical properties of aerosol plume are derived from a combination of multi-wavelength lidar and sunphotometer measurement. Aloft smoke plumes from two cases are investigated in this paper from U.S. western and south-western forest fires. The smoke source and transport pathway to the U.S. east coast are analyzed by MODIS and CALIOP imageries as well as HYSPLIT backward trajectory analysis. In both cases, the plumes have relatively high optical depth (as much as 12 at 500-nm) and Angstrom exponent of up to 1.8, but show different intrusion heights, source regions and transport process. Lidar profiling observations indicate these smoke plumes mixing downward into the planetary-boundary-layer which are coincident with increasing trends of surface PM2.5 (particulate matter, diameter < 2.5 mu m) concentrations.

Regional differences of column aerosol parameters in western Iberian Peninsula	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This study presents a characterization of aerosols columnar properties measured at three different AERONET sites in the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, namely Evora and Cabo da Roca, in Portugal, and Caceres, in Spain, during the period from 2005 to 2010. AERONET level 2.0 products have been analyzed. The comparison of these three stations has great interest because it has not been conducted yet and it allows to characterize the aerosols of a wide region in western Iberian Peninsula by a long-term analysis of their aerosol properties. In addition, it allows analyzing the possible differences in these properties between the three sites located at different distances from the coast. The results show differences between the aerosol optical depth at 440 and 1020 nm at the three stations, being the mean values in Cabo da Roca at 1020 and 440 nm (0.08 and 0.16) slightly higher than in the other two stations (Evora: 0.06 and 0.15; Caceres: 0.05 and 0.14). Greater differences among the three stations are found for the Angstrom exponent values. Thus, Caceres shows the highest mean value (133), followed by Evora (1.14) and, finally, by Cabo da Roca (1.00) which exhibits the smallest median alpha values due to the presence of coarse sea salt particles and high atmospheric humidity. These values are consistent with the values of volume size distribution, exhibiting a greater value of large particles at Cabo da Roca. The mean values of the single scattering albedo (omega) have been also analyzed, obtaining higher results as the coast is approached: Cabo da Roca: omega (440) = 0.95; omega (1020) = 0.96, Evora: omega (940) = 0.93; omega (1020) = 0.95 and Caceres: omega (440) = 0.88; omega (1020) = 0.83. The differences between the three stations are explained in terms of the distance to the coast and to the occasional arrival of diverse air masses transporting different aerosol types to each station. One classification method proposed for the study region has been applied to multi-year measurements performed at the three sites and verified by means of daily 120-h back-trajectory analyses of air masses. The most frequent situations observed at all sites include the clean, maritime and continental situations, which account for about 80% or more. The remaining percentage is accounted by the more episodic situations of desert dust (10-14%) and forest fires emissions (3-5%). The probability density plots calculated for the different classified aerosol situations show significant differences consistent with the different paths of the air masses corresponding to each aerosol situation.

The apportionment of DOC by age into millennial and decadal pools is necessary to understand the temporal connection between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. We measured Delta C-14-DOC and chemical composition indices (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)), fluorescence index (FI), hydrophobic organic acid fraction (HPOA) content) for 15 large river basins in the conterminous United States. Across all rivers the average proportion of HPOA in DOC correlated strongly with SUVA(254) (r(2) = 0.93 p < 0.001). Individual Delta C-14-DOC ranged from a low of -92.9% (726 y.b.p.) in the Colorado River to 73.4% (>Modern) in the Altamaha River for the year 2009. When adjusted by total discharge, these U.S. Rivers export modern carbon at between 34 and 46%, a signal dominated by the Mississippi River. The variation in Delta C-14 correlates to indices of the aromaticity of the DOC measured by the SUVA(254) (r(2) = 0.87, p < 0.001), and FI (r(2) = 0.6; p < 0.001) as well as differences in annual river discharge (r(2) = 0.46, p < 0.006). SUVA(254) was further correlated to broad scale vegetation phenology estimated from the Enhanced Vegetation Index derived from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). We show that basins with high discharge, high proportions of vegetation cover, and low human population densities export DOC enriched in aromatic material that corresponds to recently fixed atmospheric CO2. Conversely old DOC is exported from low discharge watersheds draining arid regions, and watersheds more strongly impacted by humans. The potential influence from fossil carbon from human inputs to aquatic systems may be important and requires more research.																	0886-6236	1944-9224				NOV 29	2012	26								GB4014	10.1029/2012GB004361								WOS:000311842100001

The correlations between the different cloud properties are built from 2 years of collocated A-train observations (CALIPSO-GOCCP and MODIS) at a scale close to cloud processes; it results in a characterization of the physical processes in tropical clouds, that can be used to better understand cloud behaviors, and constitute a powerful tool to develop and evaluate cloud parameterizations in climate models. First, we examine a case study of shallow cumulus cloud observed simultaneously by the two sensors (CALIPSO, MODIS), and develop a methodology that allows to build global scale statistics by keeping the separation between clear and cloudy areas at the pixel level (250, 330 m). Then we build statistical instantaneous relationships between the cloud cover, the cloud vertical distribution and the cloud reflectance. The vertical cloud distribution indicates that the optically thin clouds (optical thickness < 1.5) dominate the boundary layer over the trade wind regions. Optically thick clouds (optical thickness > 3.4) are composed of high and mid-level clouds associated with deep convection along the ITCZ and SPCZ and over the warm pool, and by stratocumulus low level clouds located along the East coast of tropical oceans. The cloud properties are analyzed as a function of the large scale circulation regime. Optically thick high clouds are dominant in convective regions (CF > 80 %), while low level clouds with low optical thickness (< 3.5) are present in regimes of subsidence but in convective regimes as well, associated principally to low cloud fractions (CF < 50 %). A focus on low-level clouds allows us to quantify how the cloud optical depth increases with cloud top altitude and with cloud fraction.

J	Su, H; Wang, YP				Su, Hua; Wang, Yunpeng			Using MODIS data to estimate sea ice thickness in the Bohai Sea (China) in the 2009-2010 winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												To estimate sea ice thickness over a large spatial scale is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a direct approach to effectively estimate sea ice thickness over a large spatial area of the Bohai Sea using EOS MODIS data. It is based on the model of an exponential relation between albedo and thickness of sea ice. Eighteen images of EOS MODIS L1B data in the 2009-2010 winter were used to estimate the sea ice thickness and to monitor its spatiotemporal evolution in the Bohai Sea. The estimated thickness results are in accordance with results based on the Lebedev and Zubov empirical models as well as the forecasting data from the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Centre of China. Model correlation coefficients (R-2 = 0.864 and 0.858) and close similarity in thickness prediction attest to the reliability and applicability of the proposed method. The average ice thickness of the whole Bohai Sea ranged from 3 to 21 cm, with an estimated maximum about 40 cm in Liaodong Bay. Multiple-temporal maps of sea-ice thickness show that the sea ice formed initially along the coastline, and gradually expanded away from the shore. Sea ice first appeared in the Liaodong Bay, and hugged the coast southwards to Bohai and Laizhou Bay. During melting the inverse sequence occurred. Our results also show that sea ice coverage and thickness are significantly correlated with the value of theta, the difference between cumulative FDD (Freezing Degree Days) and TDD (Thawing Degree Days).

Kirk; O'Neill, Larry			GOES-10 microphysical retrievals in marine warm clouds: Multi-instrument validation and daytime cycle over the southeast Pacific	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The daytime evolution of warm cloud microphysical properties over the southeast Pacific during October-November 2008 is investigated with optical/infrared retrievals from the Tenth Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-10) imager. GOES-10 retrievals, produced at NASA Langley Research Center, are validated against in situ aircraft observations and with independent satellite observations. Comparisons with in situ observations reveal high linear correlations (r) for cloud effective radius (r(e)) and optical thickness (tau) (r = 0.89 and 0.69 respectively); nevertheless, a GOES-10 positive mean r(e) bias of 2.3 mu m is apparent, and consistent with other previously reported satellite biases. Smaller biases are found for liquid water path (LWP) and an adiabatic-based cloud droplet number concentration (N-d), both variables derived by combining r(e) and tau. In addition, GOES-10 observations are well correlated with their Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) counterparts, but with smaller biases and root-mean-square errors for the Aqua satellite passes, arguably associated with a better calibrated MODIS-Aqua instrument relative to MODIS-Terra. Furthermore, the excellent agreement between GOES-10 LWP and microwave-based satellite retrievals, especially at high solar zenith angles (>60 degrees), provide further evidence of the utility of using GOES-10 retrievals to represent the daytime cloud cycle. In terms of the daytime cycle, GOES-10 observations show an afternoon minimum in LWP and an increase thereafter, consistent with satellite microwave climatologies. The tau cycle explains most of the LWP variance with both variables in phase, minima near noon along the coast, and a 13:30-14:00 local solar time (LST) minimum offshore. In contrast, r(e) is not exactly in phase with LWP and tau, having a minimum approximately at 12: 30 LST throughout the domain. A unique feature is a striking r(e) maximum along the coast at 16: 15 LST, concomitant with a faster tau recovery. An explanation for a coastal r(e) afternoon maximum is lacking although this is consistent with an enhancement of the updraft velocity reported in previous modeling studies. Finally, the GOES-derived Nd (N-d (proportional to) tau(1/2) r(e) (5/2)) shows a complex daytime cycle with maxima at 7: 15 and 13: 15 LST. While the first maximum is driven by large tau, the second one is mainly explained by a minimum in r(e).

Relationships between declining summer sea ice, increasing temperatures and changing vegetation in the Siberian Arctic tundra from MODIS time series (2000-11)	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The concern about Arctic greening has grown recently as the phenomenon is thought to have significant influence on global climate via atmospheric carbon emissions. Earlier work on Arctic vegetation highlighted the role of summer sea ice decline in the enhanced warming and greening phenomena observed in the region, but did not contain enough details for spatially characterizing the interactions between sea ice, temperature and vegetation photosynthetic absorption. By using 1 km resolution data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) as a primary data source, this study presents detailed maps of vegetation and temperature trends for the Siberian Arctic region, using the time integrated normalized difference vegetation index (TI-NDVI) and summer warmth index (SWI) calculated for the period 2000-11 to represent vegetation greenness and temperature respectively. Spatio-temporal relationships between the two indices and summer sea ice conditions were investigated with transects at eight locations using sea ice concentration data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). In addition, the derived vegetation and temperature trends were compared among major Arctic vegetation types and bioclimate subzones. The fine resolution trend map produced confirms the overall greening (+1% yr(-1)) and warming (+0.27% yr(-1)) of the region, reported in previous studies, but also reveals browning areas. The causes of such local decreases in vegetation, while surrounding areas are experiencing the opposite reaction to changing conditions, are still unclear. Overall correlations between sea ice concentration and SWI as well as TI-NDVI decreased in strength with increasing distance from the coast, with a particularly pronounced pattern in the case of SWI. SWI appears to be driving TI-NDVI in many cases, but not systematically, highlighting the presence of limiting factors other than temperature for plant growth in the region. Further unravelling those limiting factors constitutes a priority in future research. This study demonstrates the use of medium resolution remotely sensed data for studying the complexity of spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics in the Arctic.

Here, we investigated temporal variation in turbidity along a coastal region. To estimate suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), water samples and radiometric data were collected from waters in the Mokpo coastal area, located along the west coast of Korea. GOCI images acquired on the same day as the samples were used to generate a map of turbidity and to estimate the differences in SSC displayed in each image. Hourly GOCI images successfully identified the temporal variation in turbidity, which is mainly driven by the tidal cycle. A hydrodynamic model also showed that the GOCI-derived turbidity variation was reliable. This study shows that the GOCI can be effectively used to monitor the temporal dynamics of the turbidity of coastal waters, i.e., sediment movements driven by the tidal cycle along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula.																	0148-0227					SEP 1	2012	117								C09004	10.1029/2012JC008046								WOS:000308321900004						
J	Saldias, GS; Sobarzo, M; Largier, J; Moffat, C; Letelier, R				Saldias, Gonzalo S.; Sobarzo, Marcus; Largier, John; Moffat, Carlos; Letelier, Ricardo			Seasonal variability of turbid river plumes off central Chile based on high-resolution MODIS imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We have studied the seasonal variability of four turbid river plumes along the central Chilean coast using daily, high-resolution images of surface turbidity from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) in combination with measurements of wind, river flow, and hydrographic data. Atmospherically corrected MODIS data reveal strong seasonal variability in the areal extent of plume water, as well as in turbidity levels, which are significantly correlated with seasonality in river discharge. A seasonal climatology of turbid plume patterns shows individual plumes merging into an extensive body of turbid waters attached to the coast during fall (April-June)-winter (July-September) (occurs about 10% of days in fall-winter). During spring (October-December) and summer (January-March), the individual plumes remain distinct and occupy a smaller area close to the coast, when observed (evident on less than 30% of days in spring-summer). In spring-summer most plumes are detected for the northern rivers (Mataquito and Maule). When the plumes merge into a coastal band in fall-winter, a turbid area of more than 1000 km(2) is observed in the study area between 34.85 degrees S and 37.15 degrees S. This occurs following peaks in river discharge combined with the effect of strong southward (downwelling-favorable) winds. An analysis of key non-dimensional numbers shows that buoyancy dominates plume dynamics during summer, whereas inertial forcing associated with river outflow is more important in winter near the coast. Farther offshore (>10 km), the effects of rotation and wind tend to dominate the plume dynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Mesoscale frontal structures in the Canary Upwelling System: New front and filament detection algorithms applied to spatial and temporal patterns	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An improved automatic detection of mesoscale frontal activity is proposed, based on the edge detection algorithm initially presented by Cayula and Cornillon (1992). The performance and the sensitivity of their original method have been extensively tested on a very large MODIS SST data set at 1 km resolution, over the Canary Upwelling System, and compared to the results of a classic gradient based method. Its evaluation, including the companion method using a contour-following algorithm, shows that a significant part of the fronts was not detected by the earlier method despite an overall robustness. We propose here an improved implementation of the single image edge detection algorithm, from the best combination of multiple detections based on sliding windows (referred to as CMW). The results show a very significant increase of the overall performance: using a time series of 6 years (1,988 images), we observed an average increase of 140% in the edge detection and 30% improvement in the average length of the segments. Additionally, the sensitivity to the size of the detection window is lower, and the necessity of using the "following algorithm" is greatly reduced. We applied the CMW improvements to the Canary Current System, and showed frontal activity developed along the whole coast, with more intense fronts between Cape Ghir (30 degrees 30' N) and Cape Beddouza (32 degrees 30' N), and between Cape Juby (28 degrees N) and Cape Bojador (26 degrees 30' N). The highest filament activity was associated with Cape Bojador followed by Cape Ghir and Cape Blanco (21 degrees N). Considering the seasonality, two main areas were identified, north and south of Cape Juby, with marked seasonality in the fronts and filaments. No major interannual differences in frontal activity were observed in 2002-2007, except less seasonality during 2007. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Dufois, F; Rouault, M				Dufois, Francois; Rouault, Mathieu			Sea surface temperature in False Bay (South Africa): Towards a better understanding of its seasonal and inter-annual variability	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Two sea surface temperature (SST) products, Pathfinder version 5.0 and MODIS/TERRA are evaluated and used to study the seasonal and the inter-annual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) together with local SST and wind data in the vicinity of False Bay (Western Cape, South Africa). At the monthly scale, differences of up to 3 degrees C are detected between the two products in the bay. In the northern half of the bay, SST is fairly well explained by seasonality. In contrast, the southern half exhibits a higher inter-annual variability in SST. The southern half of the bay and the Western Cape upwelling system (Cape Agulhas to Cape Columbine) share most of their variance. Furthermore, the inter-annual variability of SST in False Bay is correlated with both the Nino 3.4 index and local wind speed anomalies. El Nino (La Nina) events induce an equatorward (poleward) shift in the South Atlantic High pressure system leading to a weakening (strengthening) of upwelling favourable south-easterly. Those changes induce a warm (cold) SST anomaly along the West Coast of Southern Africa. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chang, JF; Huang, WG; Lou, XL; Shi, AQ				Chang, Junfang; Huang, Weigen; Lou, Xiulin; Shi, Aiqin			Upwelling region wind speed correction method for wind retrieval from synthetic aperture radar imagery in the East China Sea	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												The satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been proven to be a valuable tool for high resolution ocean surface wind measurements. However, oceanic surface phenomena observed by SAR and oceanic processes which can cause the change of backscatter in SAR imagery will influence the SAR wind retrieval. Upwelling is one of the main factors, and it is prevalent in the East China Sea. It smooths the sea surface which results in a lower backscatter cross section in SAR imagery. In this study, using sea surface temperature and chlorophyll2-a data derived from Earth Observing System (EOS) MODIS, the low backscatter features in ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) imagery are analyzed. A CMOD4 algorithm is adopted to retrieve the sea surface wind speed from SAR imagery. Results show that the wind speed is negatively biased due to the low normalized radar cross section associated with the upwelling. In order to resolve the impact of coastal upwelling on SAR wind retrieval, combined with high resolution numerical meteorological model wind field data, a wind speed correction method is proposed by using linear robust regression. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, underestimated wind speeds retrieved from ENVISAT ASAR images in the upwelling areas of Zhejiang coast and the sea area near northeast of Taiwan are corrected. Results show that the accuracy of upwelling region SAR wind retrieval data has been improved. (c) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Impact assessment of the Japanese tsunami on ocean-surface chlorophyll concentration using MODIS-Aqua data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua-retrieved chlorophyll concentration data sets have been analyzed and interpreted, as have changes in chlorophyll concentrations associated with the tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011, in Sendai, Tohoku (latitude 38.3 degrees N, longitude 142.4 degrees E). The eight-day and three-day composite data sets were archived from the NASA MODIS website to generate chlorophyll images during March 2011, before, during, and after the tsunami. The chlorophyll concentration variability was studied with reference to satellite images, a transect line, eight points, and mean plots over two subsets in the coastal and offshore water. An increase in chlorophyll concentration of up to 5.0 mg/m(3) along the transect line and in the range of 1.0-4.3 mg/m(3) in the coastal water points and subset (1(0) x 1(0)) was observed. The chlorophyll mean ranged from 0.289 to 1.237 mg/m(3) and 0.123 to 0.271 mg/m(3) for subsets 1 and 2, respectively. The offshore water subset was about 300 km from the tsunami site, and the chlorophyll range has not shown more gradients in post-tsunami images, as was evident from subset-2 mean data. Data from March 2010 and 2009 was processed for the same locations to comply with any seasonal trend. But the recent 2011 tsunami had a sudden episodic impact on the coastal water of Japan, enhancing chlorophyll concentration without being tallied with seasonal trends. So, the episodic effect seemed to be significant instead of being a seasonal trend. As observed from field photographs and previous tsunami events, water receded from the land, along with a tsunami return wave that probably carried nutrients and minerals, and even upwelling would have enriched the phytoplankton growth and sudden chlorophyll concentration increase in the post-tsunami period found convincing in satellite images. The anomaly of chlorophyll observed was significant, with p < 0.02 during 2011. The interannual study does not support the drastic change than the non-tsunami years and significance is not seen with p-values observed from t-testing. So the catastrophic and episodic event has had an impact on the ecosystem of Japanese water, enhancing the ocean's chlorophyll biomass, and hence, productivity. This is the first attempt to study the chlorophyll variability of the effects of a tsunami on the Japanese coast. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J	Han, H; Lee, H				Han, Hyangsun; Lee, Hoonyol			Inter-satellite atmospheric and radiometric correction for the retrieval of Landsat sea surface temperature by using Terra MODIS data	GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL												Thermal infrared images of Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ sensors have been unrivalled sources of high resolution thermal remote sensing (120 m for TM and 60 m for ETM+) for more than two decades. As the sensors have only one thermal channel, however, the correction of atmospheric effect has been virtually limited, degrading the accuracy of sea surface temperature (SST) measurement. Launched in 1999, MODIS sensor onboard Terra satellite is equipped with two thermal channels that can provide accurate atmospheric correction at 1 km resolution. In this paper we propose an inter-satellite calibration method to correct the radiometric and atmospheric effect of Landsat brightness temperature by using the atmospherically corrected Terra MODIS SST which lags Landsat pass by 30 minutes only. Comparison of the corrected Landsat SST with in situ SST near the coast of South Korea showed a significant improvement in root mean square error from 2.31 degrees C before the correction to 0.96 degrees C after the correction. Errors from spatial and temporal inhomogeneities over 1 km X 1 km window could be masked out by identifying negative correction term and applying a root mean square deviation criterion between Landsat and MODIS SSTs. We expect that Landsat SST product obtained after the launch of Terra can be atmospherically corrected by using the method proposed in this paper while maintaining the merit of high-resolution Landsat thermal infrared imagery.

Effects of Additional Particles on Already Polluted Marine Stratus	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The response of already polluted marine stratocumulus to additional particles was examined by studying the clouds where two ship tracks cross. Nearly 100 such crossings were collected and analyzed using Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral imagery for the daytime passes off the western coast of the United States during the summer months of 4 years. To reduce biases in the retrieved cloud properties caused by the subpixel spatial structure of the clouds, results are presented only for ship tracks found in regions overcast by extensive layers of marine stratus. When two ship tracks cross, one of the tracks exhibits much larger changes in droplet radii when compared with the surrounding unpolluted clouds and is referred to as the dominant ship track. The clouds at the crossing typically exhibit properties that are closer to those of the dominant than to those of the subordinate ship track. To determine whether the additional particles at the crossing affect the dominant track, local gradients in the retrieved cloud properties near the crossing were determined for both ship tracks. Based on the gradients, the clouds at the junction were found to have significantly smaller droplet radii and significantly larger column droplet number concentrations than were predicted based on their values in both ship tracks on either side of the crossing. Comparing the effects of particle loading at the crossings and elsewhere along the ship tracks revealed that the effects decreased as the column droplet number concentration of the clouds being affected increased.																	0022-4928					JUN	2012	69	6					1975	1993		10.1175/JAS-D-11-0291.1								WOS:000304736500014

Wildfire and the atmosphere: Modelling the chemical and dynamic interactions at the regional scale	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Forest fires release significant amounts of trace gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. Depending on meteorological conditions, fire emissions can efficiently reduce air quality and visibility, even far away from emission sources. In 2005, an arson forest fire burned nearly 700 ha near Lancon-de-Provence, southeast France. This paper explores the impact of this Mediterranean fire on the atmospheric dynamics and chemistry downwind of the burning region. The fire smoke plume was observed by the MODIS-AQUA instrument several kilometres downwind of the burning area out of the Mediterranean coast. Signatures of the fire plume on air pollutants were measured at surface stations in southeastern France by the air quality network AtmoPACA. Ground-based measurements revealed unusually high concentrations of aerosols and a well marked depletion of ozone concentrations on the day of the fire. The Lancon-de-Provence fire propagation was successfully simulated by the semi-physical fire spread model ForeFire. ForeFire provided the burnt area at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The burnt areas were scaled to compute the fire heat and water vapour fluxes in the three-dimensional meso-scale non-hydrostatic meteorological model MesoNH. The simulated fire plume kept confined in the boundary layer with high values of turbulent kinetic energy. The plume was adverted several kilometres downwind of the ignition area by the Mistral winds in accordance with the MODIS and AtmoPACA observations. The vertical plume development was found to be more sensitive to the sensible heat flux than to the fire released moisture. The burnt area information is also used to compute emissions of a fire aerosol-like tracer and gaseous pollutants, using emission factors for Mediterranean vegetation. The coupled model simulated high concentrations of the fire aerosol-like tracer downwind of the burning zone at the right timing compared to ground-based measurements. A chemical reaction mechanism was coupled online to the MesoNH model to account for gaseous chemistry evolution in the fire plume. High levels of ozone precursors (NO, CO) were simulated in the smoke plume which led to the depletion of ozone levels above and downwind of the burning zone. This depletion of ozone was indeed observed at ground-based stations but with a higher impact than simulated. The difference may be explained by the simplified design of the model with no anthropogenic sources and no interaction of the smoke aerosols with the photolysis rates. Ozone production was modelled tens of kilometres downwind of the ignition zone out of the coast. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ciappa, A; Pietranera, L; Budillon, G				Ciappa, Achille; Pietranera, Luca; Budillon, Giorgio			Observations of the Terra Nova Bay (Antarctica) polynya by MODIS ice surface temperature imagery from 2005 to 2010	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Ice surface temperature (IST) imagery from the thermal infrared bands of the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been used to analyze the activity of the Terra Nova Bay polynya from 2005 to 2010. In clear sky conditions, the shape of the open water area of the polynya (i.e. the portion of the ocean free of sea-ice) is revealed by the skin sea-ice temperatures close to the water freezing point provided by the MODIS-derived IST product. The swaths of the MODIS sensors onboard Terra and Aqua satellites over the Terra Nova Bay consist of about 5500 scenes per year, useful to estimate the cloud cover too. The open water area was extracted from clear sky scenes and from scenes affected by fog but providing continuity of the shape of the polynya. Using about 40% of the available swaths, the polynya was detected for more than 80% of the sea-ice period with a revisit time below 24 h and for more than 50% with a revisit time below 3 h. The open water area was extracted using thresholds of IST based on the IST values detected within the open water area and within the band of sea-ice surrounding the polynya, obtained scene by scene. An ice free area larger than 100 km(2) was observed near the Nansen Ice Shelf for more than 70% of time (larger than 500 km2 for 50% of time). The mean annual open water area, around 900 km(2), was close to the lower limit of the reported range except during 2006, around 600 km(2), due to the limited activity in the second half of the cold season. The largest extents, between 6000 and 8500 km(2), occurred in different periods of the Antarctic winter and exceeded maxima estimated in previous studies by thermal infrared data. Polynya openings developed from a few hours to several days, in the latter case sustained by subsequent katabatic events visible in the IST sequence. Peaks of growing rate above 300 km(2)/h were observed during intense katabatic events with gusts of 50 m/s. The fluctuations of the open water area resulted well correlated with wind records available from local Automatic Weather Stations within the main katabatic routes, and followed katabatic events at intervals between 0 and 6 h. The analysis of the IST data set derived from the thermal infrared bands of MODIS provides new polynya observations of high horizontal resolution (1 km) and frequent revisit time during the winter season, complementing previously available observations with passive microwave imagery.

J	Painemal, D; Minnis, P				Painemal, David; Minnis, Patrick			On the dependence of albedo on cloud microphysics over marine stratocumulus clouds regimes determined from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The dependence of the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) albedo A on cloud microphysical properties was investigated for the three largest maritime stratocumulus clouds regimes: off California, Southeast Pacific (Chile-Peru), and southwest Africa (Namibia-Angola). Absolute S and relative S-R albedo susceptibilities to perturbations in cloud droplet number concentrations N-d, defined as dA/dN(d) and dA/dln(N-d) respectively, were calculated for the season having maximum cloud cover during the period 2006-2010. Satellite-based susceptibilities were computed by combining an adiabatically based N-d estimate and liquid water path (LWP) derived from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals matched with TOA A from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System. Empirical susceptibility maps were calculated for three constant LWP intervals at 25, 50, and 90 g(-2). It was found that S increases with LWP, with small and spatially homogeneous values for low LWP, and a contrasting increase far offshore for larger LWP values. An overall increase of S-R with LWP was also observed, with larger values near the coast for LWP = 25 and 50 g(-2). A relatively homogeneous spatial pattern of maximum SR values covered most of each regime's domain for a LWP of 90 g(-2). These results highlight the importance of LWP in modulating the albedo susceptibility. The dependencies of S and S-R on LWP are mostly explained by variations in the mean Nd and cloud optical thickness (tau), with an increase of S with LWP linked to a decrease in Nd, whereas S-R increased with t and A, until reaching a maximum for A and t near 0.36-0.4 and 12-14 respectively, and decreasing thereafter, consistent with expectations based on two-stream estimates. Larger S-R values in the Southeast Pacific are thought to be the consequence of a drier and more pristine atmosphere. Radiative transfer simulations with realistic values of above-cloud water vapor path and aerosol optical thickness showed that differing atmospheric compositions could explain why the Chile-Peru regime was the marine stratocumulus cloud deck most susceptible to change its TOA albedo due to fractional changes in N-d.

Multi-site characterization of tropical aerosols: Implications for regional radiative forcing	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												A land campaign, as a part of the Indian Space Research Organization-Geosphere Biosphere Program (ISRO-GBP), has been organized using a suit of instruments like AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) Sun/Sky sunphotometer, Microtops-II (MICROprocessor-controlled Total Ozone Portable Spectrometer), short-wave pyranometer from December 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007, over five locations (Ahmedabad, Pune, Sinhgad, Trivandrum and Gadanki) representing different environments. The dominance of different aerosol types such as biomass burning, urban/industrial pollution, marine origin and desert-dust particles is expected at these five sites. In all locations, significant day-to-day variability in AOD and Angstrom exponent is observed. The Angstrom exponent exhibits its lowest values over semi-arid region (Ahmedabad) 0.4-0.7, while it is around 1.8 at rural site (Gadanki). The retrieved volume size distributions for Pune, Ahmedabad and Trivandrum are found to be bimodal with varying concentration of each mode. Interesting feature of this observation is, very low coarse-mode volume concentration observed at Trivandrum even though observations were made about 300 m from the coast. The synergy of results from these complementary measurements is reflected in the computed regional aerosol radiative forcing and heating rates. We have used a radiative transfer model (SBDART) to examine the variations of aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) and heating rates to give an overall estimation of the effect on climate. The ADRE, over different measurement sites, at short wavelength is found to be negative at the surface in the range of -18 to -59W m(-2), and TOA forcing values varied from +0.9 to -8W m(-2).

J	Min, JE; Ryu, JH; Lee, S; Son, S				Min, Jee-Eun; Ryu, Joo-Hyung; Lee, Seok; Son, SeungHyun			Monitoring of suspended sediment variation using Landsat and MODIS in the Saemangeum coastal area of Korea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Suspended sediment concentration (SS) is an important indicator of marine environmental changes due to natural causes such as tides, tidal currents, and river discharges, as well as human activities such as construction in coastal regions. In the Saemangeum area on the west coast of Korea, construction of a huge tidal dyke for land reclamation has strongly influenced the coastal environment. This study used remotely sensed data to analyze the SS changes in coastal waters caused by the dyke construction. Landsat and MODIS satellite images were used for the spatial analysis of finer patterns and for the detailed temporal analysis, respectively. Forty Landsat scenes and 105 monthly composite MODIS images observed during 1985-2010 were employed, and four field campaigns (from 2005 to 2006) were performed to verify the image-derived SS. The results of the satellite data analyses showed that the seawater was clear before the dyke construction, with SS values lower than 20 g/m(3). These values increased continuously as the dyke construction progressed. The maximum SS values appeared just before completion of the fourth dyke. Values decreased to below 5 g/m(3) after dyke construction. These changes indicated tidal current modification. Some eddies and plumes were observed in the images generated from Landsat data. Landsat and MODIS can reveal that coastal water turbidity was greatly reduced after completion of the construction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

East Antarctic Landfast Sea Ice Distribution and Variability, 2000-08	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study presents the first continuous, high spatiotemporal resolution time series of landfast sea ice extent along the East Antarctic coast for the period March 2000-December 2008. The time series was derived from consecutive 20-day cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) composite images. Fast ice extent across the East Antarctic coast shows a statistically significant (1.43% +/- 0.30% yr(-1)) increase. Regionally, there is a strong increase in the Indian Ocean sector (20 degrees-90 degrees E, 4.07% +/- 0.42% yr(-1)), and a nonsignificant decrease in the western Pacific Ocean sector (90 degrees-160 degrees E, -0.40% +/- 0.37% yr(-1)). An apparent shift from a negative to a positive extent trend is observed in the Indian Ocean sector from 2004. This shift also coincides with a greater amount of interannual variability. No such shift in apparent trend is observed in the western Pacific Ocean sector, where fast ice extent is typically higher and variability lower than the Indian Ocean sector. The limit to the maximum fast ice areal extent imposed by the location of grounded icebergs modulates the shape of the mean annual fast ice extent cycle to give a broad maximum and an abrupt, relatively transient minimum. Ten distinct fast ice regimes are identified, related to variations in bathymetry and coastal configuration. Fast ice is observed to form in bays, on the windward side of large grounded icebergs, between groups of smaller grounded icebergs, between promontories, and upwind of coastal features (e. g., glacier tongues).

Field Study of the 2008-2009 Red Tide in the Northern Strait of Hormuz	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION												The catastrophic event of red tide has happened in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman from late summer 2008 to spring 2009. With its devastating effects, the phenomenon shocked all the countries located in the margin of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and caused considerable losses to fishery industries, tourism, and tourist and trade economy of the region. In the maritime cruise carried out by the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman Ecological Research Institute, field data, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and algal density were obtained for this research. Satellite information was received from MODIS sensor. Temperature and surface chlorophyll images were obtained and compared with the field data. The results obtained from the present research indicated that with the occurrence of harmful algal blooms (HAB), the Chlorophyll-a and the dissolved oxygen contents increased in the surface water. Maximum algal density was seen in the northern coasts of the Strait of Hormuz. Less concentration of algal density was detected in deep and surface offshore water. Temperature and chlorophyll satellite images were proportionate to the measured values obtained by the field method. This indicates that satellite measurements have acceptable precisions and they can be used in sea monitoring. S. Hamzehei, A. A. Bidokhti, M. S. Mortazavi, A. Gheiby, M. Ebrahimi, F. Saraji.

It was found that when winds are predominantly SW, S or W, a wake eddy of varying size (up to 25 km in diameter) forms off Cape Taran and can cover the area between the shoreline and the 65 m isobath. Its longest lifetime, observed using MODIS images, was 6 days. Another location where coastal sub-mesoscale eddies (up to 10-15 km in diameter) of varying form regularly appear is the coastal slope near the southern and central part of the Curonian Spit.

Comparison of MODIS cloud microphysical properties with in-situ measurements over the Southeast Pacific	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Utilizing the unique characteristics of the cloud over the Southeast Pacific (SEP) off the coast of Chile during the VOCALS field campaign, we compared satellite remote sensing of cloud microphysical properties against in-situ data from multi-aircraft observations, and studied the extent to which these retrieved properties are sufficiently constrained and consistent to reliably quantify the influence of aerosol loading on cloud droplet sizes. After constraining the spatial-temporal coincidence between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements, we selected 17 non-drizzle comparison pairs. For these cases the mean aircraft profiling times were within one hour of Terra overpasses at both projected and un-projected (actual) aircraft positions for two different averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km. Retrieved quantities that were averaged over a larger domain of 25 km compared better statistically with in-situ observations than averages over a smaller domain of 5 km. Comparison at projected aircraft positions was slightly better than un-projected aircraft positions for some parameters. Overall, both MODIS-retrieved effective radius and LWP were larger but highly correlated with the in-situ measured effective radius and LWP, e. g., for averaging domains of 5 km, the biases are up to 1.75 mu m and 0.02 mm whilst the correlation coefficients are about 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. The observed effective radius difference between the two decreased with increasing cloud drop number concentration (CDNC), and increased with increasing cloud geometrical thickness. Compared to the absolute effective radius difference, the correlations between the relative effective radius difference and CDNC or cloud geometric thickness are weaker. For averaging domains of 5 km and 25 km, the correlation coefficients between MODIS-retrieved and in-situ measured CDNC are 0.91 and 0.93 with fitting slopes of 1.23 and 1.27, respectively. If the cloud adiabaticity is taken into account, better agreements are achieved for both averaging domains (the fitting slopes are 1.04 and 1.07, respectively). Our comparison and sensitivity analysis of simulated retrievals demonstrate that both cloud geometrical thickness and cloud adiabaticity are important factors in satellite retrievals of effective radius and cloud drop number concentration. The large variabilities in cloud geometrical thickness and adiabaticity, the dependencies of cloud microphysical properties on both quantities (as demonstrated in our sensitivity study of simulated retrievals), and the inability to accurately account for either of them in retrievals lead to some uncertainties and biases in satellite retrieved cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration. However, strong correlations between satellite retrievals and in-situ measurements suggest that satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius, cloud liquid water path, and cloud drop number concentration can be used to investigate aerosol indirect effects qualitatively.

Mapping Congo Basin vegetation types from 300 m and 1 km multi-sensor time series for carbon stocks and forest areas estimation	BIOGEOSCIENCES												This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the Congo Basin forests by delivering a detailed map of vegetation types with an improved spatial discrimination and coherence for the whole Congo Basin region. A total of 20 land cover classes were described with the standardized Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) developed by the FAO. Based on a semi-automatic processing chain, the Congo Basin vegetation types map was produced by combining 19 months of observations from the Envisat MERIS full resolution products (300 m) and 8 yr of daily SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) reflectances (1 km). Four zones (north, south and two central) were delineated and processed separately according to their seasonal and cloud cover specificities. The discrimination between different vegetation types (e. g. forest and savannas) was significantly improved thanks to the MERIS sharp spatial resolution. A better discrimination was achieved in cloudy areas by taking advantage of the temporal consistency of the SPOT VGT observations. This resulted in a precise delineation of the spatial extent of the rural complex in the countries situated along the Atlantic coast. Based on this new map, more accurate estimates of the surface areas of forest types were produced for each country of the Congo Basin. Carbon stocks of the Basin were evaluated to a total of 49 360 million metric tons. The regional scale of the map was an opportunity to investigate what could be an appropriate tree cover threshold for a forest class definition in the Congo Basin countries. A 30% tree cover threshold was suggested. Furthermore, the phenology of the different vegetation types was illustrated systematically with EVI temporal profiles. This Congo Basin forest types map reached a satisfactory overall accuracy of 71.5% and even 78.9% when some classes are aggregated. The values of the Cohen's kappa coefficient, respectively 0.64 and 0.76 indicates a result significantly better than random.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2012	9	12					5061	5079		10.5194/bg-9-5061-2012								WOS:000312668100012

Fate of river Tiber discharge investigated through numerical simulation and satellite monitoring	OCEAN SCIENCE												The aim of this study was to determine the dispersion of passive pollutants associated with the Tiber discharge into the Tyrrhenian Sea using numerical marine dispersion models and satellite data. Numerical results obtained in the simulation of realistic discharge episodes were compared with the corresponding evolution of the spatial distributions of MODIS diffuse light attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K490), and the results were discussed with reference to the local climate and the seasonal sub-regional circulation regime. The numerical model used for the simulation of the sub-tidal circulation was a Mediterranean sub-regional scale implementation of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM), nested in the large-scale Mediterranean Forecasting System. The nesting method enabled the model to be applied to almost every area in the Mediterranean Sea and also to be used in seasons for which imposing climatological boundary conditions would have been questionable. Dynamical effects on coastal circulation and on water density due to the Tiber discharge were additionally accounted for in the oceanographic model by implementing the river estuary as a point source of a buoyant jet. A Lagrangian particle dispersion model fed with the POM current fields was then run in order to reproduce the effect of the turbulent transport of passive tracers mixed in the plume with the coastal flow. Two significant episodes of river discharge in both winter and summer conditions were discussed in this paper. It was found that the winter regime was characterized by the presence of a strong coastal jet flowing with the ambient current. In summer the prevailing wind regime induced coastal downwelling conditions, which tended to confine the riverine waters close to the shore. In such conditions sudden wind reversals due to local weather perturbations, causing moderate local upwelling, proved to be the only effective way to disperse the tracers offshore, moving the plume from the coast and detaching large pools of freshwater.

Evaluating nighttime CALIOP 0.532 mu m aerosol optical depth and extinction coefficient retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												NASA Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Version 3.01 5-km nighttime 0.532 mu m aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets from 2007 are screened, averaged and evaluated at 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution versus corresponding/co-incident 0.550 mu m AOD derived using the US Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS), featuring two-dimensional variational assimilation of quality-assured NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) AOD. In the absence of sunlight, since passive radiometric AOD retrievals rely overwhelmingly on scattered radiances, the model represents one of the few practical global estimates available from which to attempt such a validation. Daytime comparisons, though, provide useful context. Regional-mean CALIOP vertical profiles of night/day 0.532 mu m extinction coefficient are compared with 0.523/0.532 mu m ground-based lidar measurements to investigate representativeness and diurnal variability. In this analysis, mean nighttime CALIOP AOD are mostly lower than daytime (0.121 vs. 0.126 for all aggregated data points, and 0.099 vs. 0.102 when averaged globally per normalised 1 degrees x 1 degrees bin), though the relationship is reversed over land and coastal regions when the data are averaged per normalised bin (0.134/0.108 vs. 0140/0.112, respectively). Offsets assessed within single bins alone approach +/- 20 %. CALIOP AOD, both day and night, are higher than NAAPS over land (0.137 vs. 0.124) and equal over water (0.082 vs. 0.083) when averaged globally per normalised bin. However, for all data points inclusive, NAAPS exceeds CALIOP over land, coast and ocean, both day and night. Again, differences assessed within single bins approach 50% in extreme cases. Correlation between CALIOP and NAAPS AOD is comparable during both day and night. Higher correlation is found nearest the equator, both as a function of sample size and relative signal magnitudes inherent at these latitudes. Root mean square deviation between CALIOP and NAAPS varies between 0.1 and 0.3 globally during both day/night. Averaging of CALIOP along-track AOD data points within a single NAAPS grid bin improves correlation and RMSD, though day/night and land/ocean biases persist and are believed systematic. Vertical profiles of extinction coefficient derived in the Caribbean compare well with ground-based lidar observations, though potentially anomalous selection of a priori lidar ratios for CALIOP retrievals is likely inducing some discrepancies. Mean effective aerosol layer top heights are stable between day and night, indicating consistent layer-identification diurnally, which is noteworthy considering the potential limiting effects of ambient solar noise during day.

Meteorological Patterns Associated with Intense Saharan Dust Outbreaks over Greece in Winter	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												The Mediterranean Basin and southern Europe are often affected by Saharan dust outbreaks, which influence the aerosol load and properties, air quality standards, visibility and human health. The present work examines, mainly of the meteorological point of view, three intense dust outbreaks occurred over Greece with duration of one or two days, on 4 and 6 February and 5-6 March 2009. The synoptic analysis on the dusty days showed the presence of low-pressure systems in the west coasts of Europe and the north Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively, associated with a trough reaching the north African coast. The result of these conditions was the strong surface and mid troposphere winds that carried significant amounts of dust over Greece. During the dusty days extensive cloud cover associated with the dust plume occurred over Greece. The air-mass trajectories showed a clear Saharan origin in all atmospheric levels, while the satellite (MODIS Terra/Aqua) observations as well as the model (DREAM) predictions verified the intense dust outbreaks over easternMediterranean and Greece. The ground based particulate matter concentrations in Athens were excessively increased on the dusty days (PM10: 150-560 mu g/m(3)), while significant dry and wet deposition occurred as forecasted by DREAM model.

Spatial distributions of sea surface temperature (SST) and Chl a concentration were examined using MODIS and MEP:IS data respectively. The MERIS data were processed with an algorithm developed by the Free University of Berlin (FUB) for case 2 waters. Evaluation of MEETS Chl a versus in situ Chl a showed good correlation (r(2) = 0.67), but the concentration was underestimated. The linear regression for a 2 h window was applied to calibrate MEM Chl a. The spatio-temporal variability exhibited the clear influence of upwelling events and related filaments on Chl a distribution in the western and central Gulf. The lowest Chl a concentrations were recorded in the upwelled water, especially at the upwelling centres, and the highest concentrations (13 mg m(-3)) were observed about two weeks after the upwelling peak along the northern coast. The areas along the northern coast of upwelled water (4879 km(2)) on the SST map, and increased Chi a (5526 km(2)) two weeks later, were roughly coincident. The effect of upwelling events was weak in the eastern part of the Gulf, where Chl a concentration was relatively consistent throughout this period.

The remote-sensing data are from the advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) onboard the Environmental Satellite (Envisat), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra satellite, the imager onboard the geostationary satellite MTSAT-1R (Multi-Functional Transport Satellite-1R) and the weather radar of the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). A northerly winter monsoon surge is a cold air outbreak associated with a northerly wind, the passage of a cold front from north to south and a strong drop in air temperature. The analyses of the weather radar and the MTSAR-1R images of 15 December show that the surge of 15 December was associated with a rain band and a cloud front travelling over the SCS in a southeastward direction. Due to the interaction of the cold air (13 degrees C) with the warm water (19 degrees C), they dissolved when they had reached an offshore distance of approximately 160 km. The high-resolution (150 m) ASAR image reveals fine-scale features of the wind field, in particular details of the wind front, such as embedded rain cells and atmospheric gravity waves. Quantitative information on the near-surface wind field is retrieved from the ASAR, and it is shown that the wind field associated with the surge is quite variable and that speeds up to 15 m s(-1) are encountered in coastal wind jets. Finally, the remote-sensing data are compared with the simulation results of the pre-operational version of the Atmospheric Integrated Rapid-cycle (AIR) forecast model of the HKO. It is shown that, in general, the AIR model reproduces quite well the observational data.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013; Chan, Pak Wai/C-8447-2011	Chan, Pak Wai/0000-0003-2289-0609												0143-1161						2012	33	23			SI		7361	7381		10.1080/01431161.2012.685983								WOS:000306286200004

Use of satellite images of chlorophyll fluorescence to monitor the spring bloom in coastal waters	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					10th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)	OCT, 2010	Keelung, TAIWAN	Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Taiwan Ocean Res Inst, Taiwan Natl Sci Council, Fisheries (FA), Environm Protect Agcy Taiwan (EPA), Int Space Sci & Res Agencies				This article demonstrates a successful application of fluorescence line height (FLH) images from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagers and provides a strong argument for making more widespread use of FLH in monitoring surface phytoplankton in coastal waters. In the present example, MERIS and MODIS FLH images show the start of the spring bloom in coastal waters of the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia, Canada. The images clearly show a recurring pattern in five of the eight years from 2003 to 2010 covered by MERIS, which suggests seeding of the early spring bloom from narrow coastal inlets. Such seeding has been suggested before, but never observed. FLH images show the blooms more clearly than images of surface chlorophyll based on the ratios of water-leaving radiances in the blue and green spectral range (440-560 nm). FLH images used here have been derived with no atmospheric correction. Alternative products based on the blue/green ratio require atmospheric correction, which is difficult in coastal areas. Such products also tend to be more significantly confused with other constituents of coastal waters.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2012	33	23			SI		7469	7481		10.1080/01431161.2012.685979								WOS:000306286200011

No significant changes were found in marine phytoplankton in the first few months after the oil spill. However, a big phytoplankton bloom was observed after 10 months, when Chl-a increased from 0.1 to 1.0 mg m(-3). After considering the time-series variability of Chl-a and SST and the spatial variability of Chl-a and bathymetry, we concluded that this phytoplankton bloom was probably related to the Lebanon oil spill.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013	Pan, Gang/0000-0003-0054-6516												0143-1161						2012	33	23			SI		7482	7490		10.1080/01431161.2012.685982								WOS:000306286200012

On 11 March 2011, at local time 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC), a mega-earthquake of moment magnitude (M-w) 9.0 and shallow focus (24 km), known as the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, occurred on the Japan Trench plate boundary off the eastern shore of northern Honshu, followed by a large tsunami on the Pacific coast of Japan. This article is an attempt to analyse the development of thermal anomalies in land surface temperature (LST) preceding the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake. In order to correlate LST variations and the Tohoku earthquake, we analysed time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra/Aqua satellite daytime/night-time and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) data. A clear rise of LST (1-10 degrees C), which is apparently related to pre-seismic activity, was observed 2 weeks before the major event in all analysed satellite data around the earthquake epicentre.																	0143-1161						2012	33	21					6805	6817		10.1080/01431161.2012.692833								WOS:000305539700010

The channels 667 and 678 nm showed interesting algal bloom features. The bloom features were detected in OCM image of January 2, 2004, using Subramanian's Trichodesmium detection Protocol. MODIS-Aqua retrieved Sea Surface Temperature (SST) around the bloom patches was observed to be >240 degrees C. The OCM chlorophyll mean observed to be very high (>10.0 mg m(-3)) in two bloom pockets.

The comparison of MODIS-Aqua (C5) and CALIOP (V2 & V3) aerosol optical depth	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We assess the consistency between instantaneously collocated level-2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from MODIS-Aqua (C5) and CALIOP (Version 2 & 3), comparing the standard MODIS AOD (MYD04_L2) data to the AOD calculated from CALIOP aerosol extinction profiles for both the previous release (V2) and the latest release (V3) of CALIOP data. Based on data collected in January 2007, we investigate the most useful criteria for screening the MODIS and CALIOP retrievals to achieve the best agreement between the two data sets. Applying these criteria to eight months of data (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct 2007 and 2009), we find an order of magnitude increase for the CALIOP V3 data density (by comparison to V2), that is generally accompanied by equal or better agreement with MODIS AOD. Differences in global, monthly mean, over-ocean AOD (532 nm) between CALIOP and MODIS range between 0.03 and 0.04 for CALIOP V3, with CALIOP generally biased low, when all available data from both sensors are considered. Root-mean-squares (RMS) differences in instantaneously collocated AOD retrievals by the two instruments are reduced from values ranging between 0.14 and 0.19 using the unscreened V3 data to values ranging from 0.09 to 0.1 for the screened data. A restriction to scenes with cloud fractions less than 1% (as defined in the MODIS aerosol retrievals) generally results in improved correlation (R-2 > 0.5), except for the month of July when correlations remain relatively lower. Regional assessments show hot spots in disagreement between the two sensors in Asian outflow during April and off the coast of South Africa in July.																	1680-7316	1680-7324					2012	12	6					3025	3043		10.5194/acp-12-3025-2012								WOS:000302178000012						
J	Moradi, M; Kabiri, K				Moradi, Masoud; Kabiri, Keivan			Red tide detection in the Strait of Hormuz (east of the Persian Gulf) using MODIS fluorescence data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A monstrous red tide appeared on October 2008 and expanded to the west on November 2008 off the Iranian coasts in the Hormuz Strait (east of the Persian Gulf). MODIS satellite data, hydrographic and bio-optical field measurements were used to detect the red tide. MODIS fluorescence line height (FLH in w m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) data showed the highest correlation with near-concurrent in situ chlorophyll concentration of 0.74 (100(FLH))(1.23) (r = 0.9, n = 44). In contrast, the band- ratio Chlorophyll product of MODIS showed more inconsistency with in situ chlorophyll data due to the interference of other water constituents. High FLH value patches > 0.18 were confirmed to be located at the medium to high (10(4)-10(6) cells l(-1)) concentrations of Cochlodinium polykrikoides, and also showed a chlorophyll anomaly > 1 mg m(-3), which means the potential of red tide occurrences. The FLH imagery also showed that the bloom started in early September along Bandar-Abbas port, and developed and moved to the west along the coastal regions. The results revealed that MODIS FLH and enhanced RGB (ERGB) imagery plus in situ data are adequate tools for red tide monitoring.

Sensitivity to deliberate sea salt seeding of marine clouds - observations and model simulations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Sea salt seeding of marine clouds to increase their albedo is a proposed technique to counteract or slow global warming. In this study, we first investigate the susceptibility of marine clouds to sea salt injections, using observational data of cloud droplet number concentration, cloud optical depth, and liquid cloud fraction from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board the Aqua and Terra satellites. We then compare the derived susceptibility function to a corresponding estimate from the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM). Results compare well between simulations and observations, showing that stratocumulus regions off the west coast of the major continents along with large regions over the Pacific and the Indian Oceans are susceptible. At low and mid latitudes the signal is dominated by the cloud fraction. We then carry out geo-engineering experiments with a uniform increase over ocean of 10(-9) kg m(-2) s(-1) in emissions of sea salt particles with a dry modal radius of 0.13 mu m, an emission strength and areal coverage much greater than proposed in earlier studies. The increased sea salt concentrations and the resulting change in marine cloud properties lead to a globally averaged forcing of -4.8 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, more than cancelling the forcing associated with a doubling of CO2 concentrations. The forcing is large in areas found to be sensitive by using the susceptibility function, confirming its usefulness as an indicator of where to inject sea salt for maximum effect. Results also show that the effectiveness of sea salt seeding is reduced because the injected sea salt provides a large surface area for water vapor and gaseous sulphuric acid to condense on, thereby lowering the maximum supersaturation and suppressing the formation and lifetime of sulphate particles. In some areas, our simulations show an overall reduction in the CCN concentration and the number of activated cloud droplets decreases, resulting in a positive forcing.																	1680-7316						2012	12	5					2795	2807		10.5194/acp-12-2795-2012								WOS:000301547500035

Remote sensing of phytoplankton community composition along the northeast coast of the United States	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite imagery has proven to be a powerful tool for measuring chlorophyll a in surface waters. While this provides an estimate of total phytoplankton biomass, it does not distinguish between phytoplankton groups, many of which have functional differences and therefore affect biogeochemical cycles differently. Phytoplankton pigment analysis has been used to quantify a wide range of photosynthetic and accessory pigments, and chemotaxonomic analysis (e.g. CHEMTAX) has been used to successfully quantify functional taxonomic groups in nature based on pigment distributions. Here, we combine CHEMTAX analysis with satellite-derived distributions of specific phytoplankton pigments to describe the distributions of particular components of the phytoplankton community in the northeast coast of the United States from space. The spatial and seasonal variations in phytoplankton community structure elucidated through satellite remote sensing methods generally agreed with observations of abundance estimates of cell counts. Diatoms were generally the most abundant phytoplankton in this region, especially during Winter-Spring and in the inner shelf, but phytoplankton populations shifted to increasing abundance of other taxa during Summer, especially offshore. While still preliminary, satellite-derived taxa-specific information with proper regional controls holds promise for providing information on phytoplankton abundance to a taxonomic group level which would greatly improve our understanding of the impacts of human activity and climate change on ecosystems.

Development of Nitrate Algorithm for the Southwest Bay of Bengal Water and Its Implication Using Remote Sensing Satellite Datasets	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The in situ sampled and analyzed nitrate, chlorophyll and sea surface temperature (SST) during the period 2009-2010 from monthly coastal stations and cruise datasets have been interpreted for the southwest Bay of Bengal water to develop nitrate algorithm for remote sensing applications in ocean biogeochemical cycling. The monthly sampled data points were retrieved from the coastal water around Pondicherry, Cuddalore, Parangipettai and Nagapattinam along Tamil Nadu coast, India. The cruise data has been retrieved between the coastal and offshore water along the Chennai and Kakinada (AP) segment. The SST and chlorophyll datasets has been regressed with the nitrate three dimensionally with 105 in situ data points. Parabolic function has been fitted, producing significant relationship. During the following seasons: summer (April-June), pre-monsoon (July-September), monsoon (October-December) and post-monsoon (January-March) the coefficient of determination R(2) value found to be 0.16, 0.34, 0.48 and 0.56 respectively. The satellite derived nitrate map has been generated for February 28, 2010 using Oceansat-2 OCM derived chlorophyll concentration and MODIS-Aqua derived SST basing on in situ modeled nitrate algorithm. The satellite derived nitrate concentration range has been observed to be 0.01 to 12.0 mu/L with high nitrate fronts off Tamil Nadu and Kerala coast around southern Indian tip. High nitrate and low chlorophyll (HNLC) condition has been of concern, where SST was high. Similar contrasting features in SST and nitrate images have been observed. The developed algorithm has been validated for a different dataset of March 16 and 18, 2010 and R(2) value found to be 0.508 and the algorithm observed to be working satisfactory over the southwest Bay of Bengal region.																	1939-1404					DEC	2011	4	4					983	991		10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2165204								WOS:000298054500030

The case study analyzed is a Canadian boreal forest fire event on July 4, 2006 with carbonaceous aerosol smoke emission magnitudes comparable to those during the summer fire seasons of the previous decade. We track long-range transport of these aerosol plumes with data from space-borne remote sensing satellite instruments (MODIS, OMI, MISR, CALIOP lidar, AIRS) and ground-based in situ and remote aerosol observations (AERONET CIMEL sky/Sun photometer, MPLNET lidar, IMPROVE, EPA AirNow). Convective lofting elevated smoke emissions above the boundary layer into the free troposphere, where high speed winds aloft led to rapid, long-range transport. Aerosol layer subsidence occurred during transport due to a region of surface high pressure. Smoke aerosols reaching the boundary layer led to surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) enhancements accompanied by changes in aerosol composition as the plume mixed with anthropogenic aerosols over the northeastern U.S. The extensive coverage of this smoke plume over the northeastern U.S. affected regional air quality, with increases of 10-20 mu g m(-3) PM2.5 attributable to biomass burning smoke aerosols and EPA 24-hour PM2.5 standard exceedances along the U.S. East Coast. Although each data set individually provides a limited view of the transport of smoke emissions, we demonstrate that a multi-data set approach results in a more comprehensive view of potential impacts due to long-range transport of smoke from a less extreme fire event. Our case study demonstrates that fires emit smoke aerosols that under certain meteorological conditions can degrade regional air quality 3000 km from the source region, with additional implications for aerosol radiative forcing and regional haze over the northeastern U.S.				Dubovik, Oleg/A-8235-2009; Xiongfei, Zhao/G-7690-2015; Welton, Ellsworth/A-8362-2012; Ginoux, Paul/C-2326-2008; Zondlo, Mark/R-6173-2016	Dubovik, Oleg/0000-0003-3482-6460; Ginoux, Paul/0000-0003-3642-2988; Zondlo, Mark/0000-0003-2302-9554												2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 22	2011	116								D22209	10.1029/2011JD016170								WOS:000297421100003

Environmental controls on the spatial variability of savanna productivity in the Northern Territory, Australia	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is a critical measure of the health and sustainability of natural ecosystems. Understanding the magnitude, spatial patterns and processes of GPP will underpin predictions of the impact of climate change on the carbon cycle. In Australia, savannas account for one third of the terrestrial carbon stores and therefore, estimating the magnitude of savanna GPP and studying the spatial relationship between GPP and environmental determinants at the regional scale is essential in understanding ecosystem responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and climate change. In this study we employed an integrated approach combining in situ measurements, eddy covariance based flux tower data and remote sensing techniques to examine the role of environmental drivers in controlling the spatial variation in GPP of savannas in the Northern Territory (NT), Australia. We used field based light use efficiency (LUE), regional specific meteorology and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) based fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) data to estimate GPP. The estimated GPP agreed quite well (only a 6% error) with GPP estimated from flux tower at the Howard Springs site. The spatial pattern of GPP along the Northern Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) was calculated and showed a strong gradient in GPP from the coast (12.50 degrees S where rainfall was 1622 mm year(-1)) to inland (17.73 degrees S where mean rainfall was 643 mm year(-1)) with a decrease of 77%. A decreasing trend in GPP with rainfall is noticed especially at the dry end of the transect studied. However, in the wet end and middle part of the transect (e.g. dominated by different Eucalyptus species), the response of GPP to changes in rainfall is reduced. This finding suggests that the influence of rainfall on various Eucalyptus species may be dampened by biotic factors. Our results suggest that future changes in precipitation driven by climate change may affect the future distribution and dynamics of GPP in northern Australia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to pollutants, Asian dust particles are also transported to the island during long-range transport events. Episodic transport of dust and secondary particles was observed during intensive measurements in the spring (March 31-April 11) and fall (October 13-26) of 2009. In this study, the chemical characteristics of long-range-transported particles were investigated based on highly time-resolved ionic measurements with a particle-into-liquid system coupled with an online ion chromatograph (PILS-IC) that simultaneously measures concentrations of cations (Li(+), Na(+) NH(4)(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+)) and anions (F(-), Cl(-), NO(3)(-), SO(4)(2-)). The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) distribution retrieved by the modified Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (M-BAER) algorithm from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data confirmed the presence of a thick aerosol plume coming from the Asian continent towards the Korean peninsula. Seven distinctive events involving the long-range transport (LRT) of aerosols were identified and studied, the chemical components of which were strongly related to sector sources. Enrichment of acidic secondary aerosols on mineral dust particles, and even of sea-salt components, during transport was observed in this study. Backward trajectory, chemical analyses, and satellite aerosol retrievals identified two distinct events: a distinctively high [Ca(2+)+Mg(2+)]/[Na(+)] ratio (> 2.0), which was indicative of a preprocessed mineral dust transport event, and a low [Ca(2+)+Mg(2+)]/[Na(+)] ratio (< 2.0), which was indicative of severe aging of sea-salt components on the processed dust particles. Particulate Cl(-) was depleted by up to 85% in spring and 50% in the fall. A consistent fraction of carbonate replacement (FCR) averaged 0.53 in spring and 0.55 in the fall. Supporting evidences of Cl(-) enrichment on the marine boundary layer prior to a dust front were also found. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

Quantification of Monthly Mean Regional-Scale Albedo of Marine Stratiform Clouds in Satellite Observations and GCMs	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Planetary albedo the reflectivity for solar radiation is of singular importance in determining the amount of solar energy taken in by the Earth-atmosphere system. Modeling albedo, and specifically cloud albedo, correctly is crucial for realistic climate simulations. A method is presented herein by which regional cloud albedo can be quantified from the relation between total albedo and cloud fraction, which in observations is found to be approximately linear on a monthly mean scale. This analysis is based primarily on the combination of cloud fraction data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and albedo data from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), but the results presented are also supported by the combination of cloud fraction and proxy albedo data from satelliteborne lidar [Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CA LIPSO)]. These data are measured and derived completely independently from the CERES-MODIS data. Applied to low-level marine stratiform clouds in three regions (off the coasts of South America, Africa, and North America), the analysis reveals regionally uniform monthly mean cloud albedos, indicating that the variation in cloud shortwave radiative properties is small on this scale. A coherent picture of low "effective" cloud albedo emerges, in the range from 0.35 to 0.42, on the basis of data from CERES and MODIS. In its simplicity, the method presented appears to be useful as a diagnostic tool and as a constraint on climate models. To demonstrate this, the same method is applied to cloud fraction and albedo output from several current-generation climate models [from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 3 (CMIP3), archive]. Although the multimodel mean cloud albedo estimates agree to within 20% with the satellite-based estimates for the three focus regions, model-based estimates of cloud albedo are found to display much larger variability than do the observations, within individual models as well as between models.

We developed an extensive database of occurrence records from published studies and our own surveys and compared two methods to model the probability of O. longicaudatus presence; logistic regression and MaxEnt algorithm. The environmental variables used were tree, grass and bare soil cover from MODIS imagery and, altitude and 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim database. The models performances were evaluated and compared both by threshold dependent and independent measures. The best models included tree and grass cover, mean diurnal temperature range, and precipitation of the warmest and coldest seasons. The potential distribution maps for O. longicaudatus predicted the highest occurrence probabilities along the Andes range, from 32A degrees S and narrowing southwards. They also predicted high probabilities for the south-central area of Argentina, reaching the Atlantic coast. The Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome cases coincided with mean occurrence probabilities of 95 and 77% for logistic and MaxEnt models, respectively. HPS transmission zones in Argentine Patagonia matched the areas with the highest probability of presence. Therefore, colilargos presence probability may provide an approximate risk of transmission and act as an early tool to guide control and prevention plans.

Suresh			Spatial heterogeneities in aerosol size distribution over Bay of Bengal during Winter-ICARB Experiment	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This work examines the aerosol physical properties and size distribution measured in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) over entire Bay of Bengal (BOB) and Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) during the Winter Integrated Campaign on Aerosols, Gases and Radiation Budget (W-ICARB). The measurements were taken using the GRIMM optical particle counter from 27th December 2008 to 30th January 2009. The results show large spatial heterogeneities regarding both the total aerosol number concentrations (N-T) and the size distributions over BoB, which in turn indicates the variations in the source strength or advection from different regions. The aerosol number size distribution seems to be bimodal in the 72% of the cases and can also be parameterized by uni-modal or by a combination of power-law and uni-modal distributions for the rest of the cases. The mode radius for accumulation and coarse-mode particles ranges from similar to 0.1-0.2 mu m and similar to 0.6-0.8 mu m, respectively. In the northern BoB and along the Indian coast, the aerosols are mainly of sub-micron size with effective radius (R-eff) ranging between 0.25 and 0.3 mu m highlighting the strong anthropogenic influence, while in the open oceanic areas they are much higher (0.4-0.6 mu m). It was also found that the sea-surface wind plays a considerable role in the super-micron number concentration. R-eff and mode radius for coarse-mode aerosols. Using the relation between N-T and columnar AOD from Terra and Aqua-MODIS we found that the majority of the aerosols are within the lower MABL, while in some areas vertical heterogeneities also exist.

This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties in the visible from the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region assuming that the seawater is totally absorbant in this latter part of the spectrum. However, the non-negligible water-leaving radiance in the NIR which is characteristic of turbid waters may lead to an overestimate of the atmospheric radiance in the whole visible spectrum with increasing severity at shorter wavelengths. This may result in significant errors, if not complete failure, of various algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration, inherent optical properties and biogeochemical parameters of surface waters. This paper presents results of an inter-comparison study of three methods that compensate for NIR water-leaving radiances and that are based on very different hypothesis: 1) the standard Sea WiFS algorithm (Stumpfet al., 2003; Bailey et al., 2010) based on a bio-optical model and an iterative process; 2) the algorithm developed by Ruddick et al. (2000) based on the spatial homogeneity of the NIR ratios of the aerosol and water-leaving radiances; and 3) the algorithm of Kuchinke et al. (2009) based on a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean spectral optimization inversion. They are compared using normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w) in the visible. The reference source for comparison is ground-based measurements from three AERONET-Ocean Color sites, one in the Adriatic Sea and two in the East Coast of USA. Based on the matchup exercise, the best overall estimates of the nL(w) are obtained with the latest SeaWiFS standard algorithm version with relative error varying from 14.97% to 35.27% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 670 nm respectively. The least accurate estimates are given by the algorithm of Ruddick, the relative errors being between 16.36% and 42.92% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 412 nm, respectively. The algorithm of Kuchinke appears to be the most accurate algorithm at 412 nm (30.02%), 510 (15.54%) and 670 nm (32.32%) using its default optimization and bio-optical model coefficient settings. Similar conclusions are obtained for the aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical thickness tau(865) and the Angstrom exponent, alpha(510, 865)). Those parameters are retrieved more accurately with the SeaWiFS standard algorithm (relative error of 33% and 54.15% for tau(865) and alpha(510, 865)). A detailed analysis of the hypotheses of the methods is given for explaining the differences between the algorithms. The determination of the aerosol parameters is critical for the algorithm of Ruddick et al. (2000) while the bio-optical model is critical for the algorithm of Stumpf et al. (2003) utilized in the standard SeaWiFS atmospheric correction and both aerosol and bio-optical model for the coupled atmospheric-ocean algorithm of Kuchinke. The Kuchinke algorithm presents model aerosol-size distributions that differ from real aerosol-size distribution pertaining to the measurements. In conclusion, the results show that for the given atmospheric and oceanic conditions of this study, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm is most appropriate for estimating the marine and aerosol parameters in the given turbid waters regions.

Simulations for July 2006, forced at the lateral boundaries by ERA-Interim reanalyses, show generally accurate positioning of the various cloud regimes but also some important model-observation differences, which the authors tried to reduce by altering model parameterizations. These differences are as follows: 1) TOA albedo differences in clear-sky regions like the Sahara and southern Africa. These differences were considerably reduced by prescribing the surface albedo from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. 2) A considerable overestimation of outgoing longwave radiation within the continental ITCZ caused by the fact that modeled cirrus clouds are far too thin. 3) Underestimation by the model of cloud cover, condensed water path and albedo of the stratocumulus fields off the coast of Angola. The authors reduced these underestimations by suppressing the amount of turbulent mixing above the boundary layer, by prescribing droplet radii derived from SEVIRI data, and by assuming in-cloud horizontal homogeneity for the radiation calculations. 4) Overestimation by the model of the albedo of the trade wind cumulus fields over the Atlantic Ocean. This study argues that this overestimation is likely caused by a model overestimation of condensed water path. In general, the analyses demonstrate the power of the simultaneous evaluation of the TOA fluxes and cloud properties.																	0894-8755					AUG	2011	24	15					4015	4036		10.1175/2011JCLI3856.1								WOS:000293823900016

The field observations in two different seasons allow an exponential empirical model to be used to retrieve suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) from MODIS imagery. Both the field-survey data and the MODIS-derived SSC show that the sediment transport in the southern Bohai Strait has a significant seasonal variation due to the seasonally varying thermohaline structure of the water column and the hydrodynamics resulting from the seasonally alternating monsoons. The SSC in winter is approximately 3-10 times higher than in summer. Considering the seasonal variation of water flux (WF) and SSC, the annual sediment flux (SSF) through the southern Bohai Strait is estimated to be approximately 40.0 Mt yr(-1), about 4-8 times previous estimates, which did not take into account seasonal variation. Although the Huanghe (Yellow River) discharges a large amount of sediment in the summer, the SSF through the southern Bohai Strait in the winter (similar to 32.0 Mt) is about 4 times greater than it is in the summer. The strong seasonal variability of SSF through the southern Bohai Strait indicates that strong resuspension along the coast of the Huanghe delta in winter and enhanced longshore transport by coastal currents due to winter monsoon activity might be the major mechanisms of cross-strait transport of sediment in winter.

Seventeen Antarctic seismic events detected by global surface waves and a possible link to calving events from satellite images	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												We detect 17 seismic events in Antarctica from 1997 to 2009 by applying a surface wave detector to global seismic data. We locate these events using a waveform cross-correlation method and find that most occurred near the coast of Antarctica and are clustered in three regions: four events are on the Ronne Ice Shelf, close to the location of a 1998 calving event; five events are near the Vanderford Glacier; and eight events are near the Ninnis Glacier. The observed Rayleigh and Love waves for these events have similar amplitudes and a two-lobed radiation pattern, matching the expected amplitude behavior of a single-force source model. Using such a model, we obtain best fitting horizontal force directions for the 14 events that have relatively better signal-to-noise ratios. Analysis of coastline changes from MODIS images before and after the detected events show that two events on Vanderford Glacier and one event near Ninnis Glacier are likely associated with calving events. Moreover, the inferred force directions for the seismic events appear consistent with local ice flow directions. Both satellite observations and modeling results strongly suggest a link between seismic events and calving processes in the two regions. However, the force directions on the Ronne Ice Shelf are aligned with observed rift propagation directions, suggesting that these events may arise from rifting processes.

Modelling the current and future spatial distribution of NPP in a Mediterranean watershed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The aim of this study is to use full spatial resolution Envisat MERIS data to drive an ecosystem productivity model for pine forests along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey. The Carnegie, Ames, Stanford Approach (CASA) terrestrial biogeochemical model, designed to simulate the terrestrial carbon cycle using satellite sensor and meteorological data, was used to estimate annual regional fluxes in terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP). At its core this model is based on light-use efficiency, influenced by temperature, rainfall and solar radiation. Present climate data was generated from 50 climate stations within the watershed using co-kriging. Regional scale pseudo-warming data for year 2070 were derived using a Regional Climate Model (RCM) these data were used to downscale the GCM General Circulation Model for the research area as part of an international research project called Impact of Climate Changes on Agricultural Production Systems in Arid Areas (ICCAP). Outputs of climate data can be moderated using the four variables of percent tree cover, land cover, soil texture and NDVI. This study employed 47 MERIS images recorded between March 2003 and September 2005 to derive percent tree cover, land cover and NDVI. Envisat MERIS data hold great potential for estimating NPP with the CASA model because of the appropriateness of both its spatial and its spectral resolution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Raman, RS; Ramachandran, S; Kedia, S				Raman, Ramya Sunder; Ramachandran, S.; Kedia, Sumita			A methodology to estimate source-specific aerosol radiative forcing	JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE												This paper presents a novel approach to estimate source-specific radiative forcing by combining source apportionment results for particulate matter mass with satellite (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)) derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to particulate matter (PM) mass and its chemical constituents measured during a winter intensive study (December 2004) at Hisar, Haryana, India. The model resolved four factors including carbonate rich dust, combustion rich aerosol, secondary sulfate/nitrate, and an unidentified factor likely to be emission from polymer industries. Carbonate rich dust was the highest contributor to the measured PM mass closely followed by combustion rich aerosol with their average contributions accounting for 34.0% and 33.6%, respectively. Model apportioned species concentrations corresponding to each factor were then used to estimate factor specific optical and radiative properties, and radiative transfer calculations were performed for the shortwave regime. During the study period, although carbonate rich dust and combustion rich aerosol mass contributions were comparable, carbonate rich dust contributed to only 22% of top of the atmosphere forcing while combustion rich aerosol contributed nearly 56%. Overall, the results suggested that the aerosol radiative forcing was primarily governed by the aerosol optical and radiative properties, while the mass concentrations played a secondary role.

Role of dynamics in the advection of aerosols over the Arabian Sea along the west coast of peninsular India during pre-monsoon season: A case study based on satellite data and regional climate model	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The circulation dynamics of an event marked by the formation of an aerosol cluster off the coast of Maharashtra on April 22, 2006, its southward migration along the Indian west coast with a mean speed of similar to 200 km/day and its final dissipation after reaching the end of the peninsula by April 28, 2006 as revealed by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) against the pre-monsoon conditions of April 2006 are examined in this study. The maximum aerosol concentration in the cluster was found getting confined to lower and lower altitudes during its southward movement. The NCEP/NCAR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research) reanalysis wind field indicates that the atmospheric circulation, especially the horizontal wind convergence is the major factor that guides the formation and the dynamics of the cluster. Fine mode fraction from MODIS suggests that the cluster mainly consists of coarse dust particles. The regional climate model, RegCM3 with an efficient dust generation module simulates the formation and movement of the cluster appreciably well. The simulations which also exhibit the altitudinally descending nature of the cluster during its southward movement confirm the mechanism which governs the cluster dynamics suggested based on MODIS and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Satellite observations of asymmetrical physical and biological responses to Hurricane Earl	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Asymmetrical physical and biological responses to Hurricane Earl in 2010 are revealed with a combined data set of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ocean color and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer EOS (AMSR-E) SST observations onboard the satellite Aqua. Hurricane Earl induced broad SST drops and elevated chlorophyll-a concentrations along its track. The ocean's physical and biological responses are notably right-biased when the hurricane passed along the U. S. East Coast. In the ranges within 100 km off the track, the SST dropped 1.85 degrees C and 1.23 degrees C on the right and left sides, respectively. On the other hand, the ratios of the chlorophyll-a concentration before and after the passage of Hurricane Earl are 2.04 on the right side and 1.33 on the left. In addition to the satellite-observed sea surface changes, temperature and salinity profiles of an Argo float on Earl's track show the ocean's physical response occurred mostly within the mixed layer and thermocline in the upper 70 m water column.

Detecting toxic diatom blooms from ocean color and a regional ocean model	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												An apparent link between upwelling-related physical signatures, macronutrients, and toxic diatom blooms in the various "hotspots" throughout California has motivated attempts to forecast harmful algal blooms (HABs) as a function of select environmental variables. Empirical models for predicting toxic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in one such region, the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC), are tested in a nowcast mode using predictions based on merging data from MODIS ocean color geophysical products and the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) applied to the Southern California Bight. Thresholds for each model generate event forecasts. Spatially-explicit, monthly HAB maps are compared to shipboard observations and California monitoring data, demonstrating that the models predict offshore events otherwise undetected by nearshore monitoring. The use of mechanistic hydrodynamic models in concert with empirical, biological models facilitates future process studies on the effects of coastal eutrophication and climate change on regional HAB dynamics.

Multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC): 2. Aerosol algorithm	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												An aerosol component of a new multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm is presented. MAIAC is a generic algorithm developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which performs aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction over both dark vegetated surfaces and bright deserts based on a time series analysis and image-based processing. The MAIAC look-up tables explicitly include surface bidirectional reflectance. The aerosol algorithm derives the spectral regression coefficient (SRC) relating surface bidirectional reflectance in the blue (0.47 mu m) and shortwave infrared (2.1 mu m) bands; this quantity is prescribed in the MODIS operational Dark Target algorithm based on a parameterized formula. The MAIAC aerosol products include aerosol optical thickness and a fine-mode fraction at resolution of 1 km. This high resolution, required in many applications such as air quality, brings new information about aerosol sources and, potentially, their strength. AERONET validation shows that the MAIAC and MOD04 algorithms have similar accuracy over dark and vegetated surfaces and that MAIAC generally improves accuracy over brighter surfaces due to the SRC retrieval and explicit bidirectional reflectance factor characterization, as demonstrated for several U. S. West Coast AERONET sites. Due to its generic nature and developed angular correction, MAIAC performs aerosol retrievals over bright deserts, as demonstrated for the Solar Village Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site in Saudi Arabia.

Long-term evaluation of three satellite ocean color algorithms for identifying harmful algal blooms (Karenia brevis) along the west coast of Florida: A matchup assessment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We present a simple algorithm to identify Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico along the west coast of Florida in satellite imagery. It is based on an empirical analysis of collocated matchups of satellite and in situ measurements. The results of this Empirical Approach is compared to those of a Bio-optical Technique - taken from the published literature - and the Operational Method currently implemented by the NOAA Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System for K. brevis blooms. These three algorithms are evaluated using a multi-year MODIS data set (from July, 2002 to October, 2006) and a long-term in situ database. Matchup pairs, consisting of remotely-sensed ocean color parameters and near-coincident field measurements of K. brevis concentration, are used to assess the accuracy of the algorithms. Fair evaluation of the algorithms was only possible in the central west Florida shelf (i.e. between 25.75 degrees N and 28.25 degrees N) during the boreal Summer and Fall months (i.e. July to December) due to the availability of valid cloud-free matchups. Even though the predictive values of the three algorithms are similar, the statistical measure of success in red tide identification (defined as cell counts in excess of 1.5 x 10(4) cells L(-1)) varied considerably (sensitivity - Empirical: 86%; Bio-optical: 77%; Operational: 26%), as did their effectiveness in identifying non-bloom cases (specificity Empirical: 53%; Bio-optical: 65%; Operational: 84%). As the Operational Method had an elevated frequency of false-negative cases (i.e. presented low accuracy in detecting known red tides), and because of the considerable overlap between the optical characteristics of the red tide and non-bloom population, only the other two algorithms underwent a procedure for further inspecting possible detection improvements. Both optimized versions of the Empirical and Bio-optical algorithms performed similarly, being equally specific and sensitive (similar to 70% for both) and showing low levels of uncertainties (i.e. few cases of false-negatives and false-positives: similar to 30%) improved positive predictive values (similar to 60%) were also observed along with good negative predictive values (similar to 80%).

The temporal analysis of the 8-year time series (2002-2010) shows very different patterns of temporal variability translating the influence of the various hydrodynamic forcings occurring in this coastal system. Hydrodynamical rings formation associated with the retroflecting North Brazil current system induce strong irregular variations in the TSM loads offshore the Guiana coast. Further, strong significant 8-year interannual changes have been detected along the nearshore waters of French Guiana.

The fluorescence peak moves to longer wavelengths with the increase of chlorophyll a concentration. In this article, the fluorescence enveloped area (FEA), which integrates the fluorescence height and the fluorescence peak position, was used to estimate the chlorophyll a concentration in the coastal waters of the Pearl River Estuary. The FEA algorithm was developed from in situ data of chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended matter (TSM) concentration and above-water remote sensing reflectance, which were collected at 37 sampling stations in the Pearl River Estuary during two cruises. The results showed that the FEA algorithm made a better estimation of chlorophyll a concentration compared with the widely used FLH algorithm and moving fluorescence line height (MFLH) algorithm. These three algorithms were applied to the Pearl River Estuary for retrieval of chlorophyll a concentration from Hyperion data acquired on 21 December 2006. Compared with the FLH and the MFLH, the FEA algorithm showed a rational distribution of the chlorophyll a concentration in the Pearl River Estuary.																	0143-1161						2011	32	13					3611	3623		10.1080/01431161003762348								WOS:000293228000004

Detecting ice-sheet melt area over western Greenland using MODIS and AMSR-E data for the summer periods of 2002-2006	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												We present the results from two independent approaches for monitoring ice-sheet melt area over western Greenland. The microwave-based cross-polarization gradient ratio (XPGR) approach (Abdalati, W. and Steffen, K., 1995, Detecting ice-sheet melt area over western Greenland using MODIS and AMSR-E data for the summer periods of 2002-2006. Geophysical Research Letter, 22, pp. 787-790) is compared with a newly developed technique that exploits reflectance characteristics of snow/ice using near-infrared and visible wavelengths, to assess the extent of ice-sheet melt area over the west coast of Greenland. Data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Earth Observing Satellite (EOS) Terra are analysed through the years 2002-2006 to monitor melt area extent between May and September. Concurrently, the XPGR ratio is derived from advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) data to develop a comparative measure of melt area over the same period of investigation. Although the techniques represent fundamentally different physical approaches, good agreement is observed between these distinct melt area products. The enhanced spatial resolution that is achieved from the MODIS sensor offers additional insight into the melt response over the course of the summer melt period and highlights the advantage of synthesizing diverse sensors and retrieval algorithms for Earth observation.

Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll and Sea Surface Temperature in Indian Water with Impact of 2004 Sumatra Tsunami	MARINE GEODESY												The daily and weekly averaged Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS-P4 Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) derived chlorophyll images were generated and interpreted in terms of pretsunami, tsunami, and posttsunami periods in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. There has been observation of increase in chlorophyll concentration up to 5.0 mg/m3 in the tsunami-affected coastal waters. The high chlorophyll concentration lasted for about one week after the tsunami catastrophe. The standard deviation for different transects in the tsunami-affected water were plotted. The high chlorophyll has been observed for selected transects in the aftermath of the tsunami event in coastal regions, and offshore water has also shown increase in chlorophyll concentration (1.0 mg/m3) in the Bay of Bengal. The analysis indicated that the tsunami waves might have displaced and spread the high chlorophyll coastal water towards offshore. NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua daytime sea surface temperature (SST) daily images were retrieved and displayed during December 21, 2004, to January 6, 2005, and indicated the cooling (0.5-1 degrees C) in the Bay of Bengal around Tamil Nadu and Andhra coast. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Prediction-National Center for Environment Prediction (NOAA-NCEP) data for five weeks (December 9, 2004-January 12, 2005) were retrieved to study the SST variability trend in prior to MODIS data and indicated 0.5-1 degrees C cooling of the Bay of Bengal water off Kakinada, Chennai, Cuddalore, and Nagapattinam region on December 26 and 28, 2004.																	0149-0419						2011	34	2					152	166	PII 937663504	10.1080/01490419.2011.571561								WOS:000290668300005

Spatial heterogeneities in aerosol properties over Bay of Bengal inferred from ship-borne and MODIS observations during ICARB-W cruise campaign: Implications to radiative forcing	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Comprehensive investigations during the last decade have clearly established that aerosols have a significant impact on the climate. This paper reports the results of the spatial variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and fine mode fraction (FMF) characteristics as a function of latitude and longitude over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) during ICARB-W cruise period of 27th December 2008-30th January 2009 from onboard Sunphotometer and MODIS (Terra, Aqua) satellite measurements. Very high AOD(500) (0.7-0.8) occurred over the north head BoB adjacent to the northeastern Indian coast and the lowest AOD(500) (0.1-0.2) occurred in central BoB far away from the coasts, and in a small area in the northeastern part close to Myanmar coast as well as over NIO. The highest values (as high as 1.2) of Angstrom exponent, alpha occurring over northeast BoB (regions close to Bangladesh and Myanmar) indicate relative abundance of accumulation mode particles and very low values of alpha (below 0.7) over central part of BOB as well as southern BoB/NIO suggesting dominance of coarse-mode sea spray aerosols. Terra/Aqua MODIS AOD(550) and cruise measured AOD(500) using Sunphotometer showed good agreement (R-2 = 0.92) over the BoB. The total mass concentrations over BoB during cruise period were remarkably high, with a mean value of 28.4 +/- 5.7 mu g m(-3). Aerosol FMF was higher than 0.7 over the BoB, while FMF over NIO was about 0.5. NCEP reanalysis data on winds at 850 hPa, along with 5-days airmass back trajectories via HYSPLIT model, suggested transport of continental aerosols from the central and northern India over the BoB by the strong westerly/northwesterly winds. Regionally averaged clear sky aerosol (net) forcing over BoB during the winter is -28.9W m(-2) at the surface and -10.4 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere whereas, the ARF values estimated over NIO at TOA, surface and in the atmosphere are -6.4, -18.3 and +11.9 W m(-2), respectively.

J	Hughes, NE; Wilkinson, JP; Wadhams, P				Hughes, Nicholas E.; Wilkinson, Jeremy P.; Wadhams, Peter			Multi-satellite sensor analysis of fast-ice development in the Norske Oer Ice Barrier, northeast Greenland	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												The Norske Oer Ice Barrier (NOIB) is a region of fast ice located off the northeast coast of Greenland.. It is one of the most extensive areas of landfast ice on Earth. This paper looks at the NOIB formation during the freeze-up of late 2003 and the break-up in summer 2004. As the fast ice is immobile, it provides an ideal location for checking the consistency of classification schemes for satellite sensors. Active microwave (SAR) backscatter values from Envisat are compared with optical observations from the MODIS, multichannel passive microwave from the SSM/I and with ice-freeboard values from the Envisat RA-2. In August 2004 the underside of the NOIB was mapped by an upward-looking multibeam sonar mounted on the Autosub autonomous underwater vehicle. Statistics from sea-ice draft measurements by the multibeam are compared with neat-coincident satellite observations. Evaluating the evolution of the fast ice through multiple satellite sensors with ground truth measurements may allow future development of improved automatic classification algorithms which will be better able to track fast-ice extent. Loss of the fast ice for periods of the year has implications for the coastal environment of Greenland and may contribute to the retreat of the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier and enhanced coastal erosion.																	0260-3055	1727-5644					2011	52	57	1				151	160		10.3189/172756411795931633								WOS:000289655600020

Three-year ground based measurements of aerosol optical depth over the Eastern Mediterranean: the urban environment of Athens	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Three years (2006-2008) of ground-based observations of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in the urban environment of Athens, in the Eastern Mediterranean, are analysed in this work. Measurements were acquired with a Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer at five wavelengths. The daily average AOD at 500 nm is 0.23, and the mean Angstrom coefficient calculated between 415 and 867 nm is 1.41. The annual variability of AOD has a spring maximum dominated by coarse dust particles from the Sahara (AOD 0.34-0.42), while the diurnal pattern is typical for urban sites, with AOD steadily increasing throughout the day. The greatest contribution to the annually averaged AOD, accounting for almost 40%, comes from regional and local sources (namely the Istanbul metropolitan area, the extended areas of biomass burning around the north coast of the Black Sea, power plants spread throughout the Balkans and the industrial area in the Po valley, with average daily AOD in the range of 0.25-0.35). An additional important contribution (23%) is dust from Africa, whereas the rest of Europe contributes another 22%. The geographical distribution of the above sources in conjunction with the prevailing synoptic situation and contribution of local sources, lead to mixed types of aerosols over Athens, with highly variable contribution of fine and coarse particles to AOD in the range 10%-90%. This is the first long-term, ground based data set available for Athens, and it has also been used for the validation of satellite derived AOD by MODIS, showing good agreement on an annual basis, but with an overestimation of satellite AODs in the warm period.

Spatial distributions and seasonal cycles of aerosols in India and China seen in global climate-aerosol model	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A climate-aerosol model is employed to study spatial and temporal variability of aerosol properties over India and China for recent (year 2006) and future conditions (year 2020) under different emission pathways. We present results for aerosol mass concentration in different size classes and optical properties for the five different aerosol species treated by the model. Aerosol mass concentration and optical depth have significant contributions from both anthropogenic and natural aerosols. Different species have maxima in different regions, with the highest anthropogenic aerosol concentrations found in Kolkata and elsewhere in the Ganges basin in India and on the northern part of the east coast and in the Sichuan basin in China. In India, natural aerosols have a maximum in the summer due to higher wind speeds, whereas anthropogenic aerosols have a maximum in the winter due to less efficient wet removal. Surface concentrations also tend to be higher in winter due to the additional reason of lower average boundary layer height. In China, seasonal cycles are weaker with natural aerosols having a maximum in the spring and sulfate contribution to the aerosol optical depth (AOD) being higher in the latter half of the year. MODIS AOD spatial distributions are reproduced well by the model, except for the Ganges valley with high absorption and for the Thar desert with high dust concentrations. Seasonal cycles compare qualitatively well with MODIS measurements.

Sea surface temperature (SST) data recovered from satellite images are being used to improve the operational efficiency of fishing vessels (e. g. reduce search time and increase catch rate) and to improve the understanding of the variations in catch distribution and rate needed to properly manage fisheries. The images used for retrieval of SST often present gaps due to the existence of clouds or satellite malfunction periods. The data gaps can totally or partially affect the area of interest. Within this study, an application of a technique for the reconstruction of missing data called DINEOF (data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions) is analysed, with the aim of testing its applicability in operational SST retrieval during summer months. In this case study, the Bay of Biscay is used as the target area. Three months of SST Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, ranging from 1 May 2006 to 31 July 2006, were used. The main objective of this work is to test the overall performance of this technique, under potential operational use for the support of the fleet during the summer fishing season. The study is designed to analyse the sensitivity of the results of this technique to several details of the methodology used in the reconstruction of SST, such as the number of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) retained, the handling of the seasonal cycle or the length (number of images) of the SST database used. The results are tested against independent SST data from International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) ship reports and standing buoys and estimations of the error of the reconstructed SST fields are given. Conclusions show that over this area three months of data are enough for efficient SST reconstruction, which yields four EOFs as the optimal number needed for this case study. An extended EOF experiment with SST and SST with a lag of one day was carried out to analyse whether the autocorrelation of the SST data allows better performance in the SST reconstruction, although the experiment did not improve the results. The validation studies show that the reconstructed SSTs can be trusted, even when the amount of missing data is very high. The mean absolute deviation maps show that the error is greatest near to the coast and mainly in the upwelling areas close to the French and north-western Spanish coasts.

Characterization and transport of aerosols over the Bay of Bengal during the winter monsoon: a comparative study using in-situ and satellite measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Natural processes, such as dust storms and sea salt spray, and anthropogenic activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and biomass, introduce aerosols into the atmosphere. Their concentration, geographic distribution and particle size promote significant climatic consequences. Aerosol transport processes, from landmasses to oceans, are scarcely understood because of inadequate in-situ observations. This study reports the results of spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements using a five-channel (380, 440, 500, 675 and 870 nm) handheld MICROTOPS Sun-photometer used during a sea-truth data collection campaign conducted in the central Bay of Bengal (BOB) during the northeastern monsoon period (10 November to 13 December 2007). For the entire cruise period, the mean values of the daily average of the AODs at 500 nm and 870 nm were 0.39 +/- 0.065 and 0.22 +/- 0.047, respectively, the mean value of the Angstrom exponent (alpha) was 1.23 +/- 0.2 and the turbidity parameter (beta) was 0.183 +/- 0.044. A smaller alpha value together with a larger beta value suggests the presence of an abundance of smaller aerosol particles near the coast. An air mass back-trajectory analysis was undertaken to identify the potential source regions of the aerosols. Analysis of the results demonstrated the effect of the aerosol transport and source regions on the spectral behaviour of the AODs. In-situ measured AOD (550 nm) and alpha (550 nm, 865 nm) values were further compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived parameters. The in-situ and MODIS-derived AOD values were found to be in good agreement, with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) of 0.78 and a standard error of 0.05, while the R(2) for alpha was 0.68 with a standard error of 0.14.																	0143-1161						2011	32	5					1253	1267		10.1080/01431160903527454								WOS:000288693800003						
J	Jacquin, A; Cheret, V; Sheeren, D; Balent, G				Jacquin, Anne; Cheret, Veronique; Sheeren, David; Balent, Gerard			Determination of the fire regime in the middle of savanna in Madagascar from a MODIS time series	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												In savannah areas where fire is a predominant practice, the localization and the monitoring of burned areas are essential information to develop an accurate management system of this ecosystem. This problem is addressed through the analysis of time series of medium spatial-resolution remotely sensed images. The authors studied the savannah localized on the Marovoay watershed, on the north-west coast of Madagascar. These present the particularity of a low vegetation cover. The methodological developments proposed in this article concern more specifically two domains: the spectral signature of burned areas and the method for mapping these areas. First, a spectral analysis is undertaken to assess the capacity of six spectral indexes (NDVI, SAVI, BAI, GEMI, Albedo and Brightness Index) to discriminate burned areas. Results show that the Brightness Index is the best. Then, a method for mapping annual burned areas at the scale of the watershed is developed. It is based on the processing of a MODIS eight-day composite times series over the period 2000-2007. Analysis of the intra-annual variations of the Brightness Index leads to the definition of two spatial indicators - annual and seasonal - elaborated to localize the burned areas and to determine the period at which the fire occurs within the fire season. The ROC curves are used as a threshold tool to define the optimal value of the burned area indicator that minimizes both omission and commission errors. The validation of the MODIS burned areas maps consists of the comparison with burned areas maps produced with high spatial-resolution remotely sensed images. The quality of the results is good, with a Kappa index between 0.74 and 0.76 and a cartographic index between 76% and 79%.

Boundary Layer and Cloud Structure Controls on Tropical Low Cloud Cover Using A-Train Satellite Data and ECMWF Analyses	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), CloudSat radar, and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud data on the A-Train constellation complemented with the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses are used to investigate the cloud and boundary layer structure across a 10 degrees wide cross section starting at 5 degrees S near the international date line and extending to 35 degrees N near the California coast from March 2008 to February 2009. The mean large-scale inversion height and low-level cloud tops, which correspond very closely to each other, are very shallow (similar to 500 m) over cold SSTs and high static stability near California and deepen southwestward (to a maximum of similar to 1.5-2.0 km) along the cross section as SSTs rise. Deep convection near the ITCZ occurs at a surface temperature close to 298 K. While the boundary layer relative humidity (RH) is nearly constant where a boundary layer is well defined, it drops sharply near cloud top in stratocumulus regions, corresponding with strong thermal inversions and water vapor decrease, such that the maximum(-partial derivative RH/partial derivative z) marks the boundary layer cloud top very well. The magnitude correlates well with low cloud frequency during March-May (MAM), June-August (JJA), and September-November (SON) (r(2) = 0.85, 0.88, and 0.86, respectively). Also, CALIPSO and MODIS isolated low cloud frequency generally agree quite well, but CloudSat senses only slightly more than one-third of the low clouds as observed by the other sensors, as many clouds are shallower than 1 km and thus cannot be discerned with CloudSat due to contamination from the strong signal from surface clutter. Mean tropospheric omega between 300 and 700 hPa is examined from the ECMWF Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) analysis dataset, and during JJA and SON, strong rising motion in the middle troposphere is confined to a range of 2-m surface temperatures between 297 and 300 K, consistent with previous studies that show a narrow range of SSTs over which deep ascent occurs. During December-February (DJF), large-scale ascending motion extends to colder SSTs and high boundary layer stability. A slightly different boundary layer stability metric is derived, the difference of moist static energy (MSE) at the middle point of the inversion (or at 700 hPa if no inversion exists) and the surface, referred to as Delta MSE. The utility of Delta MSE is its prediction of isolated uniform low cloud frequency, with very high r(2) values of 0.93 and 0.88, respectively, for the MODIS and joint lidar plus radar product during JJA but significantly lower values during DJF (0.46 and 0.40), with much scatter. To quantify the importance of free tropospheric dynamics in modulating the Delta MSE-low cloud relationships, the frequency as a function of Delta MSE of rising motion profiles (omega < -0.05 Pa s(-1)) is added to the observed low cloud frequency for a maximum hypothetical low cloud frequency. Doing this greatly reduces the interseasonal differences and holds promise for using DMSE for parameterization schemes and examining low cloud feedbacks.																	0894-8755					JAN	2011	24	1					194	215		10.1175/2010JCLI3702.1								WOS:000286659600012

Generation of high-resolution East Antarctic landfast sea-ice maps from cloud-free MODIS satellite composite imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A method to generate high spatio-temporal resolution maps of landfast sea ice from cloud-free MODIS composite imagery is presented. Visible (summertime) and thermal infrared (wintertime) cloud-free 20-day MODIS composite images are used as the basis for these maps, augmented by AMSR-E ASI sea-ice concentration composite images (when MODIS composite image quality is insufficient). The success of this technique is dependent upon efficient cloud removal during the compositing process. Example wintertime maximum (-374,000 km(2)) and summertime minimum (similar to 112,000 km(2)) fast-ice maps for the entire East Antarctic coast are presented. The summertime minimum map provides the first high-resolution indication of multi-year fast-ice extent, which may be used to help assess changes in Antarctic sea-ice volume. The 2 sigma errors in fast-ice extent are estimated to be +/- 2.98% when >= 90% of the fast-ice pixels in a 20-day period are classified using the MODIS composite, or +/-8.76 otherwise (when augmenting AMSR-E or the previous/next MODIS composite image is used to classify >10% of the fast ice). Imperfect composite image quality, caused by persistent cloud, inaccurate cloud masking or a highly dynamic fast-ice edge, was the biggest impediment to automating the fast-ice detection procedure.

Assessing hurricane-induced tree mortality in U.S. Gulf Coast forest ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Tropical cyclones disturb forest ecosystems and have the potential to alter forest structure and species composition as well as ecosystem functions including rates of nutrient cycling and biomass accumulation. Quantifying these forest disturbances is necessary to evaluate the extent and severity of damage for estimating biomass loss, developing regional carbon budgets, and making management decisions following hurricanes. In this study, we quantified forest disturbance (downed and dead and snapped trees) produced by hurricanes using a relationship between field-measured tree mortality and Landsat data that can be broadly applied to Gulf Coast forest ecosystems impacted by hurricanes. Field-measured tree mortality data was collected in Gulf Coast forests at 60 inventory plots established to monitor forest disturbance produced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit the region in 2005, and Hurricane Gustav, which hit the region in 2008. Large-scale disturbance estimates were obtained by regressing Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data that in turn were associated with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from the U. S. Forest Service. The use of the general relationship produced a biomass loss from dead trees of 43.9 +/- 8.4 Tg C for Hurricane Katrina and 37.9 +/- 6.4 Tg C for Hurricane Rita, which are near the upper limit of the expected values reported in our previous studies across a number of different forest types. Our results provide an important contribution for reliable assessments of large-scale disturbance produced by hurricanes in forest ecosystems. Improving our ability to accurately assess the impacts of hurricanes on forests and on terrestrial carbon cycles is particularly important given that climate projections suggest that hurricane intensity is likely to increase.

Multi-Scale Sensor Fusion With an Online Application: Integrating GOES, MODIS, and Webcam Imagery for Environmental Monitoring	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Webcam and satellite imagery are integral sensor web components, but there are few websites that directly synthesize these products. Additionally, websites as a means for reviewing multiple images in an organized way and for analyzing time-series imagery have not been fully explored. This paper describes howweb applications can facilitate review of image archives for multi-scale sensor data fusion, with a test case of an automatic panning camera at the highest peak on Santa Cruz Island (in Channel Islands National Park off the Santa Barbara, CA coast) and MODIS and GOES-11 satellite imagery. We developed the application PanOpt (http://zulu.geog.ucsb.edu/panopt/index.html) for filtering this image database and outputting selected images as a static matrix or as an animation. On-demand product generation includes time-series charts and scatter plots of image metrics for regions of interest, with data markers linked to views of corresponding satellite and camera imagery via event-based web scripting. This is useful not only for exploratory analysis but is well suited for pedagogical applications and imparting a greater synoptic understanding of environmental phenomena. Demonstration of this website's utility includes multi-modal characterization of clouds as well as ground-and satellite-based plant phenology time-series. With this tool, the quantitative and qualitative aspects of image exploration are synergistic, making it easier to discern underlying trends and anomalies and to identify directions for further analysis.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2010	3	4	1				497	506		10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2048419								WOS:000285358700011

In this study, field measurements were applied to develop ocean color satellite algorithms of phytoplankton pigments from in-water radiometry measurements. The match-up comparisons showed that the satellite-derived pigments from our algorithms agree reasonably well (e.g. 30-55% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 37-50% for MODIS-Aqua) to field data, with better agreement (e.g. 30-38% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 39-44% for MODIS-Aqua) for pigments abundant in diatoms. The seasonal and spatial variations of satellite-derived phytoplankton biomarker pigments, such as fucoxanthin, which is abundant in diatoms, peridinin, which is found only in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, and zeaxanthin, which is primarily from cyanobacteria in coastal waters, revealed that higher densities of diatoms are more likely to occur on the inner shelf and during winter-spring and obscure other abundant phytoplankton groups. However, relatively higher densities of other phytoplankton, such as dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, are likely to occur on the mid- to outer-continental shelf and during summer. Seasonal variation of riverine discharge may play an important role in stimulating algal blooms, in particular diatoms, while higher abundances of cyanobacteria coincide with warmer water temperatures and lower nutrient concentrations.

We compare Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based albedo retrievals to data from the Greenland Climate Network (GCN) weather stations and the floating ice station Tara for polar summer 2007. The AVHRR dataset consists of 2755 overpasses. The overpasses are matched to in situ observations spatially and temporally. The SAL algorithm presented here derives the surface broadband albedo from AVHRR channels 1 and 2 using an atmospheric correction, temporal sampling of an empirical Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), and a narrow-to-broadband conversion algorithm. The satellite product contains algorithms for snow, sea ice, vegetation, bare soil, and water albedo. At the Summit and DYE-2 stations on the Greenland ice sheet, instantaneous SAL RMSE is 0.073. The heterogeneous surface conditions at satellite pixel scale over the stations near the Greenland west coast increase RMSE to >0.12. Over Tara, the instantaneous SAL RMSE is 0.069. The BRDF sampling approach reduces RMSE over the ice sheet to 0.053, and to 0.045 over Tara. Taking into account various sources of uncertainty for both satellite retrievals and in situ observations, we conclude that SAL agrees with in situ observations within their limits of accuracy and spatial representativeness.

A Simple Technique for Creating Regional Composites of Sea Surface Temperature from MODIS for Use in Operational Mesoscale NWP	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This paper describes a simple technique for creating regional, high-resolution, daytime and nighttime composites of sea surface temperature (SST) for use in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP). The composites are based on observations from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua and Terra. The data used typically are available nearly in real time, are applicable anywhere on the globe, and are capable of roughly representing the diurnal cycle in SST. The composites' resolution is much higher than that of many other standard SST products used for operational NWP, including the low-and high-resolution Real-Time Global (RTG) analyses. The difference in resolution is key because several studies have shown that highly resolved SSTs are important for driving the air-sea interactions that shape patterns of static stability, vertical and horizontal wind shear, and divergence in the planetary boundary layer. The MODIS-based composites are compared to in situ observations from buoys and other platforms operated by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) off the coasts of New England, the mid-Atlantic, and Florida. Mean differences, mean absolute differences, and root-mean-square differences between the composites and the NDBC observations are all within tenths of a degree of those calculated between RTG analyses and the NDBC observations. This is true whether or not one accounts for the mean offset between the skin temperatures of the MODIS dataset and the bulk temperatures of the NDBC observations and RTG analyses. Near the coast, the MODIS-based composites tend to agree more with NDBC observations than do the RTG analyses. The opposite is true away from the coast. All of these differences in point-wise comparisons among the SST datasets are small compared to the +/- 1.0 degrees C accuracy of the NDBC SST sensors. Because skin-temperature variations from land to water so strongly affect the development and life cycle of the sea breeze, this phenomenon was chosen for demonstrating the use of the MODIS-based composite in an NWP model. A simulated sea breeze in the vicinity of New York City and Long Island shows a small, net, but far from universal improvement when MODIS-based composites are used in place of RTG analyses. The timing of the sea breeze's arrival is more accurate at some stations, and the near-surface temperature, wind, and humidity within the breeze are more realistic.

ARCTAS Sci Team	Pollution influences on atmospheric composition and chemistry at high northern latitudes: Boreal and California forest fire emissions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												We analyze detailed atmospheric gas/aerosol composition data acquired during the 2008 NASA ARCTAS (Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites) airborne campaign performed at high northern latitudes in spring (ARCTAS-A) and summer (ARCTAS-B) and in California in summer (ARCTAS-CARB). Biomass burning influences were widespread throughout the ARCTAS campaign. MODIS data from 2000 to 2009 indicated that 2008 had the second largest fire counts over Siberia and a more normal Canadian boreal forest fire season. Near surface arctic air in spring contained strong anthropogenic signatures indicated by high sulfate. In both spring and summer most of the pollution plumes transported to the Arctic region were from Europe and Asia and were present in the mid to upper troposphere and contained a mix of forest fire and urban influences. The gas/aerosol composition of the high latitude troposphere was strongly perturbed at all altitudes in both spring and summer. The reactive nitrogen budget was balanced with PAN as the dominant component. Mean ozone concentrations in the high latitude troposphere were only minimally perturbed (<5 ppb), although many individual pollution plumes sampled in the mid to upper troposphere, and mixed with urban influences, contained elevated ozone (Delta O-3/Delta CO = 0.11 +/- 0.09 v/v). Emission and optical characteristics of boreal and California wild fires were quantified and found to be broadly comparable. Greenhouse gas emission estimates derived from ARCTAS-CARB data for the South Coast Air Basin of California show good agreement with state inventories for CO2 and N2O but indicate substantially larger emissions of CH4. Simulations by multiple models of transport and chemistry were found to be broadly consistent with observations with a tendency towards under prediction at high latitudes.

J	He, L; Li, Y; Zhou, H; Yuan, DL				He, Lei; Li, Yao; Zhou, Hui; Yuan, Dongliang			Variability of Cross-shelf Penetrating Fronts in the East China Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Images of 8-day mean chlorophyll-a concentrations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard of Aqua Satellite from 2002 to 2007 and of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite from 1998 to 2007 are used to study the variability of the cross-shelf penetrating fronts (CPFs) in the East China Sea. The analysis suggests that the generation of the CPFs has strong seasonal-to-interannual variations, with more CPFs in summer and winter than in spring and fall. Each CPF lasts for a few days to a month. The majority of the fronts are triangle-shaped with their broad bases nearby the coast and their sharp heads penetrating into the middle shelf. There are over 40 CPFs with penetrating distances exceeding 100 km over the East China Sea during the past 10 years of the satellite era, with the maximum ones reaching the Kuroshio at the edge of the continental shelf. Of all the low cloud scenes of the satellite images, more than 25% contain at least one CPF. The high-frequency occurrence of the CPFs suggests that the CPFs play an important role in cross-shelf transport of heat, effluent, and land-derived materials in the East China Sea. The generation of the CPF is found to be influenced by winds and by intrinsic oceanic variability. In particular, the collision of wind-forced coastal jet with the Taiwan Warm Current is suggested as one of the mechanisms that generate the CPFs in the East China Sea. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These algorithms are: (i) Aiken's, (ii) Clark-3-bands, (iii) Gordon and (iv) Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI) algorithm. The results show that the Aiken's algorithm is appropriate for accurately synoptic chlorophyll mapping distribution. In fact, the algorithm performs the lowest root mean square error of +/-0.10 mg/m(3) as compared to other algorithms. In conclusion, MODIS data can be used as a computing tool for accurately mapping chlorophyll concentration along the coastal water of Malaysia with the implementation of Aiken's algorithm.

Inherent optical properties (IOPs) are retrieved by match-up radiometric data and multi-band quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA). By comparing in situ spectra-retrieved IOPs with the satellite ones of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS), the accuracy of satellite-derived IOPs is quantified. The median of the absolute percentage difference is found to be approximately 20% for the total absorption coefficient a(t)(lambda) at green and blue-green bands, and 30% for particulate material backscattering coefficient b(bp)(lambda) throughout the visible bands. The spatial pattern and temporal variability of IOPs along the eastern coast of China are clarified based on satellite images and the QAA model.																	1671-7694					AUG 10	2010	8	8					721	725		10.3788/COL20100808.0721								WOS:000280900900001						
J	Yoon, SC; Kim, SW; Choi, SJ; Choi, IJ				Yoon, Soon-Chang; Kim, Sang-Woo; Choi, Suk-Jin; Choi, In-Jin			Regional-scale relationships between aerosol and summer monsoon circulation, and precipitation over northeast Asia	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												We investigated the regional-scale relationships between columnar aerosol loads and summer monsoon circulation, and also the precipitation over northeast Asia using aerosol optical depth (AOD) data obtained from the 8-year MODIS, AERONET Sun/sky radiometer, and precipitation data acquired under the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). These high-quality data revealed the regional-scale link between AOD and summer monsoon circulation, precipitation in July over northeast Asian countries, and their distinct spatial and annual variabilities. Compared to the mean AOD for the entire period of 2001-2008, the increase of almost 40-50% in the AOD value in July 2005 and July 2007 was found over the downwind regions of China (Yellow Sea, Korean peninsula, and East Sea), with negative precipitation anomalies. This can be attributable to the strong westerly confluent flows, between cyclone flows by continental thermal low centered over the northern China and anticyclonic flows by the western North Pacific High, which transport anthropogenic pollution aerosols emitted from east China to aforementioned downwind high AOD regions along the rim of the Pacific marine airmass. In July 2002, however, the easterly flows transported anthropogenic aerosols from east China to the southwestern part of China in July 2002. As a result, the AOD off the coast of China was dramatically reduced in spite of decreasing rainfall. From the calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient between MODIS-derived AOD anomalies and GPCP precipitation anomalies in July over the period 2001-2008, we found negative correlations over the areas encompassed by 105-115A degrees E and 30-35A degrees N and by 120-140A degrees E and 35-40A degrees N (Yellow Sea, Korean peninsula, and East Sea). This suggests that aerosol loads over these regions are easily influenced by the Asian monsoon flow system and associated precipitation.																	1976-7633					AUG	2010	46	3					279	286		10.1007/s13143-010-1002-3								WOS:000281318100005

It is the sole freshwater source for human users and ecosystems. The region hosts internationally important groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in the 5280 km(2) Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. The GDEs are threatened by increasing groundwater abstractions and risks of pollution. Hydrogeological exploration work is needed as basis for sound groundwater management. A multidisciplinary approach was used to study this data-scarce region. Geochemical data and phreatic surface measurements showed distinct hydrogeological units in the groundwater catchment of Sian Ka'an. The hilly southwestern areas had a low hydraulic permeability, likely caused by a geology containing gypsum, whereas the transition zone and flat areas in the east and north had a high permeability. In the latter areas, the fresh groundwater could be described by a Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg lens. Geophysical borehole logging and time-domain electromagnetic soundings identified a shallow, low-resistive and high-gamma-radiation layer present throughout the hilly area and transition zone. Its thickness was 3-8 m, apparent conductivity was 200-800 mS/m and natural gamma-radiation about 80 counts pr. second. The layer is proposed to be ejecta from the Chicxulub impact (Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary). Spatial estimates of recharge were calculated from MODIS imagery using the 'triangle method'. Average recharge constituted 17% of mean annual precipitation in the study area. Recharge was greatest in the hilly area and towards Valladolid. Near the coast, average actual evapotranspiration exceeded annual precipitation. The multidisciplinary approach used in this study is applicable to other catchment-scale studies.

Carboxylic acids, sulfates, and organosulfates in processed continental organic aerosol over the southeast Pacific Ocean during VOCALS-REx 2008	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Submicron particles were collected on board the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown during the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REx) in the southeast Pacific marine boundary layer in October and November 2008. The aerosol in this region was characterized by low numbers of particles (150-700 cm(-3)) that were dominated by sulfate ions at concentrations of 0.9 +/- 0.7 mu g m(-3) and organic mass at 0.6 +/- 0.4 mu g m(-3), with no measurable nitrate and low ammonium ion concentrations. Measurements of submicron organic aerosol functional groups and trace elements show that continental outflow of anthropogenic emissions is the dominant source of organic mass (OM) to the southeast Pacific with an additional, smaller contribution of organic mass from primary marine sources. This continental source is supported by a correlation between OM and radon. Saturated aliphatic C-CH (alkane) composed 41 +/- 27% of OM. Carboxylic acid COOH (32 +/- 23% of OM) was observed in single particles internally mixed with ketonic carbonyl, carbonate, and potassium. Organosulfate COSO3 (4 +/- 8% of OM) was observed only during the periods of highest organic and sulfate concentrations and lowest ammonium concentrations, consistent with a sulfuric acid epoxide hydrolysis for proposed surrogate compounds (e. g., isoprene oxidation products) or reactive glyoxal uptake mechanisms from laboratory studies. This correlation suggests that in high-sulfate, low-ammonium conditions, the formation of organosulfate compounds in the atmosphere contributes a significant fraction of aerosol OM (up to 13% in continental air masses). Organic hydroxyl C-OH composed 20 +/- 12% of OM and up to 50% of remote marine OM and was inversely correlated with radon indicating a marine source. A two-factor solution of positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis resulted in one factor dominated by organic hydroxyl (>70% by mass) and one factor dominated by saturated aliphatic C-CH (alkane) and carboxylic acid (together, 90% by mass), identified as the marine and combustion factors, respectively. Measurements of particle concentrations in the study region compared with concentrations estimated from MODIS aerosol optical depth indicate that continental outflow results in MBL particle concentrations elevated up to 2 times the background level (less than 300 cm(-3)) away from shore and up to 10 times the background level at the coast. The presence of both coastal fossil fuel combustion and marine sources of oxygenated organic aerosol results in little change in the oxygenated fraction and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) along the outflow of the region's dominant organic particle source.

J	Sun, L; Guo, MH; Wang, XM				Sun Ling; Guo Maohua; Wang Xiaomei			Ocean color products retrieval and validation around China coast with MODIS	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Waters along China coast are very turbid with high concentrations of suspended sediment nearly all the time, especially at the Hangzhou Bay, the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Estuary and the shoal along Jiangsu Province. In these turbid and optically complex waters, the standard MODIS ocean color products tend to have invalid values. Because the water-leaving radiances in the near-infrared (NIR) are significant resulting from the strong scattering of suspended particles, the standard MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm often gets no results or produces significant errors. And because of the complex water optical properties, the OC3 model used in the standard MODIS data processing tends to get extremely high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. In this paper, we present an atmospheric correction approach using MODIS short wave infrared (SWIR) bands based on the fact that water-leaving radiances are negligible in the SWIR region because of the extreme strong absorption of water even in turbid waters. A regional Chl-a concentration estimation model is also constructed for MODIS from in situ data. These algorithms are applied to MODIS Aqua data processing in the China coastal regions. In situ data collected in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea in spring and autumn, 2003 are used to validate the performance. Reasonably good results have been obtained. It is noted that water-leaving reflectance in the NIR bands are significant in waters along the China coast with high sediment loadings. The satellite derived and in-situ reflectance spectra can match in the turbid waters along China coast, and there is relatively good linear relationship between satellite derived and in-situ reflectance. The RMSE value of Rrs(lambda) is 0.0031 sr(-1) for all the nine ocean color bands (412 to 869 nm). The satellite-derived Chl-a value is in the reasonable range and the root mean square percentage difference is 46.1%.																	0253-505X					JUL	2010	29	4					21	27		10.1007/s13131-010-0047-6								WOS:000282285900004

Since then, it has spread along the Galician coasts and towards the western Cantrabrian coast, probably supported by new introductions related to aquaculture and private yachts. Despite the high potential of this seaweed to invade new areas, it has not fully established itself in specific areas along the eastern Cantabrian coast where it has been farmed. We attempted to identify the macro-environmental determinants for the successful establishment of U. pinnatifida in the northern Iberian coast. Thus, we built a model based on the significant relationships between this kelp and several environmental factors using the Favourability Function, a method based on binary logistic regression. We obtained a statistically significant Favourability model where the chlorophyll concentration in summer was the most influential variable and the photosynthetically active radiation in spring was a secondary variable that best characterized the presence of U. pinnatifida. The ecological implications are discussed.

A Hybrid Scheme was introduced that sequentially applies the optimized versions of two pre-existing satellite-based algorithms: an Empirical Approach (using water-leaving radiance as a function of chlorophyll concentration) and a Bio-optical Technique (using particulate backscatter along with chlorophyll concentration). The long-term evaluation of the new multi-algorithm method was performed using a multi-year MODIS dataset (2002-2006; during the boreal Summer-Fall periods - July-December) along the Central West Florida Shelf between 25.75 degrees N and 28.25 degrees N. Algorithm validation was done with in situ measurements of the abundances of K. brevis: cell counts >= 1.5 x 10(4) cells I-1 defined a detectable HAB. Encouraging statistical results were derived when either or both algorithms correctly flagged known samples. The majority of the valid match-ups were correctly identified (similar to 80% of both HABs and non-blooming conditions) and few false negatives or false positives were produced (similar to 20% of each). Additionally, most of the HAB-positive identifications in the satellite data were indeed HAB samples (positive predictive value: similar to 70%) and those classified as HAB-negative were almost all non-bloom cases (negative predictive value: similar to 86%). These results demonstrate an excellent detection capability, on average similar to 10% more accurate than the individual algorithms used separately. Thus, the new Hybrid Scheme could become a powerful tool for environmental monitoring of K. brevis blooms, with valuable consequences including leading to the more rapid and efficient use of ships to make in situ measurements of HABs.

An Aerosol-Dipole Event Over the Tropical Indian Ocean During 2006	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Using aerosol optical depth (AOD at 550 nm) from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer, surface winds, outgoing long-wave radiation from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis, and rainfall from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data sets, we report a dipolelike variability in the aerosol concentration over the region (40 degrees E-130 degrees E; 10 degrees S-10 degrees N) during September, October, and November 2006. Positive AOD anomalies (+0.4 to +0.6) (relative to the 2000-2008 climatological average) along the equatorial East Indian Ocean and Indonesia and negative AOD anomalies (-0.2 to -0.4) over the western, northwestern, and central Indian Ocean characterize an aerosol-dipolelike variability. This east-west variability of the aerosol loading along the Indian Ocean is linked to the anomalously weak easterlies associated with the 2006 Indian Ocean Dipole event. The weaker easterlies lead to the hovering of the aerosol plume over Indonesia/Sumatra coast (98 degrees E), enhancing the positive anomalies of AODs, while excessive rainfall over the central Arabian Sea caused the negative AOD anomalies.																	1545-598X					APR	2010	7	2					291	295		10.1109/LGRS.2009.2033947								WOS:000276683000014

Tides, river inflow, wind, and heat exchanges were used to drive the three-dimensional baroclinic model. Tide propagation in the northern Gulf and seasonality in the sediment plume advection from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers into the GOM were well represented in the model. The similarity between the model's results and the sediment plume as seen in MODIS satellite images and the salinity structure as observed in previous studies is demonstrated. This qualitatively valid model is used for initial guidance in design of new Mississippi River (MR) diversions by studying the effects of five conceptual MR diversions on the fate of its suspended fine material. The diversions were positioned halfway between Port Sulphur and Venice, southeast Louisiana The scenario transporting 70% of the MR to the west and 30% to the east of the delta presents the best configuration in terms of retention of sediment within the continental shelf. This configuration redirects the main sediment and freshwater flow from the river to the nearshore and the upper continental shelf with the least losses to deeper GOM waters. Given the local dominant westward wind regime, increased discharges diverted to the east will increase the amount of sediment that travels west around the MR birdfoot delta and over the Mississippi Canyon, with a higher chance of being lost to deeper waters.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2010	26	2					212	229		10.2112/08-1072.1								WOS:000276328400003

The maxima of chlorophyll-a concentrations at the river mouth is much higher for the Himalayan and north India rivers (Gangs, Subernarekha, Mahanadi, and Indus) (10-14 mg/m(3)) compared to rivers in the southern ;parts of India (Kaveri and Penner) (similar to 4 mg/m(3)). The maxima of calcite concentration (similar to 45 moles/m(3)), chlorophyll (similar to 14 mg/m(3)), and sediment concentrations (similar to 9 g/m(3)) near river mouth are found to be influenced by river discharges (Gangs and Brahmaputra) during the monsoon season. The calcite concentration (similar to 45 moles/m(3)) at the mouth of Ganga river shows a major peak with the onset of monsoon season (June-July) followed by a maxima in chlorophyll-a with a time lag of 1-2 months. The Krishna, Kaveri, and Penner rivers show low chlorophyll concentrations (3-8 mg/m(3)), high calcite (0-40 moles/m(3)), and low SSC (<3 g/m(3)) compared to Narmada and Tapti rivers (chlorophyll-a 12-14 mg/m(3), calcite 0-2 moles/m(3), and SSC 13-19 g/m(3)). The Indus river shows similar behavior (maxima of chlorophyll similar to 13 mg/m(3) and SSC similar to 8 g/m(3)) with respect to Ganga river except for high calcite concentration during winter months (similar to 25 moles/m(3)). The characteristics of the chlorophyll, calcite, and SSC at the mouth of these rivers show spatial and temporal variability along the eastern and westerns coasts of India which are found to differ widely. A comparison of the chlorophyll concentrations using OCM and MODIS data shows low chlorophyll concentrations in the Bay of Bengal as compared to the Arabian Sea. (C) 2009 COSPAR.

Broad-scale distribution patterns of sardine and their predators in relation to remotely sensed environmental conditions during the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The annual movement of South African sardine Sardinops sagax up the east coast of South Africa, known as the 'sardine run', was investigated using data from aerial surveys for the period 1988-2005 and compared with remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a data. Sardine sighting rates were highest within the Waterfall Bluff Bight off the Eastern Cape Coast, where conditions appeared to be most favourable. Sardine and predator sightings decreased significantly northwards of Mdoni on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast, whereas the proportion of nearshore sightings increased. The causal mechanism for this inshore concentration is suggested to be the influx of warm Agulhas Current water from the Durban Eddy that forces sardine shoreward. Cape gannet Morus capensis, common dolphin Delphinus capensis and sardine distributions were associated, and there was an association between SST and sardine and predator distributions. There was a marked increase in bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus sightings upon commencement of the sardine run, with these dolphins being considered to be a 'migratory' stock that enters KZN waters every winter.

Subseasonal variability of low cloud radiative properties over the southeast Pacific Ocean	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Subseasonal variability of cloud radiative properties in the persistent southeast Pacific stratocumulus deck is investigated using MODIS satellite observations and NCEP reanalysis data. A once-daily albedo proxy is derived based on the fractional coverage of low cloud (a macrophysical field) and the cloud albedo, with the latter broken down into contributions from microphysics (cloud droplet concentration) and macrophysics (liquid water path). Subseasonal albedo variability is dominated by the contribution of low cloud fraction variability, except within 10-15 degrees of the South American coast, where cloud albedo variability contributes significantly. Covariance between cloud fraction and cloud albedo also contributes significantly and positively to the variance in albedo, which highlights how complex and inseparable the factors controlling albedo are. Droplet concentration variability contributes only weakly to the subseasonal variability of albedo, which emphasizes that attributing albedo variability to the indirect effects of aerosols against the backdrop of natural meteorological variability is extremely challenging. The dominant large scale meteorological variability is associated with the subtropical high pressure system. Two indices representing changes in the subtropical high strength and extent explain 80-90% of this variability, and significantly modulate the cloud microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative cloud properties. Variations in droplet concentration of up to 50% of the mean are associated with the meteorological driving. We hypothesize that these fluctuations in droplet concentration are a result of the large scale meteorology and their correlation with cloud macrophysical properties should not be used as evidence of aerosol effects. Mechanisms by which large scale meteorology affects cloud properties are explored. Our results support existing hypotheses linking cloud cover variability to changes in cold advection, subsidence, and lower tropospheric stability. Within 10 degrees of the coast interactions between variability in the surface high pressure system and the orography appear to modulate both cloud macrophysical properties and aerosol transport through suppression of the marine boundary layer depth near the coast. This suggests one possible way in which cloud macrophysical properties and droplet concentration may be correlated independently of the second aerosol indirect effect. The results provide variability constraints for models that strive to represent both meteorological and aerosol impacts on stratocumulus clouds.

The PreVOCA experiment: modeling the lower troposphere in the Southeast Pacific	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Preliminary VOCALS Model Assessment (PreVOCA) aims to assess contemporary atmospheric modeling of the subtropical South East Pacific, with a particular focus on the clouds and the marine boundary layer (MBL). Models results from fourteen modeling centers were collected including operational forecast models, regional models, and global climate models for the month of October 2006. Forecast models and global climate models produced daily forecasts, while most regional models were run continuously during the study period, initialized and forced at the boundaries with global model analyses. Results are compared in the region from 40 degrees S to the equator and from 110 degrees W to 70 degrees W, corresponding to the Pacific coast of South America. Mean-monthly model surface winds agree well with QuikSCAT observed winds and models agree fairly well on mean weak large-scale subsidence in the region next to the coast. However they have greatly differing geographic patterns of mean cloud fraction with only a few models agreeing well with MODIS observations. Most models also underestimate the MBL depth by several hundred meters in the eastern part of the study region. The diurnal cycle of liquid water path is underestimated by most models at the 85 degrees W 20 degrees S stratus buoy site compared with satellite, consistent with previous modeling studies. The low cloud fraction is also underestimated during all parts of the diurnal cycle compared to surface-based climatologies. Most models qualitatively capture the MBL deepening around 15 October 2006 at the stratus buoy, associated with colder air at 700 hPa.

Bachelor Observatory	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Nitrogen oxide (NOx=NO+NO2) observations were made at the Mt. Bachelor Observatory in central Oregon, USA (MBO; 2.73 km above sea level) during one autumn and three springtime (15 April-20 May) periods. This is the first study to discuss interannual variability in NOx for this region. NOx concentrations (mean +/- 1 sigma) for spring 2007, 2008 and 2009 were 119 +/- 65, 117 +/- 65, and 91 +/- 54 pptv, respectively. The difference in mean mixing ratios between 2007 and 2008 is not statistically significant, whereas the difference between these years and 2009 is significant (p < 0.01). We attribute the decline in NOx from 2007-2008 to 2009 to changes in free tropospheric synoptic conditions over the Northeast Pacific and trans-Pacific transport pathways during spring 2009. In 2009, there were: (1) higher geopotential heights over the Gulf of Alaska, (2) warmer temperatures over the Aleutian Islands/Gulf of Alaska and (3) much weaker winds throughout the North Pacific. During the autumn 2008 campaign, NOx concentrations (mean +/- 1 sigma) were 175 +/- 548 pptv. The highly non-normal distribution of data (skewness coefficient of 19.1 vs. 2.5, 2.8 and 2.4 in spring 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively) resulted from periods of very high NOx levels. Using MODIS Rapid Response (Aqua and Terra) results, we show that during autumn our site can be heavily influenced by wildfires in western North America. This is in contrast to springtime, when the smaller positive (i.e., right) tail of the NOx distribution is driven largely by Asian long-range transport (ALRT) events. We developed a novel means of segregating boundary layer (BL)-influenced vs. free tropospheric (FT) air. During spring 2008 we collected "chairlift soundings" of temperature, relative humidity and pressure in an effort to better understand the diurnal pattern of a BL influence at our summit station. Results from this experiment revealed that, on average, a BL influence begins around 10: 00 PDT (UTC - 07: 00 h) in spring. Using this information to isolate FT air, we characterize probable pollution sources and synoptic conditions for the top 20 FT NOx events over three spring campaigns. Half (n = 10) of these 20 events were determined to be "Imported" events characterized by anomalously: (1) high geopotential heights off the west coast of North America, (2) warm temperatures stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Baja California, and (3) strong southwesterly winds in the Asian outflow region. Five events exhibited an influence from the North American continent. These events are characterized by very strong cyclonic behavior off the northwestern USA coast.

J	Painemal, D; Zuidema, P				Painemal, D.; Zuidema, P.			Microphysical variability in southeast Pacific Stratocumulus clouds: synoptic conditions and radiative response	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Synoptic and satellite-derived cloud property variations for the southeast Pacific stratocumulus region associated with changes in coastal satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentrations (N-d) are explored. MAX and MIN N-d composites are defined by the top and bottom terciles of daily area-mean N-d values over the Arica Bight, the region with the largest mean oceanic N-d, for the five October months of 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The ability of the satellite retrievals to capture composite differences is assessed with ship-based data. N-d and ship-based accumulation mode aerosol concentrations (N-a) correlate well (r = 0.65), with a best-fit aerosol activation value dlnN(d)/dlnN(a) of 0.56 for pixels with N-d > 50 cm(-3). The adiabatically-derived MODIS cloud depths also correlate well with the ship-based cloud depths (r = 0.7), though are consistently higher (mean bias of almost 60 m). The MAX-N-d composite is characterized by a weaker subtropical anticyclone and weaker winds both at the surface and the lower free troposphere than the MIN-N-d composite. The MAX-N-d composite clouds over the Arica Bight are thinner than the MIN-N-d composite clouds, have lower cloud tops, lower near-coastal cloud albedos, and occur below warmer and drier free tropospheres (as deduced from radiosondes and NCEP Reanalysis). CloudSat radar reflectivities indicate little near-coastal precipitation. The co-occurrence of more boundary-layer aerosol/higher N-d within a more stable atmosphere suggests a boundary layer source for the aerosol, rather than the free troposphere. The MAX-N-d composite cloud thinning extends offshore to 80 degrees W, with lower cloud top heights out to 95 degrees W. At 85 degrees W, the top-of-atmosphere shortwave fluxes are significantly higher (similar to 50%) for the MAX-N-d composite, with thicker, lower clouds and higher cloud fractions than for the MIN-N-d composite. The change in N-d at this location is small (though positive), suggesting that the MAX-MIN N-d composite differences in radiative properties primarily reflects synoptic changes. Circulation anomalies and a one-point spatial correlation map reveal a weakening of the 850 hPa southerly winds decreases the free tropospheric cold temperature advection. The resulting increase in the static stability along 85 degrees W is highly correlated to the increased cloud fraction, despite accompanying weaker free tropospheric subsidence.

A comparison of ship and satellite measurements of cloud properties with global climate model simulations in the southeast Pacific stratus deck	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Here, liquid water path (LWP), cloud fraction, cloud top height, and cloud base height retrieved by a suite of A-train satellite instruments (the CPR aboard CloudSat, CALIOP aboard CALIPSO, and MODIS aboard Aqua) are compared to ship observations from research cruises made in 2001 and 2003-2007 into the stratus/stratocumulus deck over the southeast Pacific Ocean. It is found that CloudSat radar-only LWP is generally too high over this region and the CloudSat/CALIPSO cloud bases are too low. This results in a relationship (LWP similar to h(9)) between CloudSat LWP and CALIPSO cloud thickness (h) that is very different from the adiabatic relationship (LWP similar to h(2)) from in situ observations. Such biases can be reduced if LWPs suspected to be contaminated by precipitation are eliminated, as determined by the maximum radar reflectivity Z(max)>-15 dBZ in the apparent lower half of the cloud, and if cloud bases are determined based upon the adiabatically-determined cloud thickness (h similar to LWP(1/2)). Furthermore, comparing results from a global model (CAM3.1) to ship observations reveals that, while the simulated LWP is quite reasonable, the model cloud is too thick and too low, allowing the model to have LWPs that are almost independent of h. This model can also obtain a reasonable diurnal cycle in LWP and cloud fraction at a location roughly in the centre of this region (20 degrees S, 85 degrees W) but has an opposite diurnal cycle to those observed aboard ship at a location closer to the coast (20 degrees S, 75 degrees W). The diurnal cycle at the latter location is slightly improved in the newest version of the model (CAM4). However, the simulated clouds remain too thick and too low, as cloud bases are usually at or near the surface.

Impacts of transported background ozone on California air quality during the ARCTAS-CARB period - a multi-scale modeling study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Multi-scale tracer and full-chemistry simulations with the STEM atmospheric chemistry model are used to analyze the effects of transported background ozone (O-3) from the eastern Pacific on California air quality during the ARCTAS-CARB experiment conducted in June, 2008. Previous work has focused on the importance of long-range transport of O-3 to North America air quality in springtime. However during this summer experiment the long-range transport of O-3 is also shown to be important. Simulated and observed O-3 transport patterns from the coast to inland northern California are shown to vary based on meteorological conditions and the O-3 profiles over the oceans, which are strongly episodically affected by Asian inflows. Analysis of the correlations of O-3 at various altitudes above the coastal site at Trinidad Head and at a downwind surface site in northern California, show that under long-range transport events, high O-3 air-masses (O-3>60 ppb) at altitudes between about 2 and 4 km can be transported inland and can significantly influence surface O-3 20-30 h later. These results show the importance of characterizing the vertical structure of the lateral boundary conditions (LBC) needed in air quality simulations. The importance of the LBC on O-3 prediction during this period is further studied through a series of sensitivity studies using different forms of LBC. It is shown that the use of the LBC downscaled from RAQMS global model that assimilated MLS and OMI data improves the model performance. We also show that the predictions can be further improved through the use of LBC based on NASA DC-8 airborne observations during the ARCTAS-CARB experiment. These results indicate the need to develop observational strategies to provide information on the three-dimensional nature of pollutant distributions, in order to improve our capability to predict pollution levels and to better quantify the influence of these Asian inflows on the US west coast air quality.

A combined observational and modeling approach to study modern dust transport from the Patagonia desert to East Antarctica	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The understanding of present atmospheric transport processes from Southern Hemisphere (SH) landmasses to Antarctica can improve the interpretation of stratigraphic data in Antarctic ice cores. In addition, long range transport can deliver key nutrients normally not available to marine ecosystems in the Southern Ocean and may trigger or enhance primary productivity. However, there is a dearth of observational based studies of dust transport in the SH. This work aims to improve current understanding of dust transport in the SH by showing a characterization of two dust events originating in the Patagonia desert (south end of South America). The approach is based on a combined and complementary use of satellite retrievals (detectors MISR, MODIS, GLAS, POLDER, OMI), transport model simulation (HYSPLIT) and surface observations near the sources and aerosol measurements in Antarctica (Neumayer and Concordia sites). Satellite imagery and visibility observations confirm dust emission in a stretch of dry lakes along the coast of the Tierra del Fuego (TdF) island (similar to 54A degrees S) and from the shores of the Colihue Huapi lake in Central Patagonia (similar to 46A degrees S) in February 2005. Model simulations initialized by these observations reproduce the timing of an observed increase in dust concentration at the Concordia Station and some of the observed increases in atmospheric aerosol absorption (here used as a dust proxy) in the Neumayer station. The TdF sources were the largest contributors of dust at both sites. The transit times from TdF to the Neumayer and Concordia sites are 6-7 and 9-10 days respectively. Lidar observations and model outputs coincide in placing most of the dust cloud in the boundary layer and suggest significant deposition over the ocean immediately downwind. Boundary layer dust was detected as far as 1800 km from the source and similar to 800 km north of the South Georgia Island over the central sub-Antarctic Atlantic Ocean. Although the analysis suggests the presence of dust at similar to 1500 km SW of South Africa five days after, the limited capabilities of existing satellite platforms to differentiate between aerosol types do not permit a definitive conclusion. In addition, the model simulations show dust lifting to the free troposphere as it travels south but it could not be confirmed by the satellite observations due to cloudiness. This work demonstrates that complementary information from existing transport models, satellite and surface data can yield a consistent picture of the dust transport from the Patagonia desert to Antarctica. It also illustrates the limitation of using any of these approaches individually to characterize the transport of dust in a heavily cloudy area.

A decadal regional and global trend analysis of the aerosol optical depth using a data-assimilation grade over-water MODIS and Level 2 MISR aerosol products	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Using the ten-year (2000-2009) Data-Assimilation (DA) quality Terra MODIS and MISR aerosol products, as well as 7 years of Aqua MODIS, we studied both regional and global aerosol trends over oceans. This included both operational and data assimilation grade versions of the products. After correcting for what appears to be aerosol signal drift from the radiometric calibration of both MODIS instruments, we found MODIS and MISR agreed on a statistically negligible global trend of +/- 0.003/per decade. Our study also suggests that AODs over the Indian Bay of Bengal, east coast of Asia, and Arabian Sea show increasing trends of 0.07, 0.06, and 0.06 per decade for MODIS, respectively. These regional trends are considered as significant with a confidence level above 95%. Similar increasing trends were found from MISR, but with less relative magnitude. These trends reflect respective increases in the optical intensity of aerosol events in each region: anthropogenic aerosols over the east coast of China and Indian Bay of Bengal; and a stronger influence from dust events over the Arabian Sea. Negative AOD trends, low in confidence levels, are found off Central America, the east coast of North America, and the west coast of Africa, which indicate that longer periods of observation are necessary to be conclusive.

The geographical distribution patterns of 4-year mean AOD for total, tau(0.55) (AOD at 0.55 mu m), fine, tau(0.55-fine), and coarse, tau(0.55-coarse), aerosols over China were addressed. These results indicate that the distribution of aerosol was largely affected by population, urban/industrial activity, agricultural biomass burning, spring dust, topography and humidity. tau(0.55-fine) in eastern China is significantly higher than in western China. Distribution of tau(0.55-coarse) reflected the influence of spring dust and urban/industrial pollution. The overall AOD in summer was higher than that in winter due to strong photochemical reactions producing secondary aerosols. In northern China, dust contributed to the mean tau(0.55) in spring months. In some places, aggregated precipitation in the summer months caused a pronounced drop in the temporal profile of AOD. Coal combustion, industrial emission and vehicle exhaust produced coarse aerosols, while fine aerosols are mainly dominated by secondary particles. Smoke from open-fire straw burning produced fine aerosols in the harvest season.				杨, 宇栋/F-6250-2012; Feng, Nan/O-6147-2014	Feng, Nan/0000-0002-1812-754X; Tao, Shu/0000-0002-7374-7063												0143-1161	1366-5901					2010	31	7					1801	1817		10.1080/01431160902926665								WOS:000277389200008

Based on the common ecological features six different zones were delimited. Remote sensing data from different satellites (Meteosat, Aqua) were used as input in a primary production model. The daily production of the entire area was computed on pixel by pixel basis (4x4 km) using a modified GIS software. Overwhelming importance of oceanic bloom and high spatial variance of PP (90+/-54 gC m(-2) y(r)(-1)) show that remote sensed data can allow a better estimation of carbon budget even in optically complex waters.

Natural versus anthropogenic aerosols in the eastern Mediterranean basin derived from multiyear TOMS and MODIS satellite data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In the present study we investigate the spatial and temporal variation of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in the eastern Mediterranean basin, and more specifically in the area extending from 28.5 degrees N to 42.5 degrees N and from 18.5 degrees E to 35.5 degrees E, which includes large urban areas and megacities such as Cairo, Istanbul, Athens, Izmir, Ankara, and Thessaloniki. For this purpose we use long-term AOT data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) version2 converted to 500 nm (AOT(500)) for the period 1980-2001 and Collection 005 AOT data at lambda = 550 nm (AOT(550)) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites for the periods 2000-2005 and 2002-2005, respectively. The spatial and temporal variation of AOT shows a good agreement between TOMS and MODIS, in terms of geographical patterns, which maximizes the usefulness of TOMS AOT product given its long temporal coverage (climatological). According to MODIS-Terra, the annual mean AOT550 over the studied region equals 0.22 +/- 0.05 (monthly values ranging from 0.14 to 0.32) and shows strong spatial inhomogeneities. The smallest values (down to 0.1) occur over the western, and especially in the northwestern, part of Greece, over the northern part of Anatolian peninsula and also over the sea of east Mediterranean. The largest AOT values (up to about 1.0) occur over northern Africa, Middle East, and the adjacent coasts, and over the Anatolian plateau. These high aerosol loadings are of natural origin, mainly desert dust. However, very large values (up to 0.8) are also found over large urban areas surrounding megacities, associated with anthropogenic, apart from natural desert, aerosols. By using TOMS AOT data as proxy for the dust source, and the difference of MODIS-TOMS AOT as an indicator of the anthropogenic aerosol component, the relative contribution of natural versus anthropogenic sources of aerosols has been derived for the eastern Mediterranean area. Limitations of this approach are discussed and the associated uncertainties are also evaluated and discussed.

J	Choi, YS; Ho, CH; Oh, HR; Park, RJ; Song, CG				Choi, Yong-Sang; Ho, Chang-Hoi; Oh, Hye-Ryun; Park, Rokjin J.; Song, Chang-Geun			Estimating bulk optical properties of aerosols over the western North Pacific by using MODIS and CERES measurements	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Over the western North Pacific, a large amount of land aerosols from Asian-Pacific countries is transported by the prevailing westerlies. This transport makes the radiative characteristics of these aerosols diverse, particularly when one compares those characteristics over the coastal sea with those over the open sea. In this paper we discuss a method that uses satellite data to obtain the single-scattering albedo (omega) and asymmetry factor (g) of atmospheric aerosols for two large-scale subdivisions-the coastal sea (within 250 km from the coast) and the open sea (the remaining area)-over the western North Pacific (110 degrees E-180 degrees, 20 degrees N-50 degrees N). Our estimation method uses satellite measurements, obtained over a six-year period (2000-2005), of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and shortwave fluxes at both the surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA): the measurements are obtained using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). For the two subdivisions the estimated annual means of (omega, g) at 630 nm are significantly different: (0.94, 0.65) over the coastal sea and (0.97, 0.70) over the open sea. From a quantitative viewpoint, this result indicates that in comparison with aerosols over the open sea, those over the coastal sea show greater absorption and lesser forward scattering of solar radiation. The estimated optical properties are responsible for the aerosol surface cooling observed by MODIS and CERES, which is approximately 138 and 108 W m(-2) per AOD over the coastal sea and open sea, respectively.

A Case Study of a Ross Ice Shelf Airstream Event: A New Perspective	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A case study illustrating cloud processes and other features associated with the Ross Ice Shelf airstream (RAS), in Antarctica, is presented. The RAS is a semipermanent low-level wind regime primarily over the western Ross Ice Shelf, linked to the midlatitude circulation and formed from terrain-induced and large-scale forcing effects. An integrated approach utilizes Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery, automatic weather station (AWS) data, and Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) forecast output to study the synoptic-scale and mesoscale phenomena involved in cloud formation over the Ross Ice Shelf during a RAS event. A synoptic-scale cyclone offshore of Marie Byrd Land draws moisture across West Antarctica to the southern base of the Ross Ice Shelf. Vertical lifting associated with flow around the Queen Maud Mountains leads to cloud formation that extends across the Ross Ice Shelf to the north. The low-level cloud has a warm signature in thermal infrared imagery, resembling a surface feature of turbulent katabatic flow typically ascribed to the RAS. Strategically placed AWS sites allow assessment of model performance within and outside of the RAS signature. AMPS provides realistic simulation of conditions aloft but experiences problems at low levels due to issues with the model PBL physics. Key meteorological features of this case study, within the context of previous studies on longer time scales, are inferred to be common occurrences. The assumption that warm thermal infrared signatures are surface features is found to be too restrictive.

A 2 year comparison of AMSR-E and MODIS cloud liquid water path observations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												An extensive comparison of cloud liquid water path (LWP) observations from solar reflectance and passive microwave satellite measurements over the global oceans is presented. Two years of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) LWP observations were collocated at full resolution and compared under special conditions to minimize errors, i.e., overcast, low-level liquid clouds with no detectable precipitation. Best agreement occurred in stratus regions off the west coasts of North/South America, southern Africa, and Australia. Large differences found in the winter hemispheres at higher latitudes were caused by a strong dependence of MODIS optical depth retrievals on solar zenith angle. Other differences, notably in the tropics and parts of the subtropics, were due to a dependence of AMSR-E LWP observations on surface wind speed and total precipitable water. Results highlight the need to provide more accurate cloud LWP observations for climate studies and model verification. Citation: Greenwald, T. J.

J	Kubar, TL; Hartmann, DL; Wood, R				Kubar, Terence L.; Hartmann, Dennis L.; Wood, Robert			Understanding the Importance of Microphysics and Macrophysics for Warm Rain in Marine Low Clouds. Part I: Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												The importance of macrophysical variables [cloud thickness, liquid water path (LWP)] and microphysical variables (effective radius r(e), effective droplet concentration N-eff) on warm drizzle intensity and frequency across the tropics and subtropics is studied. In this first part of a two-part study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical and CloudSat cloud radar data are used to understand warm rain in marine clouds. Part 11 uses simple heuristic models. Cloud-top height and LWP substantially increase as drizzle intensity increases. Droplet radius estimated from MODIS also increases with cloud radar reflectivity (dBZ) but levels off as dBZ > 0, except where the influence of continental pollution is present, in which case a monotonic increase of r(e) with drizzle intensity occurs. Off the Asian coast and over the Gulf of Mexico, r(e) values are smaller (by several mu m) and N-eff values are larger compared to more remote marine regions. For heavy drizzle intensity, both r(e) and N-eff values off the Asian coast and over the Gulf of Mexico approach r(e) and N-eff values in more remote marine regions. Drizzle frequency, defined as profiles in which maximum dBZ > -15, increases dramatically and nearly uniformly when cloud tops grow from 1 to 2 km. Drizzle frequencies exceed 90% in all regions when LWPs exceed 250 g m(-2) and N-eff values are below 50 cm(-3), even in regions where drizzle occurs infrequently on the whole. The fact that the relationship among drizzle frequency, LWP, and N-eff is essentially the same for all regions suggests a near universality among tropical and subtropical regions.

J	Ciappa, AC				Ciappa, Achille Carlo			Surface circulation patterns in the Sicily Channel and Ionian Sea as revealed by MODIS chlorophyll images from 2003 to 2007	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The surface circulation in the Sicily Channel and in the Ionian Sea is investigated using MCDerate-resolution Infrared Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) chlorophyll-a images collected from 2003 to 2007 The use of chlorophyll as surface tracer in the area is verified by comparison with satellite altimeter measurements available during the same period. The interaction between waters with different concentrations of chlorophyll adds new particulars to the surface circulation of the Atlantic Water (AW) in the study area. In the Sicily Channel, warm anticyclonic structures located in the southern end drive the AW flow along their northern boundary to the south-east. towards the Libyan coast. In winter, the anticyclonic structures contract in a stable nucleus (the Sidra gyre) close to the African coast allowing AW intrusion over the Tunisian shelf (Atlantic Tunisian Current). In summer, the anticyclonic structure expands westwards, limiting the Atlantic Tunisian Current, and northwards, grazing the Atlantic Ionian Stream. It also fragments, allowing occasional AW intrusion into the central part of the Sicily Channel along different pathways Due to the activity of the Sidra gyre, no evidence of the extension of the Atlantic Tunisian Current along the Libyan coast (cast of 15 degrees E) is found in the observation period. AW spreads into the central Ionian for long periods in summer but rarely in winter It reaches the northern Ionian Sea via anticyclonic eddies (already observed in thermal imagery) departing from the northern and eastern border of the anticyclonic structure, captured by the prevalent clockwise offshore circulation in the northern Ionian (except in summer 2003) The deduced circulation is in agreement with recent studies based oil the altimetric Mean Dynamic Topography and trajectories of drifters released in the Sicily Channel in recent years (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ohde, T				Ohde, Thomas			Investigation of hydrogen sulphide eruptions along the Namibian coastline using different remote sensing systems	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Hydrogen sulphide eruptions with their typical turquoise discolorations at the water surface are a unique phenomenon along the Namibian coastline. The remote sensing techniques of ocean colour sensors and microwave scatterometers were used for the investigation of such events. The studies with ocean colour sensors showed that the turquoise discolorations near the Namibian coast were neither linked to dust deposition into the water column by desert storms nor to the reflection of bright material in shallow water areas. In addition, other coloured marine events like algae blooms and river outflows were differentiable from the hydrogen sulphide eruptions by their special optical properties. Quasi-true colour images and spectral identification methods were utilised to monitor and investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of sulphide events. In the past years, they were sometimes and locally limited discovered. Newest remote sensing observations including our own investigations have established that the occurrence of sulphide events is more frequent and longer lasting. The north-westerly direction of propagation and their velocity between 12 cm s(-1) and 15 cm s(-1) were derived from an event on 14 April 2004. Lastly, the microwave scatterometer remote sensing was applied to investigate the relation of sulphide events to oceanographic conditions. The events from May 2004 were clearly related to strong coastal upwelling.

A Method for Compositing Polar MODIS Satellite Images to Remove Cloud Cover for Landfast Sea-Ice Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												This paper presents details of techniques for generating thermal infrared and visible composite images from the cloud-free portions of temporally closely spaced MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, with a focus on studies of landfast sea ice along the East Antarctic coast. Composite image inclusion criteria are based on modified MODIS Earth Observing System cloud mask product results. The compositing process presented places emphasis on retaining maximum spatial resolution while minimizing storage space requirements. Composite images can be produced either as a regular product (e. g., on a ten-day grid), or dynamically (whenever enough information is acquired to produce a new output image). The techniques presented are applicable at any latitude, are available for all MODIS channels at their native resolution, can combine Aqua and Terra images, and can produce maps in any output projection. However, due to the polar orbit of NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites which host the MODIS instrument, more frequent coverage is produced at higher latitudes. Thus, the techniques presented are particularly applicable to polar research. Examples of composite image generation of the landfast sea ice around the Mertz Glacier region, East Antarctica, are included for both winter and summer.

Investigations of an intense aerosol loading during 2007 cyclone SIDR - A study using satellite data and ground measurements over Indian region	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Tropical cyclones are prominent weather systems characterized by high atmospheric pressure gradients and wind speeds. Intense tropical cyclones occur in India during the pre-monsoon (spring). early monsoon (early summer), or post-monsoon (fall) periods. Originating in both the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the Arabian Sea (AS), these tropical cyclones often attain velocities of more than 100 km h(-1) and are notorious for causing intense rain and storm surge as they cross the Indian coast. In this study, we examine the changes in the aerosol properties associated with an intense tropical cyclone "SIDR", that occurred during 11-16 November 2007 over BoB. This cyclone, accompanied with very strong surface winds reaching 223 km h(-1), caused extensive damage over Bangladesh. Ground-based measurements of Aerosol Optical Depth (ADD) in the neighboring urban environment of Hyderabad, India, showed significant variations due to changes in wind velocity and direction associated with the cyclone passage. The Terra-MODIS and AVHRR satellite images showed prevalence of dust particles mixed with emissions from anthropogenic sources and biomass-burning AS, while the aerosol loading over BoB was significantly lower. The positive values of Aerosol index (AI) obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) suggested the presence of an elevated aerosol layer over the West coast of India, AS and Thar Desert during and after the cyclone episode. Meteorological parameters from the MM5 mesoscale model were used to study the variations in winds associated with the cyclonic activity. Particulate matter loading over the region during the cyclone period increased by similar to 45% with an accompanying decrease in columnar aerosol optical depth. The variations in Angstrom parameters suggested coarse-mode particle loading due to dust aerosols as observed in satellite data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			An assessment of the black ocean pixel assumption for MODIS SWIR bands	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Recent studies show that an atmospheric correction algorithm using shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands improves satellite-derived ocean color products in turbid coastal waters. In this paper, the black pixel assumption (i.e., zero water-leaving radiance contribution) over the ocean for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SWIR bands at 1240, 1640, and 2130 run is assessed for various coastal ocean regions. The black pixel assumption is found to be generally valid with the MODIS SWIR bands at 1640 and 2130 nm even for extremely turbid waters. For the MODIS 1240 nm band, however, ocean radiance contribution is generally negligible in mildly turbid waters such as regions along the U.S. east coast, while some slight radiance contributions are observed in extremely turbid waters, e.g., some regions along the China east coast, the estuary of the La Plata River. Particularly, in the Hangzhou Bay, the ocean radiance contribution at the SWIR band 1240 mn results in an overcorrection of atmospheric and surface effects, leading to errors of MODIS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance at the blue reaching similar to 0.5 MW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1). In addition, we found that, for non-extremely turbid waters, i.e., the ocean contribution at the near-infrared (NIR) band <similar to 1.0 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1), there exists a good relationship in the regional normalized water-leaving radiances between the red and the NIR bands. Thus, for non-extremely turbid waters, such a red-NIR radiance relationship derived regionally can possibly be used for making corrections for the regional NIR ocean contributions without using the SWIR bands, e.g., for atmospheric correction of ocean color products derived from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS).

Impact of the December 2004 tsunami on soil, groundwater and vegetation in the Nagapattinam district, India	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The tsunami of 26 December 2004 struck the Nagapattinam District, Tamil Nadu, India. Sea water inundation from the tsunami caused salinization problems for soil and groundwater in coastal areas of the district, and also induced salt injuries in crops. To document the recovery of the agricultural environment from the tsunami, we conducted observations of the soil, groundwater, and vegetation. Soil electrical conductivity increased sharply after the tsunami, but returned to pre-tsunami levels the following year. Groundwater salinity returned to pre-tsunami levels by 2006. These rapid rates of recovery were due to the monsoon rainfall leaching salt from the highly permeable soils in the area. MODIS NDVI values measured before and after the tsunami showed that vegetation damaged by the tsunami recovered to its pre-tsunami state by the next rice cropping season, called samba, which starts from August to February. From these results, we conclude that the agricultural environment of the district has now fully recovered from the tsunami. Based on the results, we have also identified important management implications for soil, groundwater, and vegetation as follows: 1) due to the heavy monsoon rainfall and the high permeability of soils in this region, anthropogenic inputs like fertilizers should be applied carefully to minimize pollution, and the use of green manure is recommended: 2) areas that were contaminated by sea water extended up to 1000 m from the sea shore and over pumping of groundwater should be carefully avoided to prevent inducing sea water intrusion: and 3) data from a moderate resolution sensor of 250 m, such as MODIS, can be applied to impact assessment in widespread paddy field areas like the Nagapattinam District.

Morning-to-Afternoon Evolution of Marine Stratus Polluted by Underlying Ships: Implications for the Relative Lifetimes of Polluted and Unpolluted Clouds	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Ship tracks appearing in both the morning and afternoon Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of the United States were used to study the morning-to-afternoon evolution of marine stratus polluted by underlying ships and nearby uncontaminated stratus. Analyzed 925-hPa winds were used to predict the afternoon positions of ship tracks found in the morning imagery. Droplet effective radii, visible optical depths, and liquid water amounts were analyzed for morning and afternoon clouds that, based on the low-level winds, were taken to be the same clouds. As found in a previous study by Segrin et al., both morning and afternoon polluted clouds had smaller droplet radii, larger optical depths, and smaller liquid water amounts than the nearby unpolluted clouds. In contrast to the Segrin et al. study, however, the droplet effective radii decreased significantly from morning to afternoon in both the polluted and unpolluted clouds, with the rate of decrease being twice as large for the unpolluted clouds. The larger decrease in the unpolluted clouds is thought to be caused by drizzle, which is probably absent in the polluted clouds. The observations suggest that, with their slower rate of liquid loss, polluted clouds could have longer lifetimes than their unpolluted counterparts. Of interest is that clouds with similar droplet radii but smaller optical depths, and thus smaller droplet number concentrations and liquid water amounts, exhibited higher sensitivities to the effects of elevated particle concentrations and a greater likelihood of appearing in both the morning and afternoon satellite overpasses.

A combinated approach to investigate the biochemistry and hydrography of a shallow bay in the South Adriatic Sea: the Gulf of Manfredonia (Italy)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The main goal of this study is to understand the hydrological and biochemical set up and processes of a marine coastal area located in the western side of the south Adriatic sea (the gulf of Manfredonia) by the use of both satellite images and in situ investigations A water sampling in the gulf of Manfredonia was performed at 18 fixed stations in June 2003; physico-chemical and biological parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and fluorescence) were measured along the water column and water samples were collected to analyse dissolved nutrients (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), total nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll a and total suspended solids. Surface spatial distributions of field collected data were examined to characterize biochemical and hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Manfredonia and these results were related with the remote sensing analysis data. Remote sensed data (obtained by Landsat 7 TM and Modis Terra) were processed to obtain maps of chlorophyll a, temperature and optical characteristics of the gulf; these maps were compared to in situ data. From physico-chemical measurements no stratification was observed in the water column except for the south-eastern area. High concentrations of silicate and ammonia were observed in the northern zone of the gulf, while nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll a and total suspended solids distributions showed higher values in the central coastal zone. These results were confirmed by remote sensing analysis; Modis elaboration showed a distribution with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a near the coast and Landsat images highlighted the extension of the surrounding agricultural areas crossed by the two main rivers which discharge into the gulf. The integration between field data with the remote sensing analysis showed to be a valid support in coastal zone management.

Seasonal Variation of the Physical Properties of Marine Boundary Layer Clouds off the California Coast	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds can significantly regulate the sensitivity of climate models, yet they are currently poorly simulated. This study aims to characterize the seasonal variations of physical properties of these clouds and their associated processes by using multisatellite data. Measurements from several independent satellite datasets [ International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (CERES-MODIS), Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO)], in conjunction with balloon soundings from the mobile facility of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement ( ARM) program at Point Reyes and reanalysis products, are used to characterize the seasonal variations of MBL cloud-top and cloud-base heights, cloud thickness, the degree of decoupling between clouds and MBL, and inversion strength off the California coast. The main results from this study are as follows: (i) MBL clouds over the northeast subtropical Pacific in the summer are more prevalent and associated with a larger in-cloud water path than in winter. The cloud-top and cloud-base heights are lower in the summer than in the winter. (ii) Although the lower-tropospheric stability of the atmosphere is higher in the summer, the MBL inversion strength is only weakly stronger in the summer because of a negative feedback from the cloud-top altitude. Summertime MBL clouds are more homogeneous and are associated with lower surface latent heat flux than those in the winter. (iii) Seasonal variations of low-cloud properties from summer to winter resemble the downstream stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition of MBL clouds in terms of MBL depth, cloud-top and cloud-base heights, inversion strength, and spatial homogeneity. The "deepening-warming'' mechanism of Bretherton and Wyant for the stratocumulus-to-trade-cumulus transition downstream of the cold eastern ocean can also explain the seasonal variation of low clouds from the summer to the winter, except that warming of the sea surface temperature needs to be taken as relative to the free-tropospheric air temperature, which occurs in the winter. The observed variation of low clouds from summer to winter is attributed to the much larger seasonal cooling of the free-tropospheric air temperature than that of the sea surface temperature.																	0894-8755	1520-0442				MAY	2009	22	10					2624	2638		10.1175/2008JCLI2478.1								WOS:000266587200009

Planktic foraminiferal production along an offshore-onshore transect in the south-eastern Bay of Biscay	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The distribution of planktic foraminifera from the continental slope onto the shelf of the south-eastern Bay of Biscay is discussed in relation to environmental factors. Samples were obtained between March and November, 2006-2008, along a bathymetric transect from 2000 to 145 m water depth, from 50 km off the shelf-break onto the outer shelf. Live specimens and empty tests (> 100 mu m) were collected with vertical plankton tows from the sea surface to a maximum water depth of 700 m, and temperature, salinity, oxygen concentration, and fluorescence/chlorophyll-a concentration were recorded. Additional data on chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature were derived from satellite imagery (Aqua MODIS and SeaWIFS). Planktic foraminifera were most abundant in the upper 80 m of the water column at all locations, with decreasing numbers towards the coast in March, April, and June. In November, maximum numbers of live specimens occurred at the outer shelf location. In July, planktic foraminiferal standing stocks were low throughout the sampling area. Chlorophyll-a concentration (i.e., food) and fresh water input were found to affect the abundance of planktic foraminifera along the transect: however we found no influence of water depth or proximity to the shelf.

Bio-optical algorithm evaluation for MODIS for western Canada coastal waters: An exploratory approach using in situ reflectance	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Biophysical and above-water reflectance measurements collected in 2006 were used to evaluate the OC3M, standard GSM01, and a modified version of the GSM01 algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl) concentrations in the Strait of Georgia, located off the southwest coast of Canada. The Strait was generally a case 2 water body, transitioning from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominant in the central region to possibly particulate dominant in Fraser River plume regions. Results showed that the OC3M algorithm was somewhat effective (R(2)=0.550) outside the most turbid areas of the Fraser River plume. However, a systematic overestimation of lower chl concentrations was found, which may have been related to the higher CDOM absorption observed throughout the Strait. The standard GSM01 algorithm had moderately good agreement with measured CDOM absorption (R(2)=0.593) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (R(2)=0.888), but was ineffective at estimating chl concentrations. Localized characterization of the CDOM absorption, through a hyperbolic CDOM model, improved the modified GSM01 results with slightly better agreement with measure CDOM absorption (R(2)=0.614) and TSS concentrations (R(2)=0.933). When the modified GSM01 algorithm was limited to regions with lower combined CDOM and non-algal particulate absorption (a(dg) (443)< 0.7 m(-1)), it was more effective then the OC3M algorithm at estimating chl concentrations. This suggests that a threshold value on the a(dg) (443) or b(bp) (443) estimated by the GSM01 algorithm may be beneficial for limiting turbidity influence on the algorithm. The further reinterpretation of phytoplankton absorption from the modified GSM01 algorithm with a two-component phytoplankton model resulted in a chl relationship with an R(2)=0.677 and a linear slope closer to one.

J	Shi, W; Wang, MH				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua			Satellite observations of flood-driven Mississippi River plume in the spring of 2008	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Satellite measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua were used to quantify the Mississippi River plume following the intense rainfall and massive flood along the Mississippi River and its tributaries during the spring of 2008. The shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm has been used to derive the total suspended matter (TSM) concentration and the spectral optical features of the Mississippi River plume. Following a significantly increased river discharge, the observed Mississippi River plume was considerably large relative to climatological monthly Mississippi River plume data, which were derived from the six-year MODIS-Aqua time series from 2002-2008. The areal coverage of the Mississippi River plume was double compared to the six-year mean value, with plume areal coverage of 5859, 4984, 4366, and 3050 km 2 for the months of April, May, June, and July in 2008, respectively. Within the plume, significantly elevated TSM concentration was observed with the pronounced normalized water-leaving reflectance at the green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Near the coast, the satellite-observed TSM concentration in April had increased approximately from the 20 mg/l six-year mean value to over 30 mg/ l in the April of 2008. Citation: Shi, W., and M.

Prevailing southwesterly winds and northeast/southwestward tidal currents pushed the oil towards Korea's West Sea coast of Taean. After the oil spill, daily chlorophyll a concentration decreased about 45-50% compared to the normal condition before the oil spill, and this decrease continued for about two weeks. Monthly mean chlorophyll a concentration in December 2007 was lower compared to the average value for the same month between 1998 and 2007, but, in October and November 2007 before the spill and in January-February 2008 after the spill, the concentration value was higher than average for the same period between 1998 and 2007.

In this paper, we show several examples of this feature from the MODIS/CALIPSO data sets. We identify this feature as the Bombay Plume that makes its way into the Arabian Sea from the west coast of India. A second part of this work is on modeling the impacts of pollution. We use a NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model to carry out many comparative forecast simulation experiments that include the pollution based on MODIS and control runs that utilize climatological estimates of pollutions. The model invokes both the direct and indirect effects of aerosols. Our observations are as follows: ( 1) The Arabian Sea experienced above normal rain during these periods for the MODIS experiments as compared to the control. ( 2) The most interesting feature is the divergent outflow center, in the upper troposphere, over polluted regions of the atmosphere over the Arabian Sea as a consequence of tropospheric aerosol heating. ( 3) An important related feature is a compensating downward lobe with a divergent inflow in the upper troposphere center over the Bay of Bengal. ( 4) The presence of this downward lobe over the Bay of Bengal relates to a reduction of winter monsoon rains over the southeast coast of India. ( 5) We also show evidence of similarly reduced winter monsoon rains in raingauge data over the southeast coast of India during high-pollution events ascertained from MODIS data.

An evaluation of remote sensing techniques for enhanced detection of the toxic dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Optical techniques were investigated to enhance current bloom detection capabilities in support of an operational system for forecasting harmful Karenia brevis blooms along the west coast of Florida. within the Gulf of Mexico. Algorithms pertaining to backscatter and changes in spectral shape of remote-sensing reflectance were applied to SeaWiFS and MODIS imagery during known K. brevis and non-K. brevis events. A method to remove resuspended chlorophyll in Texas showed limited use when applied to several scenes following tropical storms off the west Florida coast. This analysis suggests that an ensemble image approach, wherein a combination of a chlorophyll anomaly, spectral shape at 490 nm and a backscatter ratio product would provide an improvement in satellite detection of K. brevis blooms. For southwest Florida, the combination of these methods through an ensemble approach may lead to an increase in user accuracy by 30-50%, as a result of correctly identifying non-K. brevis features. Where available, MODIS FLH scenes were analyzed to determine their use in K. brevis detection. However, insufficient imagery was available to make a fair assessment. Similar approaches could be applied to bloom tracking and monitoring in other regions.

The knowledge of its spectral characteristics is the basis for developing precise remote sensing inversion algorithms. Two separate continuous monitoring stations were set near the northern and southern coast of Hangzhou Bay separately, which is typically turbid area in China coastal waters. The above-water measurement method and the American ASD portable spectroscope were adopted to measure the water surface reflectance spectrum. The sediment concentrations of surface water were synchronously acquired when measuring water-leaving radiance. Results show that the sediments concentration is comparatively high and changes dramatically according to tide cycle. The reflectance spectrum at different wavelengths rises corresponding to the increase in sediments concentrations with different extent. When using first derivative method to analysis the spectral characteristic, it can be found that the first reflectance peaks of reflectance spectra appear to shift to long wavelength. There are different correlations between sediment concentrations and each MODIS channel reflectance, which are above 0.5 in 650 nm or longer wavelengths channels and below 0.5 in 400-550 nm channels. The fitting result of regression analysis is preferable with MODIS channel 2 (841-876 nm) and in situ sediment concentrations using least square method, with R-2 of exponential above 0.8, which indicated that the MODIS channel 2 can be used for surface water suspended sediments remote sensing inversion, particularly in turbid waters such as bays and estuaries.

Annual mean values of the PM10 concentrations and AOD show a strong spatial correlation, indicating the consistent presence of aerosol concentrations. However, the temporal correlation between the monthly values of the PM10 concentrations and AOD indicates a regional contrast in their seasonality. The correlation coefficients are 0.6 or higher in the southeastern coast region, whereas they are -0.6 or lower in the north-central region. The regional discrepancy is most likely due to the difference in the size distributions of aerosols. This is also supported by the data on the distribution of the Angstrom exponent and fine mode fraction obtained from the MODIS. The characteristics of the aerosols with respect to coarse and fine particles are discussed in this study.				li, dongsheng/B-2285-2012; Choi, Yong-Sang/F-8072-2013; Ho, Chang-Hoi/H-8354-2015; Park, Rokjin/I-5055-2012; Kwon, Yulee/B-8433-2009; Song, Chang-Keun/S-2255-2016	Park, Rokjin/0000-0001-8922-0234; Kwon, Yulee/0000-0002-6515-9181; Song, Chang-Keun/0000-0002-8811-2626												1976-7633					FEB	2009	45	1					33	43										WOS:000267912100003

Empirical models of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms: Potential use as a remote detection tool in the Santa Barbara Channel	HARMFUL ALGAE												The Santa Barbara Channel, CA is a highly productive region where wind-driven upwelling and mesoscale eddies are important processes driving phytoplankton blooms. In recent years, the spring bloom has been dominated by the neurotoxin-producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. In this paper, we relate a 1.5-year time series of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance and domoic acid concentration to physical, chemical, and biological data to better understand the mechanisms controlling local Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom dynamics. The data were used to define the ranges of environmental conditions associated with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom development in the Santa Barbara Channel. The time series captured three large toxic events (max. particulate domoic acid concentration, pDA similar to 6000 ng L(-1); max. cellular domoic acid concentrations, cDA similar to 88 pg cell(-1)) in the springs of 2005-2006 and summer 2005 corresponding to bloom-level Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance (>5.0 x 10(4) cells L(-1)). In general, large increases in Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance were accompanied by increases in cDA levels, and cDA peaks preceded pDA peaks by at least one month in both the springs of 2005 and 2006. Statistical models incorporating satellite ocean color (MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS) and sea surface temperature (AVHRR) data were created to determine the probability that a remotely sensed phytoplankton bloom contains a significant population of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Models correctly estimate 98% of toxic bloom situations, with a 7-29% rate of false positive identification. Conditions most associated with high cDA levels are low sea surface temperature, high salinity, increased absorption by cDOM (412 nm), increased reflectance at 510/555 nm, and decreased particulate absorption at 510 nm. Future efforts to merge satellite and regionally downscaled forecasting products with these habitat models will help assess bloom forecasting capabilities in the central CA region and any potential connections to large-scale climate modes.

J	Liu, Y; Li, GS				Liu Ying; Li Guosheng			Study of attenuation depths for MODIS bands in the Bohai Sea in China	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												An attenuation depth is defined for remote sensing purposes a's a depth above which 90% of the arising light leaving the water surface is originated. The deeper the attenuation depth, the more information of water is detectable by remote sensing, then the more precise information of water is extracted. Meanwhile, the attenuation depth is helpful to know water layer (by its thickness) from which remote sensing will be able to extract information. A number of investigators are using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (or MODIS) for remote sensing of ocean color. It is necessary to have a rough idea of the effective attenuation depth of imagery in each of the spectral bands employed by the MODIS. The attenuation depth is directly determined from MODIS data. Though analyzing the spectral distribution of the attenuation depth on 7 August 2003 and the seasonal variation of the attenuation depth (551 nm) in the Bohai Sea indicated that: the spectral distribution of the attenuation depth for the spectral range between 400 to 700 inn is single-peak curve, and it's similar and difference in different regions is consistent with other scholars' results of zoning, moreover, it supports the Bohai Sea is Case 2 water;, the maximum attenuation depth shifts toward longer wavelengths, liking the red shift, with increase of turbidity of water, just like the maximum attenuation depth in the outside of the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea and the Bohai Strait is at 531nm, in the central of the Bohai Sea is at 551nm, in the region controlled by tire Huanghe (Yellow) River, the region impacted by the old Huanghe River, the western side of the Liaodong Bay and the eastern side of the Liaodong Bay is at 555 nm; the seasonal change of the attenuation depth is the largest in the summer, followed by the fall, and the ranking of winter and spring in different regions is distinct. The attenuation depth in different regions is dissimilar: the order of the attenuation depth in different regions from small to big is the region controlled by the Huanghe River or the eastern side of the Liaodong Bay, the western side of the Liaodong Bay, the region impacted by the old Huanghe River, the central of the Bohai Sea or the outside of the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea, the Bohai Strait (except at 412 nm and 645 nm), in which between the region controlled by the Huanghe River and the eastern side of the Liaodong Bay (and between the central of the Bohai Sea and the outside of the northwest coast of the Bohai Sea) it varies in different seasons and different bands.																	0253-505X	1869-1099					2009	28	5					39	48										WOS:000273214400005						
J	Yan, ZZ; Tang, DL				Yan, Zhongzheng; Tang, Danling			Changes in suspended sediments associated with 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												The Sumatra tsunami on 26 December, 2004 in the Indian Ocean was generated by one of the largest earthquakes of the past 100 years. The present study investigated spatial and temporal changes of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in North-East Indian Ocean (NEIO) after the Sumatra tsunami used satellite remote sensing data. The nLw551 products of MODIS-aqua data (using as indexing SSC) were analyzed for 5 years (2002-2006). Result shows SSC notably increased (55.6-200%) in large river estuaries along coast of the Bay of Bengal (BOB) in a short time (4 weeks) after the tsunami, especially the northwest coast of Indonesia, southeast coast of Myanmar, as well as the north offshore of BOB. Those increases were mainly caused by the re-suspension function induced by the initial Surge of the tsunami. Monthly analysis indicates increases (4.26%) of SSC of the entire North-East Indian Ocean area in 2005; especially in November 2005 when increase of SSC increased by about 6.19% compared with other years; those may mainly be caused by the destruction of coastal vegetation and modifying of estuaries or wetlands by the 2004 tsunami. The increases of SSC have different mechanism in different region and period after the tsunami. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

Vertical distribution of aerosols over the east coast of India inferred from airborne LIDAR measurements	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The information on altitude distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere is essential in assessing the impact of aerosol warming on thermal structure and stability of the atmosphere. In addition, aerosol altitude distribution is needed to address complex problems such as the radiative interaction of aerosols in the presence of clouds. With this objective, an extensive, multi-institutional and multi-platform field experiment (ICARB-Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget) was carried out under the Geosphere Biosphere Programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO-GBP) over continental India and adjoining oceans during March to May 2006. Here, we present airborne LIDAR measurements carried out over the east Coast of the India during the ICARB field campaign. An increase in aerosol extinction (scattering + absorption) was observed from the surface upwards with a maximum around 2 to 4 km. Aerosol extinction at higher atmospheric layers (>2 km) was two to three times larger compared to that of the surface. A large fraction (75-85%) of aerosol column optical depth was contributed by aerosols located above 1 km. The aerosol layer heights (defined in this paper as the height at which the gradient in extinction coefficient changes sign) showed a gradual decrease with an increase in the offshore distance. A large fraction (60-75%) of aerosol was found located above clouds indicating enhanced aerosol absorption above clouds. Our study implies that a detailed statistical evaluation of the temporal frequency and spatial extent of elevated aerosol layers is necessary to assess their significance to the climate. This is feasible using data from space-borne lidars such as CALIPSO, which fly in formation with other satellites like MODIS AQUA and MISR, as part of the A-Train constellation.

J	Jones, TA; Christopher, SA; Quaas, J				Jones, T. A.; Christopher, S. A.; Quaas, J.			A six year satellite-based assessment of the regional variations in aerosol indirect effects	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for cloud water droplets, and changes in aerosol concentrations have significant microphysical impacts on the corresponding cloud properties. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and cloud properties are combined with NCEP Reanalysis data for six different regions around the globe between March 2000 and December 2005 to study the effects of different aerosol, cloud, and atmospheric conditions on the aerosol indirect effect (AIE). Emphasis is placed in examining the relative importance of aerosol concentration, type, and atmospheric conditions (mainly vertical motion) to AIE from region to region. Results show that in most regions, AIE has a distinct seasonal cycle, though the cycle varies in significance and period from region to region. In the Arabian Sea (AS), the six-year mean anthropogenic + dust AIE is -0.27 Wm(-2) and is greatest during the summer months (<-2.0 Wm(-2)) during which aerosol concentrations (from both dust and anthropogenic sources) are greatest. Comparing AIE as a function of thin (LWP < 20 gm(-2)) vs. thick (LWP >= 20 gm(-2)) clouds under conditions of large scale ascent or decent at 850 hPa showed that AIE is greatest for thick clouds during periods of upward vertical motion. In the Bay of Bengal, AIE is negligible owing to less favorable atmospheric conditions, a lower concentration of aerosols, and a non-alignment of aerosol and cloud layers. In the eastern North Atlantic, AIE is weakly positive (+0.1 Wm(-2)) with dust aerosol concentration being much greater than the anthropogenic or sea salt components. However, elevated dust in this region exists above the maritime cloud layers and does not have a hygroscopic coating, which occurs in AS, preventing the dust from acting as CCN and limiting AIE. The Western Atlantic has a large anthropogenic aerosol concentration transported from the eastern United States producing a modest anthropogenic AIE (-0.46 Wm(-2)). Anthropogenic AIE is also present off the West African coast corresponding to aerosols produced from seasonal biomass burning (both natural and man-made). Interestingly, atmospheric conditions are not particularly favorable for cloud formation compared to the other regions during the times where AIE is observed; however, clouds are generally thin (LWP < 20 gm(-2)) and concentrated very near the surface. Overall, we conclude that vertical motion, aerosol type, and aerosol layer heights do make a significant contribution to AIE and that these factors are often more important than total aerosol concentration alone and that the relative importance of each differs significantly from region to region.

Effect of biomass burning on marine stratocumulus clouds off the California coast	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosol-cloud interactions are considered to be one of the most important and least known forcings in the climate system. Biomass burning aerosols are of special interest due to their radiative impact (direct and indirect effect) and their potential to increase in the future due to climate change. Combining data from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with passive tracers from the FLEXPART Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model, the impact of biomass burning aerosols on marine stratocumulus clouds has been examined in June and July of 2006-2008 off the California coast. Using a continental tracer, the indirect effect of biomass burning aerosols has been isolated by comparing the average cloud fraction and cloud albedo for different meteorological situations, and for clean versus polluted (in terms of biomass burning) continental air masses at 14:00 local time. Within a 500 km-wide band along the coast of California, biomass burning aerosols, which tend to reside above the marine boundary layer, increased the cloud fraction by 0.143, and the cloud albedo by 0.038. Absorbing aerosols located above the marine boundary layer lead to an increase of the lower tropospheric stability and a reduction in the vertical entrainment of dry air from above, leading to increased cloud formation. The combined effect was an indirect radiative forcing of -7.5% +/- 1.7% (cooling effect) of the outgoing radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere on average, with a bias due to meteorology of +0.9%. Further away from the coast, the biomass burning aerosols, which were located within the boundary layer, reduced the cloud fraction by 0.023 and the cloud albedo by 0.006, resulting in an indirect radiative forcing of +1.3% +/- 0.3% (warming effect) with a bias of +0.5%. These results underscore the dual role that absorbing aerosols play in cloud radiative forcing.

Several million gallons of fuel oil were released into the Mediterranean Sea, forming a huge oil spill. To assess the extent of the spill, two types of satellite images were used. First, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Terra images were obtained in near real-time immediately following the event and second advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) images were taken about 1 month later. Results showed an oil plume with areal extent of approximately 3,100 km2 shortly after the event, reaching the northern coast of Lebanon. However, after 2 months, satellite monitoring showed the geographic distribution of oil was reduced to 185 km2. The bio-environmental impact of this oil spill, due to its size and hydraulic dynamics, makes a major disaster.				surname, name/A-2183-2010													1527-5922						2009	10	1					51	59	PII 909022939	10.1080/15275920802659735								WOS:000263704000006

This bloom is thought to be unique in the region in terms of its large spatial extent. From its first detection in the west of the country, the bloom moved clockwise around the coast eventually reaching the east coast and the Shetland Isles to the north. The bloom resulted in extensive mortalities of benthic organisms including annelids and molluscs and some species of fish. Farmed fish mortalities were absent but gill damage was reported. The availability of satellite remote sensing, phytoplankton counts from multiple sites, meteorological data and some water chemistry, as well as information on the physical characteristics of the sampling sites, provided an extensive spatial and temporal data set. Analysis of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a data from Aqua-MODIS indicated that this parameter is a useful early warning indicator of K. mikimotoi in shelf waters off the Scottish west coast, and suggested that the bloom developed in this region prior to its advection to coastal waters. An earth observation (EO) based harmful bloom classifier for K. mikimotoi recognised areas of elevated K. mikimotoi cell density but generated false positives in areas of high reflectance. Data were also used to evaluate, in Scottish waters, various hypotheses that exist to explain the formation of K. mikimotoi blooms including phototaxis, nutrient availability, cell transport and elevated water temperature. Specifically, we sought to evaluate if routinely collected environmental data (water temperature, insolation, wind strength and direction, and sea-loch aspect) could be used as a predictor of bloom magnitude near aquaculture facility locations, which typically lie within fjordic sea lochs. Path analysis was used to derive intuitive models linking environmental drivers to bloom magnitude. Once the effects of latitude such as northward water cooling were taken into account, only rainfall was a significant predictor of bloom magnitude at the sampling sites. Therefore, while the offshore development and progression of a bloom may be predicted from satellite information, it is likely that local hydrodynamic influences are crucial in determining its magnitude at coastal aquaculture sites.

Sediment Dynamics on an Inner Shelf Shoal During Storm Events in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico, USA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Sediment resuspension and transport during storm events, specifically tropical storms and hurricanes, is poorly understood on the inner shelf. The increase in frequency and intensity of hurricanes in the northern Gulf of Mexico, coupled with the increase in development and tourism along the Florida Panhandle, in the southeastern United States, has increased the interest in sediment transport and erosion during hurricanes. This study utilized MODIS satellite imagery and a sediment resuspension model for the assessment of inner shelf material resuspension during hurricanes Ivan and Dennis. True color images and reflectance maps from red channel satellite imagery were created to corroborate modeled sediment resuspension. The model results indicate that substantial resuspension occurred over several days and down to the 100 m isobath during Hurricane Ivan. Resuspension intensity for Dennis was nearly as high as Ivan; however, such occurred over a smaller time interval and depth. Satellite imagery confirms the model's results with a significant plume that persists for 3 days after Ivan's landfall.

Hydrodynamically Induced or Modified Patterns Derived from Satellite Images in the Coastal Waters of Estonia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Due to a complex coastline, water column properties show large temporal and spatial variability in the coastal waters of Estonia. Therefore, as an addition to relatively coarse traditional monitoring, analysis of satellite images has became an increasingly popular method. The present study focuses on the identification of some hydrodynamically induced or modified patterns, recognizable from satellite images, such as river and dredging plumes, frontal zones between water masses of different origin, upwellings and coastal jets. The main aim was to match the patterns either with in situ measurement data or hydrodynamic hindcast modelling results. We used satellite imagery (MODIS, ALI), measurements of currents, waves and water column properties obtained in 2005-2008, as well as 2D hydrodynamic modelling of the coastal waters. The results show that dredging plumes in the shallow coastal waters are often overshadowed by storm induced resuspension; upwellings along straight sections of the coast are quite frequent and well visible from sea surface temperature images, while products for chlorophyll do not reveal straightforward results; river plumes and hydrochemical fronts between marine sub-basins can be monitored both by turbidity and coloured dissolved organic matter products.

On the observability of the fortnightly cycle of the Tagus estuary turbid plume using MODIS ocean colour images	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Using three years (2003 to 2005) of MODIS-Aqua normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm this paper shows a fortnightly cycle in the Tagus estuary turbid plume. The Tagus estuary is one of the largest estuaries of the west coast of Europe and is located in the most populated area of Portugal, including the capital Lisbon, The turbid plume has been detected by the backscattering characteristics of the surface waters in the vicinity of the estuary mouth. In fortnightly scales, the turbid plume has smaller dimensions during and after neap tides and higher dimensions during and after spring tides. This is most probably associated with the fortnightly spring-neap tidal cycle and the consequent increase in turbidity inside the estuary during spring tides. During the summer weak spring tides (tidal amplitude approximately 2.5 m) no turbid plume is observed for an entire fortnightly cycle. Outside the summer months, precipitation, river discharge and winds, were found to increase the turbid area, but the fortnightly cycle appears to be superimposed on the large time-scale variability, and present throughout the year.

We first document two events of dust plume transport from the Sahara to the American coast representative of summer and winter conditions. Observed and model-derived attenuated backscatter profiles agree qualitatively well, suggesting that the altitudes of the aerosol layers over the Atlantic are well reproduced by the model. In both the model and the observations, dust plumes extend up to 8 km in summer and up to 4 km in winter over the Atlantic close to the source regions and gradually descend throughout their travel over the Atlantic. We find however that, in summertime, observed AOT are overestimated by the model close to the source regions and underestimated in the remote regions, suggesting a too weak transport toward the western Atlantic and/or a too strong deposition over the Caribbean Sea. We then use our simulation to characterize the deposition flux of dust in this region. Half of the dust deposited on the surface of the open ocean in 2006 in this area occurs during summer, 20% during each of winter and spring, and 10% in the fall. During a 1-week dust episode in July 2006 that we investigated, 5 Tg of dust were deposited (4% of the annual total in the region).

Investigation of regional and seasonal variations in marine boundary layer cloud properties from MODIS observations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												To aid in understanding the role that marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds play in climate and assist in improving their representations in general circulation models (GCMs), their long-term microphysical and macroscale characteristics are quantified using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroracdiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Terra satellite. Six years of MODIS pixel-level Cloud products are used from oceanic study regions off the west coasts of California, Peru, the Canary Islands, Angola, and Australia where these cloud types are common. Characterizations are given for their organization (macroscale structure), the associated microphysical properties, and the seasonal dependencies of their variations for scales consistent with the size of a GCM grid box (300 km X 300 km). MBL mesoscale structure is quantified using effective cloud diameter C-D, which is introduced here as a simplified measure of bulk cloud organization; it is straightforward to compute and provides descriptive information beyond that offered by cloud fraction. The interrelationships of these characteristics are explored while considering the influences of the MBL state, such as the occurrence of drizzle. Several commonalities emerge for the five study regions. MBL clouds contain the best natural examples of plane-parallel clouds, but overcast clouds occur in only about 25% of the scenes, which emphasizes the importance of representing broken MBL cloud fields in climate models (that are subgrid scale). During the peak months of cloud occurrence, mesoscale organization (larger C-D) increases such that the fractions of scenes characterized as "overcast" and "clumped" increase at the expense of the "scattered" scenes. Cloud liquid water path and visible optical depth usually trend strongly with C-D, with the largest values occurring for scenes that are drizzling. However, considerable interregional differences exist in these trends, suggesting that different regression functionalities exist for each region. For peak versus off-peak months, the fraction of drizzling scenes (as a function of C-D) are similar for California and Angola, which suggests that a single probability distribution function might be used for their drizzle occurrence in climate models. The patterns are strikingly opposite for Peru and Australia; thus, the contrasts among regions may offer a test bed for model simulations of MBL drizzle occurrence.

Nyoman; Saitoh, Sei-Ichi			Satellite-derived measurements of spatial and temporal chlorophyll-a variability in Funka Bay, Southwestern Hokkaido, Japan	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration has an important economic effect in coastal and marine environments on fisheries resources and marine aquaculture development. Monthly climatologies the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) derived chl-a from February 1998 to August 2004 around Funka Bay were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a concentrations. SeaWiFS-derived suspended sediment, MODIS derived sea surface temperature (SST), solar radiation and wind data were also analyzed. Results showed two distinct chlorophyll blooms in spring and autumn. Chl-a concentrations were relatively low (<0.3 mg m(-3)) in the bay during summer, with high concentrations occurring along the coast, particularly near Yakumo and Shiraoi. In spring, chl-a concentrations increased, and a large (>2 mg m(-3)) phytoplankton bloom occurred. The spatial and temporal patterns were further confirmed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. About 83.94% of the variability could be explained by the first three modes. The first chl-a mode (77.93% of the total variance) explained the general seasonal cycle and quantified interannual variability in the bay. The spring condition was explained by the second mode (3.89% of the total variance), while the third mode (2.12% of the total variance) was associated with autumn condition. Local forcing such as the timing of intrusion of Oyashio water, wind condition and surface heating are the mechanisms that controlled the spatial and temporal variations of chlorophyll concentrations. Moreover, the variation of chlorophyll concentration along the coast seemed to be influenced by suspended sediment caused by resuspension or river discharge. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Phenology data on birch from 13 stations and 16-day MODIS-NDVI composite satellite data with 250 m resolution for the period 2000 to 2006 were used to map the growing season. A new combined pixel-specific NDVI threshold and decision rule-based mapping method was developed to determine the onset and end of the growing season. A moderately high correlation was found between NDVI data and birch phenology data. The earliest onset of the growing season is found in the narrow strip of lowland between the mountains and the sea along the coast of northern Norway. The onset follows a clear gradient from lowland to mountain corresponding to the decreasing temperature gradient. In autumn, the yellowing of the vegetation shows a more heterogeneous pattern. The length of the growing season is between 100 and 130 days in 55% of the study area. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Estimation of transboundary transport of pollution aerosols by remote sensing in the eastern Mediterranean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Quantifying transboundary transport of pollution is important for understanding the global distribution of pollution and pollutant burdens in regional and global scales. Using observations from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, the transport of pollution sulfate aerosol was estimated in the eastern Mediterranean. Over a 150 km line west of the Israeli coast, the estimated annual sulfate flux is in a range of 0.025 to 0.062 Tg S a(-1). These estimates are consistent with airborne measurements which estimated an annual flux of sulfate of 0.024-0.054 TgS a(-1). The MODIS-based estimates are also in good agreement with estimates of seasonal and annual fluxes from the GOCART model. This case study demonstrates a feasible way to estimate transboundary transport of pollution aerosol by remote sensing means.

Temporal characteristics of aerosol physical properties at Visakhapatnam on the east coast of India during ICARB - Signatures of transport onto Bay of Bengal	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Realizing the importance of aerosol physical properties at the adjoining continental and coastal locations in the airmass pathways onto the oceanic region, extensive measurements of aerosol physical properties were made at Visakhapatnam (17.7 degrees N, 83.3 degrees E), an eastern coastal location in peninsular India during the ICARB period. The temporal variations of aerosol optical depth, near surface aerosol mass size distributions and BC mass concentrations show significantly higher aerosol optical depth and near surface mass concentrations during the first and last weeks of April 2007. The mean BC mass fraction in the fine mode aerosol was around 11%. The aerosol back scatter profiles derived from Micro Pulse Lidar indicate a clear airmass subsidence on the days with higher aerosol optical depths and near surface mass fraction. A comparison of the temporal variation of the aerosol properties at Visakhapatnam with the MODIS derived aerosol optical depth along the cruise locations indicates a resemblance in the temporal variation suggesting that the aerosol transport from the eastern coastal regions of peninsular India could significantly affect the aerosol optical properties at the near coastal oceanic regions and that the affect significantly reduced at the farther regions.

Blooms of Noctiluca miliaris in the Arabian Sea - An in situ and satellite study	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Phytoplankton cell density, chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and pigment data collected during a series of five cruises in the northern Arabian Sea in the Northeast Monsoon (NEM, Nov-Jan) and the Spring Intermonsoon (SIM, Mar-May) since 2003 contradicted the established notion that winter blooms mainly consist of diatom communities. Recent data show that following the NEM and well into the SIM, phytoplankton populations are dominated by the dinoflagellate Noctiluca miliaris Suriray (synonym Noctiluca scintillans Macartney). In the SIM they were often in association with the well-known blooms of the diazotroph Trichodesmium sp. Large blooms of N. miliaris have also begun making their appearance annually in the Gulf of Oman and off the coast of Oman. This study uses NASA's recently developed product of merged SeaWiFS and Aqua-MODIS chl a data to investigate the temporal evolution and spatial extent of these taxonomically validated blooms. Satellite chl a in relation to Aqua-MODIS SST and altimetry data suggest that mesoscale eddies that populate the western Arabian Sea during the NEM contribute to the genesis and dispersal of these blooms from the Gulf of Oman into the central Arabian Sea.

Enhancing the estimation of continental-scale snow water equivalent by assimilating MODIS snow cover with the ensemble Kalman filter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												High-quality continental-scale snow water equivalent (SWE) data sets are generally not available, although they are important for climate research and water resources management. This study investigates the feasibility of a framework for developing such needed data sets over North America, through the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach, which assimilates the snow cover fraction observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into the Community Land Model (CLM). We use meteorological forcing from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) to drive the CLM and apply a snow density-based observation operator. This new operator is able to fit the observed seasonally varying relationship between the snow cover fraction and the snow depth. Surface measurements from Canada and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) estimates (in particular regions) are used to evaluate the assimilation results. The filter performance, including its ensemble statistics in different landscapes and climatic zones, is interpreted. Compared to the open loop, the EnKF method more accurately simulates the seasonal variability of SWE and reduces the uncertainties in the ensemble spread. Different simulations are also compared with spatially distributed climatological statistics from a re-gridded data set, which shows that the SWE estimates from the EnKF are most improved in the mountainous west, the northern Great Plains, and the west and east coast regions. Limitations of the assimilation system are analyzed, and the domain-wide innovation mean and normalized innovation variance are assessed, yielding valuable insights (e. g., about the misrepresentation of filter parameters) as to implementing the EnKF method for large-scale snow properties estimation.

In this study, we assess the transpacific transport of "pollution aerosol'' (defined as a mixture of aerosols from urban/industrial pollution and biomass burning) by taking advantage of the much improved measurement accuracy and enhanced new capabilities of satellite sensors in recent years. A 4-year (2002 to 2005) climatology of optical depth for pollution aerosol was generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations of fine-and coarse-mode aerosol optical depths. The pollution aerosol mass loading and fluxes were then calculated using measurements of the dependence of aerosol mass extinction efficiency on relative humidity and of aerosol vertical distributions from field campaigns and available satellite observations in the region. We estimated that about 18 Tg/a pollution aerosol is exported from east Asia to the northwestern Pacific Ocean, of which about 25% reaches the west coast of North America. The imported flux of 4.4 Tg/a to North America is equivalent to about 15% of local emissions from the United States and Canada. The pollution fluxes are largest in spring and smallest in summer. For the period we have examined the strongest export and import of pollution particulates occurred in 2003, largely because of record intense Eurasia boreal forest fires in spring and summer. The overall uncertainty of pollution fluxes is estimated at a factor of 2. Simulations by the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) and Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) models agree quite well with the satellite-based estimates of annual and latitude-integrated fluxes, with larger model-satellite differences in latitudinal and seasonal variations of fluxes.

Phytoplankton analysis revealed a near monospecific bloom of the dinoflagellate, Cochlodinium polykrikoides, with cell concentrations ranging from 2.5 x 10(5) to 3.2 x 10(6) cells per liter. Ground truth data were supplemented by processed satellite images from MODIS Aqua Level 2 data (1 km resolution) from January to April 2005, which revealed high surface chlorophyll-a levels (up to 50 mg/m(3)) offshore of west and southwest Palawan as early as February 2005. The bloom extended 310 km in length and 80 km in width at its peak in March off the central coast (Puerto Princesa). By April, the bloom declined in intensity, but was still apparent along the northern coast (El Nido). Fluctuations in chlorophyll levels off the western coast of Sabah, Malaysia and Brunei during this time period suggested that the bloom was not limited to the coast of Palawan. Satellite imagery from Sabah in late January revealed a plume of chl-a that is believed to be the source of the C polykrikoides bloom in Palawan. This plume drifted offshore, advected northward via the basin-wide counterclockwise gyre, and reached nutrient-rich, upwelled waters near Palawan (due to a positive wind stress curl) where the dinoflagellate bloomed and persisted for 2 months from March to April 2005.

Two stations (D1 and D2) were sampled on June 24, and D2 was resampled 6 days later; chlorophyll-a concentration had decreased by about one half. LAC MODIS-Chla images were obtained and showed the spread of the bloom on the day after sampling. The phytoplankton community consisted primarily of dinoflagellate temporary cysts, mainly at the surface and at 5 m in station D1. Two Pseudo-nitzschia species (P. australis, P. seriata) were also very abundant. Samples from the bloom had a specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a*(ph)(lambda)) lower than the rest of the samples. Values varied from 0.0186 to 0.0455 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph)(440) and from 0.0092 to 0.0294 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph) (675), with ratios a*(ph)(440): a*(ph)(675) ranging from 0.99 to 2.20. These low ratios were associated with the combined effect of packaging, and with the relatively high ratios of fucoxanthin, peridinin, diadinoxanthin and chlorophyll-c2 to TChla. Samples from the surface and 5 m depth at station D1 had higher ratios of Perid:TChla (0.12-0.32) than the rest of the samples, suggesting that cysts have similar Perid:TChla as free-living dinoflagellates. An unusual absorption spectrum with a broad maximum around 480-500 nm was associated with the high proportion of cysts and diatoms. The slope of the spectra between 443 and 488 nm was a good index to differentiate bloom samples containing high proportions of dinoflagellate temporary cysts. Further investigation of the absorption properties of dinoflagellate cysts is needed in order to detect these waters by remote sensing. Although much work is still necessary to understand and explain the bio-optical properties of a bloom, the present study is the first assessment off the Baja California coast to simultaneously consider aspects such as absorption properties, pigment composition and to include a spatial evaluation of the extension of a bloom with satellite images.

J	Magi, BI; Fu, Q; Redemann, J; Schmid, B				Magi, Brian I.; Fu, Qiang; Redemann, Jens; Schmid, Beat			Using aircraft measurements to estimate the magnitude and uncertainty of the shortwave direct radiative forcing of southern African biomass burning aerosol	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We estimate the shortwave, diurnally averaged direct radiative forcing (RF) in cloud-free conditions of the biomass burning aerosol characterized by measurements made from the University of Washington (UW) research aircraft during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative in August and September 2000 (SAFARI-2000). We describe the methodology used to arrive at the best estimates of the measurement-based RF and discuss the confidence intervals of the estimates of RF that arise from uncertainties in measurements and assumptions necessary to describe the aerosol optical properties. We apply the methodology to the UW aircraft vertical profiles and estimate that the top of the atmosphere RF (RFtoa) ranges from -1.5 +/- 3.2 to -14.4 +/- 3.5 W m(-2), while the surface RF (RFsfc) ranges from -10.5 +/- 2.4 to -81.3 +/- 7.5 W m(-2). These estimates imply that the aerosol RF of the atmosphere (RFatm) ranges from 5.0 +/- 2.3 to 73.3 +/- 11.0 W m(-2). We compare some of our estimates to RF estimated using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol optical properties and show that the agreement is good for RFtoa, but poor for RFsfc. We also show that linear models accurately describe the relationship of RF with the aerosol optical depth at a wavelength of 550 nm (tau(550)). This relationship is known as the radiative forcing efficiency (RFE) and we find that RFtoa (unlike RFatm and RFsfc) depends not only on variations in tau(550), but that the linear model itself is dependent on the magnitude of tau(550). We then apply the models for RFE to daily tau(550) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite to estimate the RF over southern Africa from March 2000 to December 2006. Using the combination of UW and MODIS data, we find that the annual RFtoa, RFatm, and RFsfc over the region is -4.7 +/- 2.7 W m(-2), 11.4 +/- 5.7 W m(-2), and -18.3 +/- 5.8 W m(-2), respectively.

J	Yuan, DL; Zhu, JR; Li, CY; Hu, DX				Yuan, Dongliang; Zhu, Jianrong; Li, Chunyan; Hu, Dunxin			Cross-shelf circulation in the Yellow and East China Seas indicated by MODIS satellite observations	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Ocean color and sea surface temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite are used to study the cross-shelf circulation and transport of suspended sediments in the Yellow and the East China Seas. The ocean color images show a significant turbid water plume extending in the southeast direction from the Subei coasts of China to the shelf edge south of Cheju during fall-winter, suggesting significant cross-shelf currents in the Yellow Sea/East China Sea in winter. The currents transport suspended sediments from the area of the old Huanghe mouth into the Okinawa Trough. Part of the turbid plume joins the Yellow Sea Warm Current to enter the Yellow Sea trough in winter. The satellite images suggest that the time scales of cross-shelf transport and surface-to-subsurface descending of the suspended sediments are a few weeks. The turbid plume grows in fall, reaches its maximum expansion and intensity in winter-spring, and subsides in late spring. In summer, the plume becomes coastally trapped. Substantial interannual variations of the intensity and coverage of the turbid plume are indicated by the observations. In comparison, the Changjiang Diluted Water in summer only transports a small amount of the Changjiang suspended sediment to the outer shelf south of Cheju, which does not enter the Yellow Sea owing to the weak intrusion of the Yellow Sea Warm Current in summer. The dynamics of the cross-shelf circulation in the Yellow Sea in winter are hypothesized to be associated with (1) the convergence of the Yellow Sea Coastal Current and the Taiwan Warm Current off the Changjiang mouth and (2) the time-dependent forcing of the northerly wind bursts that drives the intrusion of the Yellow Sea Warm Current.

In this study, cases of positive correlation were found over certain portions of the world by analyzing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products, together with a general finding that DER may increase or decrease with aerosol loading depending on environmental conditions. The slope of the correlation between DER and AOD is driven primarily by water vapor amount, which explains 70% of the variance in our study. Various potential artifacts that may cause the positive relation are investigated including the effects of aerosol swelling, partially cloudy, atmospheric dynamics, cloud three-dimensional (3-D) and surface influence effects. None seems to be the primary cause for the observed phenomenon, although a certain degree of influence exists for some of the factors. Analyses are conducted over seven regions around the world representing different types of aerosols and clouds. Only two regions show positive dependence of DER on AOD, near coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and South China Sea, which implies physical processes may at work. Using a 2-D Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model (GCE) with spectral-bin microphysics which incorporated a reformulation of the Kohler theory, two possible physical mechanisms are hypothesized. They are related to the effects of slightly soluble organics (SSO) particles and giant cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Model simulations show a positive correlation between DER and AOD, due to a decrease in activated aerosols with an increasing SSO content. Addition of a few giant CCNs also increases the DER. Further investigations are needed to fully understand and clarify the observed phenomenon.

Aerosol transport over the Gangetic basin during ISRO-GBP land campaign-II	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Level-3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and NCEP (National Centre for Environmental Prediction) re-analysis winds were incorporated into an aerosol flux continuity equation, for a quantitative assessment of the sources of aerosol generation over the Ganga basin in the winter month of December 2004. Preliminary analysis on the aerosol distribution and wind fields showed wind convergence to be an important factor which, supported by the regional topography, confines aerosols in a long band over the Indo Gangetic plain (IGP) stretching from the west of the Thar desert into the Head-Bay-of-Bengal. The prevailing winds of the season carry the aerosols from Head-Bay-of-Bengal along the east coast as far as the southern tip of the peninsular India. A detailed examination of MODIS data revealed significant day-to-day variations in aerosol loading in localised pockets over the central and eastern parts of the Indo Gangetic plain during the second half of December, with AOD values even exceeding unity. Aerosols over the Ganga basin were dominated by fine particles (geometric mean radius similar to 0.05-0.1 mu m) while those over the central and western India were dominated by large particles (geometric mean radius similar to 0.3-0.7 mu m). Before introducing it into the flux equation, the MODIS derived AOD was validated through a comparison with the ground-based measurements collected at Kharagpur and Kanpur; two stations located over the Ganga basin. The strength of the aerosol generation computed using the flux equation indicated the existence of aerosol sources whose locations almost coincided with the concentration of thermal power plants. The quantitative agreement between the source strength and the power plant concentration, with a correlation coefficient 0.85, pointed to thermal power plants as substantial contributors to the high aerosol loading over the Ganga Basin in winter. The layout of aerosol sources also nearly matched the spatial distribution of the Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), derived from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, lending additional support to our inference.																	0992-7689	1432-0576					2008	26	3					431	440		10.5194/angeo-26-431-2008								WOS:000255364900005

Analysis of aircraft and satellite measurements from the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment (INTEX-B) to quantify long-range transport of East Asian sulfur to Canada	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We interpret a suite of satellite, aircraft, and ground-based measurements over the North Pacific Ocean and western North America during April-May 2006 as part of the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment Phase B (INTEX-B) campaign to understand the implications of long-range transport of East Asian emissions to North America. The Canadian component of INTEX-B included 33 vertical profiles from a Cessna 207 aircraft equipped with an aerosol mass spectrometer. Long-range transport of organic aerosols was insignificant, contrary to expectations. Measured sulfate plumes in the free troposphere over British Columbia exceeded 2 mu g/m(3). We update the global anthropogenic emission inventory in a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and use it to interpret the observations. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieved from two satellite instruments (MISR and MODIS) for 2000-2006 are analyzed with GEOS-Chem to estimate an annual growth in Chinese sulfur emissions of 6.2% and 9.6%, respectively. Analysis of aircraft sulfate measurements from the NASA DC-8 over the central Pacific, the NSF C-130 over the east Pacific and the Cessna over British Columbia indicates most Asian sulfate over the ocean is in the lower free troposphere (800-600 hPa), with a decrease in pressure toward land due to orographic effects. We calculate that 56% of the measured sulfate between 500-900 hPa over British Columbia is due to East Asian sources. We find evidence of a 72-85% increase in the relative contribution of East Asian sulfate to the total burden in spring off the northwest coast of the United States since 1985. Campaign-average simulations indicate anthropogenic East Asian sulfur emissions increase mean springtime sulfate in Western Canada at the surface by 0.31 mu g/m(3) (similar to 30%) and account for 50% of the overall regional sulfate burden between 1 and 5 km. Mean measured daily surface sulfate concentrations taken in the Vancouver area increase by 0.32 mu g/m(3) per 10% increase in the simulated fraction of Asian sulfate, and suggest current East Asian emissions episodically degrade local air quality by more than 1.5 mu g/m(3).

Coastally trapped atmospheric gravity waves on SAR, AVHRR and MODIS images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Alternative dark-bright patterns on two ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images of the east coast of the Korean Peninsula acquired on 18 and 19 May 2004 are interpreted as atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) on the basis of simultaneous multi-satellite observations and atmospheric gravity wave theory. The AGWs appeared in the form of a wave packet containing several waves located between 50 and 200 km offshore. The wavelengths were ranging from 13 to 20 km. The lengths of AGW crests were from 20 to 150 km. An NOAA-17 pass was received about 30 min after the ASAR pass. Its channel 4 infrared (IR) image clearly shows wave-like moisture patterns. However, the sea surface temperature (SST) image derived after applying nonlinear calibration and split-window atmospheric correction shows no wave patterns. A daytime true-colour MODIS image taken about 14h later still shows a cloud band of same AGWs, indicating the lifespan of the standing AGWs can be over half a day. Although oceanic internal waves (IWs) may also cause similar wave patterns imaged by spaceborne SAR as they modulate the ocean surface roughness, we provide evidence to eliminate this possibility in this case. The characteristics of satellite observed AGWs are in good agreement with these simulated by a linear coastal AGW model.

Evaluation of MODIS ocean colour products at a northeast United States coast site near the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) marine and atmospheric products were evaluated using match- ups of MODIS and in situ measurements collected by an above- water radiometric system, the SeaWiFS Photometer Revision for Incident Surface Measurements ( SeaPRISM), deployed near the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory from 2004 to 2005.

Optimum groundwater locations in the northern United Arab Emirates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Due to the increase in urban and agricultural activities in arid regions, the exploration of new locations of possible groundwater discharge and accumulation is required to augment the limited water resources. In order to locate such discharge areas, it is necessary first to identify zones of high recharge potentials. In such an arid region, like the northern United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the ways to predict areas of potential groundwater recharge is by understanding the hydrological response of its drainage basins to rainfall events. Due to the scarcity of basic hydrological data, a hydrological model driven mainly by information on the physiographic characteristics, drainage network properties (generated from DEM), and surface cover distribution (generated from satellite images) was used to comprehend the dynamics of surface runoff through hydrographs, and hence water loss in the study area. Results show that the northern UAE is drained by 48 drainage basins emerging from the Oman Mountains. Two-thirds of these basins drain easterly toward the Gulf of Oman, and one-third drain westerly toward the Arabian Gulf. These basins are found to be structurally controlled by three major fault trends, which are the NE trend (Dibba zone), NW trend (Ham Zone), and WNW trend (Hatta zone). The hydrological response of a basin is correlated with its morphological characteristics. Based on these characteristics, and through the application of a cluster analysis, it was feasible to classify the largest basins in the region into four groundwater potentiality groups in accordance with the magnitude of their peak discharges. From this study, it became evident that the downstream area of the two major basins of Ar-Rafiah and Limhah, and their vicinities are the most probable sites for groundwater accumulation. The drainage systems of these two basins, especially those controlled by major fault lines, play a vital role in transmitting surface-subsurface rainwater from the Oman Mountains, the recharge zone, into the western desert plain, the discharge zone, where freshwater accumulates underground. The study also revealed that a large volume of groundwater is dissipated into the sea along the eastern coast. A detailed examination of MODIS thermal data supports this by revealing cool surface anomalies issuing from the mountain range toward both the western desert plain and the Gulf of Oman following major rainfall events. Thus, the technique used facilitates the prediction of new locations of optimum groundwater resources in the northern UAE. Such a technique could be adopted, with appropriate modifications, elsewhere in arid regions, where groundwater is restricted and subject to greater complexity.																	0143-1161						2008	29	20					5879	5906		10.1080/01431160801932517								WOS:000259366300007						
J	Hicke, JA; Jenkins, JC; Ojima, DS; Ducey, M				Hicke, Jeffrey A.; Jenkins, Jennifer C.; Ojima, Dennis S.; Ducey, Mark			Spatial patterns of forest characteristics in the western United States derived from inventories	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In the western United States, forest ecosystems are subject to a variety of forcing mechanisms that drive dynamics, including climate change, land-use/land-cover change, atmospheric pollution, and disturbance. To understand the impacts of these stressors, it is crucial to develop assessments of forest properties to establish baselines, determine the extent of changes, and provide information to ecosystem modeling activities. Here we report on spatial patterns of characteristics of forest ecosystems in the western United States, including area, stand age, forest type, and carbon stocks, and comparisons of these patterns with those from satellite imagery and simulation models. The USDA Forest Service collected ground-based measurements of tree and plot information in recent decades as part of nationwide forest inventories. Using these measurements together with a methodology for estimating carbon stocks for each tree measured, we mapped county-level patterns across the western United States. Because forest ecosystem properties are often significantly different between hardwood and softwood species, we describe patterns of each. The stand age distribution peaked at 60 100 years across the region, with hardwoods typically younger than softwoods. Forest carbon density was highest along the coast region of northern California, Oregon, and Washington and lowest in the arid regions of the Southwest and along the edge of the Great Plains. These results quantify the spatial variability of forest characteristics important for understanding large-scale ecosystem processes and their controlling mechanisms. To illustrate other uses of the inventory-derived forest characteristics, we compared them against examples of independently derived estimates. Forest cover compared well with satellite-derived values when only productive stands were included in the inventory estimates. Forest types derived from satellite observations were similar to our inventory results, though the inventory database suggested more heterogeneity. Carbon stocks from the Century model were in good agreement with inventory results except in the Pacific Northwest and part of the Sierra Nevada, where it appears that harvesting and. re in the 20th century ( processes not included in the model runs) reduced measured stand ages and carbon stocks compared to simulations.

MODIS observations of ship tracks in summertime stratus off the west coast of the United States	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Three years of I-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations for morning (Terra) and afternoon (Aqua) summertime marine stratus off the west coast of the United States were analyzed to determine the response of the clouds to aerosols in the plumes of underlying ships. The polluted clouds were identified in pixels with elevated 2.1-mu m reflectivities and 3.7-mu m radiances when compared with nearby pixels that contained unpolluted clouds. An automated routine was developed to identify which of the pixels contained clouds polluted by underlying ships and then to select unpolluted control pixels on both sides of the ship track as near as was feasible to the polluted clouds, often with a separation of as little as 1 pixel. While no requirements were placed on the cloud cover fraction-within the selected pixels, to facilitate comparisons with an earlier study based on 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery, the results presented here are restricted to 20-pixel segments along the ship tracks in which all of the pixels identified as polluted and all of the pixels selected as controls on both sides of the tracks were found to be overcast. The pollution caused about a 20% reduction in droplet radius in both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. In the MODIS observations, the increase in optical depth was about 15% and statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 99.5%. These changes were much larger than the 2% and statistically negligible increases found for the AVHRR observations. Like the AVHRR observations, the MODIS observations indicated that the majority of clouds (60%) lost liquid water when polluted, but consistent with the different outcomes for the optical depths, the losses for the MODIS observations were about half the nearly 20% loss found in the AVHRR observations. Cloud altitudes were unaffected by the pollution for both the MODIS and the AVHRR observations. For both morning and afternoon clouds, those with the largest increases in albedo in response to the pollution also showed the largest increases in cloud liquid water amount. The changes in droplet radii and liquid water amounts retrieved using the MODIS observations suggested that droplet growth was suppressed in the polluted clouds and that the rate of growth from cloud base to cloud top was also reduced when compared with nearby unpolluted clouds.																	0022-4928					DEC	2007	64	12					4330	4345		10.1175/2007JAS2308.1								WOS:000251896400009						
J	Wang, MH; Shi, W				Wang, Menghua; Shi, Wei			The NIR-SWIR combined atmospheric correction approach for MODIS ocean color data processing	OPTICS EXPRESS												A method of ocean color data processing using the combined near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for atmospheric correction for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua is proposed. MODIS-Aqua has been producing the high quality ocean color products in the open oceans, but there are still some significant errors in the derived products in the coastal regions. With the proposed NIR-SWIR combined algorithm, MODIS ocean color data can be processed using the standard (NIR) atmospheric correction algorithm for the open oceans, whereas for the turbid waters in the coastal region the SWIR atmospheric correction algorithm can be executed. The turbid water index developed by Shi and Wang (2007) (Remote Sens. Environ. 110, 149-161 (2007)) is computed prior to the atmospheric correction for the identification of the productive and/or turbid waters where the SWIR algorithm can be operated. For non-turbid ocean waters (discriminated using the turbid water index criterion), the MODIS data are still processed using the standard (NIR) algorithm. The NIR- SWIR combined algorithm has been tested and evaluated. Two examples from MODIS-Aqua measurements along the U. S. and China east coast regions show improved ocean color products with the new approach. In particular, there are no obvious data discontinuities between using the NIR and SWIR methods. Therefore, with the NIR-SWIR combined approach for the MODIS ocean color data processing, good quality ocean color products can be derived both in clear (open) oceans as well as for turbid coastal waters.

River plume patterns and dynamics within the Southern California Bight	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Stormwater river plumes are important vectors of marine contaminants and pathogens in the Southern California Bight. Here we report the results of a multi-institution investigation of the river plumes across eight major river systems of southern California. We use in situ water samples from multi-day cruises in combination with MODIS satellite remote sensing, buoy meteorological observations, drifters, and HF radar current measurements to evaluate the dispersal patterns and dynamics of the freshwater plumes. River discharge was exceptionally episodic, and the majority of storm discharge occurred in a few hours. The combined plume observing techniques revealed that plumes commonly detach from the coast and turn to the left, which is the opposite direction of Coriolis influence. Although initial offshore velocity of the buoyant plumes was similar to 50 cm/s and was influenced by river discharge inertia (i.e., the direct momentum of the river flux) and buoyancy, subsequent advection of the plumes was largely observed in an alongshore direction and dominated by local winds. Due to the multiple day upwelling wind conditions that commonly follow discharge events, plumes were observed to flow from their respective river mouths to down-coast waters at rates of 20-40 km/d. Lastly, we note that suspended-sediment concentration and beam-attenuation were poorly correlated with plume salinity across and within the sampled plumes (mean r(2) = 0.12 and 0.25, respectively), while colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence was well correlated (mean r(2) = 0.56), suggesting that CDOM may serve as a good tracer of the discharged freshwater in subsequent remote sensing and monitoring efforts of plumes.

An approach based on radiative transfer simulations was used providing systematic assessments. The study shows that when coloured dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) and non- algal particle ( NAP) concentrations are low, the seven algorithms tested, as expected, can retrieve chlorophyll with an error of, at best, 75% for 80 - 90% of the cases. The accuracy generally degrades rapidly with increasing CDOM and NAP concentrations. For the semianalytical algorithms ( bulk IOP retrieval enabled), the QAA algorithm achieved a better result at retrieving the total absorption, a, backscattering, bb and backscattering by particles, bb(p). However, none of the algorithms can break down the total absorption into components with reasonable accuracy. The study indicates that without incorporating regional and seasonal knowledge of specific IOPs the accuracy in water constituent retrievals from remote sensing is poor, hindering the use of remote sensing in water quality management.

The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) was used to predict annual and monthly regional NPP as modified by temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, soil texture, fractional tree cover, land cover type, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Fractional tree cover was estimated using continuous training data and multi-temporal metrics of 47 Envisat MERIS images of March 2003 to September 2005 and was derived by aggregating tree cover estimates made from highresolution IKONOS imagery to coarser Landsat ETM imagery. A regression tree algorithm was used to estimate response variables of fractional tree cover based on the multi-temporal metrics. This study showed that Envisat MERIS data yield a greater spatial detail in the quantification of NPP over a topographically complex terrain at the regional scale than those used at the global scale such as AVHRR.

J	Zhu, A; Ramanathan, V; Li, F; Kim, D				Zhu, Aihua; Ramanathan, V.; Li, Fang; Kim, Dohyeong			Dust plumes over the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans: Climatology and radiative impact	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Multiple satellite data sets in conjunction with the Monte Carlo Aerosol-Cloud-Radiation (MACR) model are employed to determine climatological distributions and radiative impacts of dust plumes over the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. Three target regions, namely the Yellow Sea (YS), Arabian Sea ( AS), and Saharan Coast (SC), are examined for quantitative comparisons of dust properties and their impacts on climate. Twenty year averaged Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data clearly show the peak dust season for the three target regions, March-April-May for YS and June-July-August for AS and SC. Georgia Institute of Technology-Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) modeled dust AOD fraction and Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) large-mode AOD ratio are adopted to evaluate the dust fraction estimate. Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment ( SAGE) II aerosol extinction coefficient data are used to define the vertical distribution of dust. The elevated dust plumes are detected by subtracting the non-dust-season values from dust season values of SAGE II data, showing extinction peak around similar to 4 km over AS and SC. Over YS, dust plumes are found presenting multilayered structure. The shortwave ( SW) forcing of dust, although moderated by the longwave ( LW) effect, dominates the net effects ( SW + LW) of dust plumes. Under clear-sky ( i.e., cloudless) conditions, dust plumes reduce about 5.9 W m(-2), 17.8 W m(-2), and 14.2 W m(-2) regional and seasonal mean radiative flux reaching the surface over YS, AS, and SC, respectively. Of the three regions, dust plumes over AS have the largest effect on atmospheric heating owing to a lower single-scattering albedo and the relatively large dust loading. The maximum SW heating occurs over AS with the value around + 0.5 K/day inside the dust layer at similar to 4 km. The LW effect results in strong cooling throughout the dust layer and moderate heating below the dust layer, and dust plumes over SC exert the maximum LW effect on heating rates, with up to -0.5 K/day LW cooling in the free troposphere and about + 0.3 K/day warming in the boundary layer. As the sum of the SW and the LW heating rates, net heating rate shows a more complex pattern. Over SC, large LW cooling inside the dust layer offsets up to 80% SW heating and results in about -0.1 K/day net heating rate change at the height similar to 5 km over SC. Over AS the net heating rate change is dominated by SW heating because the maximum LW cooling is less than 60% of the SW heating, which leads to + 0.3 K/day net heating inside the dust layer and moderate heating below the dust base. The net heating rate change over YS is the smallest among the three regions, with magnitude within 0.1 K/day.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 31	2007	112	D16							D16208	10.1029/2007JD008427								WOS:000249335400002						
J	Hosotani, K; Winarso, G				Hosotani, K.; Winarso, G.			Oceanic water intrusion into Kagoshima Bay resulting in thermal stratification	JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION												Kagoshima Bay is an enclosed bay that has the tendency to undergo eutrophication, and a very important site to describe the behavior of open seawater intrusion. According to the results of the satellite SST (Sea Surface Temperature) image analysis or numerical simulation focused on the warm water intrusion into the bay in winter, a warm water mass originates in the meandering Kuroshio Current and reaches the mouth of the bay making the density flow to act like a semi-geostrophic current that is influenced by the Coriolis effect. However, there is still no information on the oceanic intruding flow during the summer, where it is accompanied by thermal stratification. In this research, satellite remote sensing and numerical simulation were employed to investigate the oceanic water intrusion into Kagoshima Bay during the summer season by using satellite chl-a (chlorophyll-a) images instead of SST. As a result, the distribution of the low-concentration chl-a with the oceanic water intrusion was found to be similar to the intrusion that occurs during the winter season. Furthermore, the numerical simulation was performed under the simple assumption that the thickness of the warm water mass that reaches the southern coast of Kyushu also shows the same tendency as in the winter season. Although the characteristics, such as the intruding speed or intruding pattern, are similar in winter, some features such as the generation of the inflow from the middle layer, showed a different tendency.																	1343-8875					JUL	2007	10	3					325	334		10.1007/BF03181700								WOS:000248292700018						
J	Osborne, SR; Haywood, JM; Bellouin, N				Osborne, S. R.; Haywood, J. M.; Bellouin, N.			In situ and remote-sensing measurements of the mean microphysical and optical properties of industrial pollution aerosol during ADRIEX	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												We present a summary of the principal physical and optical properties of aerosol particles using the FAAM BAE-146 instrumented aircraft during ADRIEX between 27 August and 6 September 2004, augmented by sunphotometer, lidar and satellite retrievals. Observations of anthropogenic aerosol, principally from industrial sources, were concentrated over the northern Adriatic Sea and over the Po Valley close to the aerosol sources. An additional flight was also carried out over the Black Sea to compare east and west European pollution. Measurements show the single-scattering albedo of dry aerosol particles to vary considerably between 0.89 and 0.97 at a wavelength of 0.55 mu m, with a campaign mean within the polluted lower free troposphere of 0.92. Although aerosol concentrations varied significantly from day to day and during individual days, the shape of the aerosol size distribution was relatively consistent through the experiment, with no detectable change observed over land and over sea. There is evidence to suggest that the pollution aerosol within the marine boundary layer was younger than that in the elevated layer. Trends in the aerosol volume distribution show consistency with multiple-site AERONET radiometric observations. The aerosol optical depths derived from aircraft measurements show a consistent bias to lower values than both the AERONET and lidar ground-based radiometric observations, differences which can be explained by local variations in the aerosol column loading and by some aircraft instrumental artefacts. Retrievals of the aerosol optical depth and fine-mode (<0.5 mu m radius) fraction contribution to the optical depth using MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites show a reasonable level of agreement with the AERONET and aircraft measurements.

J	Syvitski, JPM; Saito, Y				Syvitski, James P. M.; Saito, Yoshiki			Morphodynamics of deltas under the influence of humans	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A consistent database was established to characterize key environmental factors known to control delta morphology. The database includes the location, basin morphology, fluvial and sediment discharge to the deltas, delta morphology, ocean energy, and shelf depth reached by the sub-aqueous delta. Fifty-one deltas were selected to cover the global parameter range of rivers entering all major oceans and coastal seas. Seasonal satellite images of the deltas were processed (IKONOS, SPOT, LANDSAT, and MODIS). Predictive statistical relationships were obtained, suitable for hypothesis testing or to constrain/verify numerical models used to simulate the evolution of coastal systems. The area of a delta is best predicted from average discharge, the total sediment load feeding the delta, and the offshore accommodation space. The gradient of a delta plain, measured from the apex of the delta to the coast along the main channel, is best predicted with a ratio of sediment supply to sediment retention, sediment concentration used as a proxy of delta plain sedimentation, and mean water discharge. Widths of distributary channels form a lognormal distribution, with the cumulative width of the river mouths directly related to the maximum discharge, tidal and wave energy. The grain size of topset deposits scales with the river length. Hundreds of millions of people occupy deltas and human engineering is now a major influence on the growth and evolution of many deltas, through control of the flow path of distributary channels, and mitigation of the seasonal flood wave with concomitant change in the delivery of sediment load. More and more deltas are moving away from their pre-Anthropocene morphology, as influenced by pristine sediment supply and sediment dispersal. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Multi-grid-cell validation of satellite aerosol property retrievals in INTEX/ITCT/ICARTT 2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol transport off the US Northeast coast during the Summer 2004 International Consortium for Atmospheric Research on Transport and Transformation ( ICARTT) Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment ( INTEX) and Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation ( ITCT) experiments produced a wide range of aerosol types and aerosol optical depth ( AOD) values, often with strong horizontal AOD gradients. In these conditions we flew the 14-channel NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sun photometer ( AATS) on a Jetstream 31 ( J31) aircraft. Legs flown at low altitude ( usually <= 100 m ASL) provided comparisons of AATS AOD spectra to retrievals for 90 grid cells of the satellite radiometers MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, and MISR, all over the ocean. Characterization of the retrieval environment was aided by using vertical profiles by the J31 ( showing aerosol vertical structure) and, on occasion, shipboard measurements of light scattering and absorption. AATS provides AOD at 13 wavelengths 1 from 354 to 2138 nm, spanning the range of aerosol retrieval wavelengths for MODIS over ocean ( 466-2119 nm) and MISR ( 446-866 nm). Midvisible AOD on low-altitude J31 legs in satellite grid cells ranged from 0.05 to 0.9, with horizontal gradients often in the range 0.05 to 0.13 per 10 km. When possible, we used ship measurements of humidified aerosol scattering and absorption to estimate AOD below the J31. In these cases, which had J31 altitudes 60-110 m ASL ( typical of J31 low-altitude transects), estimated midvisible AOD below the J31 ranged from 0.003 to 0.013, with mean 0.009 and standard deviation 0.003. These values averaged 6% of AOD above the J31. MISR-AATS comparisons on 29 July 2004 in 8 grid cells ( each similar to 17.6 km x 17.6 km) show that MISR versions 15 and 16 captured the AATS-measured AOD gradient ( correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.87 to 0.92), but the MISR gradient was somewhat weaker than the AATS gradient. The large AOD ( midvisible values up to similar to 0.9) and differing gradients in this case produced root-mean-square ( RMS) MISR-AATS AOD differences of 0.03 to 0.21 ( 9 to 31%). MISR V15 angstrom ngstrom exponent alpha ( = -dlnAOD/dln lambda) was closer to AATS than was MISR V16. MODIS-AATS AOD comparisons on 8 overpasses using 61 grid cells ( each nominally 10 km x 10 km) had R-2 x 0.97, with RMS AOD difference similar to 0.03 (similar to 20%). About 87% of the MODIS AOD retrievals differed from AATS values by less than the predicted MODIS over-ocean uncertainty, Delta(tau) = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau. In contrast to the small MODIS-AATS differences in AOD, MODIS-AATS differences in A ngstrom exponent a were large: RMS differences for alpha( 553, 855 nm) were 0.28 for MODIS-Terra and 0.64 for MODIS-Aqua; RMS differences for alpha( 855, 2119 nm) were larger still, 0.61 for MODIS-Terra and 1.14 for MODIS-Aqua. The largest MODIS-AATS A ngstrom exponent differences were associated with small AOD values, for which MODIS AOD relative uncertainty is large. Excluding cases with AOD( 855 nm) < 0.1 reduced MODIS-AATS a differences substantially. In one grid cell on 21 July 2004, smoke over cloud appeared to impair the MODIS-Aqua cloud mask, resulting in retrieved AODs that significantly exceeded AATS values. Experiments with extending MODIS retrievals into the glint mask yielded MODIS AODs consistently less than AATS AODs, especially at long wavelength, indicating that the current MODIS glint mask limits should not be reduced to the extent tried here. The sign of the AOD differences within the glint mask ( MODI AOD < AATS AOD) is consistent with ship-measured wind speeds there.

Extending the MODIS 1 km ocean colour atmospheric correction to the MODIS 500 m bands and 500 m chlorophyll-a estimation towards coastal and estuarine monitoring	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												National and regional obligations to control and maintain water quality have led to an increase in coastal and estuarine monitoring. A potentially valuable tool is high temporal and spatial resolution satellite ocean colour data. NASA's MODIS-Terra and -Aqua can capture data at both 250 in and 500 in spatial resolutions and the existence of two sensors provides the possibility for multiple daily passes over a scene. However, no robust atmospheric correction method currently exists for these data, rendering them unusable for quantitative monitoring applications. Therefore, this paper presents an automatic and dynamic atmospheric correction approach allowing the determination of ocean colour. The algorithm is based around the standard MODIS 1 km atmospheric correction, includes cloud masking and is applicable to all of the visible 500 m bands. Comparison of the 500 m ocean colour data with the standard 1 km data shows good agreement and these results are further supported by in situ data comparisons. In addition, a novel method to produce 500 m chlorophyll-a estimates is presented. Comparisons of the 500 M estimates with the standard MODIS OC3M algorithm and to in situ data from a near-coast validation site are given. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Micro pulse lidar observation of high altitude aerosol layers at Visakhapatnam located on the east coast of India	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												[1] Aerosol back scatter profiles obtained using a micro pulse lidar at Visakhapatnam, a station located on the east coast of peninsular India show certain high altitude aerosol layers during the months of March/April 2005, 2006. Co-located aerosol optical depth measurements show an increase in AOD by 0.05 to 0.25 during the event when the layers were observed. The prevailing meteorology does not indicate any possible local entrainment of aerosol leading to the formation of elevated layers due to boundary layer dynamics. The 7 day back trajectory analysis shows that the possible origin of the layers could be from Arabia in 60% of the cases while it is from Indian sub-continent during the rest of the events. When the air mass flow is from the Indian sub-continent, there is a proportional increase in MODIS derived aerosol column fine mode fraction though it is not observed at the surface level. During the events when air mass flow is from Arabia, such an increase in column fine mode fraction was not observed but the angstrom size index which is a measure of the aerosol size distribution was low indicating that the elevated layers of Arabian origin could contain significant fraction of dust aerosol.

J	Bennartz, R				Bennartz, R.			Global assessment of marine boundary layer cloud droplet number concentration from satellite	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Global satellite data are used to infer the droplet number concentration of marine boundary layer clouds. In a first step, two and a half years (July 2002 to December 2004) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, on board NASA's Aqua satellite) level 3 data estimates of cloud effective radius and optical thickness are used to derive cloud droplet number concentration N and cloud geometrical thickness H under the assumption of adiabatically stratified clouds. Theoretical error estimates show that for a liquid water path higher than 30 g/m(2) and a cloud fraction higher than 0.8, H (N) can be derived with a relative uncertainty of better than 20% (80%). To further validate the estimates of N and H, cloud liquid water path is calculated and compared to independent observations of cloud liquid water path from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E), also on board Aqua. Good agreement between the two different data sets is found. In a second step, the global distribution of cloud droplet number concentration in stratiform boundary layer clouds is evaluated. The data are separated into observations that are likely to be drizzling and drizzle- free using published relations between drizzle rate and N and H. It is found that the mean droplet number concentration over remote Northern Hemisphere oceans is higher than over the southern oceans (64-89 cm(-3) in the Northern Hemisphere and 40-67 cm(-3) in the Southern Hemisphere). Leeward of the major continents cloud droplet number concentration is generally high with maximum values close to the coasts. On the Southern Hemisphere, especially over the east Pacific Ocean, microphysical conditions were almost constant through the entire observation period. Over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, the cloud microphysical variability appears to be strongly influenced by the dry biomass burning season in Africa.

Physical and optical aerosol properties at the Dutch North Sea coast based on AERONET observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Sun photometer measurements at the AERONET station at the North Sea coast in The Hague (The Netherlands) provide a climatology of optical and physical aerosol properties for the area. Results are presented from the period January 2002 to July 2003. For the analysis and interpretation these data are coupled to chemical aerosol data from a nearby station of the Dutch National Air Quality Network. This network provides PM10 and black carbon concentrations. Meteorological conditions and air mass trajectories are also used. Due to the location close to the coast, the results are strongly dependent on wind direction, i.e. air mass trajectory. In general the aerosol optical properties are governed by industrial aerosol emitted form various industrial, agricultural and urban areas surrounding the site in almost all directions over land. For maritime air masses industrial aerosols are transported from over the North Sea, whereas very clean air is transported from the NW in clean polar air masses from the North Atlantic. In the winter the effect of the production of sea salt aerosol at high wind speeds is visible in the optical and physical aerosol data. In these cases fine and coarse mode radii are similar to those reported in the literature for marine aerosol. Relations are derived between the angstrom ngstrom coefficients with both the fine/coarse mode fraction and the ratio of black carbon and PM10.																	1680-7316	1680-7324					2007	7	13					3481	3495		10.5194/acp-7-3481-2007								WOS:000248733000007

Island wake circulation off Maldives during boreal winter, as visualised with MODIS derived chlorophyll-a data and other satellite measurements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The north equatorial current (NEC) is a seasonal current that exhibits variability in its strength and transport. In this paper, the westward flow of the NEC in the Indian Ocean has been observed during the northeast monsoon. The NEC passes through the Maldives, a group of coral islands in the central part of the equatorial Indian Ocean along 73 degrees E. This flow has been shown to enhance biological productivity on the west coast of the Maldives during boreal winter. This was visualized with chlorophyll-a data derived using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) sensor on 11 December 2003. The plumes of chlorophyll-a showing the progress of the westward flow through the Kardive channel on the west coast of the Maldives during the winter of 2003 to 2004 were studied. Analysis of weekly chlorophyll-a data from November to March 2000 to 2004 also indicated westward flow with distinct inter-annual and intra-season variations. The surface wind, obtained from Quicksat scatterometer data, and the mean sea level anomaly, obtained from altimeter data corresponding to the flow were also analysed. Hydrographic observations studied with ARGO floats around the area also provided supporting evidence of the flow through the Maldives group of islands in the Indian Ocean.																	0143-1161						2007	28	5					891	903		10.1080/01431160600858459								WOS:000245076500005

A satellite view of internal waves induced by the Indian Ocean tsunami	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												At 08: 45 local time ( 02: 45 GMT) on 26 December 2004, 1 h and 45 min after the Sumatra Earthquakes of magnitude 9.3, a devastating tsunami struck the east coast of Sri Lanka. Nearly 2 h and 30 min after the wave hit the coast, a weather satellite passed over Sri Lanka's coastal zone providing a rare glimpse of internal waves along the continental slope due to this tsunami. The satellite imagery indicates wave-like features from the tsunami being reflected, diffracted, and scattered off the steep continental slope and submarine canyons adjacent to Sri Lanka. The energetic wave and its modification to internal waves possibly eroded sediment from the sea floor and transported it to the sea surface. Solitary features generated by internal waves can explain the observed pattern. Future modelling approaches considering these nonlinear interactions would be required for a better understanding of the tsunami behaviour in the coastal zone, where its destructive effects are most prominent.																	0143-1161						2007	28	13-14					2927	2936		10.1080/01431160601094534								WOS:000247469000005

Mapping severe damage to land cover following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami using moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Visual analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250m before-and-after event imagery along 11 335 km of South East Asia and East Africa's coastline identified major changes to land cover along 1 220 km of coast caused by the tsunami of 26 December 2004. Over 81 000 ha of land were mapped as lost or severely damaged. High spatial resolution images (10-32 m) from the Terra satellite's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Disaster Monitoring Constellation's Surrey Linear Imager and the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) provided verification. Area estimates of damaged land from MODIS were within 17% of the estimates made using high spatial resolution systems. Errors of commission and omission were estimated at 14% and 31%, respectively. The correlation between damage estimates from MODIS and high spatial resolution systems resulted in an R-2 of 0.73 at the 99.5% confidence level, with MODIS proving especially effective at mapping tsunami-damaged areas greater in size than 150 ha. Correcting the original area estimate to account for errors of omission and commission using the regression model gave a revised figure of 103 854 ha of land damaged. Land cover types could not be assigned from the MODIS pre- and post-disaster image pairs, but interpretation of pre-disaster ETM imagery for the damaged areas indicated that around 5% was previously classed as barren, 11% as urban, 14% forest and 70% rural. The study provides confirmation that moderate resolution satellite imagery can provide rapid assessments of severe damage to land resources (though not cover type), as well as confirmation of non-affected areas, over very large geographical regions in the aftermath of natural disasters such as the tsunami.

Operative Monitoring of the Extent of Dredging Plumes in Coastal Ecosystems Using MODIS Satellite Imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												MODIS band 1 imagery is the only satellite data with acceptable spatial resolution (250 m) and sufficient revisit times (up to 4 times a day) potentially available for monitoring dredging plumes. The aim of this study was to determine the potential use of MODIS band 1 imagery in an optically sophisticated environment such as the Baltic Sea coastal waters for monitoring of total suspended matter in natural conditions and near dredging activities. It was found that there is linear correlation between MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm) reflectance and the total suspended matter concentration measured from water samples. The regression algorithm was used to produce suspended matter concentration maps and monitor dredging activities. The results showed that in such shallow water environments as the Estonian Coast resuspension caused by strong wind may increase the suspended matter concentration to the levels similar to those occurring during dredging. Areas affected by wind resuspension are much larger than the areas affected by dredging plumes. Therefore, the natural variability of suspended matter concentration has to be taken into account when estimating environmental impact of dredging activities on local ecosystems.

Springtime coupling between chlorophyll a, sea ice and sea surface temperature in Disko Bay, West Greenland	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Alterations in sea ice and primary production are expected to have cascading influences on the food web in high Arctic marine ecosystems. This study spanned four years and examined the spring phytoplankton production bloom in Disko Bay, West Greenland (69 degrees N, 53 degrees W) (using chlorophyll a concentrations as a proxy) under contrasting sea ice conditions in 2001 and 2003 (heavy sea ice) and 2002 and 2004 (light sea ice). Satellite-based observations of chlorophyll a, sea ice and sea surface temperature were used together with in situ depth profiles of chlorophyll a fluorescence collected at 24 sampling stations alone the south coast of Disko Island (5-30 km offshore) in May 2003 and 2004. Chlorophyll a and sea surface temperatures were also obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS: EOS-Terra and AQUA satellites) between March 2001 and July 2004. Daily SMMR/SSMI sea ice data were obtained in the same years. An empirical regional algorithm was developed to calibrate ratios of remotely sensed measurements of water leaving radiance with in situ chlorophyll a fluorescence. The optimal integration depth was 0-4 m, explaining between 70% and 91% of the variance. The spatial development of the phytoplankton bloom showed that the southwestern corner of the study area had the earliest and the largest spring phytoplankton bloom. The eastern part of Disko Bay, influenced by meltwater outflow from the glaciers, shows no signs of an early phytoplankton bloom and followed the general pattern of an accelerated bloom soon after the disappearance of sea ice. In all four years the coupling between phytoplankton and sea ice was bounded by average open water between 50% and 80%, likely due to the combined availability of light and stable open water. The daily incremental growth in both mean chlorophyll a density (chlorophyll a per volume water, mu g l(-1)) and abundance (density of chlorophyll a extrapolated to ice free areas, tons) estimated by linear regression (chlorophyll a vs. day) between I April and 15 May was highest in 2002 and 2004 (light ice years) and lowest in 2001 and 2003 (heavy ice years). In years with late sea ice retreat the chlorophyll a attained only slightly lower densities than in years with early sea ice retreat. However, the abundance of chlorophyll a in light ice years was considerably larger than in heavy ice years, and there was an obvious effect of more open water for light-induced stimulation of primary production. This observation demonstrates the importance of estimating chlorophyll a abundance rather than density in sea ice covered areas. This study also presents the first regional calibration of MODIS chlorophyll a data for Arctic waters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Island mass effect around the Maldives during the winter months of 2003 and 2004	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Enhanced chlorophyll-a on the west coast of the Maldive Islands in the north Indian Ocean is described as an island mass effect (IME). The phenomenon was first observed in the chlorophyll-a field of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data on 18 December 2003. This phenomenon was studied with daily and weekly datasets of the winter months of 2003 and 2004. The phenomenon was initiated in November 2003 and continued till March 2004. The satellite sensor derived wind and surface current fields examined along the Maldives indicated their association with the chlorophyll fields of the area. The spatio-temporal distribution of chlorophyll and the change in intensity through different channels of the Maldive Islands are discussed with the westward flow of the north equatorial current (NEC) in the Indian Ocean.																	0143-1161					NOV 20	2006	27	22					5087	5093		10.1080/01431160500177562								WOS:000243085000009

Influence of aerosol particles from biomass burning on cloud microphysical properties and radiative forcing	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH					14th International Conference on Clouds and Precipitation	JUL 19-23, 2004	Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, ITALY	Int Assoc Meterol & Atkmospher Sci, Int Commiss Clouds & Precipitat, Int Union Geodesy & Geophy	Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate			Aerosol from biomass burning has been shown to strongly modify cloud microphysical properties and cloud lifetime through the so-called "indirect effect." However, in the case of a lack of wet scavenging, it stays suspended for days to weeks and can be transported to considerable distances within an elevated layer above low-level cloud tops with minimal aerosol-cloud interactions. The observations carried out during the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) 2000 dry season field campaign often revealed the presence of an elevated biomass-burning aerosol layer above a semi-permanent stratiform cloud deck off the southern African coasts. MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products were used to investigate the existence of an aerosol indirect effect on convective clouds. Results are presented documenting cloud effective radius and cloud radiative forcing variations due to the presence of the aerosol during the development of convective clouds. Radiative transfer simulations in the visible (0.8 mu m, VIS) and near-infrared (1.6, 2.1 and 3.7 mu m, NIR) wavelengths were instrumental in establishing the extent of the influence of a biomass-burning aerosol layer overlying a water cloud sheet on the MODIS satellite retrieval of cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius and the optical thickness. The radiative transfer simulations suggest that the presence of the aerosol induces a significant underestimation of the cloud optical thickness, whereas an underestimation of the retrieved effective radius is more pronounced in the retrieval that makes use of the 1.6 mu m waveband than the 2.1 and 3.7 gm wavebands. The MODIS cloud products of 3 days of the SAFARI 2000 campaign were analyzed to determine whether the aerosol induced biases evidenced by the simulations also affect the operational cloud property retrieval. Cloud parameters, in particular the effective radius, are usually employed as indicators of the occurrence of aerosol-cloud interaction according to the "indirect effect." However, these results highlight some of the difficulties associated with satellite retrievals of cloud properties and show the importance of an accurate sighting of the cloud and aerosol layer top and bottom heights in order to prevent erroneous detections of indirect effects.

Principal component analysis of the evolution of the Saharan air layer and dust transport: Comparisons between a model simulation and MODIS and AIRS retrievals	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The onset and evolution of Saharan air layer (SAL) episodes during June-September 2002 are diagnosed by applying principal component analysis to the NCEP reanalysis temperature anomalies at 850 hPa, where the largest SAL-induced temperature anomalies are located along the west coast of Africa. The first principal component (PC) represents the onset of SAL episodes, which are associated with large warm anomalies located at the west coast of Africa. The second PC represents two opposite phases of the evolution of the SAL. The positive phase corresponds to the southwestward migration of the warm anomalies into the tropical-subtropical North Atlantic Ocean, and the negative phase corresponds to the northwestward migration into the subtropical to midlatitude North Atlantic Ocean and the southwest Europe. AIRS retrievals of temperatures in September 2002 verify the migration depicted by the second PC. In addition, a dust transport model (CARMA) and the MODIS retrievals of aerosol optical thickness are used to study the associated effects on dust distribution and deposition. The positive (negative) phase of the second PC corresponds to a strengthening (weakening) of the offshore flows in the lower troposphere around 10-20 degrees N, causing more (less) dust being transported toward the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The 700-hPa anticyclonic circulation associated with the warm anomalies plays a role in connecting the dust with the warm anomalies.

Impact of ship emissions on the microphysical, optical and radiative properties of marine stratus: a case study	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Modifications of existing clouds by the exhaust of ships are well-known but inadequately quantified impacts, which could contribute to climate change. The perturbation of a cloud layer by ship-generated aerosol changes the cloud reflectivity and is identified by long curves in satellite images, known as ship tracks. As ship tracks indicate a pollution of a very clean marine environment and also affect the radiation budget below and above the cloud, it is important to investigate their radiative and climatic effects. Satellite-data from MODIS on Terra are used to examine a scene from 10 February 2003 where ship tracks were detected close to the North American West-Coast. The cloud optical and microphysical properties are derived using a semi-analytical retrieval technique combined with a look-up-table approach. An algorithm is presented to distinguish ship-track-pixels from the unperturbed cloud pixels in the scene and from this the optical properties of the former are compared to those of the latter. Within the ship tracks a significant change in the droplet number concentration, the effective radius and the optical thickness are found compared to the unaffected cloud. The resulting cloud properties are used to calculate the radiation budget below and above the cloud. Assuming a mean solar zenith angle of 63 degrees for the selected scene, the mean solar surface radiation below the ship track is decreased by 43.2 Wm(-2) and the mean reflectance at top of atmosphere ( TOA) is increased by 40.8 Wm(-2). For the entire analyzed scene the ship emission decreases the solar radiation at the surface by 2.1 Wm(-2) and increases the backscattered solar radiation at TOA by 2.0 Wm(-2), whereas no significant effect on thermal radiation was detected.

The impact of assimilation of MODIS data for the prediction of a tropical low-pressure system over India using a mesoscale model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A low-pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal, India on 15 October 2003 and crossed the east coast of India during the late hours of 17 October 2003. The system, which provided copious rainfall over the Bay of Bengal and stations on the east coast, is investigated in this study using the fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (MM5). Three sets of numerical experiments are designed in this study. While the first set utilizes National Center for Environmental Prediction Aviation (NCEP-AVN) analysis (for the initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions) only in the MM5 simulation, the second set utilizes the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (as well as a few radiosonde station data) to provide an improved analysis. The third set used the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from MODIS alone to provide an improved analysis. The results of the three sets of simulation are compared with one another as well as with the analysis and observations. It is found that the predicted sea level pressure of the MM5 simulation which utilized the improved analysis: reproduces the large-scale structure of the low-pressure system as manifested in the NCEP-AVN analysis; provides a stronger and deeper low-pressure system as seen from the sea level pressure field; and shows a larger northward extent of the associated precipitation pattern as compared with the simulation with just the analysis. The results of the third experiment (impact of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity using MODIS alone) compare well with the results of the second experiment except that in the former, the associated cyclonic circulation in the lower troposphere appears weaker. The results of this study, although restricted to a single case study, demonstrate that inclusion of MODIS derived vertical temperature and humidity profiles together with radiosonde data caused a favourable impact on the simulated structure of the low-pressure system.																	0143-1161					OCT 20	2006	27	20					4655	4676		10.1080/01431160500207302								WOS:000241651200015

Offshore transport episodes of anthropogenic sulfur in northern Chile: Potential impact on the stratocumulus cloud deck	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												An outstanding meteorological feature appearing off the coast in Central and Northern Chile is the persistent stratus cloud deck under the subtropical Pacific High. It has a large impact on the regional and global energy balance and atmospheric circulation. In connection with mid-latitude synoptic-scale disturbances, subsiding easterly flow down the subtropical Andes often occurs in Northern Chile allowing large anthropogenic emissions of oxidized sulfur that take place in the region to reach the stratus deck. We explore the potential impact of anthropogenic emitted sulfur on the stratus deck associated with strong easterly flow events that occur on the average 4 to 8 times per year. A representative transport event is simulated using a 3-D transport chemistry model and the results are compared with satellite observations of cloud droplet number concentration. Although not conclusive, this preliminary study reveals a potential perturbation of the subtropical stratocumulus deck due to anthropogenic sulfur aerosols.

Assessment of MODIS-derived visible and near-IR aerosol optical properties and their spatial variability in the presence of mineral dust	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Mineral dust aerosol is among the most difficult aerosol species to measure quantitatively from space. In this paper, we evaluate MODIS retrievals of spectral aerosol optical depth ( AOD) from the visible to the near- IR off the US West Coast using measurements taken by the NASA Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer, AATS- 14, during the EVE ( Extended- MODIS-lambda Validation Experiment, 2004) campaign in April of 2004. In EVE, a total of 35 and 49 coincident over- ocean suborbital measurements at the nominal level- 2 retrieval scale of 10 km x 10 km were collected for Terra and Aqua, respectively. For MODIS- Terra about 80% of the AOD retrievals are within the estimated uncertainty, Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau; this is true for both the visible ( here defined to include 466 - 855 nm) and near- IR ( here defined to include 1243 - 2119 nm) retrievals. For MODIS- Aqua about 45% of the AOD retrievals are within Delta tau = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 tau; the fraction of near- IR retrievals that fall within this uncertainty range is about 27%. We found an rms difference of 0.71 between the sunphotometer and MODIS- Aqua estimates of the visible ( 553 - 855 nm) angstrom ngstrom exponent, while the MODIS- Terra visible A ngstrom exponents show an rms difference of only 0.29 when compared to AATS. The cause of the differences in performance between MODIS- Terra and MODIS- Aqua could be instrument calibration and needs to be explored further. The spatial variability of AOD between retrieval boxes as derived by MODIS is generally larger than that indicated by the sunphotometer data.																	0094-8276					SEP 30	2006	33	18							L18814	10.1029/2006GL026626								WOS:000240943800003

Tower-based radiometric observations at a coastal site in the Baltic Proper	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												An autonomous above-water radiometer was operated during the summer of 2005 on the Gustaf Dalen Lighthouse Tower (GDLT) off the Swedish coast in the Baltic Proper. Normalized water leaving radiances, L-WN(lambda), produced from measurements performed with the autonomous system at various center-wavelengths lambda in the 412-675 nm spectral range, were applied within the context of water quality monitoring and satellite ocean color validation activities. Specifically these in situ radiometric data were used to determine the chlorophyll a concentration through a regional band-ratio algorithm and to assess L-WN(lambda) derived from top-of-atmosphere Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The in situ measurements collected during a bloom occurring in July 2005 were also used to investigate the spectral and small scale temporal-spatial variability of L-WN(lambda) in the presence of cyanobacteria.

J	Barton, I; Pearce, A				Barton, I; Pearce, A			Validation of GLI and other satellite-derived sea surface temperatures using data from the Rottnest Island ferry, Western Australia	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												An accurate platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) has been installed on a commercial ferry that operates between Hillarys Marina, some 15 km north of Fremantle, and Rottnest Island off the Western Australian coast. The PRT is located in the engine intake system and provides continuous under-way measurements of the bulk sea surface temperature (SST) at a depth of 1 m. The "SeaFlyte" ferry makes the trip to Rottnest Island between 3 and 5 times daily and so a wealth of data is available for comparison with the SST derived using data from the GLI instrument on ADEOS-II. Analyses of the ferry and satellite data confirm the excellent quality of SST estimates from the GLI as well as four other satellite instruments-AVHRR on NOAA-16, AATSR on ENVISAT, and the MODIS instruments on TERRA and AQUA. All satellite instruments showed a comparison standard deviation of better than 0.6 degrees C with GLI being better than 0.4 degrees C. The number of ferry-satellite data coincidences used in this study demonstrates one of the advantages of installing measurement systems on commercial ships that operate regular passenger or freight services rather than infrequent deployments on research vessels. The analyses also demonstrate that satellite-derived SST estimates obtained under low surface wind conditions must be treated with care.																	0916-8370					JUN	2006	62	3					303	310		10.1007/s10872-006-0055-5								WOS:000237260700008

The algorithm described is applicable to ocean colour satellite measurements (e.g., SeaWiFS). In situ measurements of inherent and apparent optical properties were made at 19 coastal stations off the north coast of New Zealand's South Island in December 2001. These measurements were used to parameterise a bio-optical model that estimates remote sensing reflectance from concentrations of water constituents. The model generated a large number (5000) of modelled ocean colour reflectance spectra that represented a greater range of biogeochemical conditions than were measured in the study area. These modelled values spanned a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations (0.1-10 mg m(-3)), total suspended particulate material concentrations (0.1-50 g m(-3)), and dissolved yellow substance absorptions (0.01-3m(-1)). The modelled spectra were then used to test the performance of the algorithm. The median ratio of algorithm values to target values was 0.84 (absorption), and 0.80 (backscatter), and the median absolute errors were 33% (absorption) and 36% (backscatter) across two orders of magnitude. The r(2) values between target and algorithm values of inherent optical properties in log-log space were 0.89 for backscatter, and varied with wavelength for absorption from 0.79 (412 nm), 0.72 (443 nm), 0.63 (490 nm), 0.55 (510 nm), and 0.21 (555 nm).				oubelkheir, kadija/H-3843-2011; Boyd, Philip/J-7624-2014	Boyd, Philip/0000-0001-7850-1911; Lavender, Samantha/0000-0002-5181-9425; Moore, Gerald/0000-0001-6170-6646												0028-8330					JUN	2006	40	2					227	247		10.1080/00288330.2006.9517417								WOS:000239326700002

Despite this and the significant influence of BoB on the Indian monsoon and weather, information on aerosols and its spatial and temporal heterogeneity is sparse. The observations onboard several cruises and on an island location have been used in this paper along with satellite ( MODIS onboard TERRA satellite) data ( 2000 - 2004) to study the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in aerosol properties. Our studies show that seasonal variation in aerosol optical depths over northern BoB are similar to that of east coast of India and west China, whereas variations over the southern BoB region are similar to that of Arabian Sea. The aerosol optical depths (AODs) and black carbon ( BC) mass fraction (MF) over northern BoB reach their maximum value during April/May (AOD similar to 0.48 +/- 0.06; BCMF similar to 6%) and minimum during October/November ( AOD similar to 0.19 +/- 0.02; BCMF similar to 3%) in contrast to the seasonal pattern reported over Arabian Sea by earlier investigations. Over equatorial Indian Ocean south of BoB, AODs were low ( similar to 0.11 +/- 0.03) and seasonal variations were not very significant. The whole-sky ( including clouds) aerosol surface radiative forcing (0.2 to 40 mu m) over northern BoB was in the range of - 9 to - 30 W m(-2), whereas that over southern BoB was in the range of - 3 to - 12 W m(-2). The corresponding atmospheric forcing was in the range of + 6 to + 20 W m(-2) and + 1 to + 6 W m(-2). The atmospheric absorption translates to a heating rate of 0.5 to 1.0 K/day.					Moorthy, K.

Dramatic changes in the Black Sea's ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. This paper is an application of multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite remotely sensed data (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, SAR ERS, ASTER, MODIS) over a period of time between 1975 and 2003 for North-Western Black Sea coastal zone change detection assessment. Spectral mixture analysis, supervised and unsupervised classification are used to study chosen test areas. The results can be utilized as a temporal land-use change model for a region to quantify the extent and nature of change, and aid in future prediction studies, which helps in planning environmental agencies to develop sustainable land-use practices.																	1454-4164					FEB	2006	8	1					252	256										WOS:000236107300056

Nearshore retention of upwelled waters north and south of Point Reyes (northern California) - Patterns of surface temperature and chlorophyll observed in CoOP WEST	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Retentive embayments can be found near capes in upwelling regions, where they stand out as relatively warm features with higher chlorophyll a concentrations than surrounding waters. Within the area of the "Wind Events and Shelf Transport" study site (WEST) from the Gulf of the Farallones to Point Arena (37.5-39 degrees N and 122.5-124 degrees W), we describe two retentive embayments, extending approximately 20 km north of Point Reyes, and 30 km south of Point Reyes in the northern Gulf of the Farallones. These areas are identifiable from chlorophyll a (SeaWiFS) and sea-surface temperature (MODIS) satellite radiometry. Additional data from moorings and drifters were used to further characterize these retentive features. The persistence of these features is on time scales between 2 and 10 days, determined from time-series analysis of mooring data for chlorophyll and temperature. The alongshore wind stress is negatively correlated with chlorophyll and temperature mooring values. The time scale of persistence of these retentive features was similar to both the upwelling-relaxation timescale and the timescale of phytoplankton bloom development. The WEST region is notable in that the spring and summer is subject to the strongest wind stress along the US west coast, yet the coastal waters are highly productive. Based on our observations, we suggest that the apparent persistence of high biomass coastal waters in this strongly advective and wind-dominated system may be partially explained by the presence of retentive features identified in this study.

J	Satheesh, SK; Moorthy, KK; Kaufman, YJ; Takemura, T				Satheesh, SK; Moorthy, KK; Kaufman, YJ; Takemura, T			Aerosol optical depth, physical properties and radiative forcing over the Arabian Sea	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS												The Arabian Sea region (4 degrees N-20 degrees N to 50 degrees E-78 degrees E) has a unique weather pattern on account of the Indian monsoon and the associated winds that reverse direction seasonally. The aerosol data, collected using ship-borne and island platforms (for 8 years from 1995 to 2002) along with MODIS (onboard TERRA satellite) data (from 2000 to 2003) have been used to evolve a comprehensive characterisation of the spatial and temporal variation in the physical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols over the Arabian Sea. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found to increase with latitude between the equator and 12 degrees N. Over the northern Arabian Sea (regions lying north of 12 degrees N), AODs do not show significant latitudinal variations; the average aerosol optical depth for this region was 0.29 +/- 0.12 during winter monsoon season (WMS; November to March) and 0.47 +/- 0.14 during summer monsoon season (SMS; April/May to September). The corresponding Angstrom exponents were 0.7 +/- 0.12 and 0.3 +/- 0.08, respectively. The low values of the exponent during SMS indicate the dominance of large aerosols (mainly dust particles >1 mu m). The latitudinal gradient in AOD in the southern Arabian Sea is larger during SMS compared to WMS. The size distribution of aerosols shows two well-defined modes, one in the accumulation size regime and the other in the coarse size regime. During WMS, a third mode (nucleation) also appears in the sub micron range below similar to 0.1 mu m. The single scattering albedo does not show significant seasonal variations (remains within similar to 0.93 to 0.98 through out the year). During WMS (SMS), top of the atmosphere diurnally averaged aerosol forcing remains around -6.1 (-14.3) W m(-2) over the northern Arabian Sea up to around 12 degrees N and decreases southwards till it attains a value of -3.8 (-3.4) W m(-2) at the equator. The surface forcing remains around -16.2 (-15.2) W m(-2) over the northern Arabian Sea up to 12 degrees N and decreases southwards to a value of -5.5 (-3.5) W m(-2) at the equator. Over the north Arabian Sea, instantaneous forcing (flux change) at the surface can be as high as -50 W m(-2). The instantaneous forcing decreases with latitude in the southern Arabian Sea at a rate of similar to 3 W m(-2) deg(-1).

For the first time, truly synoptic SST and chl-a- concentration images are available. These images are daily and of 1.1-km resolution. The strong contrasts in sea-surface temperature and surface chlorophyll-a concentration over the southwest Atlantic make satellite infrared and color images particularly appropriate tools for studying the Brazil-Malvinas (B/M) Current confluence. We examine two years (July, 2002-June, 2004) of Aqua/MODIS infrared and color images to document the precise structure of the B/M confluence simultaneously in SST and chl-a. We first compared MODIS weekly data with simultaneous independent satellite data. Spatial and temporal distributions are similar for both SST and color. Differences between MODIS and SeaWiFS (sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor) are large in pigment-rich regions along the coast and shelf. Here, we focused on the offshore region where differences are small. For each season, exceptionally cloud-free 1.1-km resolution MODIS images showed two thermal fronts, one corresponding to the Brazil Current's southernmost limit, the other, to the Malvinas Current's northernmost limit. These two fronts remained quite close to each other (within 50 km) and were separated by water with an SST and chl-a concentration typical of the continental shelf waters. In spring, the water rich in chl-a from the platform is squeezed between the two currents and entrained away from the coast in between the two thermal fronts. In the frontal region, SST gradient maxima trace the contour of the chl-a-rich water. Enlargements of the frontal region and of the turbulent region downstream of the frontal collision are presented and analyzed. MODIS documents in an unprecedented way the SST and chl-a filaments as they are distorted and mixed by meso- and sub-mesoscale structures in the strain-dominated region of the B/M confluence. It is suggested that a substantial part of the chl-a local maximum in the Malvinas return flow is of continental-shelf origin.

J	Matheson, MA; Coakley, JA; Tahnk, WR				Matheson, MA; Coakley, JA; Tahnk, WR			Aerosol and cloud property relationships for summertime stratiform clouds in the northeastern Atlantic from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 4-km data collected over the northeastern Atlantic off the coast of the Iberian Peninsula for May to August 1995 were used to investigate the feasibility of empirically deriving estimates of the aerosol indirect radiative forcing. A retrieval scheme was used to derive cloud visible optical depth, droplet effective radius, cloud layer altitude, and pixel-scale fractional cloud cover. A two-channel aerosol retrieval scheme was used to determine aerosol optical depth in cloud-free pixels. Mean aerosol optical depths derived from the cloud-free pixels in 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude-longitude regions on a given satellite overpass were associated with mean cloud properties derived from the cloudy pixels in the same region for the same satellite overpass. The analysis was restricted to 1 degrees regions that contained only single-layered, low-level cloud systems. Because aerosol and cloud properties are highly variable, results for the 4-month period were composited into 5 degrees x 5 degrees latitude-longitude regions and averaged to obtain reliable trends in the cloud properties as functions of aerosol burden. Consistent with expectations for the aerosol indirect effect, in some 5 degrees regions, droplet effective radii decreased, and cloud visible optical depths increased as aerosol optical depths increased. The hypothesis that drizzle is suppressed in polluted clouds predicts that liquid water path should increase as aerosol burden increases. In three of the thirteen 5 degrees regions studied, the liquid water path increased as aerosol optical depth increased, but in none of the regions was the increase in cloud liquid water statistically significant. In the remaining regions, cloud liquid water remained constant or even decreased with increasing aerosol optical depth. In many of the 5 degrees regions, the retrieved aerosol optical depth increased as the percentage of cloudy pixels increased. Consistent with expectations from adiabatic cloud parcel models, droplet effective radius, cloud optical depth, and cloud liquid water path also increased as fractional cloud cover increased. The simultaneous increase in retrieved aerosol and cloud optical depths with increasing fractional cloud cover might have been due to the aerosol indirect effect, but it might also have resulted from processes that affect both the cloud and aerosol properties as cloud cover changes. The dependence on fractional cloud cover suggests that some of the trends between aerosol optical depth and the cloud properties cannot be solely attributed to the effects of the aerosols. For comparison with previous studies, the simultaneous changes in aerosol and cloud properties were used to estimate the daily average aerosol indirect forcing for overcast conditions in the summertime northeastern Atlantic. The magnitude of the indirect forcing relative to that of the direct forcing reported here is smaller than estimates reported by others.																	2169-897X					DEC 23	2005	110	D24							D24204	10.1029/2005JD006165								WOS:000234365200006

The target clouds are marine stratus and stratocumulus. They appeared over the Amami-Oshima Island, and off the south coast of Kyushu island. The principal goals of the comparison are to understand the characteristics of data obtained from each observing platform, and investigate the potentiality of synergistic use of multi platform data. The liquid water paths obtained from satellite (MODIS) observation by using the GLI cloud retrieval algorithm were compared with the ground-based measurements (microwave radiometer). The correlation coefficient and the root mean square error between ground and satellite liquid water path was 0.87 and 61.9 g/m(2). The satellite-retrieved cloud effective radius agreed with those from the aircraft measurements (FSSP) around the top of the cloud.

River discharge changes affect frontal locations, areal extent, and suspended sediment loads of the plume. During high river discharge ( > 20,000 m(3) s(-1)) in spring, the sediment plume extends 23 km southwestward, covers 2700 km(2), with maximum concentrations of 360 mg L-1. Plume temperatures vary seasonally from 10 degrees to 28 degrees C, with maximum surface fronts of 3.3 degrees C km(-1) in winter. East winds, prevalent in autumn, winter, and spring, drive a westward flow of river waters around the delta, linking two isolated shelf regions and increasing river discharge onto the Louisiana/Texas shelf. During peak river flow, this westward current exhibits velocities of 40-90 cm s(-1), is 20 km wide, and transports 140,000-165,000 m(3) s(-1) of river and shelf water. It usually turns toward the coast between 89.5 degrees W and 90 degrees W, feeding a clockwise gyre in the Louisiana Bight and a westward coastal current. The prevalent east winds trap river water and associated nutrients on the shelf where hypoxia later develops in late spring/summer. During autumn and winter, short-term wind reversals from frontal passages rapidly reverse plume direction, initiate off-shelf transport, and reduce residence times for river waters and associated sediments, nutrients, phytoplankton, and carbon. During summer, persistent southwest and south winds force river water eastward, where cross-margin transport is likely due to the relatively narrow shelf. Slope eddies and the Loop Current control river water after leaving the shelf.

J	Kokhanovsky, AA; Nauss, T				Kokhanovsky, AA; Nauss, T			Satellite-based retrieval of ice cloud properties using a semianalytical algorithm	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] A semianalytical algorithm for the retrieval of ice cloud properties from satellite data is presented. The new method is based on the semianalytical cloud retrieval algorithm and uses solutions of the asymptotic radiative transfer theory applicable for optically thick media. Therefore the new method is much less computer time expensive than the commonly used lookup table approaches. Usually, the cloud optical thickness and cloud effective droplet radius are reported for water and ice clouds even though both parameters are dependent on the actual crystal shape assumed in the retrieval procedures. Thus the authors propose to use the reduced optical thickness ( ROT) and the particle absorption length ( PAL) for the characterization of ice clouds. This implies that no a priori or climatological estimates of the particle shape/size distribution are necessary and increases the comparability of different cloud retrieval algorithms, which are built on many different distribution functions. If still necessary, the retrieved ROT and PAL can easily be transferred to values of the optical thickness and the cloud effective droplet radius by assuming any of those size distribution functions. The developed technique has been applied to data from the NASA EOS Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor. The scene shows Hurricane Jeanne just before its landfall near the coast of Florida in September 2004. Both the reduced cloud optical thickness and the particle absorption length have been derived for the eye wall region.

Analyses indicate that the significant offshore excursion of the October 2000 front is produced by a cross-shelf jet that coincides with passages of atmospheric cold fronts, which generate downwelling favorable winds. The frontal activities during July 2002 are associated with strong southwesterly winds in favor of upwelling and are likely produced by instabilities of the coastal currents. Multiple fronts within the tongue of the Changjiang ( Yangtze River) Diluted Water are observed in the summer of 2002. The significant cross-shelf jet, the instability waves, and the multiple tongues of the Changjiang Diluted Water are reported for the first time.																	0094-8276	1944-8007				OCT 7	2005	32	19							L19603	10.1029/2005GL023815								WOS:000232552300002
