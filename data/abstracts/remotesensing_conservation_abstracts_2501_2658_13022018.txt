Central to any conservation planning for the black-tailed prairie dog is an appropriate detection and monitoring technique. Because coarse-resolution satellite imagery is not adequate to detect black-tailed prairie dog colonies, we examined the usefulness of recently available high-resolution (1-m) satellite imagery. In 6 purchased scenes of national grasslands, we were easily able to visually detect small and large colonies without using image-processing algorithms. The Ikonos (Space Imaging(TM)) satellite imagery was as adequate as large-scale aerial photography to delineate colonies. Based on the high quality of imagery, we discuss a possible monitoring program for black-tailed prairie dog colonies throughout the Great Plains, using the species' distribution in North Dakota as an example. Monitoring plots could be established and imagery acquired periodically to track the expansion and contraction of colonies.																	0091-7648					SUM	2002	30	2					405	411										WOS:000176822700013

About 25 ha loss has been observed in dry evergreen forest and about 35 and 1306 ha loss is observed in the semi-evergreen and dry deciduous forests, respectively. About 69% of the present forest area is under low risk category, 25% is under medium risk category and about 2% (581 ha) is under the high-risk category. Mapping the forest resources in the Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu on 1 : 50,000 scale and its transformation in the last decade is not only a pioneer study, but also an useful information, especially for conservation and planning.																	0011-3891					MAY 25	2002	82	10					1259	1267										WOS:000175956500024

Using a geographic information system and remote-sensing imagery, we examined patterns of habitat use around wolf dens in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. Sixteen den sites were sampled for eight habitat types in their immediately vicinity, as well as at radii of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 m. We used a resource-selection ratio to determine whether specific habitat types were preferred or avoided at different radii relative to the total proportion of habitat types found within the study area. Wolves established dens in areas with significantly high proportions of pine forest up to and including a 1000-m radius and low proportions of tolerant and intolerant hardwoods within 500 m. We conclude that wolves establish den sites based primarily on the presence of pine forest, a habitat that is frequently logged within Park boundaries and subject to problems with regeneration after cutting. Dens sites are likely not limiting in this population, but our results suggest the need to protect current den sites at a relatively large spatial scale. These results also provide unique information to assess the potential for recolonization and reintroduction of wolf populations in other areas.

J	Vrieling, A; Sterk, G; Beaulieu, N				Vrieling, A; Sterk, G; Beaulieu, N			Erosion risk mapping: A methodological case study in the Colombian Eastern Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Soil erosion caused by water is an increasing global problem. Land use and soil conservation planning for large areas requires erosion risk maps, which are typically created using erosion models. These models are often developed for different regions than where they are applied. This paper describes a new qualitative methodology for mapping soil erosion risks over large areas, called Qualitative Erosion Risk Mapping (QUERIM). It is a flexible method that uses decision trees to assign ratings to the erosion-controlling factors. Constructed using expert knowledge, these decision trees reflect the important characteristics influencing erosion risk within a specific region. Ratings for erosion-controlling factors are combined at every location to obtain potential and actual erosion risk maps. QUERIM was applied to the Puerto Lopez municipality in the Colombian Eastern Plains. The obtained erosion risk maps showed agreement with field observations of erosion risk. However, more ground data should be gathered for a better evaluation of the method. It is concluded that a simple qualitative approach such as QUERIM can be more effective in erosion risk mapping than the use of models that were not developed for the region to which they are applied.

J	Cochrane, MA; Laurance, WF				Cochrane, MA; Laurance, WF			Fire as a large-scale edge effect in Amazonian forests	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Amazonian forests are being rapidly cleared, and the remaining forest fragments appear unusually vulnerable to fire. This occurs because forest remnants have dry, Ere-prone edges, are juxtaposed with frequently burned pastures, and are often degraded by selective logging, which increases forest desiccation and fuel loading. Here we demonstrate that in eastern Amazonia, fires are operating as a large-scale edge effect in the sense that most fires originate outside fragments and penetrate considerable distances into forest interiors. Multi-temporal analyses of satellite imagery from two frontier areas reveal that fire frequency over 12-14-y periods was substantially elevated within at least 2400 m of forest margins. Application of these data with a mathematical core-area model suggests that even large forest remnants (up to several hundred thousand ha in area) could be vulnerable to edge-related fires. The synergistic interactions of forest fragmentation, logging and human-ignited fires pose critical threats to Amazonian forests, particularly in more seasonal areas of the basin.

Land cover maps from 1956 and 1998 were co-registered and rasterized to the same spatial resolution in a geographic information system (GIS) and the land cover classes of both maps aggregated to a new common legend. Classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper images and field checking were used to generate the 1998 map. Comparisons between the two dates indicate that major changes have occurred in the Cacheu area, both in the extent and the spatial distribution of some vegetation classes, with decreases in areas of mangrove, dry forest and palm grove, and large increases in mudflats and savanna. In Orango, changes are less extensive, but the onset of some of the trends verified in Cacheu can be identified. The results are interpreted, taking into account land use practices in the two study regions, and will hopefully become a management and conservation tool for the local park authorities.

J	Jokisch, BD; Lair, BM				Jokisch, BD; Lair, BM			One last stand? Forests and change on Ecuador's eastern cordillera	GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW												Tropical montane forests are known for their ecological importance. Most montane forests in Ecuador have been converted to agriculture, and those that remain are concentrated on the eastern cordillera. Understanding, of land-use-land-cover change in this ecological zone is inadequate. Using remote sensing (Landsat TM, SPOT) and fieldwork, we document land-use-land-cover change in two watersheds on Ecuador's eastern cordillera (Canar Province). During the 1990s the region experienced a 0.58 percent annual rate of deforestation, but two areas within it show active signs of re/afforestation. Although conversion of forest to pasture for cattle grazing continues, human migration to the United States is likely to affect the trajectory of future land-use-land-cover change.																	0016-7428					APR	2002	92	2					235	256		10.2307/4140972								WOS:000181113300006

A number of diverse manipulations were completed under the direction of federal agency and university scientists, and abundant remote sensing imagery is available to assist in relocating the treatments and evaluating their success. This is particularly important because few of the treatments were maintained following the loss of scientific personnel coinciding with the start of World War II, and most records of Civilian Conservation Corps scientific work were lost with the disbanding of the agency in 1942. Aerial photography, which was systematically used to image the United States beginning in the 1930s, can be used to identify types of treatments, measure areal coverage, estimate longevity, and help plan locations for new experiments. No long-lasting vegetation response could be determined for contour terraces, brush water spreaders, strips grubbed free of shrubs (despite the fact that these strips have remained visible for 65 years), and mechanical rootplowing and seeding. Distinct positive, long-term vegetation responses could be seen in aerial photos for water retention dikes, certain fenced exclosures, and some boundaries where different land management practices meet. It appears from both aerial photos and existing conventional records that experimental manipulation of rangelands has often been ineffective on the landscape scale because treatments are not performed over large enough contiguous areas and hydrological and ecological processes overwhelm the treatments. In addition, treatments are not maintained over time, treatment evaluation periods are sometimes too short, multi-purpose treatments are not used to maximize effects, and treatments are often not located in appropriate sites.

J	Kozlowski, TT				Kozlowski, TT			Physiological ecology of natural regeneration of harvested and disturbed forest stands: implications for forest management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Forests are indispensable as sources of harvested products and a variety of services. Unfortunately forests throughout the world, and especially in the tropics, are threatened by natural and human-induced disturbances. Regeneration of harvested or otherwise severely disturbed forest stands typically occurs in four stages: (1) stand initiation and regeneration stage, (2) thinning or stem exclusion stage, (3) transition or understory regeneration stage, and (4) steady-state or old-growth stage. Blocks to stand regeneration may occur in each of these stages. Revegetation of severely-disturbed forests often is very slow and unpredictable because of complex interactions among propagules as well as site and climatic conditions. Stand regeneration depends on an abundant and viable seed supply, a suitable medium for seed germination, favorable environmental conditions, and capacity for sprouting or layering of some species. Massive losses of seeds in seed banks occur because of seed aging, failure of seed germination, predation, diseases, and death of seeds. Mortality of seedlings also is high, especially in the cotyledon stage of development, because of low reserves of carbohydrates and mineral nutrients. Growth of older seedlings, saplings, and mature trees is inhibited by air and soil pollution, drought, flooding, soil compaction, insect attacks, and diseases. After canopy closure occurs in a developing forest stand changes in species composition are traceable to competition among plants for light, water, and mineral nutrients. Following severe disturbance of a multi-aged, mixed forest, a mixed-species stand of fast growing, generally short-lived trees typically occupies a site and is succeeded by species that dominated the stand before the disturbance occurred. After a minor disturbance gaps form in the canopy and are recolonized. If plant succession in a developing stand runs its full course the resulting old-growth forest is impacted by frequent minor disturbances and is maintained in an oscillating steady-state in which stand establishment, thinning, gap formation, and colonization recur. In some regions frequent fires maintain forest stands in a subclimax stage of development. Natural regeneration of harvested or otherwise severely disturbed stands likely will be too slow and unpredictable to provide all the forest products and services required by increasing population growth. Hence, greater emphasis on several concurrent strategies will be needed, including heavy emphasis on artificial regeneration of disturbed forests; conservation of the remaining tropical forests; expansion of plantations, agroforestry systems, and forest reserves; expansion of tree improvement programs; more intensive and improved forest management; and expanded research with particular emphasis on seed biology, responses of tree species and genotypes to environmental stresses, tradeoffs between beneficial and harmful effects of environmental stresses on tree species and genotypes, genetic engineering, potential effects of global warming on forests, agroforestry systems, models of stand productivity; and appraisal by remote sensing of injury to forest ecosystems.

J	Trepanier, I; Dubois, JMM; Bonn, F				Trepanier, I; Dubois, JMM; Bonn, F			Monitoring the evolution of a coastline using SPOT HRV (XS) images: Application to the delta of the Red River in Vietnam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The coastal environment occupies a prime role in the economy and the development of Vietnam. To facilitate the planning of conservation and development measures in this sector, it is necessary to monitor on a continuous basis the changes occurring in the coastline. HRV SPOT-1 and SPOT-2 images, acquired respectively in 1986 and 1991, are used for determining the accumulation-erosion budget for a 14 km portion of coastline. Both aerial photographs acquired in 1986 and ground campaign results (1994) are used as ground data. After applying rigorous geometric corrections and sensor harmonization for stabilizing the dynamics of the HRV images in order to simulate the acquisition of the two images as if recorded by the same sensor, we are able to make a good image comparison. The SAVI vegetation index (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index) is used as the basis for developing a binary mask solely for the vegetation cover on the remote sensing images. The removal of the 1991 mask from the 1986 mask enhances the predominance of erosion in the study area, i.e. 0.62 km over five years. However, because of the multidate character of remote sensing data it is possible to predict the overall trend in the evolution of the coastal environment.																	0143-1161					MAR	2002	23	5					917	937		10.1080/01431160110070348								WOS:000174122400007

We identify its benefits and costs to encourage social scientlists to consider the use of remote sensing as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutions. Methods. We analyze two multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images to evaluate a habitat conservation plan (HCP) implemented Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. Results, Image analysis provides useful broad spatial scale information on HCP performance that is not discernible to the naked eye or through other methodologies. Conclusions. Satellite image analysis should be considered as a tool for planning and evaluating environmental institutional designs-despite the financial costs and requisite technical training. These images provide ecological and land cover change information that may not be available elsewhere. We provide lessons learned to help make analysts cognizant of some important issues Surrounding the use of satellite-based imagery for environmental institutional analysis.																	0038-4941					MAR	2002	83	1					244	262		10.1111/1540-6237.00081								WOS:000173943500016

J	Jain, SK; Goel, MK				Jain, SK; Goel, MK			Assessing the vulnerability to soil erosion of the Ukai Dam catchments using remote sensing and GIS	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												The investigation of basins for planning soil conservation requires a selective approach to identify smaller hydrological units, which would be suitable for more efficient and targeted conservation management programmes. One criterion, generally used to determine the vulnerability of catchments to erosion, is the sediment yield of a basin. In India, sediment yield data are generally not collected for smaller sub-catchments and it becomes difficult to identify the most vulnerable areas for erosion that can be treated on a priority basis. An index-based approach, based on the surface factors mainly responsible for soil erosion, is suggested in this study. These factors include soil type, vegetation, slope and various catchment properties such as drainage density, form factor, etc. The method is illustrated with a case study of subcatchments immediately upstream of the Ukai Reservoir located on them River Tapi in Gujarat State, India. The area is divided into 16 watersheds and different soil, vegetation, topography and morphology-related parameters are estimated separately for each watershed. Satellite data are used to evaluate the soil and vegetation indices, while a GIS system is used to evaluate the topography and morphology-related indices. The integrated effect of all the parameters is evaluated to find different areas vulnerable to soil erosion. Two watersheds were identified as being most susceptible to soil erosion. Based on the integrated index, a priority rating of the watersheds for soil conservation planning is recommended.																	0262-6667					FEB	2002	47	1					31	40		10.1080/02626660209492905								WOS:000173955900003

The methods to map spatial distribution of seagrass and seaweed beds are reviewed. They are classified into two categories. One is a direct method by visual observation and the other is an indirect method using a remote sensing apparatus. Indirect methods are divided into optical or hydro-acoustic methods. Indirect methods require sea truth by direct methods. Optical methods are image analysis of aerial photography or satellite imagery. They are effective for mapping broad areas but limited to shallow waters due to light attenuation in waters. Hydro-acoustic methods such as an echosounder and a side scan sonar have no limitation of turbidity The echosounder is practical to map vertically density and height distributions of seagrass and seaweed beds. The side scan sonar is appropriate for mapping broad horizontal distributions. Coupling of several indirect mapping methods is more useful than using only one method.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing for photogrammetric stereo-mapping and digital elevation model ( DEM) extraction within remote mountainous terrain. As a case study, a landscape analysis of the Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area of east Nepal ( 27.5 degrees N, 87.0 degrees E) was examined. The study area is a highly complex and rugged mountain landscape, with extreme topographic relief and an elevation gradient spanning more than 8300 m. A DEM extracted from stereo SPOT imagery resulted in a median disagreement of 58 m when compared to a DEM generated from a conventionally digitized GIS dataset of topographic contours (scale= 1:250000). Visual comparison of the two DEMs showed substantial agreement at the landscape scale, while larger scale comparison of 100 m contours revealed some localized differences. The SPOT extracted DEM provided equal or better basis for orthorectification of satellite imagery when compared to the conventional DEM. Derivative landscape analysis outputs, such as hydrological modelling, drainage networks and watershed boundaries, compared well with results based upon the conventional dataset. Intermediate map products useful for field research and mapping included production of an orthorectified satellite base-map image. Additionally, a fused multisensor high resolution image of the study area, combining Landsat Thematic Mapper ( TM) and SPOT imagery at 10 m resolution, was orthorectified to produce a false-colour satellite image map highlighting the spectral discrimination between land cover classes.

This paper examines a portion of Lake Superior's shoreline vi,here coastal landscape has been shaped by the introduction of 25 billion kg of stamp sand from the copper industry and subsequent dynamics associated with longshore currents. Shoreline areal change from this movement is documented through comparison of archival and current air photos. A series of historical air photo mosaics were processed with a Geographic Information System (GIS). Sets of spatially registered, temporal map polygons were developed to illustrate and allow, measurement of the areas of erosion and deposition, relevant to shoreline planning and measurement. Measurements indicate that the length of shoreline affected by the stamp sand increased by 2.4 km during a 59-year period. Measurements of area indicate a decrease of 8 ha in the same amount of time. Breadth of the stamp sand shows discernable decline of 630 in width at the original deposit area at the north near Gay, Michigan, and increase of 410 m width 1,500 in southward along the coast.

Cattle, ranching and cash cropping among Shuar and colonists in Ecuador	LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW												Observers have argued that as indigenous peoples become more acculturated and their reserves more populous, they begin to exploit tropical rain forests much as colonists acid other outsiders do. The history of changes in land use between 1950 and 1980 among the Shuar, an indigenous group in the Ecuadorian Amazon, would appear to support this convergence thesis. The Shuar began to clear land, plant pastures, and acquire cattle, much like their mestizo competitors for land. Using survey and remote-sensing data for a later period, from 1987 to 1997, we demonstrate that convergence has given way to divergence in land-use trends among the two groups. While mestizo smallholders throughout the region continue to rely on cattle ranching, Shuar smallholders close to roads have begun to reforest their lands and cultivate formers garden crops like coffee and cacao as cash crops. These recent trends in Shuar land use suggest that even when Amerindians become more acculturated, they still maintain more biologically diverse landscapes than their mestizo neighbors.																	0023-8791						2002	37	1					144	159										WOS:000174045800006						
J	Weng, QH				Weng, QH			Modeling urban growth effects on surface runoff with the integration of remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A methodology is developed to relate urban growth studies to distributed hydrological modeling using an integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS. This linkage is possible because both studies share land-use and land-cover data. Landsat Thematic Mapper data are utilized to detect urban land-cover changes. GIS analyses are then conducted to examine the changing spatial patterns of urban growth. The integration of remote sensing and GIS is applied to automate the estimation of surface runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service model. Impacts of urban growth on surface runoff and the rainfall-runoff relationship are examined by linking the two modeling results with spatial analysis techniques. This methodology is applied to the Zhujiang Delta of southern China, where dramatic urban growth has occurred over the past two decades, and the rampant urban growth has created severe problems in water resources management. The results revealed a notably uneven spatial pattern of urban growth and an increase of 8.10 mm in annual runoff depth during the 1989-1997 period. An area that experienced more urban growth had a greater potential for increasing annual surface runoff. Highly urbanized areas were more prone to flooding. Urbanization lowered potential maximum storage, and thus increased runoff coefficient values.

J	Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A				Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A			Application of remote sensing data to monitor mangroves and other coastal vegetation of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES												Remote sensing data, because of its repetitive, synoptic and multi-spectral nature, has proved to be of an immense value in monitoring of coastal vegetation. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data have been extensively used to map mangroves and other coastal vegetation for the entire country's coastline. Large database on spatial extent of mangroves and their condition has been created on 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scale using IRS data (the database provides information for the first time on the mangrove areas of the entire Indian coast). Based on this study, it was observed that the Kori creek, Gujarat, has large area under mangroves. The repetitive nature of the data has helped in monitoring vital and critical areas, periodically. In one such study, on the Marine National Park, in the Gulf of Kachchh, mangrove areas were monitored for the last 25 years. The degradation of mangroves continued up to 1985 and the condition significantly improved due to the adoption of conservation measures. This has helped in planning various management actions to conserve this vital ecosystem. IRS data have been used in identifying dominant plant communities in many mangrove areas such as Bhitarkanika, Coringa, Mandovi estuary in Goa and the Gulf of Kachchh, etc, This is a unique approach for providing spatial information at plant community level and can be seen as a first step towards bio-diversity assessment. Along with the mangroves, seaweed, seagrass beds and dune vegetation have also been mapped with reasonable accuracy. With the better sensors planned for future, remote sensing-based information is going to be one of the major inputs in the preparation of management action plans.																	0379-5136					DEC	2001	30	4					195	213										WOS:000173106900001						
J	Khan, MA; Gupta, VP; Moharana, PC				Khan, MA; Gupta, VP; Moharana, PC			Watershed prioritization using remote sensing and geographical information system: a case study from Guhiya, India	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Land resource development programmes are applied generally on a watershed basis. Delineation of watersheds within a large drainage basin and their prioritization is required for proper planning and management of natural resources for sustainable crop production. An integral part of Guhiya basin (with an area of 1614 km(2)) was studied for priority watershed delineation with the objective of selecting watersheds to under take soil and water conservation measures using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques. Using the terrain information derived from geocoded satellite data and 1:50,000 topographic maps, 68 watersheds were assessed on the basis of their erosivity and sediment-yield index values. Thematic maps of landform, landuse and land-cover, and slope were digitised using ARC/INFO. On the basis of sediment yield index values the watersheds were grouped into very high, high, moderate and low priorities. High priority watersheds with very high SYI value (> 150) need immediate attention for soil and water conservation whereas, low priority watershed having good vegetative cover and low SYI value (< 50) may not need immediate attention for such treatments.

J	Yang, C; Bradford, JM; Wiegand, CL				Yang, C; Bradford, JM; Wiegand, CL			Airborne multispectral imagery for mapping vartable growing conditions and yields of cotton, grain sorghum, and corn	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE												Airborne remote sensing is becoming increasingly useful for mapping plant growth and yield variations in precision agriculture, but operational methodologies are not well developed nor tested. The main objective of this study was to integrate airborne multispectral imagery, ground observations, global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), image processing, and yield monitoring for mapping spatial variations in plant growth and yield. A 30.4-ha dryland field that was divided into two conventional tillage strips and two conservation minimum tillage strips was the study site. The field was planted to cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in 1996, to grain sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Moench) in 1997, and to corn (Zea mays L.) in 1998 Airborne color-infrared (CIR) digital imagery was acquired from the field on three dates in each growing season and ground observations (plant populations, height, yield) were made at 29 sites within the field. A yield monitor was also used to record yields at harvest for grain sorghum and corn. These images and the ground measurements were integrated within a GIS to document, interpret, and map within-season and across-season plant growth and yield variability. The images clearly revealed plant growth patterns within and across the three growing seasons as well as differences between the two tillage systems. Yields of cotton, grain sorghum, and corn were related to the image data for the three spectral bands and four vegetation indices (two band ratios and two normalized differences) extracted at the 29 sampling sites. Regression equations for yield as a function of a spectral band or a vegetation index for each crop were developed and the best equations with R-2 Values of 0.57, 0.59, and 0.76 for cotton, grain sorghum, and corn, respectively, I were used to estimate the yields for each of the approximately 30,000 pixels. The yield maps generated from the image data based on the regression equations corresponded closely with yield monitor data maps. Recommended operational procedures are summarized. This study illustrates practical ways to integrate airborne digital imagery with spatial information technology and ground observations to map plant growth conditions and yield variations within crop fields.																	0001-2351					NOV-DEC	2001	44	6					1983	1994										WOS:000174263600075

In despite of the millionaire investments, lake reclamation has been impossible. Soil erosion is the main source of damage and loss storage capacity of the lake. Conventional tillage has stressed soil loss mainly in hillslope deforested lands. Conservation tillage is an alternative effective to reduce both soil loss and surface runoff. The aim of this study was to apply empiric erosion models to satellite data in order to simulate soil erosion, and to locate and evaluate erosion source areas. The evaluated treatments were soil erosion models from conventional till (CT) and conservation till with 100% residue soil cover (NT-100). The satellite images Landsat-TM multispectral 6 bands, 30 m of spatial resolution taken on April of 1994, were analysed using GIS Idrisi 2.0 for Windows to correct and georeference the images. Training fields and spectral signatures were displayed and assigned to images issuing the classified image supervised. This image was evaluated with the digital elevation model and the erosion model of each treatment. Results indicated that CT accounts for 6.9 t/ha of sediment yield contrasting with 1.3 t/ha of NT-100. CT alters 26% of the watershed area while NT-100 may alter 8.1 % of the area. This investigation is an alternative to locate, model and anticipate erosion sources of the Lake of Patzcuaro watershed.																	0186-4076					OCT-DEC	2001	16	4					107	115										WOS:000172112900010						
J	Manel, S; Williams, HC; Ormerod, SJ				Manel, S; Williams, HC; Ormerod, SJ			Evaluating presence-absence models in ecology: the need to account for prevalence	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Models for predicting the distribution of organisms from environmental data are widespread in ecology and conservation biology. Their performance is invariably evaluated from the percentage success at predicting occurrence at test locations. 2. Using logistic regression with real data from 34 families of aquatic invertebrates in 180 Himalayan streams, we illustrate how this widespread measure of predictive accuracy is affected systematically by the prevalence (i.e. the frequency of occurrence) of the target organism. Many evaluations of presence-absence models by ecologists are inherently misleading. 3. With the same invertebrate models, we examined alternative performance measures used in remote sensing and medical diagnostics. We particularly explored receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) plots, from which were derived (i) the area under each curve (AUC), considered an effective indicator of model performance independent of the threshold probability at which the presence of the target organism is accepted, and (ii) optimized probability thresholds that maximize the percentage of true absences and presences that are correctly identified. We also evaluated Cohen's kappa, a measure of the proportion of all possible cases of presence or absence that are predicted correctly after accounting for chance effects. 4. AUC measures from ROC plots were independent of prevalence, but highly significantly correlated with the much more easily computed kappa. Moreover, when applied in predictive mode to test data, models with thresholds optimized by ROC erroneously overestimated true occurrence among scarcer organisms, often those of greatest conservation interest. We advocate caution in using ROC methods to optimize thresholds required for real prediction. 5. Our strongest recommendation is that ecologists reduce their reliance on prediction success as a performance measure in presence-absence modelling. Cohen's kappa provides a simple, effective, standardized and appropriate statistic for evaluating or comparing presence-absence models, even those based on different statistical algorithms. None of the performance measures we examined tests the statistical significance of predictive accuracy, and we identify this as a priority area for research and development.

We estimated forest cover for Costa Rica using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite scenes acquired between 1986 and 1991. In 1991, 29 percent (ca 14,000 km(2)) of the land cover of Costa Rica was closed forest cover; of that forested area, ca 30 percent is protected by national conservation policies. Forest loss in a study area representing ca 50 percent of Costa Mca's territory during a five-year period (1986-1991) was 2250 km(2), and the estimated deforestation rate was ca 450 km(2)/yr, or ca 4.2 percent/yr, of remaining forest cover. Forests are almost completely eliminated from the Tropical Moist Forest and Premontane Moist Forest life zones, and the level of fragmentation of remaining forests may be more advanced than previously thought.

J	Hayes, DJ; Sader, SA				Hayes, DJ; Sader, SA			Comparison of change-detection techniques for monitoring tropical forest clearing and vegetation regrowth in a time series	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												The once remote and inaccessible forests of Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) have recently experienced high rates of deforestation corresponding to human migration and expansion of the agricultural frontier. Given the importance of land-cover and land-use change data in conservation planning, accurate and efficient techniques to detect forest change from multi-temporal satellite imagery were desired for implementation by local conservation organizations. Three dates of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, each acquired two years apart, were radiometrically normalized and preprocessed to remove clouds, water, and wetlands, prior to employing the change-detection algorithm. Three change-detection methods were evaluated: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image differencing, principal component analysis, and RGB-NDVI change detection. A technique to generate reference points by visual interpretation of color composite Landsat images, for Kappa-optimizing thresholding and accuracy assessment, was employed. The highest overall accuracy was achieved with the RGB-NDVI method (85 percent). This method was also preferred for its simplicity in design and ease in interpretation, which were important considerations for transferring remote sensing technology to local and international non-governmental organizations.

J	Gillespie, TW				Gillespie, TW			Remote sensing of animals	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The improved accuracy and precision of animal tracking via satellites has made a significant impact on quantifying large-scale biogeographic patterns for a variety of taxa with important implications for conservation and natural resource management. This paper reviews research undertaken from 1995 to 1999 to provide an overview of advances in the remote sensing of animal movements in both terrestrial and marine environments and to identify promising trends for biogeographic research in the twenty-first century. Remote sensing of animals by satellite provides a new method to test a number of biogeographic hypotheses related to migration and can identify a number of environmental correlates associated with the distributions of species. Tracking of smaller species and increases in sample size are sure to occur as transmitter size and cost continue to decrease in the next decade. Geographers can significantly contribute to the understanding of species dispersal and distributional patterns by combining real-time and archived global and regional datasets with existing data from past studies and future research projects. Only four studies used GIS data or remote sensed imagery in this review, while the remaining studies cited used simple digital line graphs of countries, topography, land and sea boundaries.																	0309-1333					SEP	2001	25	3					355	362		10.1177/030913330102500303								WOS:000170569400003						
J	Rao, KS; Pant, R				Rao, KS; Pant, R			Land use dynamics and landscape change pattern in a typical micro watershed in the mid elevation zone of central Himalaya, India	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The amount, the rate and the intensity of land use and land cover change are very high in developing countries. The human impacts upon the land are still very great and increasing. This study analyses the process of human-induced landscape transformation in a micro watershed in mid elevation zone of central Himalaya of India in 1963, 1986 and 1996. The watershed (about 80 km(2) in size) comprises a small mountainous valley with steep slopes and deep cut ravines, typical of the landscape pattern in high population intensity mid elevation zone of central Himalaya. The spatial and temporal change patterns of land use were quantified by interpreting remote sensing (RS) data and use a geographical information system (GIS). During the last 33 years, the vegetal cover was altered drastically with increasing population pressure (both human and animal), agricultural activities and industrial wood/raw material extraction activities. The traditional rain fed agriculture on raised terraces has passed through a process of agricultural intensification but this in turn reduced crop species diversity. Restriction on agricultural expansion by transferring large parts of vegetated areas to conservation forestry under government control and unrestrained agricultural expansion on community lands which supported fuel. fodder and manure requirements has resulted in a unbalanced land use. This in turn led to deforestation and environmental degradation. Some limiting factors such as socio-economic and policy forces caused these changes in natural resource management practices and the resulting land use patterns. The study showed that although development interventions such as World Bank aided Integrated Watershed Development Programme, etc., showed promising results in regenerating the resources, the lack of follow-up required after programme withdrawal might cause the deterioration of resources accrued during such regeneration activities. Such local impacts need to be considered in national policies and especially when time bound international aid based programmes are to be implemented, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Wang, YQ; Moskovits, DK				Wang, YQ; Moskovits, DK			Tracking fragmentation of natural communities and changes in land cover: Applications of landsat data for conservation in an urban landscape (Chicago wilderness)	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Greater Chicago is home to a surprisingly high concentration of globally significant natural communities. Within the metropolis survive some of the world's best remaining examples of eastern tallgrass prairie, oak savanna, open oak woodland, and prairie wetland. Chicago Wilderness is more than 81,000 ha of protected areas in the urban and suburban matrix. It also is the name of the coalition of more than 110 organizations committed to the survival of these natural lands. The long-term health of these imperiled communities depends on proper management of the more extensive, restorable lands that surround and connect the patches of high-quality habitat. Information critical to the success of conservation efforts in the region includes (1) a current vegetation map of Chicago Wilderness in sufficient detail to allow quantitative goal setting for the regions biodiversity recovery plan; (2) quantified fragmentation status of the natural communities; and (3) patterns of land-cover change and their effects on the vitality of communities under threat. We used multispectral data from the Landsat thematic mapper (October 1997) and associated ground truthing to produce a current vegetation map. With multitemporal remote-sensing data (acquired in 1972, 1985, and 1997), we derived land-cover maps of tide region at roughly equivalent intervals over the past 25 years. Analyses with geographic information system models reveal rapid acceleration of urban and suburban sprawl over the past 12 years. Satellite images provide striking visual comparisons of land use and health. They also provide banks of geographically referenced data that make quantitative tracking of trends possible. The data on habitat degradation and fragmentation are the biological foundation of quantitative goals for regional restoration.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					835	843		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004835.x								WOS:000170179600011						
J	Muldavin, EH; Neville, P; Harper, G				Muldavin, EH; Neville, P; Harper, G			Indices of grassland biodiversity in the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion derived from remote sensing	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We used a relatively simple and direct remote-sensing approach to determine biodiversity values in arid ecosystems and thus identify potential conservation sites. We developed indices based on regression models between, grass, shrub, litter, exposed-soil groundcover components and Landsat thematic mapper satellite imagery reflectance values over a reference site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert in New Mexico. This site supports low-disturbance grasslands that have been under a continuous grazing regime for over 100 years. Greater richness and abundance of noninvasive and nonruderal plant species were associated with the low-disturbance grasslands that had lower shrub abundance, increased litter and grass cover, and lower exposed soil. Using the thematic mapper indices, we computed an additive grassland biodiversity index such that, as exposed soil and shrub values go down, litter and grass values go up, as does the biodiversity index. When the biodiversity index was applied to the reference-site landscape, grasslands previously identified for their high conservation value were detected. As a further test, we applied the indices to a site in Chihuahua, Mexico, that supports similar grasslands but for which there are few other data on condition and conservation values. The soil, grass, and shrub indices were moderately effective in describing the range of variation at the Mexico site, but the litter equation was not. Still, higher biodiversity value in terms of nonruderal plant diversity tended to correspond to higher grass cover and lower soil exposure and a higher overall biodiversity index. Some localized calibration with geologic substrate may be required along with an assessment of the temporal constraints, but generally the index shows promise for quickly and efficiently detecting desert grasslands of high biodiversity conservation value.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					844	855		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004844.x								WOS:000170179600012

All recent vegetation surveys have been based on optic il satellite data, which is hampered by cloud cover and by southern Bahia's intricate mix of forest patches with other tree crops, especially cocoa. We describe the application of radar remote-sensing data to distinguish forest patches from cocoa planted in the shade of natural-forest trees, Radar, unlike optical sensors, is not obstructed by cloud cover and can acquire information about-forest structure by penetrating into the vegetation canopy The vegetation map generated from radar data clearly separates forest patches based on the degree of structural disturbance such as the density of shaded trees, the openness of the canopy, and the density of the monodominant Erythyrina shaded trees. The structural classification based on the radar data, and shown on the map, can help researchers assess the degree of fragmentation of the original Atlantic coastal forest and delineate areas of less disturbance with higher potential for conservation of biodiversity. This information can then be applied to conservation planning, especially the design and monitoring of nature reserves and the modeling of biological corridors.																	0888-8892					AUG	2001	15	4					867	875		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015004867.x								WOS:000170179600014

This data source is now more accessible because of improvements in digitizing technology. Internet file transfer, and availability of image processing software. We present three examples of conservation-related projects that benefited from the use of astronaut photographs. First, NASA scientist requested that astronauts photograph the area of the controversial Isahaya Bay reclamation project in Japan. Japanese researches used photograph from before and after the reclamation as a tool for communication with the public about the effects of tidal-flat loss. The newly acquired images and the availability of high-resolution digital images from NASA archives provided timely public information on the observed changes. Second, we digitally classified and analyzed a Space Shuttle photograph of Chobe National Park in Botswana to identify the locations of woodlands affected by elephants. Field validation later confirmed that area identified on the image showed evidence of elephant damage. Third, we used a summary map from intensive field surveys of seagrasses in Shoalwater Bay, Australia, as reference data for a supervised classification of a digitized photograph taken from orbit. The classification distinguished seagrasses, sediments and mangroves with accuracy approximating that in studies using other satellite remote-sensing data. Astronaut photographs are in the public domain, and the database of nearly 400,000 photographs from the late 1960s to the present is available as a single searchable location on the Internet (http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop). These photographs can be used by conservation biologists as a source of general information about the landscaped and for quantitative mapping.

In this paper, longterm observation of soil water, dry soil thickness and soil chemical changes are evaluated at eight locations in sandy soil. This paper subdivides the sandy lands and deserts of China into three climate zones: and (hyperarid and extremely arid), semiarid, and humid (subhumid and subtropical humid), with respect to the bioclimatic zone, aridity, soil water content, and soil chemical characteristics. The water movement conditions, and chemical variations in each zone are analyzed. The paper also estimates the spatial and temporal correlation function of and soil thickness and soil moisture. Sandy soils organic matter content, CaCO3 content, soluble salts content are investigated. Afforestation and selection of tree species in different sandy areas are suggested to regulate sandy land soil moisture. Sandy land in China can be divided into the four sand stabilization regions according to the shifting sand conditions and the techniques advanced: regions I, II, III, and IV. These results have important implications for remote sensing of soil moisture and soil organic carbon, and soil moisture parameterization in climate models.																	0943-0105					AUG	2001	40	9					1075	1083										WOS:000170527900003

Frequently, however, little is known about historical hydrological conditions, such as water levels, within wetlands. Moreover, many channel and ditch systems in wetlands arc not routinely monitored, except perhaps for research purposes. A methodology is presented herein which makes use of satellite imagery to indirectly provide remotely sensed observations of water levels within channels and ditches. Using multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and simultaneous ground-based measurements of water levels, statistical relationships are established between satellite-derived effective wet ditch widths and measured water levels in the drainage system of the Elmley Marshes, southeast England. These relationships can be used subsequently to estimate historical ditch water levels and to monitor contemporary ditch water levels in the wetland. The study shows that satellite imagery has much to offer in monitoring changes in the hydrological regime of wetlands and in providing complimentary approaches to field monitoring.

J	Zhou, L; Tsang, L; Jandhyala, V; Chen, CT				Zhou, L; Tsang, L; Jandhyala, V; Chen, CT			Studies on accuracy of numerical simulations of emission from rough ocean-like surfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Numerical simulation of passive microwave remote sensing of ocean surfaces has a strict requirement of accuracy. This is because the key output of the simulations is the difference of brightness temperature between a rough surface and a flat surface. Since the difference can be as small as 0.5 K, it is important to simulate the scattering and emission accurately. In this paper, we perform accurate simulations of transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) waves for ocean surfaces with relative permittivity = 28.9541 + i36.8430 at 19 GHz. Because ocean permittivity is large, we used up to 80 points per free space wavelength. Furthermore, accurate numerical integration is also performed to obtain accurate impedance matrix elements. To ensure accuracy, a matrix equation obtained from the surface integral equation formulation is solved by matrix inversion. Conservation of energy is required to be accurate to a relative error of 0.001, which corresponds to 0.3 K in brightness temperature. Numerical results are illustrated for rough surfaces with Gaussian spectrum and bandlimited ocean spectrum and bandlimited fractal surfaces. We show convergence with respect to the density of sampling points and with respect to raising the upper limit of the bandlimited ocean spectrum. Comparisons are also made with results with an impedance boundary condition approximation. Numerical results indicate that fine discretization is required for ocean-like surfaces with fine scale roughness.																	0196-2892					AUG	2001	39	8					1757	1763		10.1109/36.942554								WOS:000170682500016

Therefore, adoption of soil and water conservation measures is necessary for the optimal utilization of natural resources and to increase the productivity of land on a sustainable basis. Remote sensing and GIS techniques can be used for generating development plans for the watershed area in consonance with the production potential and limitation of terrain resources, and can also be used for assessing the impact of these measures before actual implementation in the field. This paper describes a case study for the Jasdan taluka (district) of Rajkot in Gujarat, India. The aims are to prioritize watersheds on the basis of runoff generated, expressed as yield, due to existing land use conditions; to suggest soil and water conservation measures; and to evaluate the hydrologic response of these measures on runoff. The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (CN) method was used for computing the runoff; subsequently runoff yield in percentage was calculated for prioritizing the watersheds. Satellite and other collateral data were used to identify the problems and potential in the watersheds and recommend measures for soil and water conservation. The impact of these measures was assessed by computing runoff under alternative land use and management practices. It was found that the runoff yield decreased by 42.88% of the pre-conservation value for the watershed.																	0143-1161					JUL 20	2001	22	11					2095	2108		10.1080/01431160117359								WOS:000169546300004						
J	Mumby, PJ				Mumby, PJ			Beta and habitat diversity in marine systems: a new approach to measurement, scaling and interpretation	OECOLOGIA												Habitat diversity is a widely used criterion for locating conservation activities such as protected areas. Most habitat diversity indices are measures of alpha diversity at the scale of habitats and are therefore insensitive to the underlying biological differences between habitats. To incorporate such inter-habitat differences, a new method is presented which calculates a measure of beta (beta) diversity from pixels within a window passed throughout a habitat map. To avoid confusion with beta diversity indices, the new measure is called beta -dissimilarity. beta -Dissimiliarity is calculated from the mean Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, D-m, of field data which comprise each habitat class. The variance of D-m distinguishes discrete beta -dissimilarity distributions from homogenous patterns. The method also attempts to remove some of the arbitrary aspects of habitat mapping, can be scaled to other levels of diversity or measures of community structure, is readily interpretable and permits hypothesis testing. Its applications to ecosystem science and coastal management are discussed and illustrated.

J	Stephenne, N; Lambin, EF				Stephenne, N; Lambin, EF			A dynamic simulation model of land-use changes in Sudano-sahelian countries of Africa (SALU)	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents a simulation model to project land-cover changes at a national scale for Sudano-sahelian countries. The aim of this study is to better understand the driving forces of land-use change and to reconstruct past changes. The structure of our model is heavily determined by its spatially aggregated level. This model represents, in a dynamic way, a simplified version of our current understanding of the processes of land-use change in the Sudano-sahelian region of Africa. For any given year, the land demand is calculated under the assumption that there should be an equilibrium between the production and consumption of basic resources derived from different land-uses. The exogenous variables of the model are human population (rural and urban), livestock, rainfall and cereals imports. The output are the areas allocated to fuelwood extraction, crops, fallow and pasture for every year. Pressure indicators are also generated endogenously by the model (rate of overgrazing and land degradation, labour productivity, average household "budget"). The parameters of the model were derived on the basis of a comprehensive review of the literature, mostly of local scale case studies of land-use changes in the Sahel. In agreement with farming system research, the model simulates two processes of land-use change: agricultural expansion at the most extensive technological level, followed by agricultural intensification once some land threshold is reached. The model was first tested at a national scale using data from Burkina Faso. Results simulate land-use changes at two time frequencies: high frequency, as driven by climatic variability, and low frequency, as driven by demographic trends. The rates of cropland expansion predicted by the model are consistent with rates measured for several case studies, based on fine spatial resolution remote sensing data.

J	Pereira, JJ				Pereira, JJ			Environmental geoscience in Southeast Asia: Current trends and future challenges	EPISODES												Southeast Asia is a high growth area, both from the population and development perspectives. As a result of rapid development, the region has been subjected to tremendous land use changes, hastening certain geological processes, which threaten human safety and the environment. In addition, human activity depending on limited resources such as land, soil, water and minerals has also adversely impacted the ecology of the region. The importance of environmental geoscience was brought to fore in Southeast Asia over the past two decades due to geological hazards. Other issues that presently require environmental geoscience inputs include resource and energy utilization, conservation of physical heritage, waste disposal as well as identification and cleanup of polluted land and water: Solutions to these problems require multidisciplinary inputs as well as new knowledge and approaches. Pilot initiatives that relate to integrated management of basins, watersheds and coastal zones, which involve scenario generation, are being undertaken in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. These initiatives, based on remote sensing, have brought in a wealth of information to the region. However on its own, such data cannot provide conclusive answers to ensure the integrity of the environment. There is an urgent need to fill knowledge and data gaps for improved management and decision-making in this region. and environmental geoscience has an important contribution to make, in this context.

J	Mermut, AR; Eswaran, H				Mermut, AR; Eswaran, H			Some major developments in soil science since the mid-1960s	GEODERMA												Although the science of soil was established about 150 years ago with the modern soil science taking off after the Second World War, the new Millennium has brought other challenges and new opportunities. Rapidly increasing population in countries that can least afford it have made them food-insecure. With inadequate inputs in agriculture, developing countries are degrading their lands rapidly and destroying ecosystems. Affluence in the richer countries has precipitated other problems hampering ecosystem functions and quality of land resources. These changing conditions have placed new demands on both the society and the soil science community. The latter has resulted in new areas of soil sub-disciplines such as land and soil quality, land degradation and desertification, cycling of bio-geochemicals, soil pollution assessment and monitoring etc. Advances in information technology have also enabled the science to meet the new demands of the enviro-centric world. In the last decade, noticeable changes are evident in methods and research priorities in the discipline. Soil resource assessment and monitoring is entering a new era, in terms of quality of information produced by new information technologies through the innovative use of Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing and significantly improving the acceptance and use of soil survey information. Electronic technology has dramatically increased the demand for and ability to process more data. Other innovations have resulted in quantitative approaches in soil genetic studies and demonstrated the integral role of soils in ecosystems. For global and regional resource assessment, concepts and procedures were refined. The World Reference Base for soil classification and the Global Soil and Terrain Database are the first steps towards standardisation and a more detailed assessment of global soils. The global assessment of human-induced land degradation and vulnerability to desertification are benchmark products of the databases. Environmental pollution and its effects on human and ecosystem health have become public concerns and soil science has contributed to localising, quantifying, and developing mitigation technologies to address the problems. The challenges of climate change and the charge to maintain ecologcal integrity have been met with technologies such as conservation tillage, agroforestry, precision agriculture etc. New concepts such as multi-functionality of land, soil quality, sustainability of agriculture and carbon sequestration, have emerged leading to new management strategies and an enhanced quality of life.

J	Rao, DP				Rao, DP			A remote sensing-based integrated approach for sustainable development of land water resources	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS												Sustainable development of natural resources cans for utilizing these resources based on their potential and limitations. A remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS)based integrated approach for sustainable development of land and water resources has been developed. The approach involves the extraction of information on soils, water resources (both surface and ground water), and land use/land cover from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1A/1B) Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS-II) data, terrain, and other information from ancillary sources and integrating them with the social, cultural, and economic needs of the people, and using GIS as a tool. The integration helps in the generation of an action plan identifying specific interventions in a watershed based on contemporary technology in consultation not only with scientific specialists in agriculture, horticulture, water resources, land use, forestry, soil conservation but also with social scientists, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and, above all, beneficiary farmers in the watershed. The early results of the implementation of action plans in some selected watersheds have been rewarding in that positive trends in slowing down of land degradation, rising of ground water levels, and greening of wastelands have been noticed. The paper concludes that for sustainable development, a holistic and systemic approach is essential that takes into account analysis of multiple objectives, impact and risk analysis apart from decision-making at the grassroots level. Remote sensing data plays a crucial and integral role in this endeavour.																	1094-6977					MAY	2001	31	2					207	215		10.1109/5326.941844								WOS:000170525900007						
J	Zomer, RJ; Ustin, SL; Carpenter, CC				Zomer, RJ; Ustin, SL; Carpenter, CC			Land cover change along tropical and subtropical riparian corridors within the Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area, Nepal	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Low elevation riparian forests found within the Middle Hills of Nepal are both essential biological habitats tial biological habitats and important resources for local subsistence farmers. Forming networks of habitat patches within the primarily agricultural matrix of the Middle Hills, these forests are repositories of a rich biological diversity. Dynamics of forest change along riparian corridors were investigated within the newly established Makalu Barun National Park and Conservation Area (MBCA) of eastern Nepal, based on a comparison of remote sensing data over a 20-year interval. Multispectral analysis and a supervised classification of Landsat TM (1992) and Landsat MSS (1972) data estimate approximately 7000 ha of low elevation riparian forests within the study area. Change detection analysis estimates based on the respective supervised classifications reveal little significant change in extent of the tropical and subtropical zone riparian forests. More impact was evident toward the upper elevational limits of the study area. A 4% (approximately 300 ha) loss of cover within areas previously designated as forest is estimated. For all areas in the study area, a net loss of forest of 11% is estimated. Land use is shown to be highly dynamic, with significant internal trading between land use classes. The important role of riparian corridors in biodiversity conservation within the Middle Hilts of east Nepal is discussed. Further research on biodiversity within these patches and a specific recognition of the value of remnant riparian forests within the landscape and rural economy are required if conservation goals for the eastern Nepal Himalaya are to be met.

J	Smith, DP; Atkinson, SF				Smith, DP; Atkinson, SF			Accuracy of rectification using topographic map versus GPS ground control points	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Reliable assessments of landscapes are needed for natural resource conservation and preservation efforts and for understanding the impacts humans are having upon those resources. Remotely sensed data provide an integrated view of the landscape and are nicely suited for temporal change studies. Reliable interpretation of Earth surface characteristics relies largely on accurate rectification of the remote sensing imagery to a map projection and on subsequent thematic classification. For rectification, ;l e found that control points acquired using the Global Positioning System (GPS) were superior to those acquired from digitized topographic maps. Differentially corrected GPS locations provided for the optimum rectification of SPOT satellite imagery while marginally better rectifications were obtained for Landsat MSS imagery using uncorrected GPS positions. Accuracy of ground control point sources for rectification should match the resolution of the digital image. Shifts in pixel digital number locations following the resampling procedure in rectification indicate a substantial amount of change might erroneously be attributed to change when, in fact, it might simply be due to differing methods of determining cartographic coordinates of ground control points. This has important implications in change detection studies and should be explored further.																	0099-1112					MAY	2001	67	5					565	570										WOS:000168465700006

However, we found that this common perception was not true in Wolong Nature Reserve (southwestern China), which was established in 1975 as a "flagship" protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. Analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. The rate of Loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. After the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were;similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created.

J	Lahav-Ginott, S; Kadmon, R; Gersani, M				Lahav-Ginott, S; Kadmon, R; Gersani, M			Evaluating the viability of Acacia populations in the Negev Desert: a remote sensing approach	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Recent surveys have pointed to massive mortality of Acacia trees in the Negev Desert, Israel. These observations were interpreted as evidence for a possible deterioration in the conservation status of these species. In this study we employed a demographic approach based on image processing of historical (1956) and recent (1996) aerial photographs to evaluate the viability of Acacia populations in the Negev. Populations were studied in two different sites and in habitats representing contrasting runoff regimes (large wadis vs. small runnels) within each site. In contrast to expectations, all populations showed an increase, rather than a decrease in density between 1956 and 1996. Although a strong recruitment of young trees may lead to a decrease in mean tree size, we observed a significant increase in average tree size for all populations. Distributions of tree size obtained for both 1956 and 1996 were characterized by high frequency of small trees, a result consistent with the observed positive growth rates of the populations. Patterns of demographic variation were scale-dependent, The southern site exhibited significantly greater changes in density and tree size than the northern site and, for each site, wadi populations exhibited higher growth rates than populations growing in nearby small runnels. Changes in tree density were strongly correlated with changes in mean tree size across the different site/habitat combinations, but were weakly correlated at the scale of 100x100 m grid cells. In spite of the general trend of increase in tree density, many grid cells were characterized by a decline in density, indicating that demographic data obtained from relatively small research plots may lead to misleading conclusions concerning the viability of plant populations.

Using field and remote sensing of microgeographic and landscape-level features of the aquatic and terrestrial environment, we examined the degree to which habitat characteristics were correlated with population demographic and genetic characteristics in the common toad (Bufo bufo). Measures of genetic diversity and departures from random mating are described for 20 semi-isolated breeding populations of B. bufo from Leicestershire, Great Britain, based on three species-specific single locus variable number of tandem repeat minisatellite loci. Spatial autocorrelation of allele frequencies revealed significant population structuring or lack of independence in allele frequencies over inter-breeding pond intervals of less than or equal to2 km. Such estimates of "patch size" which are inferred from correlograms, may be useful in defining the extent of effective gene flow and spatial scales over which landscape-level features could plausibly be used to characterize ecological attributes of importance to individuals from specific local breeding populations. Toad presence or absence at amphibian breeding ponds, population size, and population estimates of observed heterozygosity, allelic richness, and Wright's inbreeding coefficient (F) were individually used as dependent variables in analyses with aquatic and terrestrial habitat characteristics. Inter-population variation in inbreeding coefficients was significantly related to presence of additional ponds near each breeding site. Allelic richness, population size, and toad presence/absence were primarily associated with terrestrial habitat variables, including pond density and vegetative characteristics reflecting surrounding land use (e.g. presence of woodlands; hedgerows, extent of area in livestock [sheep] pasture, and anthropogenic development). In the absence of definitive population demographic data, specific habitat characteristics may offer predictive potential for inferring population characteristics and future viability. However, the choice of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant habitat characteristics should be made with care. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Osborne, PE; Alonso, JC; Bryant, RG				Osborne, PE; Alonso, JC; Bryant, RG			Modelling landscape-scale habitat use using GIS and remote sensing: a case study with great bustards	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Many species are adversely affected by human activities at large spatial scales and their conservation requires detailed information on distributions. Intensive ground surveys cannot keep pace with the rate of land-use change over large areas and new methods are needed for regional-scale mapping. 2. We present predictive models for great bustards in central Spain based on readily available advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery combined with mapped features in the form of geographic information system (GIS) data layers. As AVHRR imagery is coarse-grained, we used a 12-month time series to improve the definition of habitat types. The GIS data comprised measures of proximity to features likely to cause disturbance and a digital terrain model to allow for preference for certain topographies 3. We used logistic regression to model the above data, including an autologistic term to account for spatial autocorrelation. The results from models were combined using Bayesian integration, and model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristics plots. 4. Sites occupied by bustards had significantly lower densities of roads, buildings, railways and rivers than randomly selected survey points. Bustards also occurred within a narrower range of elevations and at locations with significantly less variable terrain. 5. Logistic regression analysis showed that roads, buildings, rivers and terrain all contributed significantly to the difference between occupied and random sites. The Bayesian integrated probability model showed an excellent agreement with the original census data and predicted suitable areas not presently occupied. 6. The great bustard's distribution is highly fragmented and vacant habitat patches may occur for a variety of reasons, including the species' very strong fidelity to traditional sites through conspecific attraction. This may limit recolonization of previously occupied sites. 7. We conclude that AVHRR satellite imagery and GIS data sets have potential to map distributions at large spatial scales and could be applied to other species. While models based on imagery alone can provide accurate predictions of bustard habitats at some spatial scales, terrain and human influence are also significant predictors and are needed for finer scale modelling.

J	Pickup, G; Marks, A				Pickup, G; Marks, A			Regional-scale sedimentation process models from airborne gamma ray remote sensing and digital elevation data	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Airborne gamma ray survey data were used to provide information on potassium, thorium and uranium concentrations in surface soil and rock in arid central Australia. Spatial patterns in these radioelements allow tracing of paths of sediment at catchment scale. Survey elevation data are combined with contour data to produce digital elevation models for terrain analysis, tracing of sediment flow paths and modelling of extreme floods. Gamma ray data show consistent variation with slope, a limited range of drainage areas, acid erosion/deposition models derived from the conservation of mass equation. Supply-limited sediment transport models give a reasonable reproduction of observed radioelement distribution but some elements of the distribution pattern reflect the area inundated by 500-1000 year floods rather than the effects of simple downslope movement. Partial area sediment supply models are derived by downstream accumulation of erosion and deposition rates calculated using the conservation of mass equation with transport laws based on slope alone and stream power. Comparison with observed radioelement patterns suggests that both transport laws apply in different parts of the landscape. Regional-scale sediment transport models will require a range of models depending on location in the landscape and event frequency. This approach may allow estimation of sediment delivery ratios.

These variables and leaf optical properties govern the energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any given wavelength of the solar spectrum. The presented theoretical development indicates these canopy-specific wavelength-independent variables characterize the capacity of the canopy to intercept and transmit solar radiation under two extreme situations, namely, when individual leaves 1) are completely absorptive and 2) totally reflect and/or transmit the incident radiation. The interactions of photons with the canopy at red and near-infrared (IR) spectral bands approximate these extreme situations well. One can treat the vegetation canopy as a dynamical system and the canopy spectral interception and transmission as dynamical variables, The system has two independent states: canopies with totally absorbing and totally scattering leaves. Intermediate states are a superposition of these pure states, Such an interpretation provides powerful means to accurately specify changes in canopy structure both from ground-based measurements and remotely sensed data, This concept underlies the operational algorithm of global leaf area index (LAI), and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation developed for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) instruments of the Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra mission.

Remote sensing techniques can provide information about tillage practices over large areas. In this study, six Thematic Mapper (TM)-based logistic regression models proposed by van Deventer et dl. (1997) were used to distinguish conventional and conservation tillage practices in the Lower Minnesota River watershed located in southern Minnesota. Accuracy assessments of tillage maps derived from Landsat TM data were made using field data collected by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Regression models were easy to use, cost and time effective and produced reasonably accurate tillage maps. The "percentage correct" and kappa (k) values varied from 42-77% and 0.03-0.51, respectively, with best values for logistic regression models that use TM band 5 or the difference between TM bands 3 and 5 images. This approach is promising for the rapid collection of tillage information on individual fields over large areas.																	0022-4561						2001	56	2					91	96										WOS:000168989100004

We used remotely sensed, landscape, and habitat data. The meadow type, as determined from the remotely sensed data, was highly correlated with abundances of six of the 11 bird species. Landscape variables significant in predicting occurrence were selected using a stepwise multiple regression for each bird species. These variables were then used in a multiple regression with the variable meadow type. As expected, the abundances of the generalist species (American Robin, Dark-eyed Junco, White-crowned Sparrow, Brewer's Blackbird, and Chipping Sparrow) were not strongly correlated with landscape variables or meadow type. Conversely, abundances of the Common Snipe, Common Yellowthroat, Lincoln's Sparrow, Savannah Sparrow, Vesper Sparrow, and Yellow Warbler were highly correlated with meadow type and landscape variables such as percent cover of willow (Salix spp.), graminoid, woody vegetation, sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), and graminoid and shrub biomass. The results from our study indicate that remotely sensed data are applicable for estimating potential habitats for bird species in the different types of montane meadows.

Soil surveys are an important source of data that can be used to improve farm and ranch planning and environmental protection. In this study, we examined the use of a soil survey geographic (SSURGO) database within a geographic information system (GIS) coupled with remote sensing data for land-use management in Finney County, Kansas. The objectives were (i) to identify landuse change; (ii) to evaluate the influence of soil, groundwater, and physiography on land use; and (iii) to assess land-use potential and present management alternatives. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for 1987, 1989, and 1992 were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. These LULC layers were manipulated with layers: organic matter content, thickness, and texture of the surface soil horizon; land capability class; aquifer thickness (AT); and physiography. Tire acreage of fallow land decreased and the acreage of grassland increased from 1987 to 1992 because of an increase in the acreage of land used in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Broad cropping patterns (irrigated vs. nonirrigated) did not change significantly between 1987 and 1992 and were related to AT. Some currently cropped areas had high erosion potential, whereas some grasslands had relatively low erosion hazards. These grasslands could be used as alternatives for cropping. The study demonstrates the potential of using SSURGO within a GIS coupled with remote sensing information in planning and management for natural resources.																	0361-5995					JAN-FEB	2001	65	1					169	177		10.2136/sssaj2001.651169x								WOS:000169464100022						
J	Jain, SK; Kumar, S; Varghese, J				Jain, SK; Kumar, S; Varghese, J			Estimation of soil erosion for a Himalayan watershed using GIS technique	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas has been an increasing cause of concern to environmentalists and water resources planners. The steep slopes in the Himalayas along with depleted forest cover, as well as high seismicity have been major factors in soil erosion and sedimentation in river reaches. Prediction of soil erosion is a necessity if adequate provision is to be made in the design of conservation structures to offset the ill effects of sedimentation during their lifetime. In the present study, two different soil erosion models, i.e. the Morgan model and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model, have been used to estimate soil erosion from a Himalayan watershed. Parameters required for both models were generated using remote sensing and ancillary data in GIS mode. The soil erosion estimated by Morgan model is in the order of 2200 t km(-2) yr(-1) and is within the limits reported for this region. The soil erosion estimated by USLE gives a higher rate. Therefore, for the present study the Morgan model gives, for area located in hilly terrain, fairly good results.																	0920-4741						2001	15	1					41	54		10.1023/A:1012246029263								WOS:000171818600004						
J	Guisan, A; Zimmermann, NE				Guisan, A; Zimmermann, NE			Predictive habitat distribution models in ecology	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone.

J	Gould, W				Gould, W			Remote sensing of vegetation, plant species richness, and regional biodiversity hotspots	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding mesoscale patterns of ecosystem properties is important if we are to effectively monitor ecosystem change due to land use and climate change. Remote sensing provides the best tool for looking at large areas of the earth's surface to analyze, map, and monitor ecosystem patterns and processes. Patterns of vegetation and variation in biodiversity are important ecosystem properties, with strong relationships to important ecosystem functions. Species richness is the most widely used measure of biodiversity, and mapping patterns of species richness within a landscape can provide a basis for future monitoring and an ecological basis for land management and conservation decisions. This study presents (1) a map of the vegetation of the Hood River region of the Central Canadian Arctic derived from a supervised classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, (2) estimations and maps of regional variation in plant species richness, and (3) a comparison of three species richness estimation techniques. The three vascular species richness estimates are derived from measures of variation in normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI), abundance of mapped vegetation types weighted by relative potential species richness, and a multiple regression of both these variables for 17 sampling sites of 500 pixels each. Ground-based measures of species richness range from 69 to 109 vascular plant species per 0.5-km(2) sample area. Variation in NDVI is positively correlated with measured species richness and a weighted abundance of mapped vegetation types. Multiple regression indicates that variation in NDVI and weighted abundance of mapped vegetation types explain 79% of the variance in ground-based measures of species richness. Three methods for remotely estimating species richness agree to within +/- 15 species over 60% of the area and +/- 30 species over 93% of the area.

The databases are intended to support national and regional land-cover inventory and monitoring, interagency conservation and fire risk assessment, and wildlife habitat evaluation, as well as more traditional uses including land management planning and forest inventory within each National Forest. The digital maps are fine-scale relative to their extent, being derived from 30-m-resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data and digital elevation models (DEMs). Map attributes included a vegetation life form class, a vegetation type, and canopy cover and size class estimates for forested polygons. Land-cover and vegetation type labels were more accurate than forest structure estimates. However, the mapping methodology is not static. New remote sensing data and analysis methods offer some promise to improve map attribute estimation. The database is being provided by the Forest Service to agency personnel, cooperators, and the public.																	0099-1112					OCT	2000	66	10					1209	1217										WOS:000089546300008

It is hypothesized that the presence of agricultural communities, proximity to urban markets and conservation practices affect three characteristics of wildlife distribution: the presence (range), abundance and community structure of large mammal populations. The area studied was extensive and required the use of wildlife sampling and remote sensing techniques to generate data on wildlife distribution and the explanatory factors. The results show that wildlife protection is associated with high animal abundance.

J	Ben Wu, X; Smeins, FE				Ben Wu, X; Smeins, FE			Multiple-scale habitat modeling approach for rare plant conservation	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Multiple-scale habitat assessment for rare plants is an important component of conservation and development planning. It is challenging, however, due to lack of information synthesis on the ecology of rare plants, lack of effective approaches for habitat assessment at multiple spatial scales, and lack of spatial data for relevant environmental attributes and scales. A multiple-scale habitat modeling approach was developed to meet this need. Regional-, landscape-, and site-scale habitat models were developed for eight rare plant species found in southern Texas, USA. The models were partially validated and used for planning of rare plant conservation and highway construction. Regional-scale habitat models were used to predict, based on coarse-scale geographic information system (GIS) data, spatial distribution of areas containing potential habitat of rare plant species and the probability of encountering potential rare plant habitats. Site-scale models, based on synthesis of the literature and field investigations, were developed for field survey and mapping of rare plant habitats to enable accurate assessment of potential and present habitat suitability of specific locations using fine-resolution field data on soil, landform and vegetation structure. The greatest need for assessing the presence and potential habitat of rare plants is at the landscape scales. Thus, landscape-scale models were developed for spatially explicit assessment of potential and present habitat suitability, based on site-scale models but using GIS and remote sensing-based data. These models can be used as effective tools for conservation planning, monitoring and management of rare plant habitat, as well as for reduction of land use conflicts and development cost, The processes of model development and application synthesizes the diffuse literature, identifies knowledge and data gaps to guide future research, and provides a framework for assimilating new information acquired in the future to improve habitat assessment.

In some rangeland areas of northern Australia, monitoring has detected a tilt in the production-conservation balance towards excessive production. How big is this imbalance? Can it shift back? Robust monitoring is needed to answer these questions. The aim is to know what to monitor, and where. For example, to detect changes caused by livestock on rangeland forage production and soil erosion, indicators linking grazing disturbances to landscape function are needed, that is, indicators that signal how well landscapes are capturing, concentrating, and utilizing scarce water, nutrient, and organic resources. Studies in Australia and the USA document that simple vegetation and soil patch attributes can be measured as indicators of the 'state of health' of landscape function. For example, field and remote sensing-based grazing studies in Australia document that landscapes with a high cover of perennial plant patches function effectively to capture runoff water and nutrients in sediments, whereas landscapes with a low cover of these patches do not - they are dysfunctional - as indicated by large patches of bare soil. Aerial videography is proving tp be a robust technique for measuring indicators of landscape function such as small patches of vegetation and the extent of bare soil. These indicators typically have a sigmoidal response to grazing impacts. We illustrate that if these indicators are measured on monitoring sites established near the sigmoidal 'point of inflection', then small changes in these indicators can be detected.

J	Zheng, DL; Chen, JQ				Zheng, DL; Chen, JQ			Edge effects in fragmented landscapes: a generic model for delineating area of edge influences (D-AEI)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We developed a generic model for delineating area of edge influences D-AEI for quantifying edge effects within a landscape by combining remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), moving window (3 x 3), and computer programming techniques. Our model provided a more realistic assessment of edge effects than those based on traditional methods. Unique characteristics of the D-AEI model included: (1) preservation of the spatial characteristics of the landscape structure; (2) incorporation of the most critical parameters controlling edge effects, such as edge orientation, edge contrast, prevailing direction of edge effects, decay value, and interior approximation; and (3) ability to quantify edge effects for various variables at multiple scales. The model is flexible so that the users can define key parameters and generate ecologically relevant output based on environmental and spatial characteristics of the study area and the study purpose. Our results demonstrated that: (a) edge effects were not symmetrically distributed in all directions around clearcuts; (b) AEI was not necessarily continuous around patches; and (c) boundary dynamics and multiple edge effects were clearly reflected across the landscape. Results from this research are important for current and future resource assessments, biological conservation and wildlife habitat management, biodiversity studies of flora and fauna, microclimatic research, future studies on edges and their importance in landscape design and analysis. The model has potential for broader applications in other research areas where human and natural disturbances are evident, at multiple scales from watershed, forest management district, to region.

J	Roy, PS; Tomar, S				Roy, PS; Tomar, S			Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using geospatial modelling technique	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Geospatial presentation of habitat status has become a key issue for planning conservation. Biodiversity characters of the habitat provide the basis of prioritizing the sites in conservation effort. Since India is identified as one of the 12-mega biodiversity countries in the world, this task is of great significance. In India, biogeographers have long since recognized North-East India as one of the most diverse regions with respect to flora and fauna, Since historic times. human interventions had started influencing the landuse and landcover of this region. Deforestation is mainly attributed to shifting cultivation and commercial logging of timber. This has resulted in fragmentation of the landscape. Landscape fragmentation and degradation have been identified as fundamental reasons for biodiversity loss. The paper uses landscape ecological principles for biodiversity characterization, Satellite remote sensing data have been used for characterization of the landscape and stratification for ground inventory. A geographic information system has been used to spatially model the disturbance regimes and to integrate the ground based nonspatial data with the spatial characters of the landscape. The vegetation types and landuse of Meghalaya have been mapped using Indian remote sensing (IRS) time series data. The various parameters (viz. patch shape. patch size, number of patches, porosity, fragmentation and juxtaposition) have been analyzed on the most recent landcover map to spatially present the disturbance regimes. A spatial model incorporating ground based biodiversity attributes of the landscape elements, landuse change patterns, disturbance regimes of the landscape and terrain complexity have been used to delineate the spatial pattern of biological richness. This has been achieved using the landscape analysis package (LAP) developed at the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing. Habitat evaluation using ground based data and their spatial organization have been found to provide reliable information on the biodiversity distribution pattern. The present approach for prioritizing the biodiversity rich sites have the advantage of integrating spatial, non-spatial information and horizontal relationships. The information is finally presented in space and time. This approach will facilitate conservation prioritization: systematic inventory and continuous monitoring. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Kampichler, C; Barthel, J; Wieland, R				Kampichler, C; Barthel, J; Wieland, R			Species density of foliage-dwelling spiders in field margins: a simple, fuzzy rule-based model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Field margins are grassy strips or banks between arable fields or meadows that are not cultivated or ploughed and contain only single shrubs or trees. They not only support beneficial arthropods, e.g. predators of crop pests, but can also be of potential value to species of concern, making them a critical target for conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Most ecological data and most knowledge of ecological relationships are imprecise, uncertain or ambiguous. An overemphasis on the precision of mathematical models, thus, does not necessarily translate into a greater representation of reality. In contrast, fuzzy expert systems permit the representation and processing of 'soft' ecological knowledge in terms of natural language. This is done by sets of IF-THEN rules that relate the variables (expressed in the form of fuzzy sets such as 'rather cold', 'comparably few species', etc.) among each other. Data on 96 field margins in southern Germany and their foliage-dwelling spider assemblages, which had been collected from May to September 1994, were used for fuzzy modelling of the effects of margin width, margin density, frequency of mechanical disturbance and vegetation-architectural complexity on species density of spiders. Habitat factors were ordered according to their hierarchical effectiveness: margin width and disturbance determine habitat persistence, habitat persistence and margin density determine colonisation potential, and colonisation potential and herbaceous-plant cover determine species density. Forty-five rules are necessary to relate these factors. The predictive power of the fuzzy model was surprisingly high. The mean average error between predicted and observed number of species for test data, which was not used for model development, was less than 1.4 species (observed values ranged between 3 and 25). A multiple-regression model showed a mean average error of 3.17 species. We conclude that fuzzy models are suitable for representing the soft knowledge of field-margin/spider-assemblage relationships. The model permits time- and manpower-saving validation on larger scales by qualitative rather than quantitative data collection and by the inclusion of remote sensing data. We believe that fuzzy models could provide a valuable means for formulating measures necessary for conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Roff, JC; Taylor, ME				Roff, JC; Taylor, ME			National frameworks for marine conservation - A hierarchical geophysical approach	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Development of environmental protected areas has been driven 'more by opportunity than design, scenery rather than science' (Hackman A. 1993. Preface. A protected areas gap analysis methodology: planning for the conservation of biodiversity. World Wildlife Fund Canada Discussion Paper: i-ii). If marine environments are to be protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of types of marine habitats and delineation of their boundaries in a consistent classification is required. Without such a classification system, the extent and significance of representative or distinctive habitats cannot be recognized. Such recognition is a fundamental prerequisite to the determination of location and size of marine areas to be protected. 2. A hierarchical classification has been developed based on enduring/recurrent geophysical (oceanographic and physiographic) features of the marine environment, which identifies habitat types that reflect changes in biological composition. Important oceanographic features include temperature, stratification and exposure; physiographic features include bottom relief and substrate type. 3. Classifications based only on biological data are generally prohibited at larger scales, due to lack of information. Therefore, We are generally obliged to classify habitat types as surrogates for community types. The data necessary for this classification are available from mapped sources and from remote sensing. It is believed they can be used to identify representative and distinctive marine habitats supporting different communities. and will provide an ecological framework for marine conservation planning at the national level.

J	Pickup, G; Marks, A				Pickup, G; Marks, A			Identifying large-scale erosion and deposition processes from airborne gamma radiometrics and digital elevation models in a weathered landscape	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Patterns of erosion and deposition are difficult to identify and measure at catchment and regional scale but it may be possible to infer their distribution from remote sensing using easily measured surrogate variables. Airborne geophysical surveys provide data on gamma ray emissions from surface and near-surface material and allow estimation of K, Th and U content. Gamma ray signatures are largely determined by lithology but also change with weathering and with erosion and deposition, and may be used as a partial surrogate for those processes. Comparison of gamma ray signatures with topographic characteristics closely related to sediment transport capacity, downstream sorting of sediments, and the extent of erosion and deposition shows strong linkages. Studies in four small catchments in southeastern Australia indicate that K consistently increases as slopes become steeper while Th and U may either increase or decrease. This suggests the presence of fresh rock rather than weathered material and implies removal of material by erosion, although some patterns may result from systematic changes in lithology across catchments. Analysis by lithology confirms the increase in K with slope in granites, metamorphosed sediments and basalt, and also shows a tendency for U to decrease with slope in the granites and basalt. Gamma ray emissions vary only slightly with catchment area (a surrogate measure of water discharge) suggesting that water erosion is limited or that discharge is not closely related to area. Gamma radiometric profiles down hillslopes, averaged across the full range of gradients, show that, in most cases, radioelements initially decrease, probably reflecting increased weathering, but then increase close to valley floors because of accumulation of fine sediments. Analysis by lithology confirms the increase in radioelements close to valley floors in granites and metamorphosed sediments but the trend is less clear in basalt. Gamma ray profiles down floodplains are variable and indicate the amount of deposition and accumulation of weathered material in valley openings and exposure of bedrock in valley constrictions. Simple erosion and deposition models, based on the conservation of mass equation, and applied to the four catchments, show that all radioelements increase as the potential for deposition increases. They reach a low point in zones of no net erosion or deposition and subsequently increase as erosion becomes more intense and weathered material is lost from slopes. Analysis by lithology largely confirms this pattern. The usefulness of airborne geophysical survey data is limited by flight line spacing with most data being flown at a 200-400 m spacing in Australia. However, general trends in erosion and deposition can still be distinguished and there is capacity for calibrating long-term erosion and deposition models once better approaches to interpretation of gamma ray data have been developed.

There is great demand for Taxus from pharmaceutical companies and the species is being extracted heavily from its natural habitats throughout the world. This demand has necessitated the preparation of an inventory of Taxus-bearing forests for conservation and sustainable utilization. We have used remote sensing and Geographical Information system for identifying and mapping yew plants with reasonably good accuracy. IRS 1C LISS-III False Color Composite (FCC) data dated 2 January 1997 having 23.5 m ground resolution were applied for this purpose. These forests were visited on ground for a detailed vegetation analysis of the distribution of the yew plants. The raw data was corrected both radiometrically and geometrically and then enhanced using the standard image enhancement techniques such as linear contrast stretch. Various techniques of digital image classification such as hybrid clustering, masking and classification were tested to differentiate and delineate the yew-bearing forests in Talle Valley area falling in Lower Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh. Forests covered with various proportions of Taxus could be stratified and mapped with 85% accuracy. The preliminary results obtained in this study demonstrate that Taxus-bearing forests could be separated with a priori knowledge of vegetation types of the area.																	0011-3891					APR 25	2000	78	8					1008	1013										WOS:000086767500023						
J	Nagler, PL; Daughtry, CST; Goward, SN				Nagler, PL; Daughtry, CST; Goward, SN			Plant litter and soil reflectance	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The presence of plant litter on the soil surface influences the flow of nutrients, carbon, water, and energy in terrestrial ecosystems. Quantifying plant litter cover is important for interpreting vegetated landscapes and for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation tillage practices. Current methods of measuring litter cover are subjective, requiring considerable visual judgment. Reliable and objective methods are needed. The spectral reflectance (0.4-2.5 mu m) of wet and dry soils (six types) and plant litters (2 crops, 14 forest, and 2 grasses) of different ages were measured. Discrimination of plant litters from the soils was ambiguous in the visible and near-infrared (0.4-1.1 mu m) wavelength region. An absorption feature associated with cellulose and lignin was observed at 2.1 mu m in the spectra of dry plant litter, which was not present in the spectra of soils. A new spectral variable, cellulose absorption index (CAI), was defined using the relative depth of the reflectance spectra at 2.1 mu m. CAI of dry litter was significantly greater than CAI of soils. CAI generally decreased with age of the litter. Water absorption dominated the spectral properties of both soils and plant litter and significantly reduced the CAI of the plant litters. Nevertheless, the CAI of wet litter was significantly greater than CAI of wet soil. This study provides a new methodology to discriminate plant litter from soils by differences in spectral reflectance produced by their physical and chemical attributes. This remote sensing method should improve quantification of plant litter cover and thus improve estimates of phytomass production, surface energy balance, and the effectiveness of soil conservation practices.

The USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Curve Number method incorporating GIS techniques and remotely-sensed data were used in this study for assessing the runoff curve number (CN) change, The S-65A sub-basin in the Kissimmee River Basin, FL was used as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of application. The GIS database as obtained from both Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle (DOQQ) data which was further processed using Arcview and ERDAS Imagine software. A grid of curve numbers was generated based on land use for 1990 and 1995, The results showed that not only were both TM images and DOQQ data applicable for assessing the land use changes and CN variation in the S-65A sub-basin, but also the land use change in this 5-yr study period caused an increase of CN value by about 8%.

This area has historically been a wetland forest and prairie grassland region and has been home and resting site to much bird wildlife. Sudden snow melts and intense precipitation in the adjacent Vosges can still cause widespread flooding. In recent times the ploughing in of much of the prairies and intensive maize production has led to a destabilised biotope. Therefore, the close to surface water table is under threat from the infiltration of agricultural pesticides and fertilisers and the bare soils in winter are open to erosion. This wetland has been inscribed in EU circulars under the protection of wetland areas (79/409) and an official flood zone has been defined. Prairie grassland conservation policies have been implemented. Given the area's ecological and agricultural importance it has been the subject of many land-cover, soil moisture and flood event studies at SERTIT using optical and radar remote sensing data (Clandillon et al., 1993; 1995; De Fraipont et al., 1994; Fellah et al., 1995; Fellah and Tholey et al., 1996; SERTIT, 1990; Tholey et al., 1997; Yesou et al., 1995).																	0169-3298						2000	21	2-3					223	228		10.1023/A:1006766816134								WOS:000167731800011						
J	Catling, PC; Burt, RJ; Forrester, RI				Catling, PC; Burt, RJ; Forrester, RI			Models of the distribution and abundance of ground-dwelling mammals in the eucalypt forests of north-eastern New South Wales in relation to habitat variables	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												We examined the distribution and abundance of ground-dwelling mammals in eucalypt forests in relation to habitat variables within an area of c. 24 000 km(2) in north-eastern New South Wales. Habitat variables are defined as vegetative variables that may be altered or created by humans or natural disturbances and used for the management and/or conservation of fauna. Statistical models of the distribution and abundance of ground-dwelling mammals in relation to the habitat variables are presented. Generally, the ground-dwelling mammals in the region were more diverse and in greater abundance, and the forest more complex, than in south-eastern New South Wales. The models reflect a general preference of the ground-dwelling fauna for forests that were least disturbed. However, some species were more tolerant of disturbance than others. Recent developments in remote sensing have allowed the mosaic of habitats for ground-dwelling mammals to be mapped over large areas of the landscape. Such maps and the models presented here are discussed with respect to the management of wildlife species. The reduced disturbance during silvicultural practices and the lower abundance of foxes are discussed in relation to the greater diversity and abundance of the ground-dwelling mammals in the region than in south-eastern New South Wales.																	1035-3712						2000	27	6					639	654		10.1071/WR99066								WOS:000165567500010						
J	Millward, AA; Mersey, JE				Millward, AA; Mersey, JE			Adapting the RUSLE to model soil erosion potential in a mountainous tropical watershed	CATENA												This research integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to model erosion potential for soil conservation planning within the Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve (SMBR), Mexico. Mountainous topography and a tropical uni-modal precipitation regime characterize this region. These unique climatic and topographic characteristics required a modification of the standard RUSLE factors and their derivation. The resulting RUSLE-GIS model provides a robust soil conservation planning tool readily transferable and accessible to other land managers in similar environments. Future pressure to expand agriculture and grazing operations within the SMBR will unquestionably accentuate the already high rate of soil erosion and resultant sediment loading of watercourses occurring in this region. Until recently there did not exist a reliable or financially viable means to model and map soil erosion within large remote areas. An increase in the reliability and resolution of remote sensing techniques, modifications and advancements in watershed scale soil erosion modelling techniques, and advances in GIS, represent significantly improved tools that can be applied to both monitoring and modelling the effects of land use on soil erosion potential. Data used in this study to generate the RUSLE variables include a Landsat Thematic Mapper image (land cover), digitized topographic and soil maps, and tabular precipitation data. Soil erosion potential was modelled within Zenzontla, a sub-catchment of the Rio Ayuquila, located in the SMBR, and the results are presented as gee-referenced maps for each of the wet and dry precipitation seasons. These maps confirm that high and extreme areas of soil loss occur within the Zenzontla sub-catchment, and that erosion potential differs significantly between wet and dry seasons.

J	Ortega-Huerta, MA; Medley, KE				Ortega-Huerta, MA; Medley, KE			Landscape analysis of jaguar (Panthera onca) habitat using sighting records in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												The Sierra de Tamaulipas is a biogeographically isolated mountain system in Northern Mexico, where habitat fragmentation by land-management practices is a possible threat to wildlife conservation. As a case example, we used GIS analyses to evaluate how human activities influence the landscape structure of jaguar (Panthera onca) habitat in the region. The study: (1) ranked potential habitat based on associations between environmental attributes (topography, streams and vegetation) and the frequency distribution of jaguar sighting records; (2) classified current land cover from a 1990 Landsat-TM image and mapped the landscape structure of high potential habitat; and (3) compared the degree to which mature natural vegetation is fragmented by different types of owners. Jaguar sites showed significant associations with tropical deciduous and oak forests, and low, west or south-east slopes, between 400 and 900 m. About 52% of the high potential habitat was mapped as mature natural vegetation, which was distributed as two large patches (28% of the land area) and many small forest patches (98% at < 80 ha). The number and size-class distribution of high-potential habitat patches varied little amongst four ownership types, but the dispersed distribution of more subsistence and commercial-based owners across the landscape suggests the need for collaborative participation in a conservation plan. From our study the need to scale up from managing individual land parcels is substantiated and areas that promote regional contiguity of jaguar habitat in the Sierra de Tamaulipas are identified.																	0376-8929					DEC	1999	26	4					257	269		10.1017/S0376892999000387								WOS:000085666600005

The dynamics of the landscape elements and the spatial pattern of Minorca were analysed to test whether this human-modelled landscape was at a stationary state, and, if it was the case, to see whether the system could be characterized by a particular spatial pattern. Landsat TM satellite images were processed to derive land cover classification and vegetation index maps corresponding to the years 1984 and 1992, the best compromise between een null cloudiness and maximum time span. The classification was used to test the stationary state by estimating the transition matrix; of land cover. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to analyse the spatial pattern of change at the patch level. The spatial analysis of NDVI was based on four indices: fractal dimension, number and size distribution of patches, and spatial Kappa index. Those pattern descriptors were compared with values obtained from stochastic landscape simulations. Temporal analysis showed that land cover proportions remained approximately constant over the 8-year period, although interchange amongst patches existed. This suggested that the landscape of Minorca was close to a stationary state. The study of NDVI changes revealed that the spatial structure was different from that of neutral models and presented scale invariance properties. Results from land cover transitions and from NDVI patterning suggest that the landscape of Minorca is a critical system, in the framework of the self-organized criticality hypothesis, i.e. the mosaic of patches would self-organize at the frontier of a dynamic equilibrium constituted by the balance between disturbances and successional processes.

We aimed to describe responses of the vegetation in the lower Volga Delta to these substantial sea-level changes using an analysis of historic vegetation maps produced by aerial photography and satellite imagery. The sea level drop in the earlier part of the century was followed by rapid progression of the vegetation. The subsequent rapid sea-level rise in the 1980s did however not result in similarly rapid regression of the vegetation. This partial irreversibility of the vegetation response to sea-level change is explained by the wide flooding tolerance of the major emergent species, namely Phragmites australis. Floating vegetation increased in extent, most likely due to the increased availability of more favourable conditions, particularly for Nelumbo nucifera, a tropical plant reaching its northernmost distribution in the Volga Delta. This species increased in distribution from 3.5 ha in the 1930s throughout the entire Volga Delta to several thousands of hectares in the Astrakhanskiy Biosphere Reserve alone in the 1980s. The reported sea-level changes swept the ecosystems in the Astrakhanskiy Biosphere Reserve back and forth within the Reserve boundaries. At longer time scales, ten-fold greater sealevel change has been reported. The ecosystems for which the Reserve is renowned might be pushed completely out of the Reserve under these conditions. We therefore question whether the current Reserve will be sufficiently large to guarantee conservation of the biota in the lower Volga Delta at longer time scales.

The layer is assumed to be homogeneous and optically semi-infinite, and the bidirectional reflection function (BRF) is found by a simple iterative solution of the Ambartsumian's nonlinear integral equation. As an exact solution of the radiative transfer equation, the reflection function thus obtained fully obeys the fundamental physical laws of energy conservation and reciprocity. Since this technique bypasses the computation of the internal radiation held, it is by far the fastest numerical approach available and can be used as an ideal input for Monte Carlo procedures calculating BRFs of scattering layers with macroscopically rough surfaces. Although the effects of packing density and coherent backscattering are currently neglected, they can also be incorporated. The FORTRAN implementation of the technique is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.giss.nasa.gov/ similar to crmim/brf.html and can be applied to a wide range of remote sensing, engineering, and biophysical problems. We also examine the potential effect of ice crystal shape on the bidirectional reflectance of flat snow surfaces and the applicability of the Henyey-Greenstein phase function and the delta-Eddington approximation in calculations for soil surfaces, (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Knight, J; McCarron, SG; McCabe, AM; Sutton, B				Knight, J; McCarron, SG; McCabe, AM; Sutton, B			Sand and gravel aggregate resource management and conservation in Northern Ireland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Glaciofluvial landforms in Northern Ireland are important resource bodies for sand and gravel aggregate, and also form integrated geomorphic assemblages which have scenic and aesthetic importance in the landscape. Determining the overall 'value' of sand and gravel features in economic and landscape terms involves making assumptions about their geotechnical properties, future extraction rates, and quantifying otherwise poorly-defined aesthetic attributes. This paper deals mainly with landscape economic, scientific and aesthetic 'values' and rates of resource depletion on different spatial scales. Based on remote sensing, field mapping and automation of the data set using a geographical information system (GIS), glaciofluvial sand and gravel is calculated to cover 534 km(2) +/- 10% in Northern Ireland (similar to 3.4% of land area). By assuming specific deposit thicknesses for each landform type, mappable sand and gravel reserves are calculated to range between 2400 and 14 675 million tonnes. Based on low growth, high growth and 'business as usual' scenarios of future annual increases in extraction rate from 1996 AD onwards, these reserves are calculated to have a lifespan of 48-314 yr (median value 132 yr). Case studies of the Glarryford esker complex and the Lough Fea deltas complex illustrate the local landscape importance of sand and gravel features. These case studies show that defining, quantifying and evaluating landscape resources at a local-scale is a necessary part of aggregate resource management and conservation where the overall resource-base is diminishing.

J	Mumby, PJ; Harborne, AR				Mumby, PJ; Harborne, AR			Development of a systematic classification scheme of marine habitats to facilitate regional management and mapping of Caribbean coral reefs	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Most coastal habitat mapping is conducted on an ad hoc basis with little consistency in terminology and ambiguous documentation. These limitations obstruct interpretation and integration of maps for coral reef science and management, particularly at regional (international) scales where standardisation is urgently required. This paper advocates an objective, systematic approach to habitat classification which couples coastal geomorphology and benthic cover. Benthic classes are derived and described objectively using agglomerative hierarchical classification of field data and Similarity Percentage analysis of resulting clusters. The scheme has a hierarchical structure to accommodate various user requirements, variable availability of data, and the spatial scales of most remote sensing methods. We illustrate our approach with a scheme based on extensive field data from the Turks and Caicos Islands and Belize. While the scheme will not represent all habitats of the Caribbean, it provides a useful basis for a regional classification and illustrates the systematic approach. Standardised regional maps of coastal habitats will help development of predictive models of coral metapopulation dynamics, aid the identification of larval source and sink areas, and facilitate strategic transboundary planning of protected areas to maximise species, habitat, and ecosystem conservation. Habitats might also be interpreted to reflect ecosystem processes such as productivity and trophic guild structure, thereby allowing the ecosystem function to be examined at larger scales.

J	Smith, W; Meredith, TC; Johns, T				Smith, W; Meredith, TC; Johns, T			Exploring methods for rapid assessment of woody vegetation in the Batemi Valley, North-central Tanzania	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Conservation of local biological resources in remote areas requires efficient data and collection methods. This paper describes part of a local conservation initiative in Northern Tanzania in which an indigenous conservation group enlisted the support of outside scientists to explore means of preparing baseline ecological reports. Two factors are seen as important: one is local use of ecological resources and the other is local availability. This paper focuses on the second of these and considers woody species. A variety of ecological field methods, statistical analysis and remote sensing and mapping techniques are used to generate baseline ecological inventories. The fieldwork identified 101 woody species, representing 54 genera and 37 families in the Batemi area. There are three main vegetation types: Vangueria apiculata-Ficus sycomorus-Trichilia emetica type; Croton dictygamous-Euphorbia tirucalli-Grewia bicolor type; and Acacia tortilis-Balanites aegyptica-Euphorbia candelabrum type. The Landsat TM map identified four main land-cover classes: (1) bushland and woodland thicket, (2) woodland (3) wooded grassland, and (4) grassland with scattered trees, which includes agricultural areas and villages. The combination of these data and methods can be useful for conservation planning and long-term monitoring, but it is clear that ground-level local assessment is necessary to detect subtleties of human-environment interaction that are required for conservation planning.																	0960-3115					APR	1999	8	4					447	470		10.1023/A:1008898331292								WOS:000081405700001

The aim of this project is to develop a working tool to carry out comprehensive broad scale mapping surveys of sublittoral habitats and communities (or biotopes). Reliable marine benthic information, at a suitable level of detail, is required by SNH in its work in conservation management of coastal ecosystems. Increasingly it is required to assist with the implementation of the EC Habitats Directive through the identification, designation, management and monitoring of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and for the protection of threatened species. The work to date has developed a survey strategy which employs a basic, low-cost acoustic system to produce maps, ground-truthed using a variety of techniques. The maps provide an estimation of the geographical distribution and extent of the biological resources in the survey area. The current paper provides a review of the areas covered to date and some examples of the use this information, in particular the resource maps, has been put to by SNH to support environmental management.																	0143-1161					FEB 15	1999	20	3					585	592		10.1080/014311699213352								WOS:000078973300009

In the former brown coal mining area of eastern Germany, now scheduled as a nature conservation area, an analysis of the spatial distribution of vegetation was considered as an important tool in landscape planning. Therefore a comprehensive vegetation survey by means of satellite imagery (Landsat-TM), airborne imagery (CASI), and ground-based methods, notably habitat mapping and vegetation sampling was carried out. With respect to the scales of resolution the classification results of the four methods are, to a certain degree, comparable. Differences in the outcome can be ascribed to the fact that methods of low resolution result in a discrete array of polygons whereas methods of high resolution depict a mosaic structure with an underlying, continuously changing gradient. Provided that the biological meaning of the remote sensing classification is known, a shift from single vegetation patterns to the landscape scale will be possible. Neither satellite nor airborne imagery is restricted to the purpose of mapping but may also serve for vegetation classification itself.																	1402-2001					DEC	1998	1	2					233	240		10.2307/1478953								WOS:000208471900009

A statistical classifier applied to satellite images identified 14 land-cover classes including water, swamp, dry grasslands, degraded woody vegetation, semi-natural forest classes and intensive land uses. Validation, using 240 sample sites, recorded 86% correspondence between field and map data. Intensive land use makes up 23% of the area, water and swamps 27%, dry grasslands 29%, woody vegetation 21%, with semi-natural forests covering 15% of the area. The species data from sample-based field surveys included flowering plant species, dragon/lies, butterflies, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The species data were used to generate biodiversity ratings, based on species 'richness' and 'rarity', which could be related to the vegetation cover. This inter-relation helped to generate a biodiversity map of the Sango Bay area which has since been used to aid conservation planning. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

About three-fourths of the study area is located in China and one-fourth was in North Korea. A biosphere reserve, Changbai Natural Reserve; was included in the study area. A quarter-scene of a Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite image from September 21, 1987 was used to delineate the spatial distribution of five major land cover types: nonforest, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, evergreen coniferous forest, larch forest, and subalpine vegetation. The dominant cover type (43%) was mixed broadleaf-conifer forest. Large contiguous patches of old-growth forest, visible in the land cover map, extended across the political borders between the reserve and the surrounding area as well as between China and North Korea. Forests at different locations an Changbai Mountain were managed differently: those outside the reserve have been harvested by clearcutting, while those inside the reserve have been preserved but are now isolated from other forest patches. Obvious conflicts exist between conservation goals and clearcutting activities in old-growth forests on Changbai Mountain. Increased international attention could lead to better management and protection of the old-growth forests in this remote area.																	0885-8608					OCT	1998	18	4					358	365										WOS:000076696900009						
J	Prasad, SN				Prasad, SN			Conservation planning for the Western Ghats of Kerala: II. Assessment of habitat loss and degradation	CURRENT SCIENCE												Habitat change analyses for conservation planning in India were hampered by lack of efforts to utilize the existing spatial data. While, traditionally, most change analyses involving remote sensing data were of short term in nature (less than or equal to 10 years), the ecological history studies of long term (>10 years) were essentially nonspatial in nature, and have contributed little to site-specific explanation on dynamics of habitat loss and consequent impact on biodiversity. In this study, GIS tools are applied to analyse habitat loss, and transformation over a period of 30 years beginning late 1950s for Western Chats of Kerala, It is shown that over a thirty-year period the evergreen/semi-evergreen habitat has declined by 47% while the deciduous habitat has marginally increased by 7%. Landscape variables such as perimeter/area ratio were shown to be better indicators of habitat degradation rather than simple estimates of habitat loss. Attention is drawn to building a comprehensive data base for conservation planning.																	0011-3891					AUG 10	1998	75	3					228	235										WOS:000075560000020

The potential application of GIS is illustrated through various case studies ranging from development of Forest Resources Information System at divisional level to micro-level planning in Joint Forest Management areas. The studies related to plant diversity prospecting, inputs for forest working plans, etc. have also been discussed in the paper.																	0011-3891					AUG 10	1998	75	3					272	282										WOS:000075560000025

Thus it is apprent that conservation of light sand soils against wind erosion is vital, so much as privatization started in the first years of this decade brought fundamental changes in facilities of soil protection. In 80's a county-wide soil protection network directed the resaech to reduce the damages. After the privatization (1988-89) the Ianduse (type and structure) was changed. The results of this process were overlapped with the natural aridification tendency of the South Hungarian Region. Both changes indicated us to launch a research project with the following aims: - to build up stations for measurements of deflation and accumulation of sandy soils, - to provide suitable information and advice for the private landowners - to assess the risk of wind erosion in the Danube-Tisza Interfuve region for the regional development plan. In this study we would like to summerize last problem, to border the territories endangered by wind erosion and also to define the size of these areas. We marked out 64 km2 large area around the stations. The monitoring methods of the rest area were elaborated. After collecting and measuring of the geomorphological, soil and Ianduse characteristics these data were transported to a database. The idea of the analysis based on GIS and remote sensing methods. We selected the surfaces covered by sandy soils, the surface was used as cultivated area and posited not in the depression between sand dunes. There are the where the wind erosion might be active due to the ecological parameters (ecologically critical areas ECA). Taking the Landsat and SPOT images the soil wetness index (SWI) were calculated. On the SWI relates to canopy and soil moisture. We supposed that the driest areas (SWI < 6%) exposed to wind erosion a greater extent. Overlapping the maps of physical parametes by the SWI map and the landuse map good correlations were found between the landuse and SWI indexes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

For the first time, the deltaic complex of Mahajamba bay has been surveyed, using SPOT 1 and SPOT 2 imagery. An intensive field survey together with complete aerial coverage at a scale of 1:40 000 were used for the validation of the digital classification. The accuracy of cartographic products and of vegetation changes is closely related both to the adopted image processing methods and to the season of satellite data acquisition. The main input of the present contribution is to provide precise descriptions and mapping of the mangroves in Madagascar using high resolution remote sensing technology to assess conspicuous changes. Some conspicuous limitations of satellite data have also been noted. Nevertheless the results can be used for conservation and management purposes.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1998	19	10					1873	1886		10.1080/014311698215036								WOS:000074702300003

Even fewer publications have addressed the use of topographic normalization methods in these regions. This article discusses the influence of anisotropic reflectance patterns on land cover classification for two study areas characterized by very rugged terrain and high relief.

J	Hussein, MH				Hussein, MH			Water erosion assessment and control in northern Iraq	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The semiarid region of northern Iraq consists of about 12 millions ha of forest, grazing and farmland areas. Water erosion is a serious problem on forest and grazing lands due mainly to land mismanagement. On cropland, conventional farming practices and intensive cropping increased water erosion on marginal land. To assess the damage caused by water erosion in the region, the Universal Soil Loss Equation was used to predict the potential annual soil loss. Present erosion and erosion forms were determined by site visits, remote sensing and from soil survey reports. These information were then compiled in a soil degradation map for the region. The map consists of nine units. Each map unit characterizes potential and present water erosion, erosion forms and a land-use capability index. Overall, about 23% of total land area has slight water erosion. About 22% of total land area which is mostly mountainous land located to the north and northeast of the region has severe water erosion. The rest of the region has a slight to moderate water erosion. An exception are the areas of Sinjar mountain, Adhaim valley and the Hemrin and Makhool mountains where severe rill and gully erosion were identified; these areas form about 8% of total land area in the region. Further land deterioration in the region is expected unless the proper soil conservation measures are implemented.

J	DeGraaf, RM; Hestbeck, JB; Yamasaki, M				DeGraaf, RM; Hestbeck, JB; Yamasaki, M			Associations between breeding bird abundance and stand structure in the White Mountains, New Hampshire and Maine, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Assessment of faunal distribution in relation to landscape features is becoming increasingly popular. Technological advances in remote sensing have encouraged regional analyses of the distributions of terrestrial vertebrates. Comparisons of the: strength of association of habitat characteristics at various scales of measurement of habitat structure are rare. We compared the associations of forest-type, stand size-class, and stand structure to abundance of breeding bird species in managed forest in northern New England, We surveyed breeding birds and measured stand structure in 20 stands to test the hypothesis that forest cover-type, stand size-class, and structure variables were equally associated with numbers of forest birds. We fit regression models to data from each data source to predict the log number of individuals for each species. We restricted our analyses to cover-types with > 1 size-class and to size-classes representing > 1 cover-type, and restricted our comparisons to bird species with at least 10 observations/yr for 2 yr. Of 31 bird species that met our criteria for analysis, a significant(P < 0.05) association was detected between bird abundance and structure data for 30 species. cover-type data fur 19 species, and size-class data for 10 species. Stand structure was the best predictor of bird abundance for 25 species, cover-type for 5 species, and size-class for none. Of the 14 structure variables used in the analyses, total foliage volume of large and mid-size deciduous trees, density of mid-size trees, total woody stem density, total deciduous understory volume and total volume of large conifers were most frequently important in explaining variation in species abundances. Although path species had a unique set of structural affinities, multi-layered stands are apparently more important to long-distance migrants, in general, than to resident/short distance migrants. Large-scale efforts to identify important habitats, assess degree of protection, or monitor species/habitat trends are important to conservation. For forest birds, such efforts must include estimates of the factors to which the species of concern respond. At the stand scale in New England, it seems that bird abundance is more strongly associated with forest structure than with forest cover-type or stand size-class.

J	Mayaux, P; Achard, F; Malingreau, JP				Mayaux, P; Achard, F; Malingreau, JP			Global tropical forest area measurements derived from coarse resolution satellite imagery: a comparison with other approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Definition of appropriate tropical forest policies must be supported by better information about forest distribution. New information technologies make possible the development of advanced systems which can accurately report on tropical forest area issues. The European Commission TREES (Tropical Ecosystem Environment observation by Satellite) project has produced a consistent map of the humid tropical forest cover based on 1 km resolution satellite data. This base-line reference information can be further calibrated using a sample of high-resolution data, in order to produce accurate forest area estimates. There is good general agreement with other pantropical inventories (Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Forest Resources Assessment 90, World Conservation Union Conservation Atlas of Tropical Forests, National Aeronautics & Space Administration [USA] Landsat Pathfinder) using different approaches (compilation of existing data, statistical sampling, exhaustive survey with satellite data). However, for some countries, large differences appear among the assessments. Discrepancies arising from this comparison are here analysed in terms of limitations associated with each approach and they are generally associated with differences in forest definition, data source and processing methodology. According to the different inventories, the total area of closed tropical forest is estimated at 1090-1220 million hectares with the following continental distribution: 185-215 million hectares in Africa, 235-275 million hectares in Asia, and 670-730 million hectares in Latin America. A proposal for improving the current state of forest statistics by combining the contribution of the various methods under review is made.																	0376-8929					MAR	1998	25	1					37	52		10.1017/S0376892998000083								WOS:000073321000007						
J	Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD				Mumby, PJ; Green, EP; Edwards, AJ; Clark, CD			Coral reef habitat-mapping: how much detail can remote sensing provide?	MARINE BIOLOGY												The capability of satellite and airborne remote-sensing methods for mapping Caribbean coral reefs is evaluated. Reef habitats were categorised into coarse, intermediate and fine detail, using hierarchical classification of field data (percent cover in 1 m quadrats and seagrass standing-crop). Habitats were defined as assemblages of benthic macro-organisms and substrata and were mapped using the satellite sensors Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Habitats were also mapped using the high-resolution digital airborne sensor, CASI (compact airborne spectrographic imager). To map areas >60 km in any direction with coarse detail, Landsat TM was the most accurate and cost-effective satellite sensor (SPOT XS when < 60 km). For maps with intermediate habitat detail, aerial photography (from a comparable study in Anguilla) exhibited similar accuracy to Landsat TM, SPOT XS, SPOT Pan and merged Landsat TM/SPOT Pan. Landsat MSS was consistently the least accurate sensor. Maps from CASI were significantly (p < 0.001) more accurate than satellite sensors and aerial photographs. Maps with detailed habitat information (i.e. >9 reef classes) had a maximum accuracy of 37% when based on satellite imagery, but aerial photography and CASI achieved accuracies of 67 and 81%, respectively. Commissioning of new aerial photography does not appear to be a cost-effective option; satellites are cheaper for coarse habitat-mapping, and detailed habitat-mapping can be conducted more accurately and cheaply with CASI. The results will guide practitioners in matching survey objectives to appropriate remote-sensing methods.

J	Debinski, DM; Humphrey, PS				Debinski, DM; Humphrey, PS			An integrated approach to biological diversity assessment	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												Although biodiversity assessment has become a topic of interest in the last decade, there are no specific guidelines as to how such assessments should be conducted, and the initiation of such projects can be a daunting task. The primary goal of most biodiversity assessments is to obtain species lists for the taxa of interest; but species lists are only a first step. Biodiversity assessments provide opportunities for monitoring community changes over time, prioritizing areas of conservation concern, and developing testable hypotheses relating patterns of geographic variation in species assemblages to selected environmental factors. If the data collected are to be useful for elucidating ecological relationships or monitoring trends over time, rigorous methods of sampling and analysis must be established. To aid managers, systematists, and ecologists in obtaining useful biodiversity data, we have described an integrated approach to biodiversity assessment. Our approach includes the use of species effort curves, Geographic Information Systems, remotely sensed data, and multivariate ordination techniques. We address selection of taxonomic groups, sampling replication, and the relative merits of presence/absence data and abundance data for terrestrial systems.

It also war intended to help the development of sustainable agriculture and associated environmental harmony However, its effectiveness has been questioned because of the large rests and extensive staff required to conduct the program. The objectives of our study were to test procedures for integrating remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to evaluate the present CRP in terms of its main goal, and to give recommendations for the future of the program in Finney County, Kansas. Three seasonal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were used to derive the land-use/land cover (LULC) map. This information was incorporated with spatial dimensions of soil surface horizon thickness, surface horizon texture, soil family, soil subgroup, and soil erodibility index (EI), all of which were extracted or calculated from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil survey geographic (SSURGO) data base. With GIS techniques, calculation of EI was move efficient and the value was more accurate than that calculated by hand. We found the average EI of the county to be 20, with the highest EI of 77 in the southwest portion of the study area. CRP land had higher soil fertility and a lower EI than land currently used for farming; therefore, the CRP for this county did not necessarily include the lank most susceptible to erosion. We suggest continuing the CRP program in Finney County, because the soils are generally at serious risk of erosion. We also suggest modifying the eligibility rules of the program in order to target the most environmentally sensitive lands.

Remote sensing techniques are one of the most cost-effective methods of resource mapping. Sonar is the optimal method of remote sensing the seabed in turbid, temperate marine waters. Acoustic ground discrimination systems provide a relatively simple, low-cost method of sea bed mapping but are designed to map the physical environmental variables of topography and seabed type. The BioMar project at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne has developed methods of analysing acoustic data in conjunction with biological information to produce biological resource maps, These methods utilise geographic information systems (GIS).

The 190,000 ha Reserve was established as an International Biosphere Reserve by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1979. It is the most important natural landscape remaining in China's temperate/boreal climate. The images used in this research cover a total area of 967,847 ha, about three-fourths of which is in China. Imagery from 1972 and 1988 was classified into 2 broad cover types (forest and non-forest). Overall, forests covered 84.4% of the study area in 1972 and 74.5% in 1988. Changes in forest cover within the Reserve were minimal. The loss of forest cover outside the Reserve appears to be strongly associated with timber harvesting at lower elevations. Landscape patterns in 1988 were more complex, more irregular, and more fragmented than in 1972. This is one of the few studies to assess landscape changes across two countries. The rates and patterns of forest-cover loss were different in China and North Korea. In North Korea, extensive cutting appears to have occurred prior to 1972 and this has continued through 1988 while in China, most cutting appears to have occurred since 1972.																	0921-2973					AUG	1997	12	4					241	254		10.1023/A:1007963324520								WOS:A1997XV63300004						
J	Menon, S; Bawa, KS				Menon, S; Bawa, KS			Applications of geographic information systems, remote-sensing, and a landscape ecology approach to biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats	CURRENT SCIENCE												The mountains along the west coast of peninsular India, the Western Ghats, constitute one of the unique biological regions of the world. Rapidly occurring land-cover and land-use change in the Western Ghats has serious implications for the biodiversity of the region. Both landscape changes as well as the distribution of biodiversity are phenomena with strong spatial correlates. Recent developments in remote-sensing technology and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow the use of a landscape ecology and spatial analysis approach to the problem of deforestation and biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats. Applications of this approach include analyses of land-cover and landuse change; estimation of deforestation rates and rates of forest fragmentation; examination of the spatial correlates of forest loss and the socioeconomic drivers of land-use change; modelling of deforestation; analysis of the consequences of land-cover and land-use change in the form of climate change and change in distribution of biodiversity; biomass estimation; gap analysis of the effectiveness of the protected area network in conserving areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; and conservation planning. We present examples from our work in the Western Ghats, in general, and in the Agastyamalai region and Biligiri Rangan Hills, in particular, as well as that of other researchers in India on various aspects of applications of GIS, remote sensing, and's landscape ecology approach to biodiversity conservation.

Remote sensing could provide the potential of estimating amount of crop residue using reflectance measurement and model simulation procedures. The purpose of this study was (1) to use the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model to simulate crop residue reflectance from wheat, Triticum aestivum (L.), at visible and near-infrared wavelengths; and (2) to compare the simulated reflectance with field-measured reflectance for evaluating the simulation model. Simulated reflectance in visible and near-infrared wavebands was overestimated about 1 to 5 per cent, compared with measured reflectance in the held. However, overestimation was within the experimental errors. Results suggest that the SAIL model can be used to simulate crop residue reflectance in different wheat crop residue covers and that wheat crop residue cover could be estimated by inverting the model.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1997	18	10					2261	2267		10.1080/014311697217891								WOS:A1997XH14300015

A 15-year fire history (1980-94) was assembled for Kakadu National Park, a 20 000 km(2) World Heritage property in monsoonal northern Australia, based on interpretation of LANDSAT MSS imagery sampled at least three times over the 7-month dry season. 2. Detailed ground-truthing was undertaken at the end of the early dry season period (May-July) for both 1993 and 1994; ground-truth data were not available for previous years. Overall agreement was greater than 80% in both years. In sum, these data inspire a relatively high degree of confidence in the interpreted fire history of the Park for any one year, at least at the landscape and habitat scales examined here. 3. An average of 46% of the Park was found to be burnt each year over the 15 years of records, with 25% burnt in the early, and 21% burnt in the late, dry season. The data indicate a pronounced shift from a fire regime dominated by late (typically more intense and potentially extensive) dry season fires up until the mid-1980s, to one dominated by early (typically of low intensity and patchy) dry season fire subsequently. 4. Whereas an average of 55% of lowland savanna habitats has been burnt annually, 28% of habitats occupying both sandstone plateau and riverine landforms have been burnt each year. The great majority of burning in relatively fire-sensitive sandstone habitats continues to be in the late dry season. Data indicate a marked increase in the extent of burning on floodplains and in associated fire-sensitive Melaleuca forests and lowland rainforests, from 1990; this increase is attributed to increased herbaceous fuel loads associated with the removal of feral Asian water buffalo. 5. Proximity analyses indicate that slightly more early dry season burning has been undertaken close to roads, and at greater distances from settlements; no proximity differences were discernible for fires late in the dry season. Burning has been concentrated close to lowland drainage lines, both in the early and late dry season. 6. Lowland savanna sites are burnt on average 3 out of 5 years. In contrast, the majority of sandstone plateau and riverine floodplain sites have burnt on average 0-4 times and 0-3 times, respectively, over the 15 years of records. 7. The median size of contiguously burnt areas (patches) has been declining steadily over the 15 years of records, from upwards of 300 ha initially to c. 60 ha in 1994. 8. It is concluded that although the assembled data are imperfect in that they underrepresent wet season burns and very small fires, are prone to positional errors of up to c. 300 m, and because little confidence can be placed in the sequential fire histories for any 1-ha site, they afford an effective means by which the Park's fire management programme can be monitored, its problems identified, and its needs assessed. The demonstrable utility of this programme has led to its recent extension on other significant conservation properties in monsoonal northern Australia; the procedure offers potential for wider adoption in savanna regions generally.																	0021-8901					JUN	1997	34	3					748	766		10.2307/2404920								WOS:A1997XG78600015

To test the classification of grassland quality, plot-based vegetation data collected from 32 sites are analyzed for differences in species composition, and evaluated for relationships between TRI data and plant diversity. Significant differences between predicted high and low quality grassland sites are identified for the following variables: cover of the dominant and common species, overall species richness, number of forbs, number of grasses, and plant diversity using Shannon's index. Linear regression analysis reveals a significant relationship (r(2)=0.61) between species diversity and the prediction of grassland quality from the supervised classification The addition of spectral data to this model did not improve the prediction of species diversity, but spectral brightness is identified as a key feature in mapping shortgrass vegetation diversity patterns with TM data.																	1100-9233					JUN	1997	8	3					387	394		10.2307/3237328								WOS:A1997XL27800009

P-, L-, and C-band SAR data, collected over a section of Kakadu National Park in Australia's Northern Territory during the Joint NASA/Australia DC-8 data acquisition campaign, were analyzed in light of field data integrating vegetation structure and floristics with bird abundances across a heterogeneous study site. Results indicate that SAR data are able to discern structural differences relevant to bird habitat quality within floristically homogeneous stands, while multispectral sensors successfully identified floristic differences among habitat types. Simplifying indices of bird diversity showed ambiguous changes across the site; however, the abundances of individual species were observed to change significantly across both floristic and structural gradients. These results suggest that efforts to map bird diversity should focus on species-specific habitat relationships and that some measure of vegetation structure is needed to understand bird habitat. The approach employed here advances the use of SAR data in the three-dimensional mapping of animal habitats from remotely sensed data, and extends current capabilities for mapping and modeling large-scale patterns in the distribution of biological diversity.

A collaborative project, the Vegetation and Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP), addressed modeling of multiple resource limitation at the scale of the conterminous United States, and the responses of ecosystems to environmental change. In this paper, we evaluate the model-generated patterns of spatial variability within and between ecosystems using Century, TEM, and Biome-BGC, and the relationships between modeled water balance, nutrients, and carbon dynamics. We present evaluations of models against mapped and site-specific data. In this analysis, we compare model-generated patterns of variability in net primary productivity (NPP) and soil organic carbon (SOC) to, respectively, a satellite proxy and mapped SOC from the VEMAP soils database (derived from USDA-NRCS [Natural Resources Conservation Service] information) and also compare modeled results to site-specific data from forests and grasslands. The VEMAP models simulated spatial variability in ecosystem processes in substantially different ways, reflecting the models' differing implementations of multiple resource limitation of NPP. The models had substantially higher correlations across vegetation types compared to within vegetation types. All three models showed correlation among water use, nitrogen availability, and primary production, indicating that water and nutrient limitations of NPP were equilibrated with each other at steady state. This model result may explain a number of seemingly contradictory observations and provides a series of testable predictions. The VEMAP ecosystem models were implicitly or explicitly sensitive to disturbance in their simulation of NPP and carbon storage. Knowledge of the effects of disturbance (human and natural) and spatial data describing disturbance regimes are needed for spatial modeling of ecosystems. Improved consideration of disturbance is a key ''next step'' for spatial ecosystem models.

J	Nohr, H; Jorgensen, AF				Nohr, H; Jorgensen, AF			Mapping of biological diversity in Sahel by means of satellite image analyses and ornithological surveys	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Through analysis of biological data and satellite images from the Ferlo region in Northern Senegal, the correlations between remote sensing data and biological diversity have been tested. Data on a number of biological and abiotic factors have been compared with different analyses of LANDSAT TM and NOAA satellite images. Biological diversity has mainly been measured through ornithological surveys in the dry seasons 1991-1993. Correlations are obtained between different measurements for avian diversity and the combination of a landscape diversity index based on a LANDSAT TM pixel analysis, and the yearly biomass production expressed by INDVI for the study areas (multivariable coefficient of determination r(2) ranging from 0.35 to 0.56). A multiple regression model, based on 10 different parameters from the study sites, can explain 59-68% of the variation in avian species richness, number of individuals and Simson diversity index. The following factors are significantly involved in explaining the model: latitude, LANDSAT TM landscape diversity indices, plant biomass, bare ground, herbaceous and woody vegetation. Explaining factors vary in relation to the avian parameter used in the model, but in general latitude (-), LANDSAT TM landscape diversity indices (+) and bare ground (+) are significant factors in all models. Based on the positive multivariable regression between avian diversity and features of LANDSAT TM and NOAA images, a biodiversity map has been produced for the Ferlo region. This map can be one layer of a future integrated conservation strategy for the Ferlo region. Limitations for the interpretation of the map, and recommendations for improvement of the data gathering and analyses in similar studies, are discussed.																	0960-3115					APR	1997	6	4					545	566		10.1023/A:1018333328680								WOS:A1997WV93800004

Our landscape data included a remote sensing derived map of the current habitat of the study area and six maps of future habitat distributions resulting from different land development scenarios. Our species data included lists of all bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species in the study area, their habitat associations, and area requirements for each. We estimated the area requirements using home ranges, sampled population densities, or genetic area requirements that incorporate dispersal distances. Our measures of biodiversity were species richness and habitat abundance. We calculated habitat abundance in two ways. First, we computed the total habitat area for each species in each landscape. Second, we calculated the number of habitat units for each species in each landscape by dividing the size of each habitat patch in the landscape by the area requirement and summing over all patches. Species richness was based on presence of habitat. Species became extinct in the landscape if they had no habitat area or no habitat units, respectively. We then computed ratios of habitat abundance in each future landscape to habitat abundance in the present for each species. We also computed the ratio of future to present species richness. We then calculated summary statistics across all species. Species richness changed little from present to future. There were distinctly greater risks to habitat abundance in landscapes that extrapolated from present trends of zoning patterns, however, as opposed to landscapes in which land development activities followed more constrained patterns. These results were stable when tested using Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity tests on the area requirements. We conclude that this methodology can begin to discriminate the effects of potential changes in land development on vertebrate biodiversity.

This study demonstrates their application in sustainable rural development planning especially for people at the grass root level, the farmers, in the Bahal-Singhani area of Bhiwani district, Haryana, in north-western India. A holistic approach was adopted considering the production and the conservation functions of the ecosystem. Remotely sensed data were utilized to assess the natural resources of the area. A thorough analysis of climatic, socio-economic and natural resources conditions was made. A set of rules was formulated and all the information was integrated to prepare realistic action plans. These action plans have found wide acceptance due to their practicability and soundness.																	0143-1161					OCT	1996	17	15					3055	3069		10.1080/01431169608949127								WOS:A1996VJ56400012

For conformity, it is presented as one sheet at a scale of 1 :5 million. It uses the basic map of the American Geographical Society (1942; bipolar oblique conformal projection) which forms the base for FAO's Soil map of the world. Basic information was obtained from many published maps, unpublished observations and satellite data. The limits of the main vegetation types have been updated with a complete set of Landsat MSS images (369 scenes) with a mosaic of Landsat TM data for 1991 and with recent forest maps from Asia. Nine main vegetation units, which are groups of forest formations, have been identified and mapped, including woodlands, thickets and wooded savannas. Agricultural land has been shown in a uniform pale green colour in order to clearly express the extent of human impacts on woody vegetation. In spite of the necessary oversimplification of the ground data, this map is probably the most explicit expression of the remaining forest stands and of the regression of natural vegetation in the region. It can be considered as a benchmark for future monitoring of tropical vegetation.																	1100-9233					OCT	1996	7	5					623	634		10.2307/3236374								WOS:A1996WB06300003						
J	AlGarni, AM				AlGarni, AM			A system with predictive least-squares mathematical models for monitoring wildlife conservation sites using GIS and remotely-sensed data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Today there is a worldwide trend towards protecting the environment and its natural resources. This goal is achieved using different procedures and techniques. Remote sensing and geographical information systems, however, are two of the most suitable techniques for monitoring, analysing, and managing Earth resources. Conserved natural areas for wildlife is one of the most important natural resources that should be explored using GIS and RS technologies. In this study, a prototype GIS that can integrate remotely-sensed data to monitor conservation areas (for wildlife) in arid and semi-arid regions is developed. The system uses TM images and other heuristic information to perform its analysis and prediction. Future change in land-cover is anticipated by mathematical models. The mathematical models are developed by this study based on the concepts of least-squares theories and techniques. The system is operational. It is tested using an area in Saudi Arabia. The obtained results showed that the system is accurate.																	0143-1161					SEP 10	1996	17	13					2479	2503		10.1080/01431169608949088								WOS:A1996VC47600002

Forest cover loss during the period 1935 to 1987 was characterized using data derived from aerial photography, historical map products, and Landsat satellite multispectral imagery. Forest cover in the basin declined from 65% to 15% over the 52-year period (a loss of 108,000 ha of forest cover). There was little change in forest cover between 1975 and 1987. Remaining forest stands in the basin are fragmented and small in size. Comparing forest-stand data with Soil Conservation Service data revealed that 90% of the forest loss in the southern half of the basin occurred in hydric soil areas, thus indicating a significant loss of forested wetlands.																	0277-5212					SEP	1996	16	3					258	263		10.1007/BF03161317								WOS:A1996VK49900002

The BirdLife Biodiversity project has mapped the distributions of all the world's restricted-range bird species and identified the areas where they are concentrated. Re-analysis of project data originally published in 1992 has led to the identification of 218 'Endemic Bird Areas' (EBAs), defined as areas supporting two or more species with ranges less than 50,000 km(2). Point locality data for a total of 2649 such restricted-range birds were mapped using GIS to identify these areas. A large series of regional maps and six tables present the project findings in outline, and details of revisions to the original analysis are provided. In total, EBAs occupy a mere 4.5% of the Earth's land surface, and contain 73% of all globally threatened birds; research to date indicates a high congruence of endemism between birds and other life-forms, so that it is reasonable to propose that EBAs should be used as guides to general centres of endemism. Identifying refugia, the use of GIS and remote sensing, and exchange of information between biogeographers are three ways to continue this work towards a global map of biodiversity.																	0960-7447					JUL-SEP	1996	5	4-5					281	304		10.2307/2997796								WOS:A1996VY33900010

We examine how these two forces drive flow movement in the downstream and cross-stream directions by adopting a volume conservation approach. Simplifying assumptions reduce the governing equation to the dimensionless form partial derivative/partial derivative x(alpha h(m)) = partial derivative/partial derivative y(alpha h(m) partial derivative h/partial derivative y), where x and y are the downstream and cross-stream directions, respectively; h is the flow depth; and alpha = alpha(x) and m are prescribed by the rheology of the fluid, We solve this equation analytically for flows of arbitrary m and alpha using a similarity transformation. This method involves transforming variables and reducing the governing equation to a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Our solution determines how flow depth and width change with distance from the source of the now for different alpha and m based on known or assumed initial parameters. Consequently, from the traditional geometric dimensions of the deposits, these rheological parameters can be inferred. We have applied the model to basaltic lava flows and found m values typically between 1 and 2. This contrasts with Newtonian fluids, for which m=3. The model of alpha(x) corresponding to constant viscosity approximates the field data of pahoehoe toes (<5 meters in length), whereas models of alpha(x) corresponding to linearly increasing and exponentially increasing viscosities better approximate the remote sensing data of longer flows (several kilometers in length).																	2169-9313	2169-9356				MAY 10	1996	101	B5					11565	11577		10.1029/96JB00178								WOS:A1996UL09000032						
J	Townsend, PA; Butler, DR				Townsend, PA; Butler, DR			Patterns of landscape use by beaver on the lower Roanoke River floodplain, North Carolina	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Satellite imagery was used to map dramatic increases in area impounded by beaver activity between 1984 and 1993 in the Roanoke River floodplain of eastern North Carolina. The tenfold increase in beaver impoundment coincides with natural increases in beaver populations in North Carolina and the transfer of lands within the floodplain into conservation ownership. The results were analyzed within a geographic information system to examine patterns of landscape use by, and landscape changes resulting from, beaver activity. In general, floodplain beaver impoundments are associated either with sloughs, where ponds form connected linear complexes extending the length of a swale; or backswamps, where ponds spread unconstrained from the edge into the interior of the swamp. Increases in beaver activity between 1984 and 1993 dramatically increased the length of beaver-pond edge and associated habitat within the floodplain. Additionally, beaver ponds became significantly less isolated within the floodplain, making beavers a significant environmental influence upon vegetation dynamics within the floodplain. Although beavers do not specifically browse upon baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), areas characterized by these species are most affected by increased beaver activity because these also represent the areas that are most prone to flooding. Localized beaver activity may result in decreased forest regeneration owing to the extended flooding caused by beaver impoundments and the growth of shrub-herbaceous ''beaver meadows'' along the saturated fringes of beaver impoundments.

The importance of these government-owned reservations as nationally valuable resources has been relatively unrecognized. During the last 50 years, the DOE Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) has been a relatively protected island in a region of rapidly expanding urbanization and land clearing. Consisting of the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park and associated lands surrounding DOE facilities at Oak Ridge Tennessee, the unique nature of the ORR in the surrounding landscape is clearly visible from the air and has been documented using remote sensing data. Although forests dominate much of other regions of eastern Tennessee, this 15,000-ha tract of mostly natural forest habitat is unique in the southern Ridge and Valley physiographic province, which is otherwise widely developed for pasture, marginal cropland, woodlot, and urban uses. Twenty state-listed and federal-candidate plant species are known to be present on the ORR. This richness of species, which are provided protection by state and federal laws, exceeds that of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on a species area basis and is an index of the value of the ORR both regionally and nationally in conserving biodiversity. With the end of the Cold War, changing DoD and DOE missions combined with increasing development pressure contribute to uncertainty in the future management of security reservations.																	0364-152X					MAR-APR	1996	20	2					207	218		10.1007/BF01204005								WOS:A1996TZ62800005

Massive deforestation has taken place, mainly in the last 20 years, 79% of unprotected forests have been eliminated on the 100 X 100 km study area. Deforestation is also beginning to encroach on protected areas. Forest fragments are mainly found close to the deforestation front. In areas which were first deforested, forest fragments are very scarce and are restricted to less productive soils; they are often severely degraded. Young secondary forests develop on abandoned fields, but primary forest regeneration seems unlikely in light of the distance from seed sources and the increase in population pressure. Conservation initiatives in this zone of high biodiversity should focus on protected areas, taking into account short and long term benefits for the local population.																	0960-3115					JAN	1996	5	1					37	53		10.1007/BF00056291								WOS:A1996TW70400003

Because current methods for measuring crop residue cover are tediuous and somewhat subjective, there is a need for new methods to measure residue cover that are rapid, accurate, and objective. We discuss the potential for discriminating crop residues from soils using reflectance and fluorescence techniques and examine experimentally the changes in wheat residue fluorescence during weathering. The fluorescence of crop residue was a board band phenomenon with emissions extending from 420 to 600 nm for excitation of 350-420 nm. Soils had low intensity broad band emissions over the 400-690 nm region for excitations of 300-600 nm. We found that the fluorescence intensities for the crop residues were much greater than the fluorescence of the soils, but as the crop residues decompose, their blue-green fluorescence intensities approach the fluorescence of the soils. We conclude that fluorescence techniques are less ambiguous and better suited for discriminating crop residues from soils than the reflectance methods. However, the potential problems, that must be addressed to implement the fluorescence technique, are (i) adequate excitation energy must be supplied to induce fluorescence and (ii) the fluorescence signal is small relative to normal, ambient sunlight. Nevertheless, if properly implemented, we believe that the fluorescence techniques can be used to quantify crop residue cover in field.																	0177-798X						1996	54	1-2					17	26		10.1007/BF00863555								WOS:A1996UY03800003

The accuracy of the methods depends on how closely habitat mapping classes are linked to population demography Habitat use by Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) was quantified using circular plots. Habitat variation was mapped using high-resolution aerial photography on a site where all Florida Scrub Jays were color-banded. Nest site selection, nest success, yearling production, and breeder survival were measured within Florida Scrub Jay territories. Habitat use was lowest in areas without scrub oaks or areas within 136 m from forests. Open oak, dominated by scrub oaks and open sandy areas, had the highest use and nest success among habitats. Open oak occurred as narrow patches (<20 m wine) in landscapes dominated by matrix habitat (palmetto-lyonia and swale marshes). Most wide patches (>50 m) of open oak were potential population sources, where reproduction exceeded mortality. Areas with patches of open oak of less than 1 ha were usually population sinks. Open oak occurred as less flammable patches in a landscape subject to frequent fires. Population sources varied temporally and spatially with fires and sire potential to support scrub oaks (soils). Analyses of landscape patterns and dynamics indicated that habitat mapping should not only include patches of currently optimal habitat but should also include landscapes associated with open oak. The influences of landscape patterns on habitat use, reproductive success, survival, and territory size can be quantified at different scales starting with attributes associated with habitat patches, nest sites, and territories. Potential mapping errors occur, however, when habitats are used to quantify the areal extent of sources and sinks and similar population attributes important for species persistence.																	0888-8892	1523-1739				DEC	1995	9	6					1442	1453		10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061442.x								WOS:A1995TL67200013						
J	Franklin, J				Franklin, J			Predictive vegetation mapping: Geographic modelling of biospatial patterns in relation to environmental gradients	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Predictive vegetation mapping can be defined as predicting the geographic distribution of the vegetation composition across a landscape from mapped environmental variables. Computerized predictive vegetation mapping is made possible by the availability of digital maps of topography and other environmental variables such as soils, geology and climate variables, and geographic information system software for manipulating these data. Especially important to predictive vegetation mapping are interpolated climatic variables related to physiological tolerances, and topographic variables, derived from digital elevation grids, related to site energy and moisture balance. Predictive vegetation mapping is founded in ecological niche theory and gradient analysis, and driven by the need to map vegetation patterns over large areas for resource conservation planning, and to predict the effects of environmental change on vegetation distributions. Predictive vegetation mapping has advanced over the past two decades especially in conjunction with the development of remote sensing-based vegetation mapping and digital geographic information analysis. A number of statistical and, more recently, machine-learning methods have been used to develop and implement predictive vegetation models.																	0309-1333					DEC	1995	19	4					474	499		10.1177/030913339501900403								WOS:A1995TK67900003

Four federal land management agencies-the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, U.S. National Park Service, and U.S. Forest Service-have used aerial photography and satellite imagery to document the extent, type, and condition of Alaska's natural resources. Aerial photographs have been used to collect detailed information over small to medium-sized areas. This standard management tool is obtainable using equipment ranging from hand-held 35-mm cameras to precision metric mapping cameras. satellite data, equally important, provide synoptic views of landscapes, are digitally manipulatable, and are easily merged with other digital databases. To date, over 109.2 million ha (72%) of Alaska's land cover have been mapped via remote sensing. This information has provided a base for conservation, management, and planning on federal public lands in Alaska.																	0885-8608					OCT	1995	15	4					329	338										WOS:A1995TC15500008

This paper describes a methodology developed to compile a treatment-oriented land-use planning scheme for a hilly watershed using a geographical information system (GIS). A remote sensing based physiographic soils map and a digital elevation model (DEM) are the sources of soil depth and slope steepness classes, respectively, and are the information databases for GIS analysis. The GIS was used to integrate these databases and provide tools for manipulation of the data. A set of knowledge-based rules was formed from the classification scheme formulated by Sheng and Stennett (1975) for hilly watersheds, modified to allow for the local land-use patterns. These rules were used to manipulate the databases and allow the establishment of a sustained land-use system in the watershed with proper soil and water conservation measures. This biological engineering scheme would be a safeguard against soil erosion and other environmental threats. A priority sub-watersheds delineation survey conducted in the watershed indicates significant variation in the silt yield index values, which calls for conservation planning in earnest in cases of high and very high priority sub-watersheds.																	0898-5812					SEP	1995	6	3					171	178		10.1002/ldr.3400060305								WOS:A1995RY66700004

These have invariably been orientated towards conservation and management goals, and the information used to assess wetland loss or to assign management priorities. Existing national and regional classification systems have not only been useful, but they provide an essential base for developing an international system. At the international level, differences among existing systems in the definition of a wetland and how wetland types are defined assume great importance and need to be resolved. Classification is an essential prerequisite for wetland inventory. A number of international inventories have been undertaken, although these have not generally utilized the available high technology and data storage systems available through remote sensing and geographic information systems. More extensive international inventories will require standardization of techniques for data collection, storage and dissemination. A minimum data set needs to be defined with standards for data accuracy. An international committee under the auspices of an international agency (e.g. IWRB, Ramsar Bureau, IUCN) needs to be established to develop an international classification system and guidelines for carrying out a complete inventory of the world's wetlands.

A principal components analysis indicates that the major source of variability at the scale of TM resolution (approximate to 30 m) is related to TM band 4 (TM4) radiance, and that the second and third most important sources are related to TM bands 5 and 7, respectively. Cluster analysis of TM4, TM5, and TM7 radiance produced six distinct land-cover types, which follow a topographic gradient. Both TM radiance and the radiance coefficient of variation (CV) are significant in discriminating land-cover types. The primary source of variability within upland forests is related to TM4, and the primary sources of variability within lowland swamps are related to TM5 and TM7. We infer from these results that green leaf biomass is the most important variable in discriminating between land-cover types in the uplands, and that canopy closure and degree of senescence are the most important variables in the lowland swamps. We also examined patterns of landscape diversity reflected in three landscape indices: the number of land-cover types (LCT), the Shannon-Weaver index of landscape evenness (S-W), and a topographic index (TI). The strongest correlations were found for TM4 radiance and TI (r = 0.94, n = 30, P < 0.0001) and S-W (r = -0.72, n = 30, P < 0.0001), and between TM4 radiance CV and LCT (r(s) = 0.67, n = 30, P < 0.0001). Thus, TM4 provides a good measure of landscape diversity. We found a perfect nonparametric correlation (r(s) = 1, n = 6) between TM4 radiance CV within a land cover type and the type's TI rank, which probably reflects increasing canopy heterogeneity between lowland swamps and upland forests. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of TM-based land-cover maps and diversity indices in designing and monitoring nature reserves.

The aims of this study were to quantify the changes occurring in the various habitat types following raising of the waterlevel and to assess the stability of the plant communities present at this Ramsar site. The current hydrological regime, which has been stable since 1986, is typified by an increase in mean annual reservoir level of 2.2 m and by an increase in the annual range in level of 1.3 m. Landsat (1980, 1981, 1984, 1986, and 1988) and SPOT (1990) satellite images show a decrease in the area of grassland and shallow water areas, the very rapid disappearance of reedbeds, the appearance of beds of Nymphaea and the disappearance of half the forest area. The flooded forest, dominated by Salix alba, is a key habitat contributing to the biological richness of this wetland of international importance. The decrease in the forested area will continue because of the death of standing trees, the absence of regeneration under the new regime, the felling of trees and grazing. Management could be undertaken to ensure the survival of forested habitat and reedbeds at Kerkini, but this would require that the authorities take into account nature conservation and the protected status of the site and not raise the water level again.																	0364-152X					MAY-JUN	1995	19	3					417	430		10.1007/BF02471983								WOS:A1995QR83300010

These were combined with several atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) models to allow computation of basin-scale surface fluxes of sensible (H) and latent heat (LE). The calculated fluxes were compared to averages from a network of surface flux stations. One ABL model calculated H using a bulk similarity approach for wind and temperature with remotely sensed surface temperature as the lower bo undary condition. With basin-scale estimates of R(n) and G, LE was solved as a residual. The other ABL model applied atmospheric profiles from a series of soundings in the conservation equations of temperature and humidity in the mixed layer to compute H and LE directly. By combining these H values with R(n) and G, calculation of LE by residual also was performed, The ABL-derived H values differed from the averages from the surface network by roughly 20 and 30% for the bulk similarity and conservation approaches, respectively. For LE, these same differences were around 10 and 70%. The disparity was reduced to nearly 30% for the conservation approach when LE was solved as a residual. Days with significant spatial variation in surface soil moisture and/or cloud cover were associated with most of the disagreement between the ABL-derived and surface-based values. This was particularly true for conservation estimates of LE. The bulk similarity method appeared less sensitive non-ideal environmental conditions. This may in part be due to the use of remotely sensed information, which provided a lower boundary value of surface temperature and estimates of R(n) and G over the study area, thereby allowing for residual calculations of LE. Such information clearly has utility for assessing the surface energy and water balance at basin scale.

A case study of the Dorset heathlands in southern England illustrates the application of this approach. Information on the historical extent of the heathlands was combined with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to assess the current extent of the heathlands together with the potential for adjacent other lands (formerly heathland) to be converted to heathland again. The results of this work showed that the current extent of the Dorset heathlands is about 44.3 km(2). Heathland that had been converted to grassland since 1960 was considered to be the category of land use most suitable for the restoration of heathlnnd. It was found that 27.5% of this type of landfalls within 100 m of existing heathland and, under changed management, could significantly improve the natural resource of the region. This work draws upon an existing understanding of heathland ecology and demonstrates the application of geographical information systems to the solution of ecological and conservation problems.																	0006-3207						1995	72	1					91	97		10.1016/0006-3207(94)00070-7								WOS:A1995QL53100012

The area is a saline desert with extremely sparse cover of vegetation. In the past, the habitat supported a thriving population of wild asses. However, due to extensive changes in the land-use around the Rann of Kutch, there has been an increase in the conflict of interests between man and the wild ass. The present paper seeks to analyse the situation with respect to changes in land-use, vegetation cover and salt cultivation to plan proper habitat management inside the sanctuary to mitigate the problem of crop predation by the wild ass through the use of high resolution satellite data. The Survey of India (SOI) topographic maps of 1960 vintage were used to estimate the past habitat, land-use, vegetal cover and salt fields. The SOI topographic maps and false colour composites provided a limited number of land-use classes for a meaningful comparison of land-use changes. This data has been compared with digitally classified SPOT MLA on SIPS (Satellite Image Processing System, Hyderabad). Various techniques such as principal component analysis, normalized difference vegetation index, unsupervised and supervised classifications were carried to classify various features. Of these techniques, supervised classification provided very useful results for an effective interpretation. It was observed that there has been an increase in irrigated crop fields. This has resulted in enhanced crop predation by wild asses thereby triggering human-wild ass conflicts. The digital interpretation provided crucial information on a number of classes of land-use relevant to the habitat of wild ass. An operational basis of deriving such information for formulating effective conservation strategies is presented.																	0143-1161					NOV 10	1994	15	16					3155	3164		10.1080/01431169408954318								WOS:A1994PT57300005

Distribution maps of nine dominant coastal scrub species and 13 species assemblages that were identified by divisive information analysis have been analyzed to quantify spatial patterns of species co-occurrence. Three general distribution patterns are identified that suggest the Diegan, Venturan and Riversidian Associations identified by other workers. Vegetation data have also been related to land ownership and management to assess the conservation status of upland plant communities. A large proportion of the mapped distribution of species and vegetation types is on private land, and several taxa show less than 4% of mapped distribution in nature reserves. The analysis highlights the need to extend current conservation planning efforts into the northern part of the region to encompass areas where Salvia leucophylla is a frequent community dominant.

This information is combined in a geographic information system with ethnographic and survey research carried out over the past 5 years to develop representative spectral ''signatures'' which permit measurement and differentiation of land uses and the detection of change even between small areas of managed floodplain forest and unmanaged forest, and between three distinct age/growth classes of secondary succession following deforestation. Implementation of these procedures permit the scaling up or down of research at different resolutions. Three distinct patterns of land use are examined with differential impact on the environment. Mechanized agriculture at one site has eliminated virtually all the mature upland forest and is now dominated by secondary successional vegetation. The more traditional system of diversified land use at the next site shows a subtle cycling of flooded forest to managed palm forest through time in response to the price of palm fruit and cycling in the use of fallow land. A third site, based on palm fruit extractivism, shows minimal changes in land cover due to persistent specialization on management of flooded forest extraction. There is little evidence that the community with the greatest impact on forest cover is any better off economically than the two communities which have minimal impact on the landscape. This study suggests how a balance between use and conservation in Amazonia may be achieved in floodplain and estuarine areas, and the effectiveness of monitoring these types of land cover from satellite platforms.																	0300-7839					SEP	1994	22	3					249	278		10.1007/BF02168853								WOS:A1994PZ90400002

We investigated the spatial relationship of CRP fields to other land-use types using geographic information system (GIS) software. We used computer simulation and habitat modeling to evaluate northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) habitat quality with and without CRP land. Contribution of CRP fields to habitat quality depended on (1) the amount of CRP land present, (2) its suitability for bobwhite use, (3) the suitability of replaced and remaining cropland for bobwhite use, (4) the juxtaposition of CRP fields with other habitat components, and (5) the composition and quality of existing bobwhite habitat, in particular, the limiting factors.																	0099-1112					SEP	1994	60	9					1139	1143										WOS:A1994PN91800008

A 2589-km2 managed forest landscape in western Oregon was classified into two forest types, closed-canopy conifer forest (CF) (typically, >60% conifer cover) and other forest and nonforest types (OT) (typically, <40 yr old or deciduous forest). The percentage of CF declined from 71 to 58% between 1972 and 1988. Declines were greatest on private land, least in wilderness, and intermediate in public nonwilderness. High elevations (>914 m) maintained a greater percentage of CF than lower elevations (<914 m). The percentage of the area at the edge of the two cover types increased on all ownerships and in both elevational zones, whereas the amount of interior habitat (defined as CF at least 100 m from OT) decreased on all ownerships and elevational zones. By 1988 public lands contained almost-equal-to 45% interior habitat while private lands had 12% interior habitat. Mean interior patch area declined from 160 to 62 ha. The annual rate of disturbance (primarily clear-cutting) for the entire area including the wilderness was 1.19%, which corresponds to a cutting rotation of 84 yr. The forest landscape was not in a steady state or regulated condition which is not projected to occur for at least 40 yr under current forest plans. Variability in cutting rates within ownerships was higher on private land than on nonreserve public land. However, despite the use of dispersed cutting patterns on public land, spatial patterns of cutting and remnant forest patches were nonuniform across the entire public ownership. Large remaining patches (< 5000 ha) of contiguous interior forest were restricted to public lands designated for uses other than timber production such as wilderness areas and research natural areas.																	1051-0761					AUG	1994	4	3					555	568		10.2307/1941957								WOS:A1994NZ30800013

Two areas were considered in the study, Tucurui and Altamira. Spot/XS and Landsat/TM multispectral images were used, together with color aerial photographs of these areas. A computer-assisted visual interpretation procedure was employed to analyze images, and linear multispectral transformation was applied in selected subscenes in order to improve information extraction. The results indicate that high-resolution satellite imagery is generally compatible with the scale of the environmental problems in Amazonia and is a very efficient source of detailed information at a local scale on many aspects of the environment, in particular for monitoring changes over time in selected areas. Therefore, commercial satellite imagery, processed by specialized software, can accommodate a variety of analysis needs for decision makers and can also be an effective means of verification of international agreements on conservation of the environment in Amazonia.																	0364-152X					JUL-AUG	1994	18	4					597	604		10.1007/BF02400862								WOS:A1994NM13100010

The use of multispectral remote sensing in the identification of old growth has been largely confined to efforts in the Pacific Northwest. The purpose of this study was to determine which image processing techniques best discriminate between old growth and younger spruce-fir stands in the southern Rocky Mountains. Various image processing techniques were applied to TM imagery of the Marvine Lakes valley in the Colorado White River National Forest. The study focused on two major structural differences between the forest types. 1) multistoried (old growth) vs. single-storied (young growth) canopies and 2) higher frequency of standing dead in old growth. Field measurements of photosynthetically active radiation confirmed the hypothesis that old growth canopies contain more gaps than the young post-fire stands. Texture analysis, color-ratio techniques, and vegetation indices successfully identified old growth. Evaluation of the success of old growth identification within a geographic information system suggested that digital per-pixel classification was inferior to visual interpretation. Spatial and spectral methods must be used in combination if structurally variable old growth forests are to be detected.																	0034-4257					JUN	1994	48	3					291	301		10.1016/0034-4257(94)90003-5								WOS:A1994NV60400003

Both the full matrix inversion and the banded matrix iterative approaches are developed. By using.the principle of reciprocity and energy conservation, all four Stokes parameters are calculated for polarimetric passive remote sensing of rough surfaces. We show in this paper that for a moderately rough surface, the third Stokes parameter can be as high as +/-20-degrees-K. The tapered wave integral equation approach can deal with a rough surface with a large slope. The new method presented in this paper is compared with the previously published plane wave integral equation method and the extended boundary condition method. Very good agreement is obtained. Unlike the plane wave integral equation method and the extended boundary condition method, the tapered wave integral equation method does not have the kinks imposed by Floquet models and it requires a shorter surface length in most applications.

FORMULATION	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A physically based rainfall forecasting model for real-time hydrologic applications is developed with emphasis on utilization of remote sensing observations. Temporal and spatial scales of interest are lead times of the order of hours and areas of the order of 10 km2. The dynamic model is derived from conservation of mass in a cloud column as defined by the continuity equations for air, liquid water, water vapor, and cloud water. Conservation of momentum is modeled using a semi-Lagrangian frame of reference. The model state is vertically integrated liquid water content in a column of the atmosphere. Additionally, laws of thermodynamics, adiabatic air parcel theory, and cloud microphysics are applied to derive a basic parameterization of the governing equations of model dynamics. The parameterization is in terms of hydrometeorologic observables including radar reflectivity, satellite-infrared brightness temperature, and ground-level air temperature, dew point temperature, and pressure. Implementation and application is described by French et al. (this issue) and involves incorporation of uncertainty analysis and a two-dimensional spatial domain, where the dynamics of the continuous space-time rainfall process are discretized onto a rectangular grid.																	0043-1397					APR	1994	30	4					1075	1083		10.1029/93WR03249								WOS:A1994NE30000021						
J	ZHANG, W				ZHANG, W			SCATTERING OF RADIOWAVES BY A MELTING LAYER OF PRECIPITATION IN BACKWARD AND FORWARD DIRECTIONS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION												A melting layer of precipitation is composed of melting snowflakes (snow particles); the assumption of spherical particles along with mass conservation is used. The melting layer is studied by deriving the size distribution of the melting snow particles, the thickness of a melting layer, the density of a dry snow particle, and the average dielectric constant of a melting snow particle. Vertical profiles of radar reflectivity and specific attenuation are computed at 1-100 GHz by using the Mie theory for five raindrop size distributions at rain rates below 12.5 mm/h. The radar bright band is explained with computed radar reflectivities at 3-10 GHz. It is shown that the radar bright band can be absent in the melting layer at frequencies above 20 GHz. This agrees with radar observations at 35 and 94 GHz. The specific attenuation, as well as the average specific attenuation of the melting layer, is divided into absorption part and scattering part. The latter is increasingly significant with the increase of frequency. The total zenith attenuation due to stratiform rain is divided into the rain zenith attenuation and the additional zenith attenuation, which is the difference between zenith attenuation, due to the melting layer, and attenuation, due to the same path length of the resulting rain. The additional zenith attenuation increases with the increase of rain rate even at frequencies above 20 GHz. This should be taken into account in radar remote sensing and satellite earth communications.																	0018-926X					MAR	1994	42	3					347	356		10.1109/8.280721								WOS:A1994NJ92100008

To fully exploit the potential of acquiring quantitative information requires a detailed description of the interaction between microwaves and objects. For practical reasons a simplified approach is preferred where the radar return of a distributed target is modeled as a sum of scatterer echoes. In this paper, a point scatterer model is given to simulate scattering of radar waves by distributed targets. The scatterers may have different heights in synthesizing rough surfaces. The principle of conservation of energy is used to account for electromagnetic coupling between the scatterers in function of target sampling density. The predicted coupling between two scatterers is experimentally verified by indoor radar cross section measurements. The model is verified through comparison with numerically solving the electric field integral equation for linear scatterer arrays. Results are given in the form of bistatic scatter diagrams to provide insight in the full scattering behavior.																	0196-2892					MAR	1994	32	2					296	306		10.1109/36.295045								WOS:A1994NU66300009

A negative logarithmic relationship was demonstrated between total P concentrations and distance from the nutrient source (levee L-39). Dense cattail stands illustrated by remote sensing in 1987 coincided spatially with high sediment total P concentrations measured in 1990. Cattail density appeared to increase more rapidly than did sawgrass densities during wet years. Cattail decline was greater at nutrient enriched sites than at the low nutrient site during dry years. Drought stimulated sawgrass expansion at nutrient enriched sites, but not at the low nutrient site. Cattail increased at both nutrient enriched and low nutrient sites following fire, yet fire and nutrient enrichment together appeared to stimulate greater increases in cattail density. Multi- and univariate ANOVA revealed significant nutrient effects on plant density during the last 3 years of the study (P< 0.05). Stepwise regression analysis suggested that total P loading into WCA2A best explained plant density fluctuations at three of the four sites closest to the levee, while hydrology best explained plant density fluctuations at the site most distant from the levee. Although the single low nutrient site provided an inadequate basis for understanding sawgrass and cattail dynamics under low nutrient conditions, the results of this study support two hypotheses of causal factors leading to the spread of cattail in WCA2A: (1) nutrient enrichment stimulates cattail growth; (2) a prolonged hydroperiod is conducive to cattail proliferation.																	0304-3770					DEC	1993	46	3-4					203	223		10.1016/0304-3770(93)90002-E								WOS:A1993MM90200002

The CLDU map was derived from slope, soil, ground water prospect and land-use information using GIS techniques. Alternate land-use sites for grassland, horticulture, afforestation were recommended based upon the soil-slope conditions of the CLDUs. Priority sub-watersheds in the district were identified for soil conservation measures. Analysis on SCH was based upon composite amenity index (AI).																	0143-1161					NOV 20	1993	14	17					3163	3168		10.1080/01431169308904430								WOS:A1993MN29100011

It can be perceived that most of these factors are related to watershed morphology. Hence, watershed forms an ideal unit for planning rather than any unit chosen on an ad-hoc basis. Remote Sensing technology integrated with conventional techniques is emerging as an efficient, speedy, cost-effective and important tool for the management of natural resources. The Mahbubnagar district of Andhra Pradesh, India has been taken up for the demarcation of priority macro watersheds on the scale 1:250 000. Out of a total 49 watersheds in the district, 35 watersheds have been identified as very high and high priority categories. Further, one very high priority macro watershed has been analysed on the scale 1:50 000 and priority micro watersheds have been demarcated showing the areas for immediate conservation measures.																	0143-1161					NOV 20	1993	14	17					3239	3247		10.1080/01431169308904438								WOS:A1993MN29100019

The SCS intends to complete the process with as little field personnel hours as possible. As an alternative to the laborious process of field verification and air photo interpretation, the agency is evaluating the use of satellite remote sensing to perform wetland delineations. The following paper describes a wetland recertification and sampling pilot project being performed by the Space Remote Sensing Center for the SCS. The study area is located in Logan County, ND which is contained within the Prairie Pothole region of the Upper Great Plains Province. Of particular interest to the SCS is the satellite classification of potentially converted wetlands. Data types being evaluated include Landsat TM and SPOT. Classification results will be compared with an existing SCS wetland inventory covering this region.																	0273-1177					NOV	1993	13	11					83	90		10.1016/0273-1177(93)90206-Q								WOS:A1993ML87500012

Remotely-sensed data provide a means to accomplish part of this task, but there has been no comprehensive scientific framework to guide its effective application. Here we propose a remote sensing research agenda designed to improve the quality and quantity of information available for testing scientific hypotheses, monitoring, and conservation planning. Biodiversity should be more fully incorporated into ongoing Earth system science and global change programmes, with remote sensing featured as a prominent data acquisition and analysis tool.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	1993	14	10					1839	1860		10.1080/01431169308954007								WOS:A1993LR84800002

The extent of different landuse/land cover categories from IRS FCC products and revenue record has been computed and tabulated. It has been observed that the area mapped from IRS FCC products for all the landuse/land cover categories is less than that of revenue record due to the small scale and poor resolution of the remotely sensed data. The suitable cropping patterns, plant species and soil and water conservation measures have been suggested for the rational landuse planning of different landuse/land cover categories of the district.																	0570-1791					MAR	1993	32	1					33	42										WOS:A1993LY51000006						
J	YAN, XH; OKUBO, A				YAN, XH; OKUBO, A			3-DIMENSIONAL ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR THE MIXED LAYER DEPTH	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We have recently developed a three-dimensional semi-analytical mixed layer remote sensing model which includes the horizontal advection and diffusion processes in our previous one dimensional model (Yan et al., 1991a). The three-dimensional (3-D) model can be used as a supplement to the one-dimensional (1-D) model in the area where advection is important and for a finer resolution grid prediction. The 3-D thermal inertia model is based on the 3-D thermal energy conservation equation. Using sine transformation and inverse sine transformation methods, we obtained the solution for mixed layer thermal inertia which, in turn, can be used to calculate mixed layer depth using a similar method to that of Yan et al. (1991a). In the solution, the thermal inertia (which is proportional to the mixed layer depth) is expressed as functions of sea surface temperature changes (deltaSST), heat flux (Q) and surface layer velocity (u, v, and w). The vertical entrainment and wind effects are accounted for in the model by eddy diffusivity which changes of deltaSST result from entrainment, e.g., if vertical entrainment is larger, deltaSST will be smaller and vice versa. The advantages of this model are that it can be easily forced by remotely sensed data and that it is much simpler to compute than numerical 3-D mixed layer turbulence closure models. The model was tested using the data froin the advanced verv high resolution radiometer/multichannel sea surface temperature data set and the Cooperative Ocean Atmosphere Data Set for the North Pacific Ocean. The model-predicted mixed layer depths compared favorably with the mixed layer depths calculated from 14 years of Volunteer Observing Ship/expendable bathythermograph observation data. The model/data comparison also exhibited a number of mesoscale features of seasonal changes and anomalies of the mixed layer depth.																	0148-0227					DEC 15	1992	97	C12					20201	20226		10.1029/92JC01833								WOS:A1992KE65600009						
J	DRAYTON, RS; WILDE, BM; HARRIS, JHK				DRAYTON, RS; WILDE, BM; HARRIS, JHK			GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEM APPROACH TO DISTRIBUTED MODELING	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A rainfall and run-off model has been developed which is based on a rectangular grid cell network. The run-off in each cell is estimated empirically and is routed through the network to the principal drainage lines. Information on the land cover in each 50 x 50 m cell is interpreted from remotely sensed data, gathered by an orbiting satellite. Values of topographic parameters for each cell are derived from a digital model of the terrain. Other more conventional data are acquired by digitizing maps. The large amounts of data required in this approach are handled by a geographical information system (GIS), which is a management system specially designed for data with spatial characteristics. A GIS has functions which allow the user to combine the many layers of data within the GIS arithmetically or logically to provide fresh information. At the current stage of development the GIS provides estimates of the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service curve number for estimating the run-off in each cell. An analysis of the digital terrain model defines the pathway taken by run-off from each cell and the run-off is routed from cell to cell as far as the principal drainage lines, where a conventional hydraulic analysis is used. The model benefits from a simple and robust approach to run-off estimation distributed on a very fine grid. An important feature of the model is its ability to use historical satellite images to estimate changes in the catchment's response over a period of time. Future changes in land use may also be easily incorporated into the GIS. The model is being tested on data from the Tywi catchment in West Wales, UK, which had undergone large changes in land cover due to forestation.																	0885-6087					JUL-SEP	1992	6	3					361	368		10.1002/hyp.3360060309								WOS:A1992JF99600008						
J	NELDNER, VJ; HOWITT, CJ				NELDNER, VJ; HOWITT, CJ			COMPARISON OF AN INTUITIVE MAPPING CLASSIFICATION AND NUMERICAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF VEGETATION IN SOUTH-EAST QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA	VEGETATIO												Hierarchical agglomerative polythetic clustering of vegetation data for 51 sites from Brian Pastures Research Station, south-east Queensland, Australia, produced site and species groups that supported those formed during a previous intuitive mapping survey. On the basis of floristic composition, these analyses suggested the possible amalgamation of some map units. However, their segregation into separate units was justified on the basis of having distinct photopatterns and physiographic positions in the landscape. The classifications of the trees only (55 species) and woody plants only (115 species) data sets produced site groupings of high similarity to those constructed by the mapping survey. The addition of the herbaceous plants (266 additional species, of which 70% were annual species) tended to dominate the analyses, and produce site groupings that were less similar to the mapping groups. The distribution of many annual species appeared to be independent of the perennial plant species and underlying substrate. In wooded communities, herbaceous plants have only a minor influence on photopattern, which is the primary determinant of the mapping classification. Binary data retained a large percentage of the information contained in the quantitative data. The extra effort of gathering herbaceous data may not be justified for a broad scale mapping project, but is required for comprehensive nature conservation surveys, flora inventory, and vegetation monitoring purposes.

Platform Terminal Transmitters (PTTs) attachable to animals now weigh less than 150 g and can be used on larger species of birds. Simultaneous remote sensing and location of animals using the NOAA satellites is described. Marine animals can only be tracked if they surface during a satellite overpass. New developments which permit animal location using fewer messages greatly increase the probability of successful tracking. Only satellite tracking can provide long-term ocean-wide coverage necessary for management and conservation of many important species.																	0143-1161					APR	1991	12	4					667	680		10.1080/01431169108929684								WOS:A1991FD71600002

Accelerated wind erosion on sandy surfaces and water erosion on the shallow soils of piedmont areas are both common. Landsat Thematic Mapper sub-scenes have been used to map the type, extent and degree of degradation. In an area of over 5000 km2, 42% was affected by wind erosion and 50% by accelerated water erosion. A quarter of the whole area needs urgent attention for soil conservation.																	0266-0032					MAR	1991	7	1					47	52		10.1111/j.1475-2743.1991.tb00846.x								WOS:A1991FE33600008						
J	Westman, WE; Strong, LL; Wilcox, BA				Westman, Walter E.; Strong, Laurence L.; Wilcox, Bruce A.			Tropical deforestation and species endangerment: the role of remote sensing	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Initial results of a pilot study to link remotely-sensed information on tropical forest loss to field-based information on species endangerment are reported here. LANDSAT multispectral scanner (MSS) imagery from 1973 and 1988 were used to estimate net forest removal (29% of forest area), regrowth (7% of forest area, including possible artifactual errors), and forest edges in Mabira Forest in southeastern Uganda during the 15-year period. Of the forest remaining, the percentage that was heavily disturbed increased from 18% to 42%. This change in forest density was observable with the MSS imagery. The total forest edge-to-area ratio (including edges interior to the forest boundary) increased by 29% over the period. Although four distinct types of closed tropical forest, based on structure or dominance, could be recognized on the ground, the types could not be distinguished by differences in spectral reflectance in the four MSS bands. Closed tropical forest could be readily distinguished from exotic conifer plantations, banana plantations, and other non-forest vegetation types. Field measurements in Mabira and other Ugandan rain forests, and in rain forest isolates on the Atherton Tableland of North Queensland, are being made to relate changes in forest fragmentation to resulting changes in species abundance, structural form of the forests, and morphological diversity of target populations. Possible applications of conservation biology theory and modeling to these data are briefly discussed.																	0921-2973					DEC	1989	3	2					97	109		10.1007/BF00131173								WOS:000207944200004
