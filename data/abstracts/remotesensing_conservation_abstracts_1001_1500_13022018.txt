Land cover classifications, extracted in a timely and area-extensive manner through remote sensing data, can be employed to derive habitat maps, through the use of domain expert knowledge and ancillary information. However, complete information to fully discriminate habitat classes is rarely available, while expert knowledge may suffer from uncertainty and inaccuracies. In this study, a rule-based classification methodology for habitat mapping through the use of a pre-existing land cover map and remote sensing data is proposed to deal with uncertainty, missing information, noise afflicted data and inaccurate rule thresholds. The use of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is introduced in land cover to habitat mapping, in combination with fuzzy logic. The framework is able to handle lack of information, by considering composite classes, when necessary data for the discrimination of the constituting single classes is missing, and deal with uncertainty expressed in domain expert knowledge. In addition, a number of fuzzification schemes are proposed to be incorporated in the methodology in order to increase its performance and robustness towards noise afflicted data or inaccurate rule thresholds. Comparison with reference data reveals the improved performance of the methodology and the efficient handling of uncertainty in expert rules. The further scope is to provide a robust methodology readily transferable and applicable to similar sites in different geographic regions and environments. Although developed for habitat mapping, the proposed rule-based methodology is flexible and generic and may be well extended and applied in various classification tasks, aiming at handling uncertainty, missing information and inaccuracies in data or expert rules.

J	Mabwoga, SO; Thukral, AK				Mabwoga, Samson Okongo; Thukral, Ashwani Kumar			Characterization of change in the Harike wetland, a Ramsar site in India, using landsat satellite data	SPRINGERPLUS												The increasing population in the developing countries has rendered wetlands vulnerable to land use changes. Remote sensing offers a rapid and efficient means of data acquisition of ecosystems in time and space. The present study was undertaken to identify changes in the Harike wetland, a Ramsar site in the state of Punjab, India; and identify causal factors, as well as vulnerable areas threatened from the land cover changes. Unsupervised classification and post-classification change detection techniques were applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data of 16-10-1989, 22-10-2000 and 26-10-2010. Images were classified into five land cover classes (1) Waterbody, (2) Wetland I, (3) Wetland II, (4) Barren land and (5) Agricultural land. Land cover change is characterized mainly by a decrease in the wetland area, as indicated by decrease in wetland vegetation and an increase in non-wetland areas, characterized by increasing agricultural and barren land areas. Overall, the wetland shrunk by 13% from 1989 to 2010, with the north-eastern side experiencing maximum shrinkage. The wetland needs immediate reclamation to check it from further shrinkage so as to save its biodiversity.

J	Leblond, JP				Leblond, Jean-Philippe			Thai Forest Debates and the Unequal Appropriation of Spatial Knowledge Tools	CONSERVATION & SOCIETY												The illegal occupation of legal forest land has been at the centre of prolonged and often violent conflicts in Thailand. Since 1990, forest debates have been characterised by an intense polarisation between a conservation-oriented perspective (called dark green) and a counter perspective (called light green) supporting both the rights and interests of forest occupants as well as forest conservation. Cartographic and remote sensing tools have come to play an immense role in this debate. However, their use has been mostly concentrated in the hands of forest authorities and other dark green actors. Through an analysis of knowledge claims made by the two coalitions, I discuss how the low involvement of light green groups with spatial information tools contributed to their uncritical acceptance of problematic dark green truth claims of the environmental efficacy of conservation measures and the non-existence of recent positive forest cover change. In light of the emergence of multiple claims of forest transitions in developing countries and the recent push towards the establishment of schemes that financially reward reforestation and avoided deforestation, light green groups and, by extension, sympathetic political ecologists, should carefully analyse the implications of their incomplete involvement with cartographic and remote sensing tools.																	0972-4923	0975-3133				OCT-DEC	2014	12	4					425	436		10.4103/0972-4923.155588								WOS:000353901100009						
J	Giri, C; Long, J				Giri, Chandra; Long, Jordan			Land Cover Characterization and Mapping of South America for the Year 2010 Using Landsat 30 m Satellite Data	REMOTE SENSING												Detailed and accurate land cover and land cover change information is needed for South America because the continent is in constant flux, experiencing some of the highest rates of land cover change and forest loss in the world. The land cover data available for the entire continent are too coarse ( 250 m to 1 km) for resource managers, government and non-government organizations, and Earth scientists to develop conservation strategies, formulate resource management options, and monitor land cover dynamics. We used Landsat 30 m satellite data of 2010 and prepared the land cover database of South America using state-of-the-science remote sensing techniques. We produced regionally consistent and locally relevant land cover information by processing a large volume of data covering the entire continent. Our analysis revealed that in 2010, 50% of South America was covered by forests, 2.5% was covered by water, and 0.02% was covered by snow and ice. The percent forest area of South America varies from 9.5% in Uruguay to 96.5% in French Guiana. We used very high resolution (<5 m) satellite data to validate the land cover product. The overall accuracy of the 2010 South American 30-m land cover map is 89% with a Kappa coefficient of 79%. Accuracy of barren areas needs to improve possibly using multi-temporal Landsat data. An update of land cover and change database of South America with additional land cover classes is needed. The results from this study are useful for developing resource management strategies, formulating biodiversity conservation strategies, and regular land cover monitoring and forecasting.																	2072-4292					OCT	2014	6	10					9494	9510		10.3390/rs6109494								WOS:000344458000017

This study developed a methodology for regional estimates of potential floodwater retention under floodplain inundation from ecologically significant flood return periods by coupling remote sensing and geographic information system technologies with spatial hydrological modelling. The Macquarie Marshes in Australia were selected as the case study area. Time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 8-day composite imagery were related to peak flows (Mlday(-1)) of the 1-in-10 return period. Inundation extent in corresponding images was detected using the modified normalised difference water index (mNDWI). The potential maximum soil water retention was derived using a spatial hydrological modelling approach, which is driven by the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN) method. Soil and land cover data were collected and intersected to determine spatial distribution of CN using ArcGIS. The CN-based retention capacity map was then integrated with an inundation extent map to delineate the spatial pattern of retention under inundation. The results have ecological implications in relation to the response of broad eco-types in wetlands. This study has proved that the integration of remote sensing, geographic information system and spatial hydrologic modelling can be used to provide essential information as inputs to the management of environmental flows in terms of sustaining ecosystem function, biodiversity and habitat suitability.

J	Cuba, N; Bebbington, A; Rogan, J; Millones, M				Cuba, Nicholas; Bebbington, Anthony; Rogan, John; Millones, Marco			Extractive industries, livelihoods and natural resource competition: Mapping overlapping claims in Peru and Ghana	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Taking the cases of Peril and Ghana, this paper examines overlaps between the extraction of minerals, oil and gas on the one hand, and river basins, agricultural land use, and protected areas on the other hand. In particular the paper considers how far such overlaps can be revealed and analyzed on the basis of (relatively) accessible and affordable data, without having to use more expensive data generated by remote sensing or fieldwork. We use concessions as our indicator of the presence of extractive industry activity, focusing on both mineral and hydrocarbon concessions, and areas of exploration and of active resource exploitation. High portions of agricultural land use in both countries are located within areas that are subject to mineral or hydrocarbon concessions (38% in Peril, 39% in Ghana), predominantly within areas in which exploration activities are permitted or occurring (36% in Peril, 35% in Ghana). While overlaps between concessions and areas protected for conservation were much smaller (10% for Peru, 2% for Ghana), concessions overlapped with a larger portion of titled indigenous communities in Peru (35%). These findings help visualize the geographies of uncertainty and risk that the expansion of extractive industry creates for populations dependent on agriculture, land, water and other resources in areas affected by concessions. The visualizations and the evidence of quite different degrees of overlap, depending on the type of resource in question suggest the relative strength of different modes of land and resource governance in the face of extractive industry. Notwithstanding their well-documented fragilities, institutions for habitat conservation seem to have been better able to resist pressures on them from the extractive sector than do those for regulating water resources, agricultural land and indigenous communities which appear far less able to moderate the expansion of resource extraction.

In India, which hosts a high density and diversity of CCAs, the need for more assessments of the ecological and socio-economic properties of these systems to guide conservation planning and policy has been emphasised in recent years. We inventoried the extant sacred grove network against official records of 407 groves across 70 villages in the Kodagu District of India's Western Ghats, and interviewed local communities about their management and conservation. We also evaluated recent trends in aboveground biomass of sacred groves using time-series satellite data from six time-points during the 2000-2010 period, and made comparisons to corresponding trends in nearby State-managed protected forests. Although most of the larger (>2 ha) groves officially listed were forested at present, over two-thirds of the smaller groves listed were either not forested or could not be located. Local communities attributed these declines to encroachment and illicit logging. Time-series satellite data revealed aboveground biomass declines of similar to 0.5% annually across the sacred grove network over the 2000-2010 period. In contrast, biomass increased during this period at the interiors and edges of State-managed forests in the landscape. Our results highlight that the conservation status of even well-protected CCAs can vary considerably over time, especially given the dynamism in socio-economic, cultural and ecological factors that govern their status. We argue that understanding and addressing this dynamism is crucial to the conservation of CCAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Reshitnyk, L; Costa, M; Robinson, C; Dearden, P				Reshitnyk, Luba; Costa, Maycira; Robinson, Cliff; Dearden, Phil			Evaluation of WorldView-2 and acoustic remote sensing for mapping benthic habitats in temperate coastal Pacific waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Maps of nearshore marine habitat are fundamental tools for the management and conservation of coastal ecosystems. While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sargassum beds play a range of ecological roles in coastal waters, but their sustainability is threatened by pollution and reclamation within ASEAN countries with rapid economic growth. Before conservation initiatives can be implemented, it is necessary to establish their present distribution. These beds can be mapped using the noncommercial satellite, ALOS, which can provide multiband images using high spatial resolution optical sensors (sensitive to 10 m(-2) plots), AVNIR-2. These images are of sufficient quality for examining coastal ecosystems and, in this study, for mapping the Sargassum beds in the waters off the coast of Sattahip, Chon Buri Province, Thailand. This coastal zone is a natural marine park reserve and protected from human activities such as fishery and reclamation. Biomass data were obtained in January, February, March, and December 2009 from quadrat sampling. The biomass of Sargassum aquifolium (Turner) C. Agardh at a bottom depth of 1 m and 1.5-2 m was determined to be 7.73 and 92.75 g dw m(-2), while that of Sargassum oligocystum Montagne was found to be 44.05 and 87.97 g dw m(-2), respectively. Ground truth data were obtained in February and October 2012 from serial images taken by manta tow. Supervised classification is a procedure for identifying spectrally similar areas on an image by identifying "training" sites of known targets and then extrapolating those spectral signatures to other areas of unknown targets. By applying this methodology, the Sargassum beds off Sattahip can be detected with an accuracy of about 70%. It is estimated that the error is caused by mixel effects of the bottom substrates in individual pixels, each of which covers an area of 10 x 10 m. Our results indicate that the images captured by ALOS AVNIR-2 are informative and useful for mapping the -Sargassum beds in Southeast Asia.																	0006-8055	1437-4323				OCT	2014	57	5					367	377		10.1515/bot-2014-0015								WOS:000343111500004

How do these data perform compared to full range imaging spectroscopy data? Which spectral and spatial characteristics of remote sensing data are important for accurate mapping of habitats and their variability? LocationA mire complex in Bavaria, southern Germany. MethodsTo compare the performance of imaging spectroscopy and multispectral remote sensing data, airborne spectroscopy data (AISA Dual) were spectrally and spatially resampled to the characteristics of two state-of-the-art multispectral sensors (RapidEye and Sentinel-2), resulting in three data sets with different spectral and spatial resolution. Based on the three data sets, we used a combination of field surveys, ordination techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling), as well as regression and classification techniques (Random Forests) to derive maps of the distribution of Natura 2000 habitat types and their compositional variability. Subsequently, we analysed effects of the spatial and spectral image resolution and spectral coverage on the mapping performance. ResultsMire habitat types and their floristic composition could be accurately mapped with multispectral remote sensing data. In the case of accentuated floristic differences between habitats, the fits of the models for the three sensors differed only marginally. These effects and the importance of the spatial resolution are discussed. ConclusionsThe results are encouraging and confirm that multispectral data may allow the combined mapping of discrete habitats and their local variability. Still, questions with respect to the transferability of the approach to habitat types with less pronounced spectral differences, and with regard to bridging the gap between fine-scale vegetation records and coarse resolution imagery remain open.

In particular, monuments and historical buildings which are open to the visitors and/or subject to important stress must be studied for their dynamic response. In the last 10 years the new ground-based radar interferometry technology has been developed allowing to monitor displacements from a point of sight far from the studied targets. It virtually provides a continuous mapping of displacements of the observed structures up to 10 mu m with a range resolution of 0.75 m. In this paper, the application of ground-based interferometry on one very important historical building, the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, is reported. The analysis of these kind of structures is important to catch their dynamic response to natural actions in general, and also to assess the effects due to pedestrian and users, and consequently to define functional capabilities and levels of acceptable dynamic stress. The studied structure was subject to artificial loading by synchronous movement of about 20 people. Artificial forcing led the structure to a resonance condition with the same frequency of the one due to the natural noise excitation, which was separately measured, and with an oscillation amplitude more than thirty times greater than the natural one (in conditions of weak wind). During the passive stages of the survey the recorded structural vibrations were very closed to the instrumental sensitivity, making difficult to distinguish vibration amplitudes amplifications of various segments at various heights. Through the spectral analysis of the acquired data it was possible to estimate the vibration frequencies of the first modal shapes of the structure along two orthogonal directions. The power spectra of the passive survey data have the same maximum frequency of the active but contain more noise at low frequency.

Spatial assessment of fin whale hotspots and their association with krill within an important Antarctic feeding and fishing ground	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean, presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				OCT	2014	161	10					2293	2305		10.1007/s00227-014-2506-7								WOS:000342415200009

Space use of wintering waterbirds in India: Influence of trophic ecology on home-range size	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												Relationship between species' home range and their other biological traits remains poorly understood, especially in migratory birds due to the difficulty associated with tracking them. Advances in satellite telemetry and remote sensing techniques have proved instrumental in overcoming such challenges. We studied the space use of migratory ducks through satellite telemetry with an objective of understanding the influence of body mass and feeding habits on their home-range sizes. We marked 26 individuals, representing five species of migratory ducks, with satellite transmitters during two consecutive winters in three Indian states. We used kernel methods to estimate home ranges and core use areas of these waterfowl, and assessed the influence of body mass and feeding habits on home-range size. Feeding habits influenced the home-range size of the migratory ducks. Carnivorous ducks had the largest home ranges, herbivorous ducks the smallest, while omnivorous species had intermediate home-ranges. Body mass did not explain variation in home-range size. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind on migratory ducks, and it has important implications for their conservation and management																	1674-5507					OCT	2014	60	5					616	621		10.1093/czoolo/60.5.616								WOS:000342355500007

Currently, Kansas has no up-to date inventory of windbreaks. The goal of this project was to assist foresters with future windbreak renovation planning and reporting, by outlining a series of semi-automated digital image processing methods that rapidly identify windbreak locations. There were two specific objectives of this research. First, to develop semi-automated methods to identify the location of windbreaks in Kansas, this can be applied to other regions in Kansas and the Great Plains. We used a remote sensing technique known as object-based image analysis (OBIA) to classify windbreaks visible in the color aerial imagery of National Agriculture Imagery Program. We also combined GIS techniques and field survey to complement OBIA in generating windbreak inventory. The techniques successfully located more than 4500, windbreaks covering an approximate area of 2500, hectares in 14 Kansas counties. The second purpose of this research is to determine how well the results of the automated classification schemes match with other available windbreak data and the selected sample collected in the field. The overall accuracy of OBIA method was 58.97 %. OBIA combined with 'heads up' digitizing and field survey method yielded better result in identifying and locating windbreaks in the studied counties with overall accuracy of 96 %.

A Short Overview of Measures for Securing Water Resources for Irrigated Crop Production	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Agriculture is the main user of limited fresh water resources in the world. Optimisation of agricultural water resources and their use can be obtained by both agronomical and political incentives. Important options are: reduction of the loss of irrigation water in conveyance before it reaches the farm; selection of water-efficient irrigation methods such as drip and micro-irrigation saving 30-40% water compared to furrow irrigation; improvement of irrigation scheduling using plant and soil sensors and remote sensing-based models; deficit irrigation (DI) raising the water productivity in the range of 10-50%; use of saline and wastewater for which modelling tools lately have been developed; introduction of drought and salt-tolerant crops eases the use of DI and use of saline water; improvement of cropping systems with development of conservation agriculture. Further options are: use of the virtual water' principles so that water-rich regions secure food supply to dry regions; reduction in waste of food, feed and biofuel from post-harvest to the end consumer; changing of food composition to less water-consuming products; regulating amount of irrigation water by rationing, subsidies or water pricing to support water-saving measures such as use of drip, irrigation scheduling and DI. The potential for water saving for different measures is discussed and estimated. Reduction in waste of food and loss of irrigation water from conveyance source to farm both has a great potential for water saving compared to other measures. How to choose the measures will depend on the local situation, which is ultimately a political choice.

Assessing soil erosion in inaccessible mountainous areas in the tropics: The use of land cover and topographic parameters in a case study in Thailand	CATENA												Land degradation processes in hilly areas are often directly related to land cover changes. At the same time, many hilly areas in the tropics are inaccessible and thus lack proper data. As a result, data scarcity is a crucial problem when trying to assess soil erosion. In this paper a method is described showing the use of digital elevation, remote sensing and field measurement techniques for deriving necessary land cover parameters as required for erosion modeling. The study shows that correction of topography-induced illumination variation in remote sensing data helps improve classification accuracy while field measurements help in accurate estimation of cover factor. Similarly, the incorporation of DEM-derived parameters such as upslope catchment area and flow direction network in erosion modeling helps not only to improve the estimation of soil losses but also to identify the dominant erosion process active in the area. This makes the formulation of sound conservation measures for minimizing soil losses and reducing off-site erosion effects in low lying areas much easier. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Soil Phosphorus and Nitrogen Predictions Across Spatial Escalating Scales in an Aquatic Ecosystem Using Remote Sensing Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The incorporation of remote sensing (RS) data into digital soil models has shown success to improve soil predictions. However, the effects of multiresolution imagery on modeling of biogeochemical soil properties in aquatic ecosystems are still poorly understood. The objectives of this study were the following: 1) to develop prediction models for soil total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) utilizing RS images and environmental ancillary data at three different resolutions; 2) to identify controlling factors of the spatial distribution of soil TP and TN; and 3) to elucidate the effects of different spatial resolutions of RS images on inferential modeling. Soil cores were collected (n = 108) from the top 10 cm in a subtropical wetland: Water Conservation Area-2A, the Florida Everglades, USA. The spectral data and derived indices from RS images, which have different spatial resolutions, included the following: MODIS (500 m resampled to 250 m), Landsat ETM+ (30 m), and SPOT (10 m). Block kriging and random forest (RF) were employed to predict soil TP and TN using RS-image-derived spectral input variables, environmental ancillary data, and soil observations. The RF models showed R-2 between 0.90 and 0.93 and root mean square error between 100.4 and 115.9 mg.kg(-1) for TP and between 1.45 and 1.52 g.kg(-1) for TN. Soil TP was mainly predicted from RS-derived spectral indices that infer on biotic/vegetation characteristics, whereas soil TN was predicted using a combination of biotic/vegetation, topographic, and hydrologic variables. Results suggest that the spectral data informed soil models have excellent predictive capabilities in this aquatic ecosystem. Interestingly, there was no noticeable distinction among different spatial resolutions of RS images to develop prediction models for soil TP and TN in terms of error assessment. However, the variability and complexity of soil TP and TN variations were much better expressed with the finer resolution RFSPOT model than the coarser resolution RFMODIS model as demonstrated using entropy.

A 2D parallel diffusive wave model for floodplain inundation with variable time step (P-DWave)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Growing advances in remote sensing technologies together with the widespread availability of Digital terrain models (DTM) have intensified the research into two-dimensional (2D) models. Supported by detailed DTM, 2D models can become very accurate tools yet not without an added cost on the computational effort. Floodplain inundation is characterised by a slow varying phenomenon which can last hours, days or even weeks. In this paper we aim to develop a specific parallel diffusive wave model with variable time step suitable for flood inundation. Taking advantage of up to 12 processors, speed-up times ranging from 1.7 to 5.2 and 1.2 to 1.7 are achieved with the Matlab parallel computing toolbox and Fortran OpenMP Application Programming, respectively. The variable time method and the process devised to represent Wet-Dry fronts kept the solution stable and preserved absolute mass conservation. P-DWave performed well against known analytical solutions and dynamic and diffusive models in a total of seven tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, due to differing technical backgrounds and languages, cross-sectorial communication between this group and remote-sensing scientists is often hampered. Hardly any really comprehensive studies exist that are directed towards the conservation community and provide a solid overview of available Earth observation sensors and their different characteristics. This article presents, categorizes, and discusses what spaceborne remote sensing has contributed to the study of animal and vegetation biodiversity, which different types of variables of value for the biodiversity community can be derived from remote-sensing data, and which types of spaceborne sensor data are available for which time spans, and at which spatial and temporal resolution. We categorize all current and important past sensors with respect to application fields relevant for biologists, ecologists, and conservationists. Furthermore, sensor gaps and current challenges for Earth observation with respect to data access and provision are presented.

Assessment and monitoring of deforestation from 1930 to 2011 in Andhra Pradesh, India using remote sensing and collateral data	CURRENT SCIENCE												Deforestation is one of the greatest threats to the world's forest ecosystems. The present study has utilized remote sensing and GIS techniques to quantify changes in forest cover and to map patterns of deforestation in Andhra Pradesh, India during 1930-2011. Andhra Pradesh has the second largest recorded forest area and ranks sixth with an actual forest cover amongst all Indian states. Forest cover maps from seven temporal datasets were prepared based on interpretation of multi-source topographical maps and satellite data. A representative set of landscape indices has been used to study landscape-level changes over time. The mapping for the period of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2011 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 85,392, 68,063, 46,940, 45,520, 44,409, 43,577 and 43,523 sq. km of the study area respectively. The study found the net forest cover declined as 49% of the total forest area during the last eight decades. The annual rate of estimated deforestation during 2005-2011 was 0.02%. Annual rate of deforestation of teak mixed forests was relatively higher (0.76) followed by mangroves (0.58%), semi-evergreen forests (0.43%), dry deciduous forests (0.21%), moist deciduous forests (0.09%) and dry evergreen forests (0.07%) during 1975-2011. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches was 3,981 in 1930, 5,553 in 1960, 8,760 in 1975, 9,412 in 1985, 9,646 in 1995 and 10,597 in 2011, which indicates ongoing anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (sq. km) of forest decreased from 21.5 in 1930 to 12.3 in 1960 and reached 3.9 by 2011. The analysis of historical forest cover changes provides a basis for management effectiveness and future research on various components of biodiversity, climate change and accounting of carbon.																	0011-3891					SEP 10	2014	107	5					867	875										WOS:000342330900024

It is a critical input to many land-surface models such as crop growth models, net primary productivity models, and climate models. There is a great need for FAPAR products derived from remote-sensing data. The objective of this research is to develop a new instantaneous quantitative FAPAR model based on the law of energy conservation and the concept of recollision probability (p). Using the ray-tracing method, the FAPAR-P model separates direct energy absorption by the canopy from energy absorption caused by multiple scattering between the soil and the canopy. Direct sunlight and diffuse skylight are also considered. This model has a clear physical meaning and can be applied to continuous and discrete vegetation. The model was validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and field measurements in the Heihe River basin, China, which proved its reliability for FAPAR calculations.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				SEP	2014	7	9			SI		3945	3955		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2325673								WOS:000344992200025

This research article presents an integrated system for continuous monitoring of the vegetation and the human impact on the Natura 2000 protected areas of Strofilia Forest and Kotychi lagoon (Natura 2000 codes: GR 232001 and GR233006 respectively) with contemporary methods of remote Sensing and Telemetry. More specifically, aerial photographs and still images obtained from the Landsat satellite were used for visualization of spectral signatures and detection of changes in vegetation and land-uses. Water quality data was checked via sensors measuring hydrological parameters in order to detect temporal changes. Finally, an on-line database system, whose main structural characteristics are illustrated in this paper, was created to assist field work and help data collection and assessment. The efficiency and accuracy of this type of monitoring for the conservation of natural environment is discussed.																	1735-6865	2008-2304				FAL	2014	8	4					1195	1202										WOS:000344126300034

Airborne laser scanning data is available for large areas with high resolution and supports automatic processing, therefore, it is well suited for habitat mapping. Lowland hay meadows are widespread habitat types in European grasslands, and also have one of the highest species richness. The objective of this study was to test the applicability of airborne laser scanning for vegetation mapping of different grasslands, including the Natura 2000 habitat type lowland hay meadows. Full waveform leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds were collected from a Natura 2000 site in Sopron, Hungary, covering several grasslands. The LIDAR data were processed to a set of rasters representing point attributes including reflectance, echo width, vegetation height, canopy openness, and surface roughness measures, and these were fused to a multi-band pseudo-image. Random forest machine learning was used for classifying this dataset. Habitat type, dominant plant species and other features of interest were noted in a set of 140 field plots. Two sets of categories were used: five classes focusing on meadow identification and the location of lowland hay meadows, and 10 classes, including eight different grassland vegetation categories. For five classes, an overall accuracy of 75% was reached, for 10 classes, this was 68%. The method delivers unprecedented fine resolution vegetation maps for management and ecological research. We conclude that high-resolution full-waveform LIDAR data can be used to detect grassland vegetation classes relevant for Natura 2000.

This change increases the leakage of nutrient resources and water into the river streams in semi-arid areas. A common management solution for decreasing this loss of resources is to create a runoff-harvesting system (RHS). The objective of the current research is to apply geo-information techniques, including remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), on the watershed scale, to monitor and analyze the spatial and temporal changes in response to drought of two source-sink systems, the natural shrubland and the human-made RHSs in the semi-arid area of the northern Negev Desert, Israel. This was done by evaluating the changes in soil, vegetation and landscape cover. The spatial changes were evaluated by three spectral indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Crust Index (CI) and landscape classification change between 2003 and 2010. In addition, we examined the effects of environmental factors on NDVI, CI and their clustering after successive drought years. The results show that vegetation cover indicates a negative Delta NDVI change due to a reduction in the abundance of woody vegetation. On the other hand, the soil cover change data indicate a positive Delta CI change due to the expansion of the biocrusts. These two trends are evidence for degradation processes in terms of resource conservation and bio-production. A considerable part of the changed area (39%) represents transitions between redistribution processes of resources, such as water, sediments, nutrients and seeds, on the watershed scale. In the pre-drought period, resource redistribution mainly occurred on the slope scale, while in the post-drought period, resource redistribution occurred on the whole watershed scale. However, the RHS management is effective in reducing leakage, since these systems are located on the slopes where the magnitude of runoff pulses is low.																	2072-4292					SEP	2014	6	9					8134	8164		10.3390/rs6098134								WOS:000343093800012						
J	Bermeo, A; Couturier, S; Pizana, MG				Bermeo, Adriana; Couturier, Stephane; Galeana Pizana, Mauricio			Conservation of traditional smallholder cultivation systems in indigenous territories: Mapping land availability for milpa cultivation in the Huasteca Poblana, Mexico	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The ancient milpa agricultural system has been regarded as a resilient agro-biodiverse practice within the context of recent global land-use changes. The conservation of the traditional smallholder cultivation system (TSCS) has been the focus of an extended civil network that is based on an alliance between agro-ecological science and indigenous knowledge. Collaborative rural planning has recently been supported in cartographic representations of indigenous territories in Mexico at the intercommunity scale. However, spatial assessments of multicropping milpa practice are largely lacking, and reduced access to land by smallholders is reported to be one of the key constraints on this practice. This research employs a method for the intercommunity-scale mapping of land availability for milpa cultivation (LAMC). This method combines information on land use derived from remote sensing data with information on agrarian structures deduced from census data and it takes into account the concentration of land ownership associated with capital-intensive coffee and pasture-based production systems. We applied this method to explore trends in LAMC between 1970 and 2010 in a rural subdistrict of the State of Puebla, which is an indigenous, densely populated, and highly agro-biodiverse area of Mexico. The results were successfully assessed against conventional analysis based on an agricultural census. The method is replicable to any rural setting, provides an alternative approach to delineating peasant indigenous territories of Mexico and contributes to baseline cartography for the global conservation of TSCS.

Spatial conservation planning framework for assessing conservation opportunities in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Historic rates of habitat change and growing exploitation of natural resources threaten avian biodiversity in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. We implemented a twostage framework for conservation planning in the Atlantic Forest. First, we used ecological niche modeling to predict the distributions of 23 endemic bird species using 19 climatic metrics and 12 spectral and radar remote sensing metrics. Second, we utilized the principle of complementarity to prioritize new sites to augment the Atlantic Forest's existing reserves. The best predictors of bird distributions were precipitation metrics (the seasonality of rainfall) and radar remote sensing metrics (QSCAT). The existing protected areas do not include 10% of the habitat of each of the 23 endemic species. We propose a more economical set of protected areas by reducing the extent to which new sites duplicate the biodiversity content of existing protected areas. There is a high concordance between the proposed conservation areas that we designed using computerized algorithms and Important Bird Areas prioritized by BirdLife International. Insofar as deforestation in the Atlantic Forest is similar to land conversion in other biodiversity hotspots, our methodology is applicable to conservation efforts elsewhere in the world.

Deforestation trends and spatial modelling of its drivers in the dry temperate forests of northern Pakistan - A case study of Chitral	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Deforestation is a major environmental challenge in the mountain areas of Pakistan. The study assessed trends in the forest cover in Chitral tehsil over the last two decades using supervised land cover classification of Landsat TM satellite images from 1992, 2000, and 2009, with a maximum likelihood algorithm. In 2009, the forest cover was 10.3% of the land area of Chitral (60,000 ha). The deforestation rate increased from 0.14% per annum in 1992-2000 to 0.54% per annum in 2000-2009, with 3,759 ha forest lost over the 17 years. The spatial drivers of deforestation were investigated using a cellular automaton modelling technique to project future forest conditions. Accessibility (elevation, slope), population density, distance to settlements, and distance to administrative boundary were strongly associated with neighbourhood deforestation. A model projection showed a further loss of 23% of existing forest in Chitral tehsil by 2030, and degradation of 8%, if deforestation continues at the present rate. Arandu Union Council, with 2212 households, will lose 85% of its forest. Local communities have limited income resources and high poverty and are heavily dependent on non-timber forest products for their livelihoods. Continued deforestation will further worsen their livelihood conditions, thus improved conservation efforts are essential.																	1672-6316	1993-0321				SEP	2014	11	5					1192	1207		10.1007/s11629-013-2932-x								WOS:000342223500009

Because the lake is faced with a series of ecological and environmental problems, it is important and necessary to study the land use changes in the Poyang Lake region. In this study, Landsat images from 1976, 1989, 1999 and 2009, were used along with other evaluation methods (quantitative analysis of changes in land use, land use dynamic, degree and transfer matrix analyses) to investigate the changes in land use within the Poyang Lake region from 1976 to 2009. Land use was classified into seven types: cropland, woodland, grassland, the water body, construction land, bottomland and unused land. Areas of cropland, bottomland and the water body were decreasing although the area of the water body decreased relatively slowly. However, areas of construction land, grassland, woodland and unused land increased to a certain extent, with unused land increasing the most rapidly given its smaller proportion compared to the other types. All land types in the study region had different levels of conversion between other types of land. As a whole, the decrease in cropland and the increase in construction land, woodland and grassland were caused by human activities and the conservation policies such as Grain-for-Green and "returning farm to lake". However, the decrease in the water body area was mainly influenced by natural factors and human activities. Changes in the area of bottomland were mainly influenced by water levels and human farming activities.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				SEP	2014	42	3					633	643		10.1007/s12524-013-0348-2								WOS:000341439700015

Given their widespread loss and increased recognition, remarkably little is known about restoration techniques. In this study, we examine the effects of gabions (wire baskets filled with rocks used as dams) on vegetation in the Cienega San Bernardino, in the Arizona, Sonora portion of the US-Mexico border, using a remote-sensing analysis coupled with field data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), used here as a proxy for plant biomass, is compared at gabion and control sites over a 27-year period during the driest months (May/June). Over this period, green-up occurred at most sites where there were gabions and at a few of the control sites where gabions had not been constructed. When we statistically controlled for differences among sites in source area, stream order, elevation, and interannual winter rainfall, as well as comparisons of before and after the initiation of gabion construction, vegetation increased around gabions yet did not change (or decreased) where there were no gabions. We found that NDVI does not vary with precipitation inputs prior to construction of gabions but demonstrates a strong response to precipitation after the gabions are built. Field data describing plant cover, species richness, and species composition document increases from 2000 to 2012 and corroborate reestablished biomass at gabions. Our findings validate that gabions can be used to restore riparian vegetation and potentially ameliorate drought conditions in a desert cienega. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Implications of Spatial Data Variations for Protected Areas Management: An Example from East Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies have become an important tool for visualizing conservation management and developing solutions to problems associated with conservation. When multiple organizations separately develop spatial data representations of protected areas, implicit error arises due to variation between data sets. We used boundary data produced by three conservation organizations (International Union for the Conservation of Nature, World Resource Institute, and Uganda Wildlife Authority), for seven Ugandan parks, to study variation in the size represented and the location of boundaries. We found variation in the extent of overlapping total area encompassed by the three data sources, ranging from miniscule (0.4 %) differences to quite large ones (9.0 %). To underscore how protected area boundary discrepancies may have implications to protected area management, we used a landcover classification, defining crop, shrub, forest, savanna, and grassland. The total area in the different landcover classes varied most in smaller protected areas (those less than 329 km(2)), with forest and cropland area estimates varying up to 65 %. The discrepancies introduced by boundary errors could, in this hypothetical case, generate erroneous findings and could have a significant impact on conservation, such as local-scale management for encroachment and larger-scale assessments of deforestation.

Location Global. Methods Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy-based integration approach, we integrated four global land-cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30-m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. Results Our product offers accuracy-weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land-cover classes within every nominal 1-km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land-cover information contained in the fine-grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine-grain land-cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. Main conclusions Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land-cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land-cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.																	1466-822X	1466-8238				SEP	2014	23	9					1031	1045		10.1111/geb.12182								WOS:000340426000008						
J	Nagarajan, M; Basil, G				Nagarajan, M.; Basil, George			Remote sensing- and GIS-based runoff modeling with the effect of land-use changes (a case study of Cochin corporation)	NATURAL HAZARDS												A study was conducted to estimate the runoff in urbanized zone using Soil Conservation Services Curve Number (SCS-CN) method through remote sensing and GIS techniques. In this study, the region was identified as Cochin Corporation (Kerala State, India) with an aerial extent of 96.44 km(2). The spatial and non-spatial data were collected from different sources, and the thematic layers of soil hydrologic group and land-use maps were prepared and overlaid with one other. The overlaid output results were assigned by curve numbers with respect to soil and land-use categories, and the CN map was prepared with the help of Visual Basic (VB) language in ArcGIS platform. Through supervised classifications, 13 different land-use classes were identified from Quickbird data for the year of 2005 and 2010. The most prominent land-use classes were water bodies, residential, mixed crops, commercial and industrial, and 3 types of soil hydrologic groups were identified namely A, B, and C categories. The B group is most prominent occupying 60 km(2) of the study area. The CN map shows the ranges that 92-100 is the major CN area with high runoff potential zone of the study region. At the final stage, the runoff was estimated by the maximum successive rainfall received in this study area in two different years-2005 and 2010 along with their land-use pattern. The runoff model is applied for temporal variation in land-use change, and impact of runoff was studied. The study area showed significant changes in land-use pattern between 2005 and 2010 particularly in the land-use change from agricultural into industrial, commercial, and residential (high density). The area covered by the highest runoff depth with the range of 92-100 CN values increased from 43.87 to 45.32 km(2) from 2005 to 2010. The volume of runoff was increased from 135.56 to 141.49 Mm(3) from 2005 to 2010 due to the land-use change pattern.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				SEP	2014	73	3					2023	2039		10.1007/s11069-014-1173-9								WOS:000340492700042						
J	Khosrokhani, M; Pradhan, B				Khosrokhani, Maryam; Pradhan, Biswajeet			Spatio-temporal assessment of soil erosion at Kuala Lumpur metropolitan city using remote sensing data and GIS	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK												The main purpose of this paper is to assess and predict soil erosion and its dynamism observation at Kuala Lumpur metropolitan city using universal soil loss equation (USLE). To acquire USLE factors, multi-source datasets such as rainfall data of the past 20 years, DEM map, SPOT5 image and geological map of the study area were used to calculate spatial soil erosion of Kuala Lumpur metropolitan city. Results indicated that the highest spatial coverage (61.9%) occurred in very low and the lowest spatial coverage (3.8%) in severe soil loss class. Furthermore, a landslide inventory map of the same area was overlaid on the resultant soil erosion layer to demonstrate their correlation. A frequency ratio (FR) method was applied to determine the relationship between occurred landslides and each soil erosion class. The results indicated that the highest and the lowest FR equal to 0.8 and 2.1 and observed in very low and severe soil loss classes, respectively. Temporal assessment of soil erosion indicated that there is a decrement of soil loss content in severe class from 2000 to 2010. The result of the prognosis analysis showed that the spatial coverage of the study area in severe soil loss class equals to 48%. This result proved the significance of land use/land cover to curb soil erosion. The resultant maps may help the planners and managers to take proper decision for the conservation of soil as a noteworthy natural resource.

J	Yang, XK; Lu, XX				Yang, Xiankun; Lu, Xixi			Drastic change in China's lakes and reservoirs over the past decades	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Using remote sensing images, we provided the first complete picture of freshwater bodies in mainland China. We mapped 89,700 reservoirs, covering about 26,870 km(2) and approximately 185,000 lakes with a surface area of about 82,232 km(2). Despite relatively small surface area, the total estimated storage capacity of reservoirs (794 km(3)) is triple that of lakes (268 km(3)). Further analysis indicates that reservoir construction has made the river systems strongly regulated: only 6% of the assessed river basins are free-flowing; 20% of assessed river basins have enough cumulative reservoir capacity to store more than the entire annual river flow. Despite the existence of 2,721 lakes greater than 1 km(2), we found that about 50 lakes greater than km(2) have formed on the Tibetan Plateau resulting from climate change. More than 350 lakes of >= 1 km(2) vanished in four other major lake regions. Although the disappearance of lakes happened in the context of global climate change, it principally reflects the severe anthropogenic impacts on natural lakes, such as, the excessive plundering of water resources on the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau and serious destruction (land reclamation and urbanization) on the eastern plains.

In this study, we have proposed an empirical C-chla estimation model using Landsat ETM+ image reflectance and laboratory-based C-chla measurements from hypersaline-alkaline shallow lake (HSAS-lake) water. This study aims to use remote sensing technique to determine the quantity and distribution of chlorophyll (as an indicator of cyanobacterial biomass) rendering an indirect estimate of food availability for flamingos and other aquatic animals, thus providing valuable information for their future conservation. Using proposed empirical method named blue-red-NIR model, it has been found that the C-chla ranges from 3.43 to 43.75 mu g L-1 with the mean Chl-a value of 5.45 mu g L-1, in the lake investigated. A variety of regression functions have been implemented for the single and multiband ratios. The best-fitted regression model was developed for the band combination of [R-rs(-1) (660) - R-rs(-1) (482)] x R-rs(-1) (825) having an R-2 of 0.88and model errors of 0.93, 0.8, and 4.74 for standard error of estimate (SEE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), respectively. Our finding evinces that the proposed blue-red-NIR model may be appraised as a robust solution for the estimation of C-chla in optically shallow waters, provided that the local inherent optical properties (IOPs) should be scrutinized and reinitialized.

Habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and the spread of invasive species are drastically depleting the Earth's biological diversity, leading to detrimental impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being. 2. Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e. g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems. 3. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored. 4. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.

Radar analysis of fall bird migration stopover sites in the northeastern US	CONDOR												The national network of weather surveillance radars (WSR-88D) detects flying birds and is a useful remote-sensing tool for ornithological study. We used data collected during fall 2008 and 2009 by 16 WSR-88D radars in the northeastern U.S. to quantify the spatial distribution of landbirds during migratory stopover. We geo-referenced estimates based on radar reflectivity, of the density of migrants aloft at their abrupt evening exodus from daytime stopover sites, to the approximate locations from which they emerged. We classified bird stopover use by the magnitude and variation of radar reflectivity across nights; areas were considered "important" stopover sites for conservation if bird density was consistently high. We developed statistical models that predict potentially important stopover sites across the region, based on land cover, ground elevation, and geographic location. Large areas of regionally important stopover sites were located along the coastlines of Long Island Sound, throughout the Delmarva Peninsula, in areas surrounding Baltimore and Washington, along the western edge of the Adirondack Mountains, and within the Appalachian Mountains of southwestern Virginia and West Virginia. Locally important stopover sites generally were associated with deciduous forests embedded within landscapes dominated by developed or agricultural lands, or near the shores of major water bodies. Preserving or enhancing patches of natural habitat, particularly deciduous forests, in developed or agricultural landscapes and along major coastlines could be a priority for conservation plans addressing the stopover requirements of migratory landbirds in the northeastern U.S. Our maps of important stopover sites can be used to focus conservation efforts and can serve as a sampling frame for fieldwork to validate radar observations or for ecological studies of landbirds on migratory stopover.

FORESTS												Assessing forest changes is the baseline requirement for successful forest management. Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) are three essential components for achieving such assessments. Community participation in resource monitoring and management is increasingly seen as a scientifically efficient, cost-effective, and equitable way to employ such practices, particularly in the context of REDD+. We developed a multidisciplinary approach to study the feasibility of Participatory MRV (PMRV) across three sites along a forest degradation gradient in Indonesia. We looked at both the local and national level needs of MRV. Our approach combines: (1) social research focusing on the enabling conditions for local participation in MRV; (2) governance analyses of existing MRV systems in forestry and health; and (3) remote sensing work comparing overlaps and gaps between satellite imagery and local assessments of forest changes. We considered in our approach the possible multiple benefits of PMRV (carbon mitigation, biodiversity conservation, livelihood security). Our study helped to identify the multiple stakeholders (communities, NGOs and governments) and what the levels of governance should be to make PMRV design and implementation feasible and sustainable.																	1999-4907					AUG	2014	5	8					1855	1878		10.3390/f5081855								WOS:000341099200003						
J	Simonson, WD; Allen, HD; Coomes, DA				Simonson, William D.; Allen, Harriet D.; Coomes, David A.			Applications of airborne lidar for the assessment of animal species diversity	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments. 2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales. 3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity. 4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.																	2041-210X	2041-2096				AUG	2014	5	8					719	729		10.1111/2041-210X.12219								WOS:000340600400001						
J	Stepanian, PM; Chilson, PB; Kelly, JF				Stepanian, Phillip M.; Chilson, Phillip B.; Kelly, Jeffrey F.			An introduction to radar image processing in ecology	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Use of radar in ornithology, chiropterology and entomology continues to increase, driven in part by widespread online data availability. In addition to research applications, rapid growth in areas such as wind energy and aviation has prompted the use of radar for conservation. While a variety of research applications motivate ecologists to gain basic radar literacy, the ability to process and analyse radar data sets can be a daunting task that may dissuade inexperienced ecological radar users. This effect is exacerbated by vague radar methodologies in the ecology literature, as well as the combination of complex techniques and unfamiliar terminology in other radar-focused disciplines. 2. While radar data come in many formats and levels of detail, a common type is the two-dimensional radar image. As rasters of data with associated spatial coordinates, radar images are relatively easy to manipulate, especially for those familiar with basic raster computations. Furthermore, because radar image data require relatively small storage space, they can be readily downloaded from a number of online sources. With this in mind, radar images provide a convenient foundation for ecological applications. 3. A primer on radar image interpretation and processing is presented, with a focus on image composition for typical atmospheric surveillance radar scans. Additionally, a selection of existing ecological radar image processing methods are overviewed. As a starting point, a basic algorithm for automated image processing is outlined that may be modified to create specialized workflows. Three examples of the application of this algorithm are included, illustrating its modification and use for automated feature extraction. 4. By outlining a basic algorithm, we hope to provide a clear starting point for the beginning radar user. When combined with additional existing methods, this algorithm provides a wide range of refinements and modifications that can pave a path towards sophisticated radar processing workflows. In the long term, the ability of ecologists to independently analyse radar data will lead to better ecological interpretation of radar data and a more informed application to conservation policy.

Remote sensing serves as an important tool to provide up-to date baseline information which is the primary requirement for the conservation planning of mangroves. In this study, supervised classification by maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) has been used to classify LANDSAT TM and LANDSAT ETM satellite data. This algorithm is used for computing likelihood of unknown measurement vector belonging to unknown classes based on Bayesian equation. Image spectra for various mangrove species were also generated from hyperspectral image. During field visits, GPS locations of five dominant mangrove species with appreciable distribution were taken and image spectra were generated for the same points from hyperion image. The result of this classification shows that, in 1999 total mangrove forest accounted for 55.01 % of the study area which has been reduced to 50.63 % in the year 2010. Avicennia sp. is found as most dominating species followed by Excoecaria sp. and Phoenix sp. but the aerial distribution of Avicennia sp., Bruguiera sp. and Ceriops sp. has reduced. In this classification technique the overall accuracy and Kappa value for 1999 and 2010 are 80 % and 0.77, 85.71 % and 0.81 respectively.

Socioeconomic factors influencing land cover changes in rural areas: The case of the Sierra de Albarracin (Spain)	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Rural abandonment in mountainous regions is a habitual process that occurs in many countries and has socioeconomic and environmental implications. Land cover changes in Mediterranean mountains resulting from farming abandonment have been associated with certain processes of land degradation. This study employed Landsat satellite images for mapping the land cover changes in 1984 and 2007, south of the Iberian Range (region of Sierra de Albarracin, Teruel, Spain). A neural network classification was used to achieve sufficient land cover accuracy. The land cover change analysis revealed an expansion of forestland at the expense of pastureland and abandoned rainfed cropland. These changes were associated with demographic and economic shifts that resulted from a continuous process of rural abandonment. Population reduction has been the natural trend for a century, characterized by massive internal migrations to nearby cities. The dynamic displacement of the population centroid was used to identify the migratory processes in the last century. The primary sector and the associated secondary sector (farming and forestry) were diminished and resulted in a decrease in natural resource exploitation. Economic activity moved towards the tertiary sector, which focuses on rural tourism. The current socioeconomic scenario has unknown future implications for land cover dynamics and their associated ecosystem services values. Thus, monitoring of land cover changes and ecosystem services is required to promote sustainable development in an area that is highly dependent on the conservation of natural resources and ecological services.

Effective landscape-scale management of cavity-dependent wildlife requires an understanding of where cavities occur, but tree cavities can be cryptic and difficult to survey. We assessed whether a landscape-scale map of mature forest habitat availability, derived from aerial photographs, reflected the relative availability of mature trees and tree cavities. We assessed cavities for their suitability for use by wildlife, and whether the map reflected the availability of such cavities. There were significant differences between map categories in several characteristics of mature trees that can be used to predict cavity abundance (i.e. tree form and diameter at breast height). There were significant differences between map categories in the number of potential cavity bearing trees and potential cavities per tree. However, the index of cavity abundance based on observations made from the ground provided an overestimate of true cavity availability. By climbing a sample of mature trees we showed that only 5.1% of potential tree cavities detected from the ground were suitable for wildlife, and these were found in only 12.5% of the trees sampled. We conclude that management tools developed from remotely sensed data can be useful to guide decision-making in the conservation management of tree cavities but stress that the errors inherent in these data limit the scale at which such tools can be applied. The rarity of tree cavities suitable for wildlife in our study highlights the need to conserve the tree cavity resource across the landscape, but also the importance of increasing the accuracy of management tools for decision-making at different scales. Mapping mature forest habitat availability at the landscape scale is a useful first step in managing habitat for cavity-dependent wildlife, but the potential for overestimating actual cavity abundance in a particular area highlights the need for complementary on-ground surveys.																	1442-9985	1442-9993				AUG	2014	39	5					579	586		10.1111/aec.12118								WOS:000339421000010

This study develops an urban isolation index (UII) to quantify the isolation effects of land-use conversion on key ecological areas (KEAs) and accounts for urban patch size, morphology, location, and quality loss. Based on the five remote sensing Landsat images taken between 1980 and 2005, UII is applied to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the isolation effects caused by rapid urbanization in Shenzhen, China. The results showed that the habitat isolation constantly intensified during the urbanization process. We identified spatially explicit information of critical urban domains that exerted an interference effect on KEAs. There are considerable differences of isolation effects resulting from different urban growth types. Urban edge expansion caused the greatest habitat isolation in Shenzhen. The outlying and infilling urban patches contributed minor isolation effects to the KEAs. This paper furthers the understanding of the ecological effects of urbanization processes and provides a spatially explicit identification for ecological conservation and restoration in rapidly urbanized regions.

Threat evaluation for biodiversity conservation of forest ecosystems using geospatial techniques: A case study of Odisha, India	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Up-scaling the evaluation of threat status of biodiversity from species to ecosystem level has remained for long a research challenge in global conservation science. To meet this challenge, the present study makes an attempt toward actionable conservation prescription and assigning a threat category scheme for forest ecosystems. The scheme sets the quantitative criteria for evaluation of cumulative anthropogenic threats in grid cells, such as deforestation, degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and biological invasions. Adopting the convention of IUCN, five conservation status categories (i.e. Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened, Least Concern) have been similarly adopted for the forest ecosystems facing these threats. The operational success of this scheme of threat categories at ecosystem level has been strengthened by remote sensing and field data generated for the forest ecosystems of Odisha, India. The threat category status of the forest ecosystems were identified by creating grids (5 km x 5 km) in GIS and assigned the degree of the threats for each grid. The database on deforestation was generated using topographical maps of 1935 and remote sensing data of 1975 and 2010. The degradation in forest ecosystems have been assessed based on the change in forest canopy closure, fragmentation pattern, forest fire distribution and impact of biological invasions. The analysis for conservation priority hotspots complements an assessment of the threatened ecosystems undergoing remarkable level of multiple threats. Areas under the danger of cumulative anthropogenic threats would have a higher priority. 5.8% grids of existing forest had included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 12.4% in conservation priority hotspot-II, and 12.5% in conservation priority hotspot-III. An integrated approach involving the cumulative anthropogenic threat indicators have been found to be the most appropriate tool to empirically evaluate the threat status of the forest ecosystems.

Markedly divergent estimates of Amazon forest carbon density from ground plots and satellites	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The accurate mapping of forest carbon stocks is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle, for assessing emissions from deforestation, and for rational land-use planning. Remote sensing (RS) is currently the key tool for this purpose, but RS does not estimate vegetation biomass directly, and thus may miss significant spatial variations in forest structure. We test the stated accuracy of pantropical carbon maps using a large independent field dataset. Location Tropical forests of the Amazon basin. The permanent archive of the field plot data can be accessed at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5521/FORESTPLOTS.NET/2014_1 Methods Two recent pantropical RS maps of vegetation carbon are compared to a unique ground-plot dataset, involving tree measurements in 413 large inventory plots located in nine countries. The RS maps were compared directly to field plots, and kriging of the field data was used to allow area-based comparisons. Results The two RS carbon maps fail to capture the main gradient in Amazon forest carbon detected using 413 ground plots, from the densely wooded tall forests of the north-east, to the light-wooded, shorter forests of the south-west. The differences between plots and RS maps far exceed the uncertainties given in these studies, with whole regions over-or under-estimated by > 25%, whereas regional uncertainties for the maps were reported to be < 5%. Main conclusions Pantropical biomass maps are widely used by governments and by projects aiming to reduce deforestation using carbon offsets, but may have significant regional biases. Carbon-mapping techniques must be revised to account for the known ecological variation in tree wood density and allometry to create maps suitable for carbon accounting. The use of single relationships between tree canopy height and above-ground biomass inevitably yields large, spatially correlated errors. This presents a significant challenge to both the forest conservation and remote sensing communities, because neither wood density nor species assemblages can be reliably mapped from space.

Although wetlands are generally protected by law, growing human populations increasingly drain and clear them to provide agricultural land, especially in tropical Africa. Managing and conserving wetlands requires accurately monitoring their spatial and temporal extent, often using remote sensing, but distinguishing wetlands from other land covers can be difficult. Here, we report on a method to separate wetlands dominated by papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) from spectrally similar grasslands dominated by elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.). We tested whether topographic, spectral, and temperature data improved land cover classification within and around Kibale National Park, a priority conservation area in densely populated western Uganda. Slope and reflectance in the mid-IR range best separated the combined papyrus/elephant grass pixels (average accuracy: 86%). Using a time series of satellite images, we quantified changes in six land covers across the landscape from 1984 to 2008 (papyrus, elephant grass, forest, mixed agriculture/bare soil/short grass, mixed tea/shrub, and water). We found stark differences in how land cover changed inside versus outside the park, with particularly sharp changes next to the park boundary. Inside the park, changes in land cover varied with location and management history: elephant grass areas decreased by 52% through forest regeneration but there was no net difference in papyrus areas. Outside the park, elephant grass and papyrus areas decreased by 61% and 39%, mostly converted to agriculture. Our method and findings are particularly relevant in light of social, biotic, and abiotic changes in western Uganda, as interactions between climate change, infectious disease, and changing human population demographics and distribution are predicted to intensify existing agricultural pressure on natural areas.

The various parameters such as rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), topographic factor (LS), crop management factor (C) and support practice factor (P) were derived using standard techniques. The study revealed that forest cover, crop land and scrub/grass land constitute 87.4 % of soil erosion susceptible area. The rate of depletion of soil was estimated at 25.63 t/ha/yr. It was highest in stony/barren land (60.3 t/ha/yr) and lowest in case of tea garden (16.09 t/ha/yr). It was felt that there is a need of implementation of soil and water conservation measures in the region to curb the soil loss. The undulating nature of terrain was observed as the main contributing factor for soil erosion. It was concluded that RS and GIS based RUSLE model can be efficiently used in mountainous regions to determine the status and extent of soil erosion.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2014	28	10					3307	3317		10.1007/s11269-014-0680-5								WOS:000338651100036						
J	Wu, CF; Lin, YP; Chiang, LC; Huang, T				Wu, Chen-Fa; Lin, Yu-Pin; Chiang, Li-Chi; Huang, Tao			Assessing highway's impacts on landscape patterns and ecosystem services: A case study in Puli Township, Taiwan	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Highway construction facilitates urban growth in Taiwan. However, the long-term effects of transportation infrastructure are not well understood; these include land-use changes, changes in landscape patterns, and the alteration of ecosystem services. To assess the effects of different land-use scenarios under various agricultural and environmental conservation policy regimes, this study applies an integrated approach to analyze the effects of Highway 6 construction on Puli Township. Interviews with neighborhood leaders of Puli Township, along with remote sensing analysis, reveal that both biophysical and socioeconomic factors are the major forces driving land-use change. The effects of these land-use changes are varied. An example is the road-effect zone, which for Pull Township extends 400 m perpendicular to the length of the highway; however, due to differing spatial patterns it is highly asymmetric; indirect effects include the spatial restructuring of certain landscapes, which can drastically influence habitat dynamics. Land-use simulation results indicate that agricultural and environmental conservation policies have significant effects on projected land-use patterns in the southern part of Puli's downtown area and in areas along major roads. Specifically, highway construction and subsequent urbanization under various land-use policies result in varying degrees of isolation and fragmentation in the overall landscape pattern. A habitat quality assessment using the InVEST model indicates that the conservation of agricultural and forested lands improves habitat quality and preserves rare habitats. In summary, appropriate environmental policies will mediate both the direct and indirect impacts of Highway 6 on landscape patterns and ecosystem services in Pull Township. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Commonly used techniques include hyperspectral imaging, 3D scanning, and medical computed tomography imaging. However, viewing most of this digital image data frequently requires both specialized software, which is often associated with a particular type of acquisition device, and professional knowledge of and experience with each type of data. In addition, many of these software packages are focused on particular applications (such as medicine or remote sensing) and do not permit users to access and fully exploit all the information contained in the data. In this paper, we address two practical barriers to using high-tech digital data in art conservation. First, users must deal with a wide variety of interfaces specialized for applications besides conservation. We provide an open-source software tool with a single intuitive interface consistent with conservators' needs that handles various types of 2D and 3D image data and preserves user-generated metadata and annotations. Second, previous software has largely allowed visualizing a single type or only a few types of data. The software we present is designed and structured to accommodate multiple types of digital imaging data, including as yet unspecified or unimplemented formats, in an integrated environment. This allows conservators to access different forms of information and to view a variety of image types simultaneously.

J	Diao, CY; Wang, L				Diao, Chunyuan; Wang, Le			Development of an invasive species distribution model with fine-resolution remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) is recognized as one of the most aggressively invasive species throughout the Western United States. Mapping its suitable habitat is of paramount importance to effective management, and thus, becomes a high priority for conservation practitioners. In previous studies, species distribution models (SDMs) have been applied to predicting the suitable habitats of saltcedar at national scale, but at coarser spatial resolution (1 km). Although such studies achieved some success, they are lacking of capability to accommodate fine-scale resolution environmental variables, and therefore, fail to uncover detailed spatial pattern of habitats. The objective of this study was to develop a remote sensing driven SDM so as to characterize suitable habitats of saltcedar at very fine spatial scale (30 m). We exploited several fine-scale environmental predictors through remote sensing images, and utilized the logistic regression model to analyze the species-habitat relationship by identifying influential factors with subset selection criteria. We also incorporated the spatial autocorrelation with regression kriging method. Our results indicated that the model incorporating spatial autocorrelation achieved a higher accuracy than that of regression only model. Among 10 environmental variables, the distance to the river and the phenological attributes summarized by the harmonic analysis were regarded as the most significant in predicting the invasive potential of saltcedar. We conclude that remote sensing driven SDM has potential to identify the suitable habitat of saltcedar at a fine scale and locate appropriate areas at high risk of saltcedar infestation, which could benefit the early control and proactive management strategies to a large extent.

The present study explores the capability of remote-sensing variables (vegetation indices and textures derived from SPOT-5; backscattering coefficient and interferometric coherence of ALOS PALSAR images) for modeling the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass in the Environmental Conservation Zone of Mexico City. Correlation and spatial autocorrelation coefficients were used to select significant explanatory variables in fir and pine forests. The correlation for interferometric coherence in HV polarization was negative, with correlations coefficients r=-0.83 for the fir and r=-0.75 for the pine forests. Regression-kriging showed the least root mean square error among the spatial interpolation methods used, with 37.75 tC/ha for fir forests and 29.15 tC/ha for pine forests. The results showed that a hybrid geospatial method, based on interferometric coherence data and a regression-kriging interpolator, has good potential for estimating above-ground biomass carbon.

Assessing these communities implies studying species' richness and composition, and determining a state variable of species abundance in order to infer changes in species distribution and habitat associations. The Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) network fills a chronic gap in standardized data collection by implementing a systematic monitoring framework of biodiversity, including mammal communities, across several sites. In this study, we used TEAM camera trap data collected in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, an area of exceptional importance for mammal diversity, to propose an example of a baseline assessment of species' occupancy. We used 60 camera trap locations and cumulated 1,818 camera days in 2009. Sampling yielded 10,647 images of 26 species of mammals. We estimated that a minimum of 32 species are in fact present, matching available knowledge from other sources. Estimated species richness at camera sites did not vary with a suite of habitat covariates derived from remote sensing, however the detection probability varied with functional guilds, with herbivores being more detectable than other guilds. Species-specific occupancy modelling revealed novel ecological knowledge for the 11 most detected species, highlighting patterns such as 'montane forest dwellers', e.g. the endemic Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus sanjei), and 'lowland forest dwellers', e.g. suni antelope (Neotragus moschatus). Our results show that the analysis of camera trap data with account for imperfect detection can provide a solid ecological assessment of mammal communities that can be systematically replicated across sites.																	1932-6203					JUL 23	2014	9	7							e103300	10.1371/journal.pone.0103300								WOS:000339614100105	25054806

Repeated mapping of reefs constructed by Sabellaria spinulosa Leuckart 1849 at an offshore wind farm site	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Sabellaria spinulosa reefs are considered to be sensitive and of high conservation status. This article evaluates the feasibility of using remote sensing technology to delineate S. spinulosa reefs. S. spinulosa reef habitats associated with the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site were mapped using high resolution sidescan sonar (410 kHz) and multibeam echo sounder (< 1 m(2)) data in 2005 (baseline), 2007 (pre-construction baseline) and 2012 (post-construction). The S. spinulosa reefs were identified in the acoustic data as areas of distinct irregular texturing. Maps created using acoustic data were validated using quantitative measures of reef quality, namely tube density (as a proxy for the density of live S. spinulosa), percentage cover of S. spinulosa structures (both living and dead) and associated macrofauna derived from seabed images taken across the development site. Statistically significant differences were observed in all physical measures of S. spinulosa as well the number (S) and diversity (H') of associated species, derived from seabed images classified according to the presence or absence of reef, validating the use of high resolution sidescan sonar to map these important biogenic habitats. High precision mapping in the early stages allowed for the micro-siting of wind turbines in a way that caused minimal damage to S. spinulosa reefs during construction. These habitats have since recovered and expanded in extent. The surveys undertaken at the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site demonstrate the importance of repeat mapping for this emerging industry, allowing habitat enhancement to be attributed to the development whilst preventing background habitat degradation from being wrongly attributed to the development.

J	Flaherty, S; Lurz, PWW; Patenaude, G				Flaherty, Silvia; Lurz, Peter W. W.; Patenaude, Genevieve			Use of LiDAR in the conservation management of the endangered red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris L.)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												LiDAR remote sensing allows the direct retrieval of vegetation structure parameters and has been widely used to assess habitat quality for various species. The aim of this study is to test whether LiDAR can help in providing estimates of habitat suitability over larger scales and inform conservation management planning in stronghold areas of an endangered forest mammal, the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris L.). The Eurasian red squirrel is endangered in the UK and under strict legal protection. Hence, long-term habitat management is a key goal of the UK conservation strategy. This involves understanding habitat preferences of the species. In a previous study, we demonstrated the importance of forest structure for red squirrels' habitat preference. We used a general linear model (GLM) to relate the distribution and abundance of squirrel feeding signs to mean canopy closure, mean tree height, and the total number of trees at the plot level. However, this analysis was limited to a few sample areas. In the current study, we implement the GLM using LiDAR-derived explanatory variables in Abernethy Forest. Results suggest that when forest structure is considered, only 27% of the total forest area is highly suitable for red squirrel. Implications for management are discussed.

Projecting current and future location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for breeding birds in the Great Basin	ECOSPHERE												We estimated the current location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for 50 species of breeding birds in four mountain ranges in the central Great Basin (Lander, Nye, and Eureka Counties, Nevada) and projected the future location, quality, and connectivity of habitat for these species given different scenarios of climate-induced land-cover change. In the United States, such models are relevant to federally mandated management of wild animals by state-level agencies. We sampled birds during the breeding seasons of 2001-2009 with fixed-radius point counts. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to model incidence (proportion of years a location was surveyed in which the species was present) as a function of topography and current land cover and climate. To assess model fit, we calculated the proportion of binomial deviance explained. We used cross-validation to estimate the predictive accuracy of the models. We applied the conservation planning program Zonation to identify locations where incidences of multiple species were maximized through time given current land cover and two scenarios of land-cover change, expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland into sagebrush shrubsteppe and contraction of riparian woodland. Models based on a set of 13 covariates derived from remotely sensed data had some predictive capacity for 41 of 50 species. Model outputs suggested substantial changes in amount of habitat for many species following projected expansion of pinyon-juniper woodland, but less pronounced changes following projected contraction of riparian woodland. Zonation analyses indicated that the spatial distribution of the highest-quality habitat for the avian assemblage was relatively consistent through time under both scenarios. Breeding birds in the Great Basin commonly are grouped in management plans on the basis of their general association with land-cover classes such as pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush shrubsteppe, and riparian woodland. However, even within these groups, the environmental attributes that explained a high proportion of variation in species' incidences and the projected responses to different scenarios of land-cover change varied considerably among species.																	2150-8925					JUL	2014	5	7							82	10.1890/ES13-00387.1								WOS:000345096600005

The objective was to evaluate the forest fragmentation of Coqueiral APA, using landscape metrics, as well as, elaborating landscape simulation models to provide future scenarios of ecological restoration, and then, to compare these simulations to the current landscape. Land use analyses were carried out through Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing techniques, using a SPOT 5 satellite image (SPOTMAP). Forest fragmentation was analysed by FRAGSTATS software for calculating landscape metrics such as: area, perimeter, shape, and, patch connectivity. We performed 1 and 5 m buffers maps, and a virtual restoration of the Permanent Protected Areas (APP) for landscape simulations. Landscape fragmentation analyses showed that natural vegetation is distributed within 360 patches, being 137 of them smaller than 1 ha. Landscape simulation models revealed that natural vegetation has increased from 1943.13 ha to 2299.02 ha in the restored APP simulation (natural vegetation/restored APPs = VA). The average patch size increased from 7.66 m to 15.75 m in the same simulation in comparison to the current landscape. VA showed a smaller shape value (1.93), indicating that patch shape is simpler in this simulation. This is an important result from the conservation point of view, because as simpler a shape of a patch is, smaller the edge effect is. Isolation values were not statistically different in the simulations: 38.9 m (VN); 40.64 m (VB1); 42.89 m (VB5) e 39.75 m (VA), what indicates low isolation between patches, even in the current landscape. Connectivity index was high (99%) for all simulations, indicating that landscapes have high structural connectivity.

Remotely sensed data are frequently employed for monitoring vegetation and for estimating herbivore diversity. Their use for predicting predator arthropod species abundance and richness has also been investigated with success for ants and beetles in forests using normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and for beetles in mountain forests using light detection and ranging data. 2. We investigated whether vegetation indices, derived from multispectral SPOT imagery could predict abundance and species richness of ground active spiders and ground beetles in a new ecological context, the floodplain meadows of the Loire River in Western Europe. Using pitfall traps, we collected carabids and spiders in the field. 3. Maximum vegetation height, litter-depth and plant species richness best explained species assemblages of both groups (multivariate analyses). NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI 2) were strongly related to activity-density and species richness for ground beetles only, EVI 2 being the best surrogate. Relationships between vegetation indices and spider assemblage patterns were either non-significant or weak. 4. We demonstrated that EVI 2 is a good surrogate of the abundance and richness of carabid species in a temperate floodplain, and has potential as a low cost method for mapping arthropod assemblages at large spatial scales. 5. Our approach provides a tool which contributes to biodiversity assessment at large spatial scales. It can also contribute to the prioritisation of conservation areas and early change detection, as carabids are keystone indicators.

In situ data give evidence of the upwelling in the form of thermocline tilting upward onshore. The remote sensing data show a strip of upwelling in the coastal region, which occurs more than half a summer. The upwelling probability map indicates there are two upwelling cores, one located downstream of Pingtan Island formed as cape effect and the other over the coastal canyon off the Sansha Bay. Remote sensing data and numerical model results suggest that the southerly wind plays a key role in shaping this upwelling strip, while the tides regulate the upwelling location through tidal mixing effect in the shallow water region, especially lee of Pingtan Island. Further numerical experiments using idealized cape and coastal canyon topography show that vertical velocity is intensified downstream of the cape and canyon. The vorticity equation shows that relative vorticity change along a streamline and frictional diffusion of vorticity are responsible for the vertical velocity off the cape and within and around the canyon. According to the conservation of potential vorticity, the variation of relative vorticity along a streamline over irregular topography, e.g., cape and canyon, is the main mechanism for the two upwelling cores in the northern Taiwan Strait.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL	2014	119	7					4605	4625		10.1002/2014JC009831								WOS:000340415500036

In this study, an animal habitat assessment method based on a learning neural network is proposed to reduce the level of subjectivity in animal habitat assessments. Based on two hypotheses, this method substitutes habitat suitability index with apparent density and has advantages over conventional ones such as those based on analytical hierarchy process or multivariate regression approaches. Besides, this method is integrated with a learning neural network and is suitable for building non-linear transferring functions to fit complex relationships between multiple factors influencing habitat suitability. Once the neural network is properly trained, new earth observation data can be integrated for rapid habitat suitability monitoring which could save time and resources needed for traditional data collecting approaches through extensive field surveys. Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) natural habitat in Ya'an prefecture and corresponding landsat images, DEM and ground observations are tested for validity of using the methodology reported. Results show that the method scores well in key efficiency and performance indicators and could be extended for habitat assessments, particularly of other large, rare and widely distributed animal species.																	2071-1050					JUL	2014	6	7					4059	4076		10.3390/su6074059								WOS:000340036600005

Upper Washita River Experimental Watersheds: Land Cover Data Sets (1974-2007) for Two Southwestern Oklahoma Agricultural Watersheds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Land cover data sets were developed for 1997, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 for the Little Washita River and Fort Cobb Reservoir experimental watersheds (LWREW and FCREW, respectively), located in southwestern Oklahoma, to support remote sensing based studies of soil water content. A previously unpublished retrospective land cover analysis covering the years 1974, 1981, 1985, 1989, and 1994 was conducted to complement these data sets to gain a sense of the dynamics of land cover in both the LWREW and FCREW over the 33 yr. Each of these studies used satellite-based sensors of various spatial, radiometric, and spectral resolutions, but the number of images used, image date, and methods used to analyze the images varied from study to study. Our purpose was to document the details of the retrospective land cover study, to compare land cover between watersheds with time, and to compare findings from the various studies to elucidate changes or trends in land cover in each watershed during the 33 yr the data sets represent. Information on how to access to the data sets is also given. The LWREW was a grassland watershed that changed little during the study period. The FCREW was divided between grassland and cropland, but the cropland portion exhibited dynamic behavior that appeared correlated with peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) price supports and Conservation Reserve programs. Dynamic land use information coupled with information concerning conservation practices will enhance assessment of conservation practice effectiveness as well as improve modeling of the fate and transport of chemicals and nutrients in watersheds.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2014	43	4					1310	1318		10.2134/jeq2013.07.0292								WOS:000339273000021	25603078

The effects of riverine physical complexity on anadromy and genetic diversity in steelhead or rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss around the Pacific Rim	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study explored the relationship between riverine physical complexity, as determined from remotely sensed metrics, and anadromy and genetic diversity in steelhead or rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The proportion of anadromy (estimated fraction of individuals within a drainage that are anadromous) was correlated with riverine complexity, but this correlation appeared to be driven largely by a confounding negative relationship between drainage area and the proportion of anadromy. Genetic diversity decreased with latitude, was lower in rivers with only non-anadromous individuals and also decreased with an increasing ratio of floodplain area to total drainage area. Anadromy may be less frequent in larger drainages due to the higher cost of migration associated with reaches farther from the ocean, and the negative relationship between genetic diversity and floodplain area may be due to lower effective population size resulting from greater population fluctuations associated with higher rates of habitat turnover. Ultimately, the relationships between riverine physical complexity and migratory life history or genetic diversity probably depend on the spatial scale of analysis.

Monitoring British Upland Ecosystems With the Use of Landscape Structure as an Indicator for State-and-Transition Models	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Remote sensing and landscape ecology concepts can provide a useful framework for state-and-transition models (STM) in order to quantify thresholds at different scales, and provide useful information for scientists, land managers, and conservationists in relation to resilience management. The overall aim of this research was to develop a spatially explicit STM to quantify thresholds based on the scale of disturbance processes impacting a grazing system. Specific objectives were to develop a conceptual STM framework for upland grazing ecosystems, to quantify spatial dynamics of stable and degraded pastures, and to assess threshold occurrence. Color aerial photography from Armboth Fell in the English Lake District National Park (United Kingdom) was classified into bare rock, dwarf shrub heath (DSH), and grassland/degraded wet heath (GDWH) in four pastures with different degrees of grazing pressure. Vegetation communities from these pastures were combined with soils, climate, and landform data to create a conceptual STM framework. Each pasture was sampled with 2-ha plots to quantify DSH and GDWH spatial structure. The proposed STM consisted of two reference and three alternative states. Low-grazing-pressure areas showed significantly higher percentage of DSH cover with larger contiguous patches and lower patch density than high-grazing-pressure areas. Breakpoints, considered to be thresholds, in mean patch area were identified in our data when DSH percentage cover was < 63% and GDWH, > 77%. The present study has shown the value of a robust, reliable, and repeatable approach to identify landscape dynamics and integrate it with field data to inform a conceptual STM framework for upland grazing ecosystems. It also demonstrates the importance of selecting scales relevant to the predominant disturbance process to test for threshold occurrence, and how this approach can be integrated with current assessment methods for resilience management.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				JUL	2014	67	4					380	388		10.2111/REM-D-13-00170.1								WOS:000338912800005

European mountain landscapes that include numerous protected areas provide a unique opportunity to weigh the long-term influences of land-use practices and climate on forest-grassland ecotone dynamics. Aerial photographs from four dates (1948, 1978, 1993, and 2009) were used to quantify the extent of forest and grassland cover at 5-m resolution across a 150-km(2) area in a protected area of the southwestern French Alps. The study area included a grazed zone and a nongrazed zone that was abandoned during the 1970s. We estimated time series of a forestation index (FI) and analyzed the effects of elevation and grazing on FI using a hierarchical linear mixed effect model. Forest extent (composed primarily of mountain pine, Pinus uncinata) expanded from 50.6 km(2) in 1948 to 85.5 km(2) in 2009, i.e., a 23% increase in relative cover at the expense of grassland communities. Over the sixty-year period, the treeline rose by 118 m, from 1564 to 1682 m. Rapid forest expansion within the nongrazed zone followed the cessation of logging activities and was likely accelerated by climate warming during the 1980s. Within the grazed zone, the maintained presence of sheep did not fully counteract mountain pine expansion and led to highly contrasting rates of land-cover change based on the location of shepherds' cabins and water sources. Projections of FI for 2030 showed remnant patches of intensively used grasslands interspersed in a densely forested matrix. Our analysis of mountain land-cover dynamics provided strong evidence for forest encroachment into grassland habitat despite consistent grazing pressure. This pattern may be attributed to the disappearance of traditional land-use practices such as shrub burning and removal. Our findings prompt land managers to reconsider their initial conservation priority (i.e., the protection of a renowned mountain pine forest) and to implement proactive management strategies in order to preserve landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity. Projecting historical trends in the forest-grassland ecotone to 2030 provides stakeholders with a policy relevant tool for near-term land management.

Estimating biomass on CRP pastureland: A comparison of remote sensing techniques	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												Biomass from land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is being considered as a biofuel feedstock source. A quick, accurate and nondestructive method to estimate biomass yield would be valuable for land managers to ensure sustainable production. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of regression models to estimate biomass yields using data from satellite and ground based remote sensing platforms. Biomass yields and plant spectral responses were obtained at different phenological stages over two growing seasons (2011-2012) on an 8.1 ha CRP pasture in central Montana. Regression models were constructed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and various band combinations from a hand held Crop Circle sensor and from Landsat satellite images. All models showed reasonable accuracy in estimating biomass, with a difference of <276 kg ha(-1) or 8% of measured values. None of the models showed statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between actual and estimated biomass. Results suggest that the usefulness of the spectral regions is a function of phenological growth stage. Red, red edge, and the near-infrared bands are more responsive at boot and peak growth stages while bands in the short-wave infrared increased the accuracy for the dormant stage biomass estimations. Land managers may construct spectral models to more effectively manage biomass resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Estimation of residential outdoor water use in Los Angeles, California	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The current study analyzes existing methods for estimating outdoor use and landscape irrigation in highly developed residential areas across Los Angeles. Outdoor use was estimated using three methods: two methods described by the Pacific Institute and a third approach that utilizes remotely sensed vegetation and water billing data. Monthly individual water use records were provided by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) for 2000-2010. This period includes voluntary and mandatory restrictions due to drought conditions across the state. Records were aggregated to the census tract level to protect customer privacy. The two Pacific Institute methods, which are based on water billing data, generally underestimate outdoor use due to assumptions that the lowest water consumption month represents indoor use, which is likely not the case in Los Angeles. The remote-sensing model developed between single-family water use and the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) surplus performed well in greener areas of the city and indicates that landscape irrigation use represents 54% of total single-family water use. The model also predicts an average decrease in landscaping irrigation of 6% and by 35% during voluntary and mandatory restrictions, respectively. Voluntary conservation and mandatory waste restrictions were less effective for higher income groups in the city, while more stringent pricing and non-pricing mandatory restrictions in FY2010 had similar effects across income groups. Study results contribute to a better understanding of the partitioning of Los Angeles residential water use and can be utilized to evaluate pricing structures and target water conservation efforts.

Variability in mangrove change estimates and implications for the assessment of ecosystem service provision	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To quantify the variability in estimates of change in mangrove area for key countries throughout the tropics, and to highlight potential implications for the assessment of global mangrove ecology, function and conservation. Location Pan-tropical, covering 15 countries, and accounting for c. 67% of global mangrove area. Methods We review 314 national mangrove area estimates (authoritative statements with defined time periods) from various sources. Linear regression models of mangrove area over time were applied to various data point combinations, defined by data source. These included various FAO resources, as well as academic and government statistics and remote sensing studies. Results National trends of change in mangrove area exhibited high variability depending on which data points were modelled. Many countries showed high variability in deforestation rate when the results of all models were combined, e.g. Indonesia had an average deforestation rate of 331.65 (+/- 222.26) km2 yr-1, Nigeria lost 92.09 (+/- 188.95) km2 yr-1 and Cuba lost 34.82 (+/- 142.17) km2 yr-1. The standard deviations were large due to high variability in national estimates, and hence the number of contradictory trends that could be extracted. Conflicting trends of long-term mangrove loss and gain could be derived for eight of the 15 countries analysed, including Indonesia, Brazil and the Philippines. Main conclusions The great variability in trends of mangrove extent suggests that estimates of ecosystem functional loss, biodiversity threat assessments and science-based conservation policies will be hampered by low confidence in mangrove area dynamics. Variable and inaccurate baseline data feed into various estimates of biodiversity and ecosystem functional loss, such as IUCN Red List assessments and estimates of global carbon emissions from mangrove deforestation. We also require robust information to inform conservation actions and policies hoping to reduce functional loss. Variability has important implications for all ecosystems where statistics are required over large scales.

J	Ferreira, V; Panagopoulos, T				Ferreira, Vera; Panagopoulos, Thomas			Seasonality of Soil Erosion Under Mediterranean Conditions at the Alqueva Dam Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Alqueva reservoir created the largest artificial lake of Western Europe in 2010. Since then, the region has faced challenges due to land-use changes that may increase the risk of erosion and shorten the lifetime of the reservoir, increasing the need to promote land management sustainability. This paper investigates the aspect of seasonality of soil erosion using a comprehensive methodology that integrates the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) approach, geographic information systems, geostatistics, and remote-sensing. An experimental agro-silvo pastoral area (typical land-use) was used for the RUSLE factors update. The study confirmed the effect of seasonality on soil erosion rates under Mediterranean conditions. The highest rainfall erosivity values occurred during the autumn season (433.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)), when vegetation cover is reduced after the long dry season. As a result, the autumn season showed the highest predicted erosion (9.9 t ha(-1)), contributing 65 % of the total annual erosion. The predicted soil erosion for winter was low (1.1 t ha(-1)) despite the high rainfall erosivity during that season (196.6 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1)). The predicted annual soil loss was 15.1 t ha(-1), and the sediment amount delivery was 4,314 x 10(3) kg. Knowledge of seasonal variation would be essential to outline sustainable land management practices. This model will be integrated with World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies methods to support decision-making in that watershed, and it will involve collaboration with both local people and governmental institutions.

Satellite images were used to detect the change in potential crane habitat, from which suitable crane habitat was determined by excluding fragmented habitat. In this study, a principal component analysis (PCA) with seven variables (channel flow, rainfall, temperature, sediment discharge, number of oil wells, total length of roads, and area of settlements) and linear regression analyses of potential and suitable habitat against the retained principal components were applied to explore the influences of natural and anthropogenic factors on the change of the red-crowned crane habitat. The experimental results indicate that suitable habitat decreased by 5,935 ha despite an increase of 1,409 ha in potential habitat from 1992 to 2008. The area of crane habitat changed caused by natural drivers such as progressive succession, retrogressive succession, and physical fragmentation is almost the same as that caused by anthropogenic forces such as land use change and behavioral fragmentation. The PCA and regression analyses revealed that natural factors (e.g., channel flow, rainfall, temperature, and sediment discharge) play an important role in the crane potential habitat change and human disturbances (e.g., oil wells, roads, and settlements) jointly explain 51.8 % of the variations in suitable habitat area, higher than 48.2 % contributed by natural factors. Thus, it is vital to reduce anthropogenic influences within the reserve in order to reverse the decline in the suitable crane habitat.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2014	186	7					4013	4028		10.1007/s10661-014-3676-y								WOS:000337030000004	24526617

Assessing the changes in land use and ecosystem services in Changzhou municipality, Peoples' Republic of China, 1991-2006	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Much of the world is experiencing fast urbanization. Many pen-urban open spaces, such as parks, forest, farmland, and wetlands, have been built over, which has resulted in a steep decline of ecosystem services at the municipal and regional levels. Using remote sensing, geography information system (GIS) technology and economic evaluation method for ecosystem services, the evolution of landscape spatial structure in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 of Changzhou City, People's Republic of China, was obtained and the change of ecosystem services resulted from land use change was evaluated. Study results show a continuing expansion of urbanized areas and reduction in ecosystem services. Before 2001, farmland was the main type of land use, accounting for more than 53.3% of the total area within the broadly-drawn municipal boundaries. In 2006, farmland and built-up areas were the main land-use types. The built-up area increased by 122% from 1991 to 2006. From 1991 to 2001, the proportion of ecological land (farmland, forests, grasslands, and water-covered areas) within Changzhou's municipal boundaries decreased 24.1%. Based on the observed changes, the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Changzhou's ecological land decreased by 19.3% from 1991 to 2006 and the annual decrease ratio was approximately 1.3%. Conversion of farmland to other uses was responsible for the largest reduction in the value of ecosystem services, equal to 239.8 million RMB (equivalent to USD 37.8 million). Our research results were already adopted locally by Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Urban Planning and applied for Changzhou Mater Urban Planning. The current study can contribute not only to improvements in the Changzhou environment, but to the study of and improvements to other rapidly-urbanizing cities, as the rapid growth of urban areas is one of the most pronounced environmental trends of recent times.

During this period, Mato Grosso emerged as a globally important center of agricultural production. In 2001, 3.3 million hectares of mechanized agriculture were cultivated in Mato Grosso, of which 500 000 hectares had two commercial crops per growing season (double cropping). By 2011, Mato Grosso had 5.8 million hectares of mechanized agriculture, of which 2.9 million hectares were double cropped. We found these agricultural changes to be selective with respect to land attributes -significant differences (p < 0.001) existed between the land attributes of agriculture versus non-agriculture, single cropping versus double cropping, and expansion versus abandonment. Many of the land attributes (elevation, slope, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, initial soy transport costs, and soil) that were associated with an increased likelihood of expansion were associated with a decreased likelihood of abandonment (p < 0.001). While land similar to agriculture and double cropping in 2001 was much more likely to be developed for agriculture than all other land, new cropland shifted to hotter, drier, lower locations that were more isolated from agricultural infrastructure (p < 0.001). The scarcity of high quality remaining agricultural land available for agricultural expansion in Mato Grosso could be contributing to the slowdown in agricultural expansion observed there over 2006 to 2011. Land use policy analyses should control for land scarcity constraints on agricultural expansion.

Spatial Decision Analysis on Wetlands Restoration in the Lower Reaches of Songhua River (LRSR), Northeast China, Based on Remote Sensing and GIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Wetlands in the Lower Reaches of Songhua River (LRSR), Northeast China, are rich in biodiversity and natural resources, which provide crucial staging and wintering habitats for various endangered species. However, in the past five decades, the size of this wetland area has decreased, and its quality has deteriorated because of increased natural and human activities. Wetland restoration is critical to improve these conditions. In this study, hydrological regulation and habitat suitability, the most important wetland functions, were selected and analyzed to identify suitable wetland restoration sites. By using these two function layers, together with the geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis function and remote sensing (RS) image data, we identified and prioritized suitable sites for wetland restoration in the LRSR. Areas with high hydrological regulation and good or fair waterbirds' habitat suitability can support wetland restoration. The potential sites were prioritized in terms of patch size and proximity to natural wetlands and water bodies. Finally, we obtained two priority classes (high and low) of wetland restoration in a spatial scale. The results from this study showed that the areas with high and low priority classes for wetland restoration are 82,628 and 247,039 ha, respectively, which account for 1.23% and 3.67% of the total study area. The high-priority class areas would be used for the wetland restoration.																	1735-6865	2008-2304				SUM	2014	8	3					849	860										WOS:000339932500034

In addition, CBFM enables greater survey repeatability. Therefore, CBFM should be a fundamental component of national forest monitoring systems and programs to measure, report and verify (MRV) REDD+ activities. To contribute to the development of more effective approaches to CBFM, in this paper we assess: (1) the feasibility of using small, low-cost drones (i.e., remotely piloted aerial vehicles) in CBFM programs; (2) their potential advantages and disadvantages for communities, partner organizations and forest data end-users; and (3) to what extent their utilization, coupled with ground surveys and local ecological knowledge, would improve tropical forest monitoring. To do so, we reviewed the existing literature regarding environmental applications of drones, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own firsthand experience flying small drones to map and monitor tropical forests and training people to operate them. We believe that the utilization of small drones can enhance CBFM and that this approach is feasible in many locations throughout the tropics if some degree of external assistance and funding is provided to communities. We suggest that the use of small drones can help tropical communities to better manage and conserve their forests whilst benefiting partner organizations, governments and forest data end-users, particularly those engaged in forestry, biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation projects such as REDD+.

Potential contributions of remote sensing to ecosystem service assessments	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Ecological and conservation research has provided a strong scientific underpinning to the modeling of ecosystem services (ESs) over space and time, by identifying the ecological processes and components of biodiversity (ecosystem service providers, functional traits) that drive ES supply. Despite this knowledge, efforts to map the distribution of ESs often rely on simple spatial surrogates that provide incomplete and non-mechanistic representations of the biophysical variables they are intended to proxy. However, alternative data sets are available that allow for more direct, spatially nuanced inputs to ES mapping efforts. Many spatially explicit, quantitative estimates of biophysical parameters are currently supported by remote sensing, with great relevance to ES mapping. Additional parameters that are not amenable to direct detection by remote sensing may be indirectly modeled with spatial environmental data layers. We review the capabilities of modern remote sensing for describing biodiversity, plant traits, vegetation condition, ecological processes, soil properties, and hydrological variables and highlight how these products may contribute to ES assessments. Because these products often provide more direct estimates of the ecological properties controlling ESs than the spatial proxies currently in use, they can support greater mechanistic realism in models of ESs. By drawing on the increasing range of remote sensing instruments and measurements, data sets appropriate to the estimation of a given ES can be selected or developed. In so doing, we anticipate rapid progress to the spatial characterization of ecosystem services, in turn supporting ecological conservation, management, and integrated land use planning.

Conservation policies in JNP include the implementation of two national reforestation programs to increase forest cover and the exclusion of local land-use. We use archaeological excavation, ethnographic interviews, remote sensing and vegetation surveys to examine the implications of these policies for non-forest, montane meadows. We find that Amdo Tibetan people cultivated the valley for > 2,000 years, creating and maintaining meadows through land clearing, burning and grazing. Meadows served as sites for gathering plants and mushrooms and over 40 % of contemporary species are ethnobotanically useful. Remote sensing analyses indicate a substantial (69.6 %) decline in meadow area between 1974 and 2004. Respondents report a loss of their "true history" and connections to the past associated with loss of meadows. Conservation policies intended to preserve biodiversity are unintentionally contributing to the loss of these ecologically and culturally significant meadow habitats.																	0300-7839	1572-9915				JUN	2014	42	3					481	491		10.1007/s10745-014-9650-z								WOS:000337059400010	26097267					
J	Potter, C				Potter, Christopher			Monitoring the production of Central California coastal rangelands using satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												There is a long history of livestock grazing on the California Central Coast, dating back over 150 years. In this study, methods were reviewed and results presented for analysis of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor data to monitor year-to-year variation of forage production on Central Coast rangelands around Big Sur, California. Time series plots from 2000 to 2012 of vegetation greenness for ten rangeland sites showed similar inter-annual patterns in satellite yield index (SYI) values. Most sites reached their maximum greenness levels each year in early May. The year with the highest observed SYI level across most sites was 2005. In the northern portion of the region (north of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park), 2007 was the year with the lowest observed SYI level, whereas in the southern allotments, 2007 was a year with a relatively high SYI level. These methods have the potential to monitor the differing seasonal growing cycles of rangeland production across the area of individual grazing allotments on the Central Coast. Such a cost-effective and timely approach is required for conservation monitoring in the Big Sur coastal ecosystems where rapid climate change may shift vegetation cover in favor of more extensive rangelands at the expense of forested lands.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				JUN	2014	18	3					213	220		10.1007/s11852-014-0308-1								WOS:000336739500006

Measuring Habitat Quality for Least Bitterns in a Created Wetland with Use of a Small Unmanned Aircraft	WETLANDS												Created wetlands play an important role in the conservation of Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis) by compensating for the loss of natural wetlands. In 2011, we studied habitat relationships of a major population breeding in a 128-ha cattail- and bur-reed-dominated impoundment in Quebec. We surveyed for bitterns and recorded habitat parameters at 30 points, making novel use of a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to obtain fine-scale land cover data. A model-selection approach based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) determined that breeding density was best predicted by cattail cover in combination with water-vegetation edge density (Akaike weight = 0.88). Breeding density was unrelated to water depth, contrary to a previous study at the site after a dyke breach significantly lowered water levels, suggesting that above a certain depth threshold other habitat preferences take precedence. We recommend that management of created wetlands for Least Bitterns focus on maintaining stable water levels of at least 25 cm on average during the breeding season and manipulating them as required later on in order to promote hemi-marsh conditions. UAS can enhance wetland habitat research and monitoring by improving the precision and efficiency of data collection in the field while reducing disturbance compared to ground-based surveys.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2014	34	3					527	533		10.1007/s13157-014-0518-1								WOS:000336288800011

Quantifying Tropical Wetlands Using Field Surveys, Spatial Statistics and Remote Sensing	WETLANDS												Tropical wetlands support high biodiversity and ecological services, but in most areas they suffer from a paucity of baseline data to support management. We demonstrate how modern technology can be used to develop ecological baseline data including, landuse/landcover, water depth, water quality, lake-level fluctuation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). For the first time we quantified and mapped these metrics for the Paya Indah Wetlands, Malaysia using the new high-spatial-resolution World View 2 imagery. Landuse/landcover classifications were validated by field visits and visual interpretation of the imagery. NDVI was extracted based on red and near infra-red 2 bands. Topo to Raster method was used for interpolation of water depths. Annual mean of a water-quality index and annual water-level fluctuation of lakes were interpolated across lakes using the inverse-distance weighting method. Qualitative and quantitative accuracy assessment of classification (75 % overall accuracy, user's accuracies ranged from 60 % to 90 % and producer's accuracy ranged from 60 % to 97 %) was promising and clearly illustrated that World View 2 imagery can yield fast and reasonably precise identification of ecosystem characteristics for ecological baselines.

J	Kaiser, BA				Kaiser, Brooks A.			Watershed Conservation in the Long Run	ECOSYSTEMS												We studied unanticipated long-run outcomes of conservation activities that occurred in forested watersheds on O`ahu, Hawaii, in the early twentieth century. The initial general impetus for the conservation activities was to improve irrigation surface water flow for the sugar industry. Industry concentration facilitated conservation of entire ecosystems. We investigate the benefits that accrued through dynamic linkages of the hydrological cycle and groundwater aquifer system. This provides a clear example of the need to consider integrated watershed effects, industrial structure, and linkages in determining conservation policy. We incorporated remote-sensing data, expert opinion on current watershed quality, and a spatial economic and hydrological model of O`ahu's freshwater use with reports of conservation activities from 1910-1960 to assess these benefits. We find a 2.3% annual increase in groundwater recharge levels from these activities, with a lower bound benefit-cost ratio of 7.1-18.2. This lower-bound excludes returns from such high value, yet controversial to measure, amenities as species preservation.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				JUN	2014	17	4					698	719		10.1007/s10021-014-9754-8								WOS:000336397600011

Application of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data for extraction of soil moisture and its use in hydrological modelling at Gottleuba Catchment, Saxony, Germany	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT												Hydrological modelling is a powerful tool for hydrologists and engineers involved in the planning and management of water resources. With the recent advent of computational power and the growing availability of spatial data, remote sensing and geographical information systems technologies can augment to a great extent the conventional methods used in rainfall run-off studies. That means it is possible to accurately describe the characteristics of watershed in particularly when determining the run-off response to rainfall inputs. The main objective of this study is to apply the potential application of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (i.e. TerraSAR-X and Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) for soil moisture retrieval) and to improve the spatial input parameters required for hydrological modelling. For the spatial database creation, a high-resolution 2-m aerial laser scanning digital terrain model, soil map, and land use map were used. Rainfall records were transformed into a run-off through hydrological parameterisation of the watershed using Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS) software for rainfall run-off simulation. The Soil Conservation Services Curve Number and soil moisture accounting loss methods were selected to calculate the infiltration losses. In this research, soil moisture was derived from two different types of spaceborne SAR data: TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR (L-band). The developed integrated hydrological model was applied to a flood prone area: Gottleuba Catchment in Pirna (Saxony, Germany). For model validation, 10 years historical precipitation data were used. The validated model was further optimised using the extracted soil moisture from SAR data. The simulation results showed a reasonable match between the simulated and the observed hydrographs. Hence, this paper confirms that TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR (L-band) have a high potential for soil moisture mapping as a useful source of information and technique in hydrological modelling.

Tracking wetland loss to improve evidence-based wetland policy learning and decision making	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												At the core of any evidence-based policy analysis are accurate data and the policy analytic capacity of government agencies to use these data to develop and measure metrics of policy success. This study evaluated the government's policy capacity to manage wetlands in Alberta, Canada, by measuring and evaluating three policy metrics: (1) no net change of wetland area; (2) permitted versus unpermitted wetland loss; and (3) an information tracking system that provides credible regulatory oversight. Using a climate-corrected wetland loss inventory, we detected the loss of 242 wetlands, totaling 71 ha, in the Beaverhill subwatershed between 1999 and 2009. The majority of the losses occurred on land that were classified as 'developed' (urban and industrial) or 'agriculture'. When wetland loss was compared to government-issued wetland permit data, we found that over 80 % of the wetland area was lost without a government permit. The wetland permit data also revealed serious problems with information tracking by both government and non-government agencies responsible for policy and regulatory oversight. In order to resolve these common policy failures, governments need to commit more resources towards acquiring, effectively managing, and freely sharing information that can be used to evaluate policy outcomes to 'open up' wetland management and decision making to include active participation from informal institutions, local governments, and the general public as a means to drive improved regulatory oversight.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				JUN	2014	22	3					235	245		10.1007/s11273-013-9326-2								WOS:000335908600003

To illustrate the approach, spatial simulation models, including landscape-level forest dynamics, were developed for a semi-natural grassland of conservation concern in a southern Italian protected area, which was exposed to woody vegetation encroachment. A forest landscape dynamics simulator (LANDIS-II) under conditions of climate change, current fire and alternative management regimes was used to develop scenario maps. Landscape pattern metrics provided data on fragmentation and habitat quality degradation, and quantified the spatial spread of different tree species within grassland habitats. The models indicated that approximately one-third of the grassland area would be impacted by loss, fragmentation and degradation in the next 150 years. Differing forest management regimes appear to influence the type of encroaching species and the density of encroaching vegetation. Habitat modifications are likely to affect species distribution and interactions, as well as local ecosystem functioning, leading to changes in estimated conservation value. A site-scale conservation strategy based on feasible integrated fire and forest management options is proposed, considering the debate on the effectiveness of protected areas for the conservation of ecosystem services in a changing climate. This needs to be tested through further modelling and scenario analysis, which would benefit from the enhancement of current modelling capabilities of LANDIS-II and from combination with remote sensing technologies, to provide early signals of environmental shifts both within and outside protected areas.

Murray			Ecohydrodynamics of Cold-Water Coral Reefs: A Case Study of the Mingulay Reef Complex (Western Scotland)	PLOS ONE												Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications.

J.; Wang, Qi; Qing, Baoping; Ding, Changqing			Reduced Dependence of Crested Ibis on Winter-Flooded Rice Fields: Implications for Their Conservation	PLOS ONE												The Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon was once thought to be extinct in the wild until seven birds were discovered in a remote mountain village in China in 1981. Studies suggested that winter-flooded rice fields play an essential role in nest site selection by the Crested Ibis and hence in their survival. Considerable efforts were therefore made to conserve the winter-flooded rice fields, but these have caused conflicts between the agricultural and conservation communities. The population and geographical range of the wild Crested Ibis has expanded greatly since 1981, but there is no spatial information on the winter-flooded rice fields, nor on the current association of nest sites and winter-flooded rice fields. We mapped winter-flooded rice fields across the entire current range of Crested Ibis using innovative remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. The spatial relationships between the nest site clusters and winter-flooded rice fields were quantified using Ward's hierarchical clustering method and Ripley's K-function. We show that both have significantly clumped distribution patterns and that they are positively associated. However, the dependence of Crested Ibis on the winter-flooded rice fields varied significantly among the nest site clusters and has decreased over the years, indicating the absence of winter-flooded rice fields is not constraining their recovery and population expansion. We therefore recommend that efforts should be made to protect the existing winter-flooded rice fields and to restore the functionality of natural and semi-natural wetlands, to encourage both in-situ conservation and the re-introduction of the Crested Ibis. In addition, we recommend that caution should be exercised when interpreting the habitat requirements of species with a narrow distribution, particularly when that interpretation is based only on their current habitat.

Pine Island Glacier retreated 31 km at its center, with most retreat in 2005-2009 when the glacier ungrounded from its ice plain. Thwaites Glacier retreated 14 km along its fast flow core and 1 to 9 km along the sides. Haynes Glacier retreated 10 km along its flanks. Smith/Kohler glaciers retreated the most, 35 km along its ice plain, and its ice shelf pinning points are vanishing. These rapid retreats proceed along regions of retrograde bed elevation mapped at a high spatial resolution using a mass conservation technique that removes residual ambiguities from prior mappings. Upstream of the 2011 grounding line positions, we find no major bed obstacle that would prevent the glaciers from further retreat and draw down the entire basin.

Oil exploration and exploitation can constitute an important threat to fragmented and remnant desert biodiversity, yet little is known about where and how intensively such developments are taking place. This lack of information hinders local efforts to adequately buffer and protect desert wildlife against encroachment from anthropogenic activity. Here, we investigate the use of freely available satellite imagery for the detection of features associated with oil exploration in the African Sahelo-Saharan region. We demonstrate how texture analyses combined with Landsat data can be employed to detect ground-validated exploration sites in Algeria and Niger. Our results show that site detection via supervised image classification and prediction is generally accurate. One surprising outcome of our analyses is the relatively high level of site omission errors in Niger (43%), which appears to be due to non-detection of potentially small-scale, temporary exploration activity: we believe the repeated implementation of our framework could reduce the severity of potential methodological limitations. Overall, our study provides a methodological basis for the mapping of anthropogenic threats associated with oil exploitation that can be conducted across desert regions.

Such synchronization is the key to improving the potential for satellite data effectively to support future environmental management decision-making processes. With this themed issue, we aim to illustrate how integrating remote sensing into ecological research promotes a better understanding of the mechanisms shaping current changes in biodiversity patterns and improves conservation efforts.

Here, we compare two measures derived from unclassified remotely sensed data, a measure of habitat heterogeneity and a measure of habitat composition, for explaining bird species richness and the spatial distribution of 10 species in a semi-arid landscape of New Mexico. We surveyed bird abundance from 1996 to 1998 at 42 plots located in the McGregor Range of Fort Bliss Army Reserve. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values of two May 1997 Landsat scenes were the basis for among-pixel habitat heterogeneity (image texture), and we used the raw imagery to decompose each pixel into different habitat components (spectral mixture analysis). We used model averaging to relate measures of avian biodiversity to measures of image texture and spectral mixture analysis fractions. Measures of habitat heterogeneity, particularly angular second moment and standard deviation, provide higher explanatory power for bird species richness and the abundance of most species than measures of habitat composition.

Individual PAs have different roles in maintaining connectivity, depending on their size and location. We measured their contribution to network connectivity (irreplaceability) for carnivores and ungulates and combined it with a measure of vulnerability based on a 30-year trend in remotely sensed vegetation cover (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). Highly irreplaceable PAs occurred mainly in southern and eastern Africa. Vegetation cover change was generally faster outside than inside PAs and particularly so in southern Africa. The extent of change increased with the distance from PAs. About 5% of highly irreplaceable PAs experienced a faster vegetation cover loss than their surroundings, thus requiring particular conservation attention. Our analysis identified PAs at risk whose isolation would disrupt the connectivity of the PA network for large mammals. This is an example of how ecological spatial modelling can be combined with large-scale remote sensing data to investigate how land cover change may affect ecological processes and species conservation.

Assessing the drivers of biodiversity in Madagascar by quantifying its hydrologic properties at the watershed scale	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Motivated by a theory developed by Wilme et al. (2006) according to which, watersheds of Madagascar with headwaters at high altitude respond differently to drought from those with headwaters confined to relatively low elevations, with possibly profound effects on the biodiversity patterns of the island, we analyzed multi-year basin-specific observations of soil moisture and vegetation water content (derived from NRL's WindSat radiometer) and their response to precipitation departures (derived from TRMM 3B42 V7) from its local mean. These datasets were analyzed to investigate the hydrologic properties at the basin scale, including the speed with which vegetation and soil moisture respond to precipitation anomalies. We also looked at the basin-specific normalized radar surface-backscattering cross-sections from NASA's QuikSCAT Scatterometer, to obtain information on the vegetation regimes of the various Malagasy basins. Finally, we correlated the basin response to the precipitation forcing, and compared the amplitude and time lag of the correlations across watersheds with high elevation headwaters versus those with low elevation headwaters in the aim of evaluating the drought-response hypothesis of Wilme et al. (2006). Our results indicate that the vegetation water content time series exhibit several features that are consistent with those of the majority of the bioclimatic zones of the island. Specifically, although the speed of the response of the vegetation water content varies significantly among the different basins, it is inter-annually consistent for each watershed, while the soil-moisture time series are less consistent than the vegetation water content time series. This study is a first step in the quantification of the hydrologic properties derived from microwave remote sensing, and which could potentially shed new light on the different intra-annual responses of watersheds to precipitation anomalies. Furthermore, this analysis offers important insights into the hydro-geomorphologic drivers associated with biodiversity patterns in Madagascar, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine biotic diversification across the various bioclimatic regions of the island.

Most analytical models consider single surface reflections, and the polarization is usually ignored. However, a loss of energy is reported for large observation angles (theta > 50 degrees) because multiple surface reflections are ignored. This article generalizes the infrared reflectivity derivation of Li etal. (Appl. Opt., Vol. 52, 6100-6111, 2013) for 1D surfaces (2D problems) to 2D surfaces (3D problems), so that the cross-polarization effect can be taken into account. The contributions of one and two successive surface reflections are analyzed separately. The bidirectional reflectivity and the hemispherical reflectivity are studied. It is shown that the sea surface infrared reflectivity is significant for large incidence and observation angles. The energy conservation criterion is then checked. The loss of energy is largely reduced after taking into account two surface reflections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The methodology is applied to a real case of great historical interest: the "Torre del Mangia" (Mangia's tower) in Siena (Italy). The tower geometry was acquired through Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) techniques. The tower oscillations were detected using an interferometric radar in "Piazza del Campo", the square facing the Mangia's Tower, along three alignments, and movement of the structure at several heights were recorded. A FE model, built on the basis of the geometry acquired through the TLS, was used to interpret and verify the physical meaning of the experimental results. Through the discussion of the case study, the paper shows that the proposed approach can be considered as an effective and expeditious method for assessing the dynamic behavior of monumental buildings (and to plan interventions) on territorial scale.

In this study we used remote sensing techniques to model the degree of spatial overlapping between the Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and Argentine fisheries, assuming this as a proxy of risk for albatrosses. Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal long-line fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincon estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1 degrees by 1 degrees grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38 degrees S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47 degrees s in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure. Although there were possible biases due to the limited number of tracked birds and the locations where albatrosses were captured and instrumented, the information presented in this study provides a comprehensive picture of important areas of overlapping during winter that could be used by the fishery administration to prioritize conservation actions under limited resource scenarios.

The focus is the transnational region of the western coastal section of The Gambia and Senegal located between the Gambia and Casamance Rivers. Remote sensing applied to Landsat images of the interfluvial region in 1986 and 2010 indicates a 35% decline in overall mangrove coverage for the study area with sub-regions of pronounced loss. There was a 12% decline along the south bank of the lower Gambia River and a 43% decrease in coverage between the Gambian border and the Casamance River. Mangrove loss reached 92% in the northern section of Casamance south of the international border between Senegal and The Gambia. Fieldwork suggests that the mangrove decline over the study period is in part driven by the growing firewood demand of urban centers. The remote-sensing analysis, complemented by fieldwork in the region, attributes the negative trends to the Gambian demand for firewood, political instability in Casamance, and a porous international border that facilitates illegal cutting and smuggling.

Paramo environments provide important species habitat and ecosystem services. Changes in spatial extent of the paramo ecosystem at Pambamarca in the Central Cordillera of the northern Ecuadorian Andes were analysed using multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite data. The region suffered a loss of 1826.6 ha or 20% of the total area at a rate of 100 ha/annum during 1988-2007 period. It is found that permanent paramo cover decreased from 8350 ha in 1988 to 5864 ha in 2007 at a fairly constant rate (R (2)=0.94). This loss is attributed to expansion of commercial agriculture and floriculture in the valleys coupled with increased population pressure. Land at higher elevations has been cleared for small scale agriculture. Loss of the paramo ecosystem will exert a number of negative impacts on ecosystem services and livelihoods of the local population at Pambamarca.																	1672-6316	1993-0321				MAY	2014	11	3					708	716		10.1007/s11629-013-2365-6								WOS:000336319100012

Rainfall and Vegetation Coupling Index for soil erosion risk mapping	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Information about vegetation cover based on remote sensing data is widely used for soil erosion risk mapping, but no clear guidelines exist to select the most appropriate temporal satellite data. Soil erosion risk varies with rainfall and vegetation cover dynamics during a year, and the month with the highest erosion risk varies too. This paper proposes the use of a Rainfall and Vegetation Coupling Index (RVCI) to. quickly identify the month with the highest soil erosion risk by using easily available rainfall and vegetation cover data. The appropriateness of the RVCI is validated against field measured sediment yield data in the upper watershed of Miyun Reservoir (UWMR) for different years. Based on the above, the soil erosion risk in the UWMR. for 2005 was mapped and analyzed. Our results show that RVCI has the ability to cut through the rainfall-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index complexity and provides a more intuitive means for inferring the relative soil erosion risk.The soil erosicin risk in the UWMR for 2005 shows that severe soil loss or worse tends to occur on dry lands or grasslands on steep slopes, which will require attention for soil and water conservation in the future.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2014	69	3					213	220		10.2489/jswc.69.3.213								WOS:000336197200008

To improve communication in conservation planning, managers and other stakeholders need spatially explicit projections at the landscape scale of future biodiversity under different land-use scenarios. For that purpose, we visualized the potential effect of five forest management scenarios on the avifauna of Kakamega Forest, western Kenya using different measures of bird diversity and GIS data. Future projections of bird diversity combined: (1) remotely sensed data on the spatial distribution of different forest management types; (2) field-based data on the biodiversity of birds in the different management types; and (3) forest management scenarios that took into account possible views of various stakeholder groups. Management scenarios based on the species richness of forest specialists were very informative, because they reflected differences in the proportions of near-natural forest types among the five scenarios. Projections based on community composition were even more meaningful, as they mirrored not only the proportions of near-natural forest types, but also their perimeter to area ratios. This highlights that it is important to differentiate effects of the total area of available habitat and the degree of habitat fragmentation, both for species richness and community composition. Furthermore, our study shows that an approach that combines land-use scenarios, remote sensing and field data on biodiversity can be used to visualize future biodiversity. As such, visualizations of alternative scenarios are valuable for successful communication about conservation planning considering different groups of stakeholders in species-rich tropical forests.																	0006-3606	1744-7429				MAY	2014	46	3					357	366		10.1111/btp.12105								WOS:000335784700014

This study tests the use of ecosystem functioning variables, derived from satellite imagery data, to explore their potential use in modeling the distribution of the European badger in Mediterranean arid environments. We found that the performance of distribution models was enhanced by the inclusion of variables derived from the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), such as mean EVI (a proxy for primary production), the coefficient of variation of mean EVI (an indicator of seasonality), and the standard deviation of mean EVI (representing spatial heterogeneity of primary production). We also found that distributions predicted by remote sensing data were consistent with the ecological preferences of badger in those environments, which may be explained by the link between EVI-derived variables and the spatial and temporal variability of food resource availability. In conclusion, we suggest the incorporation of variables associated with ecosystem function into species modeling exercises as a useful tool for improving decision-making related to wildlife conservation and management.

Artificial restoration projects have been conducted worldwide to repair disaster damage to forests, but the efficacy of such projects in light of naturally occurring recovery processes is rarely evaluated. To fill such an important knowledge gap, we investigated forest recovery and restoration in the world-renowned Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan, China after the catastrophic Wenchuan earthquake (magnitude 8.0) in 2008, which caused considerable damage to the forest and habitat of the endangered giant panda. This was the first multi-year field study to document natural recovery of forests in response to this disaster. Forest sampling conducted in panda habitat over a four-year period after the earthquake revealed that natural recovery was rapid, with vegetation covering roughly 70% of once denuded sites by the fourth sampling year. Vegetation recovery was further improved in sampled artificial restoration sites, which recovered from an average of 30% vegetation cover to 70% in only one year. Factors including soil cover and slope were correlated with successful vegetation recovery. New information learned from the multi-year field data provided a finer scale context for understanding the effects of disasters, a novel contribution considering that the majority of previous work has been conducted at the broader scale using remote sensing. Spatial analysis revealed that restoration sites were mainly distributed in areas of suitable slopes and elevations, but a measurable proportion (30-40%) were located too far from the existing panda distribution area and too close to human settlements. The restoration project has thus far had limited direct effect on giant panda conservation, but has indirect effects on improving forest cover in areas previously affected by human disturbances. This study provides a useful reference for understanding conditions affecting forest recovery, which can inform decision-making surrounding the implementation of forest restoration projects and conservation of endangered species, not only in China but also around the world.

Brazil nut stock and harvesting at different spatial scales in southeastern Amazonia	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Evaluations of the effects of non-timber forest product (NTFP) extractive industries by traditional communities have focused on local effects, but effective conservation of species often requires evaluation at wider scales that can only be efficiently undertaken with the use of remote sensing. Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa seed) is one of the most important NTFP in the Amazon basin and has received considerable attention from researchers aiming to guarantee its sustainability. However, most studies evaluating the impacts of B. excelsa seed harvesting investigated only effects in harvested sites, and did not consider B. excelsa availability in the landscape, or patterns of harvesting at broader scales, which are critical to evaluate the viability of extraction and plan management practices. We used high-resolution satellite images associated with ground truthing, participative mapping with harvesters and harvest records, to evaluate abundance of B. excelsa in the territories of three Kayapo indigenous communities in southeastern Amazonia. This allowed us to obtain conservative estimates of the proportion of Brazil nut harvested by the Kayapo at scales appropriate to evaluate effects on stocks in the landscape and in harvested groves. B. excelsa groves are abundant in the Kayapo lands, but only about 30% of them are harvested. In recent years, the villagers have harvested from 7.2% to 43% of the seeds produced in harvested groves. These represent only 2.5-12.7% of total seeds estimated to have been produced within the Brazil nut-collection territories of those Kayapo villages. Our results show that the Kayapo have undertaken non-intensive Brazil nut harvesting at local and especially at landscape scales, which suggests that B. excelsa is currently not threatened by harvesting in the region and that there is still potential to expand commercial production in at least one of the sites. The application of similar multi-scale approaches in other sites and for other non-timber forest products would provide important information to evaluate their long term conservation, subsidize the development of management plans and help to guarantee the livelihoods of traditional communities.

Decadal time-scale monitoring of forest fires in Similipal Biosphere Reserve, India using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Analyzing the spatial extent and distribution of forest fires is essential for sustainable forest resource management. There is no comprehensive data existing on forest fires on a regular basis in Biosphere Reserves of India. The present work have been carried out to locate and estimate the spatial extent of forest burnt areas using Resourcesat-1 data and fire frequency covering decadal fire events (2004-2013) in Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The anomalous quantity of forest burnt area was recorded during 2009 as 1,014.7 km(2). There was inconsistency in the fire susceptibility across the different vegetation types. The spatial analysis of burnt area shows that an area of 34.2% of dry deciduous forests, followed by tree savannah, shrub savannah, and grasslands affected by fires in 2013. The analysis based on decadal time scale satellite data reveals that an area of 2,175.9 km(2) (59.6 % of total vegetation cover) has been affected by varied rate of frequency of forest fires. Fire density pattern indicates low count of burnt area patches in 2013 estimated at 1,017 and high count at 1,916 in 2004. An estimate of fire risk area over a decade identifies 12.2 km(2) is experiencing an annual fire damage. Summing the fire frequency data across the grids (each 1 km(2)) indicates 1,211 (26 %) grids are having very high disturbance regimes due to repeated fires in all the 10 years, followed by 711 grids in 9 years and 418 in 8 years and 382 in 7 years.

Remote sensing of crop residue and tillage practices: Present capabilities and future prospects	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Sustainable agricultural management is essential not only to maintain productivity of current farmlands, but also to conserve natural environments. Records of agricultural activities are required to assist rapid assessment of agricultural lands, and thus, designation of management plans and policies. By the 1980s, when unfavorable environmental impacts of conventional tillage practices were widely recognized, agronomists introduced conservation tillage to benefit soils and agricultural environments, and soon began programs to monitor adoption of conservation tillage practices. The role of remote sensing in acquiring this information has been increasing because remote sensing technologies can provide the broad scope and the ability to collect sequential imagery to estimate trends and patterns of adoption of alternative tillage practices. This review encompasses comparisons of remote sensing techniques with more conventional methods for surveying and estimating tillage status, applications of remote sensing technologies, data processing and analysis, validation and field data collection, impacts of terrain, spectral and spatial resolution, timing and temporal detail, and prospects of future instruments.

Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern in this region due to water quality issues interfering with the conservation of the whole ecosystem. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations can be extremely high (up to about 500 mg/m(3) in some cases) during cyanobacteria blooms, which are often associated with a surface accumulation of algae. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) was used to acquire 52 images covering the summers of 2004 to 2011. These images were analyzed to map Chl-a concentrations and the presence of scum using two different band ratio algorithms applied to atmospherically-corrected data. The results identify wind speed as the main driving factor in the surface accumulation of algae, as well as in the spatial distribution of Chl-a. The utility of microwave images was also assessed, as since any cloud cover obviously hampers the use of optical data. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images were collected synchronously with the MERIS data and the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) signal was corrected for the contribution of wind for the purposes of correlating the results with the MERIS-derived Chl-a concentrations. In general, there was a stepwise decrease in the NRCS for high values of Chl-a (>50 mg/m3) with wind speeds in the range of 2 to 6 m/s. Under these conditions, our results demonstrate that optical and microwave signals can be used in combination to improve our understanding of cyanobacteria blooming.

Quantification of morphometric characterization and prioritization for management planning in semi-arid tropics of India: A remote sensing and GIS approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Planning of watershed at micro-level is indispensable for sustainable development, particularly in the fragile semi-arid tropics. Morphometric characterization is important to recognize hydrological behavior of the basin for carrying out management strategies. Previous prioritization methods suffer from cavities in which uncertainties were associated with morphometric variables of watershed ecosystem. Keeping this in view, geospatial-statistical techniques were used for identifying critical and priority sub-watersheds in water scarce region of India. A novel Weighted Sum Analysis (WSA) technique was developed for ranking of each hydrological unit concerning the weightages obtained from morphometric parameters. Considering WSA approach, sub-watersheds were alienated into very high, high, medium, low and poor priority zones. The results illustrate that 51.66% of sub-watersheds are in the moderately to highly susceptible zones, which shows potential areas for preferential conservation works planning. The WSA is viable approach and will be useful to different stakeholders such as agriculturists and natural resources managers for better decisions making.

In the last decades, active management has stopped in most of these stands and management goals have changed towards nature conservation purposes. The aim of this work was: (1) to analyze stand dynamics and spontaneous regeneration processes taking place with increasing age in even-aged fir plantations; and (2) to discuss if the above processes may be useful for defining management approaches addressing such conservation purposes. The study was carried out in the Vallombrosa Forest (near Florence, Italy). The relationship between fir stand age and structural parameters was analyzed using inventory data. Gap dynamics were monitored between 1983 and 2007 based on remote sensing data. A field survey of a sample of gaps was carried out. Species composition and density of seedlings and saplings were analysed in relation to gap size and within-gap position. From 1983 to 2007 the number of gaps and their total area increased, following increasing stand age. Significant relationships (p < 0.01) were found between fir stand age and number of trees per hectare (r = -0.30), quadratic mean diameter (r = 0.65) and volume per hectare (r = 0.50). A layer of trees with DBH < 15 cm (composed by 15 different broadleaf species usually mixed with fir) was observed in fir stands with lower stand density. Gap size influenced the presence of young firs (seedlings and fir < 0.5 m), which were significantly more abundant in gaps < 200 m(2), but it had relatively limited influence on species diversity. Within-gap position did not affect the density of recruitments. Results indicate that the creation of small gaps (< 200 m(2)) in the canopy cover may simulate the natural dynamics of aged fir plantations in the Apennines and may be considered as a possible management option for their gradual transformation into mixed, naturally regenerating forests.

Nils			Quantitative analysis of woodpecker habitat using high-resolution airborne LiDAR estimates of forest structure and composition	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has the potential to radically alter the way researchers and managers collect data on wildlife-habitat relationships. To date, the technology has fostered several novel approaches to characterizing avian habitat, but has been limited by the lack of detailed LiDAR-habitat attributes relevant to species across a continuum of spatial grain sizes and habitat requirements. We demonstrate a novel three-step approach for using LiDAR data to evaluate habitat based on multiple habitat attributes and accounting for their influence at multiple grain sizes using federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW; Picoides borealis) foraging habitat data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA First, we used high density LiDAR data (10 returns/m(2)) to predict detailed forest attributes at 20-m resolution across the entire SRS using a complementary application of nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression and multiple linear regression models. Next, we expanded on previous applications of LiDAR by constructing 95% joint prediction confidence intervals to quantify prediction error at various spatial aggregations and habitat thresholds to determine a biologically and statistically meaningful grain size. Finally, we used aggregations of 20-m cells and associated confidence interval boundaries to demonstrate a new approach to produce maps of RCW foraging habitat conditions based on the guidelines described in the species' recovery plan. Predictive power (R-2) of regression models developed to populate raster layers ranged from 034 to 0.81, and prediction error decreased as aggregate size increased, but minimal reductions in prediction error were observed beyond 0.64-ha (4 x 4 20-m cells) aggregates. Mapping habitat quality while accounting for prediction error provided a robust method to determine the potential range of habitat conditions and specific attributes that were limiting in terms of the amount of suitable habitat. The sequential steps of our analytical approach provide a useful framework to extract detailed and reliable habitat attributes for a forest-dwelling habitat specialist, broadening the potential to apply LiDAR in conservation and management of wildlife populations.

Preliminary coastal vulnerability assessment for Pico Island (Azores)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					INTERNATIONAL COASTAL SYMPOSIUM DURBAN, KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA THE OYSTERBOX UMHLANGA	APR 13-18, 2014	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA					The SMARTPARKS project (PTDC/AAC-AMB/098786/2008), funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), aims at establishing a planning and management system for small island (SI) protected areas (PA). Diverging from traditional no-take zone protected areas this project strives to integrate human activities, economic and cultural development, and conservation objectives. Pico Island in the Azores archipelago was selected as a suitable case study site. Pico is a Natural Park with 35% of its area being classified as PAs. This paper presents the assessment of relative coastal vulnerability of Pico to erosion and coastal flooding in order to determine how best to manage the PAs with respects to coastal hazards. A Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) was developed based on remote sensing and fieldwork data whereby a set of physical coastal parameters, which serve as indicators of vulnerability, were obtained: type of cliff; exposure to swell/storm waves; outcrop flooded; and coastal defences. The CVI values were used to rate coastal segments into five classes ranging from extremely low to very high based on its relative degree of vulnerability. CVI will provide input into a decision support tool to facilitate effective planning and management on Pico Island Natural Park with the potential of adapting and extending this approach to the other SIs.

J	Tong, LG; Xu, XL; Fu, Y; Li, S				Tong, Laga; Xu, Xinliang; Fu, Ying; Li, Shuang			Wetland Changes and Their Responses to Climate Change in the "Three-River Headwaters" Region of China since the 1990s	ENERGIES												The wetland ecosystem in the "Three-River Headwaters" (TRH) region plays an irreplaceable role in water source conservation, run-off adjustment and biodiversity maintenance. In recent years, assessment of wetland resources affected by climate changes has aroused enormous attention, since it can further protect wetland resources and provide a scientific basis for decision makers. In this study, wetland changes and its response to climate changes in the TRH region from the early 1990s to 2012 were analyzed by remote sensing (RS) image interpretation and climate change trend analysis. The results showed that wetlands occupied 6.3% of the total land area in 2012, and swamps, streams & rivers and lakes were the dominant wetland types in the TRH region. Since the early 1990s, wetlands have undergone great changes, and total wetland area increased by 260.57 km(2) (1.17%). Lakes, reservoir & ponds took on continuous increasing trend, but swamps, streams & rivers had a continuous decreasing trend. On the other hand, the wetland area in the Yangtze River basin showed an overall increasing trend, while in the Yellow River and Langcang River basins, it decreased in general. The climate turned from Warm-Dry to Warm-Wet. The average temperature and precipitation increased by 0.91 degrees C and 101.99 mm, respectively, from 1990 to 2012, and the average humidity index (HI) increased by 0.06 and showing an upward trend and a shifting of the dividing line towards the northwest in both the areas of semi-humid and semi-arid zone. The correlation analysis of wetland changes with meteorological factors from 1990 to 2012 indicated that the regional humidity differences and the interannual variation trend, caused by the change of precipitation and evaporation, was the main driving factor for the dynamic variation of wetland change in the TRH region. In the general, the increase of HI in the THR region since the 1990s, especially in the western TRH region, contributed to wetland increase continuously. The conclusions of this study will provide some scientific references for the management and protection of wetlands in the TRH region, especially for restoration, reconstruction and conservation of degradation wetland.																	1996-1073					APR	2014	7	4					2515	2534		10.3390/en7042515								WOS:000336217000033

Sediment dynamics in shallow tidal basins: In situ observations, satellite retrievals, and numerical modeling in the Venice Lagoon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The morphological evolution of shallow tidal systems strongly depends on gradients in transport that control sediment erosion and deposition. A spatially refined quantitative description of suspended sediment patterns and dynamics is therefore a key requirement to address issues connected with dynamical trends, responses, and conservation of these systems. Here we use a combination of numerical models of sediment transport dynamics, high temporal resolution point observations, and high spatial resolution remote sensing data to overcome the intrinsic limitations of traditional monitoring approaches and to establish the robustness of numerical models in reproducing space-time suspended sediment concentration (SSC) patterns. The comparison of SSC distributions in the Venice Lagoon (Italy) computed with a numerical model with SSC retrievals from remote sensing data allows us to define the ability of the model to properly describe spatial patterns and gradients in the SSC fields. The use of point observations similarly allows us to constrain the model temporally, thus leading to a complete space-time evaluation of model abilities. Our results highlight the fundamental control exerted on sediment transport intensity and patterns by the sheltering effect associated with artificial and natural intertidal landforms. Furthermore, we show how the stabilizing effect of benthic vegetation is a main control of sediment dynamics at the system scale, confirming a notion previously established in the laboratory or at small field scales.

Landscape level analysis of disturbance regimes in protected areas of Rajasthan, India	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												There is an urgent need to identify the human influence on landscape as disturbance regimes was realized for prioritization of the protected areas. The present study has attempted to describe the landscape level assessment of fragmentation and disturbance index in protected areas of Rajasthan using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Geospatial analysis of disturbance regimes indicates 61.75% of the total PAs are under moderate disturbance index followed by 28.64% and 9.61% under low and high, respectively. Among the 28 protected areas National Chambal WLS, Jaisamand WLS, Kumbhalgarh WLS, Sawai Man Singh WLS, Kailadevi WLS and Bandh Baratha WLS are representing high level of disturbance. The present study has emphasized the moderate to low disturbance regimes in protected areas, which infer low biotic pressure and conservation effectiveness of PA network in Rajasthan. The spatial information generated on PAs is of valuable use for forest management and developing conseryation strategies.

J	Li, W; Qin, BQ; Zhu, GW				Li, Wei; Qin, Boqiang; Zhu, Guangwei			Forecasting short- term cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu, China, using a coupled hydrodynamic- algal biomass model	ECOHYDROLOGY												Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake of China, provides drinking water supply for five million people. Over the last 30years, the lake has suffered from serious cyanobacterial blooms that deteriorate drinking water quality and in some cases have led to serious water supply crises. For local government to respond quickly to the onset of a cyanobacterial bloom, it is crucial to forecast the probability, areas, and intensity of the bloom. In this paper, an attempt to forecast the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu is documented. The forecast is based on a short-term cyanobacterial bloom forecasting numerical model containing a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-algal biomass model and a probability of bloom occurrence forecasting model. The former model was based on solving the governing equations of the cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in shallow lakes. Unstructured mesh division was used to fit the irregular coastal boundaries where harmful blooms often happened. The finite volume method discretized the governing equations, and the conservation laws were preserved. To drive the model, the initial algae chlorophyll a concentrations were obtained from 18 automatic monitoring buoys and boat survey measurements. By combining calculation and prediction of the hydrological and meteorologic scenarios over the ensuing 3days, the dynamic distributions of the algae concentration scenarios in Lake Taihu were simulated. Blooming probabilities were then predicted by a forecast model that included the weight of algal biomass, wind velocity, and weather condition. The model was applied to predict the occurrences of the algae blooms of the next 3days in Lake Taihu during April to September in 2009 and 2010. Independent evaluations from remote sensing images and boat survey data showed that the accuracy of these bloom forecasts was more than 80%. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Countryside biogeography of Neotropical reptiles and amphibians	ECOLOGY												The future of biodiversity and ecosystem services depends largely on the capacity of human-dominated ecosystems to support them, yet this capacity remains largely unknown. Using the framework of countryside biogeography, and working in the Las Cruces system of Coto Brus, Costa Rica, we assessed reptile and amphibian assemblages within four habitats that typify much of the Neotropics: sun coffee plantations (12 sites), pasture (12 sites), remnant forest elements (12 sites), and a larger, contiguous protected forest (3 sites in one forest). Through analysis of 1678 captures of 67 species, we draw four primary conclusions. First, we found that the majority of reptile (60%) and amphibian (70%) species in this study used an array of habitat types, including coffee plantations and actively grazed pastures. Second, we found that coffee plantations and pastures hosted rich, albeit different and less dense, reptile and amphibian biodiversity relative to the 326-ha Las Cruces Forest Reserve and neighboring forest elements. Third, we found that the small ribbons of "countryside forest elements" weaving through farmland collectively increased the effective size of a 326-ha local forest reserve 16-fold for reptiles and 14-fold for amphibians within our 236-km(2) study area. Therefore, countryside forest elements, often too small for most remote sensing techniques to identify, are contributing similar to 95% of the available habitat for forest-dependent reptiles and amphibians in our largely human-dominated study region. Fourth, we found large and pond-reproducing amphibians to prefer human-made habitats, whereas small, stream-reproducing, and directly developing species are more dependent on forest elements. Our investigation demonstrates that tropical farming landscapes can support substantial reptile and amphibian biodiversity. Our approach provides a framework for estimating the conservation value of the complex working landscapes that constitute roughly half of the global land surface, and which are experiencing intensification pressure worldwide.

Land use has significant effects on the ecosystem structure and functions, even its services. Using the remote sensing (RS), geographical information system and ecological economy theory, this paper analyzed land use changes of different eco-economic functional areas in Manas River Basin during the period 1958-2006 using different stage RS images. This paper selects the evaluation method obtained by Costanza et al. and Xie Gaodi, and the ecological sensitivity coefficient analysis, which analyzed the variation characteristics of eco-service values of different eco-economic functional areas. The results showed that the land use pattern has changed greatly from 1958 to 2006. The area of farmland and industrial area increased rapidly, while the forest area, grassland, water area and unutilized area decreased greatly. The total eco-service value of the river basin decreased from 3,529.64 US$ x 10(6) in 1958 to 2,559.88 US$ x 10(6) in 2006. There was 27.47 % net loss of 969.76 US$ x 10(6). The eco-service values of various land use types in the study area were close to the regional real values and the results were credible. There existed apparent temporal and spatial changes in the eco-service values of different eco-economic functional areas, and this significant change in the eco-service values was driven by economic development. Consequently, in view of eco-economic characteristics and ecological issues of various eco-economic functional areas, relevant strategies of ecological conservation were proposed for enhancing the general eco-service value of the river basin and realizing the regional sustainable development.

Using remote sensing data to model European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) occurrence in a highly fragmented landscape in northwestern Spain	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												We model the occurrence of European wild rabbit in fragmented environments in a mountainous area of northwestern Spain (Gers-Xur,s Biosphere Reserve). We carried out a field survey by sampling the presence/absence of pellets in 237 plots (100 Au 100 m) selected at random below an altitude of 800 m. For modelling purposes, we considered eight predictors related to vegetation, topography, human influence and heterogeneity. We obtained vegetation and ecological predictors from land use/land cover maps derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images (acquired at the same time as the field data) and calculated vegetation indices by using a supervised classification method. We obtained topographical predictors from a Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) and used a generalized linear model to describe the occurrence of the European wild rabbit. The overall accuracy of the Landsat-derived map in Baixa Limia was 87.51 %, and the kappa coefficient was 0.85. The most parsimonious model included "grassland and crops", "mean slope", "distance to roads", "urban settlements" and "ecotone scrubland-forest". Five predictors were consequential, three of them with a positive sign for the presence of the species (scrub, urban settlements and ecotone scrubland-forest) and two with a negative sign (mean slope and distance to roads). The information on habitat requirements of European wild rabbit in the area provides a good framework for determining the habitat requirements of this keystone species in mountainous ecosystems in northwestern Iberian Peninsula.

The DRASTIC model can be applied in the evaluation of groundwater vulnerability to such pollution. The main purpose of using the DRASTIC model is to map groundwater susceptibility to pollution in different areas. However, this method has been used in various areas without modification, thereby disregarding the effects of pollution types and their characteristics. Thus, this technique must be standardized and be approved for applications in aquifers and particular types of pollution. In this study, the potential for the more accurate assessment of vulnerability to pollution is achieved by correcting the rates of the DRASTIC parameters. The new rates were calculated by identifying the relationships among the parameters with respect to the nitrate concentration in groundwater. The methodology was implemented in the Kerman plain in the southeastern region of Iran. The nitrate concentration in water from underground wells was tested and analyzed in 27 different locations. The measured nitrate concentrations were used to associate and correlate the pollution in the aquifer to the DRASTIC index. The Wilcoxon rank-sum nonparametric statistical test was applied to determine the relationship between the index and the measured pollution in Kerman plain. Also, the weights of the DRASTIC parameters were modified through the sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, the rates and weights were computed. The results of the study revealed that the modified DRASTIC model performs more efficiently than the traditional method for nonpoint source pollution, particularly in agricultural areas. The regression coefficients showed that the relationship between the vulnerability index and the nitrate concentration was 82 % after modification and 44 % before modification. This comparison indicated that the results of the modified DRASTIC of this region are better than those of the original method.

J	Frick, A; Tanneberger, F; Bellebaum, J				Frick, Annett; Tanneberger, Franziska; Bellebaum, Jochen			Model-Based Selection of Areas for the Restoration of Acrocephalus paludicola Habitats in NE Germany	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The global Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola, Vieillot, 1817) population has suffered a major decline due to the large-scale destruction of its natural habitat (fen mires). The species is at risk of extinction, especially in NE Germany/NW Poland. In this study, we developed habitat suitability models based on satellite and environmental data to identify potential areas for habitat restoration on which further surveys and planning should be focused. To create a reliable model, we used all Aquatic Warbler presences in the study area since 1990 as well as additional potentially suitable habitats identified in the field. We combined the presence/absence regression tree algorithm Cubist with the presence-only algorithm Maxent since both commonly outperform other algorithms. To integrate the separate model results, we present a new way to create a metamodel using the initial model results as variables. Additionally, a histogram approach was applied to further reduce the final search area to the most promising sites. Accuracy increased when using both remote sensing and environmental data. It was highest for the integrated metamodel (Cohen's Kappa of 0.4, P < 0.001). The final result of this study supports the selection of the most promising sites for Aquatic Warbler habitat restoration.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				APR	2014	53	4					728	738		10.1007/s00267-014-0234-x								WOS:000332949600002	24446053

A method for estimating colony sizes of Ad,lie penguins using remote sensing imagery	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are important predators of krill (Euphausia spp.) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) during summer, are a key indicator of the status of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and are therefore a focal species for the Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Ecosystem Monitoring Program. The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Ad,lie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Ad,lie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Ad,lie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2014	37	4					507	517		10.1007/s00300-014-1451-8								WOS:000332770800006

Increasing tree cover while losing diverse natural forests in tropical Hainan, China	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												To protect biodiversity and improve environmental conditions, China has invested billions of dollars in reforestation and payments for ecosystem service programs. Here, we examine the Sloping Land Conversion Program, the largest such program in the world and found that after 13 years of implementation at our study site, it has had negative impacts on natural tropical forests. GIS and remote sensing techniques revealed that both natural forests and natural shrub and grasslands were replaced by non-native monocultural plantations on Hainan Island, China, a key tropical biodiversity hotspot. Under current Chinese policy, these plantations are classified simply as "forests", with the assumption that they are equivalent to natural forests. This lack of a distinction in forest quality has led to substantial deforestation and plantation expansion, including encroachment into protected areas on Hainan. Additional social and economic drivers of these changes were identified by examining the participants in this program and their actions. Without a new ecologically based definition of forests and new goals for reforestation, such programs designed to improve ecosystem services, and forest quality may actually threaten remaining natural forests and other vegetation types in Hainan and in other areas of mainland China.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				APR	2014	14	2			SI		611	621		10.1007/s10113-013-0512-9								WOS:000333267700014						
J	Deb, S; Ahmed, A; Datta, D				Deb, Shovik; Ahmed, Akram; Datta, Debajit			An alternative approach for delineating eco-sensitive zones around a wildlife sanctuary applying geospatial techniques	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The dynamics, degradation, and conservation of forest ecosystems are matters of prime concerns worldwide at the present. Proper planning and management of a forest area are essentially needed to protect it from the grasp of burgeoning pressure of urban-industrial sprawl. Establishment of eco-sensitive zones (ESZs), which act as buffer areas around the core forests, is one of the key approaches towards achieving this goal. This paper deals with the applicability of geospatial techniques to identify the ESZ around an Indian wildlife sanctuary following the different rules and acts prescribed by the Government of India. Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the northeastern state of Tripura in India, has been selected here as a case study. Collected pieces of information on the distribution of biodiversity and human population in the area were also used to make the approach more holistic. As inferred from this study, remote sensing and geographical information systems were found to be easily implementable and time as well as cost-effective tools for this purpose with a distinct advantage of spatial as well as temporal accuracy in identifying the existing land use and land cover patterns in pilot assessments. However, the results indicated that only appropriate hybridization of field-based information on the biodiversity and ecological aspects of the forest as well as patterns of human interferences with the remote sensing and GIS-based data could make this approach more relevant in actual implementations.

J	Pan, JH; Wen, Y				Pan, Jinghu; Wen, Yan			Estimation of soil erosion using RUSLE in Caijiamiao watershed, China	NATURAL HAZARDS												Soil erosion is a serious environmental and production problem in China. In particular, natural conditions and human impact have made the Chinese Loess Plateau particularly prone to intense soil erosion area. To decrease the risk on environmental impacts, there is an increasing demand for sound, and readily applicable techniques for soil conservation planning in this area. This work aims at the assessment of soil erosion and its spatial distribution in hilly Loess Plateau watershed (northwestern China) with a surface area of approximately 416.31 km(2). This study was conducted at the Caijiamiao watershed to determine the erosion hazard in the area and target locations for appropriate initiation of conservation measures using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The erosion factors of RUSLE were collected and processed through a geographic information system (GIS)-based approach. The soil erosion parameters were evaluated in different ways: The R-factor map was developed from the rainfall data, the K-factor map was obtained from the soil map, the C-factor map was generated based on Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper image and spectral mixture analysis, and a digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 25 m was derived from topographic map at the scale of 1:50,000 to develop the LS-factor map. Support practice P factor was from terraces that exist on slopes where crops are grown. By integrating the six-factor maps in GIS through pixel-based computing, the spatial distribution of soil loss in the study area was obtained by the RUSLE model. The results showed that spatial average soil erosion at the watershed was 78.78 ton ha(-1) year(-1) in 2002 and 70.58 ton ha(-1) year(-1) in 2010, while the estimated sediment yield was found to be 327.96 x 10(4) and 293.85 x 10(4) ton, respectively. Soil erosion is serious, respectively, from 15 to 35 of slope degree, elevation area from 1,126 to 1,395 m, in the particular area of soil and water loss prevention. As far as land use is concerned, soil losses are highest in barren land and those in waste grassland areas are second. The results of the study provide useful information for decision maker and planners to take appropriate land management measures in the area. It thus indicates the RUSLE-GIS model is a useful tool for evaluating and mapping soil erosion quantitatively and spatially at a river watershed scale on a cell basis in Chinese Loess Plateau and for planning of conservation practices.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				APR	2014	71	3					2187	2205		10.1007/s11069-013-1006-2								WOS:000332025200049

China's Land-Use/cover Datasets (CLUDs) were updated regularly at 5-year intervals from the late 1980s to 2010, with standard procedures based on Landsat TMETM+ images. A land-use dynamic regionalization method was proposed to analyze major land-use conversions. The spatiotemporal characteristics, differences, and causes of land-use changes at a national scale were then examined. The main findings are summarized as follows. Land-use changes (LUCs) across China indicated a significant variation in spatial and temporal characteristics in the last 20 years (1990-2010). The area of cropland change decreased in the south and increased in the north, but the total area remained almost unchanged. The reclaimed cropland was shifted from the northeast to the northwest. The built-up lands expanded rapidly, were mainly distributed in the east, and gradually spread out to central and western China. Woodland decreased first, and then increased, but desert area was the opposite. Grassland continued decreasing. Different spatial patterns of LUC in China were found between the late 20th century and the early 21st century. The original 13 LUC zones were replaced by 15 units with changes of boundaries in some zones. The main spatial characteristics of these changes included (1) an accelerated expansion of built-up land in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, the southeastern coastal areas, the midstream area of the Yangtze River, and the Sichuan Basin; (2) shifted land reclamation in the north from northeast China and eastern Inner Mongolia to the oasis agricultural areas in northwest China; (3) continuous transformation from rain-fed farmlands in northeast China to paddy fields; and (4) effectiveness of the "Grain for Green" project in the southern agricultural-pastoral ecotones of Inner Mongolia, the Loess Plateau, and southwestern mountainous areas. In the last two decades, although climate change in the north affected the change in cropland, policy regulation and economic driving forces were still the primary causes of LUC across China. During the first decade of the 21st century, the anthropogenic factors that drove variations in land-use patterns have shifted the emphasis from one-way land development to both development and conservation. The "dynamic regionalization method" was used to analyze changes in the spatial patterns of zoning boundaries, the internal characteristics of zones, and the growth and decrease of units. The results revealed "the pattern of the change process," namely the process of LUC and regional differences in characteristics at different stages. The growth and decrease of zones during this dynamic LUC zoning, variations in unit boundaries, and the characteristics of change intensities between the former and latter decades were examined. The patterns of alternative transformation between the "pattern" and "process" of land use and the causes for changes in different types and different regions of land use were explored.																	1009-637X	1861-9568				APR	2014	24	2					195	210		10.1007/s11442-014-1082-6								WOS:000329619000001						
J	Scullion, JJ; Vogt, KA; Sienkiewicz, A; Gmur, SJ; Trujillo, C				Scullion, Jason J.; Vogt, Kristiina A.; Sienkiewicz, Alison; Gmur, Stephan J.; Trujillo, Cristina			Assessing the influence of land-cover change and conflicting land-use authorizations on ecosystem conversion on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Despite the many benefits natural forests provide, they are being lost worldwide at unsustainable rates as development frontiers expand. One approach to improving the efficacy of natural forest conservation efforts is to refine local forest conservation policies based on insights from the place-based study of conservation policies and land-use and land-cover change (LULC) dynamics. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, this research explores the dynamics of LULC and conservation policies on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios, Peru. The main objectives of this research are to evaluate the efficacy of designated conservation lands in a rapidly expanding frontier landscape and to assess the effect on ecosystem conversion of granting conflicting land-use designations, such as mining concessions, inside conservation areas. Using statistical matching and a GIS-based analysis of LULC, this research shows that for the period 2006-2011, designated conservation lands on the forest frontier of Madre de Dios significantly reduced ecosystem losses compared to non-conservation lands, but the effect was highly variable across conservation designations. Also, when present, conflicting land-use authorizations inside conservation areas, specifically overlapping mining and agricultural titles, eliminated the policy additionality of designating lands for conservation. This finding demonstrates that authorizing conflicting land-use rights inside conservation areas should be avoided to ensure intended land conservation outcomes. This case study also provides examples of how local forest conservation policies can be improved through detailed and frequent analyses of LULC and conservation policies, particularly in dynamic frontier landscapes where LULC and socio-economic conditions are rapidly changing.

Nest site selection of a primary hole-nesting passerine reveals means to developing sustainable forestry	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation affect populations worldwide. For example, many bird populations of boreal forests have declined due to intensive forestry. To target conservation actions for such species, determining the key factors that affect their habitat selection is essential. Remote sensing methods provide highly potential means to measure habitat variables over large areas. We aim at identifying the key-features of habitats by utilizing remote sensing data. As a case example, we study the nest site selection of a primary hole-nesting passerine, the willow tit Poecile montanus, in a managed forest landscape. Using presence-absence data, we determine the most important habitat characteristics of the nest sites for three spatial scales by generalized linear mixed effect models. Our results highlight the importance of the availability of nesting sites - standing decaying deciduous trees - in the nest site selection of P. montanus. It seems to prefer moist habitats with high densities of deciduous trees and to avoid open areas, but does not require mature or intact habitats. Most of the nest site selection seems to occur within small scales. In this case, remote sensing data alone was insufficient for producing reliable models, but adding information of an ecologically important feature from direct field surveys greatly improved model performances. For the conservation and maintenance of dead wood dependent species, changes in forestry practices are necessary to keep the key characteristics of the habitat. Most importantly, continuous availability of standing decaying wood should be secured.																	0908-8857	1600-048X				MAR	2014	45	2					187	196		10.1111/j.1600-048X.2013.00250.x								WOS:000332394000009

Our objective was to address this need using an array of bioclimatic and remotely sensed data sets representing vegetation properties and structure, and other aspects of the physical environment. We first build models of bird species richness across breeding bird survey (BBS) routes, and then spatially predict richness across the coterminous US at moderately high spatial resolution (1 km). Predictor variables were derived from various sources and maps of species richness were generated for four groups (guilds) of birds with different breeding habitat affiliation (forest, grassland, open woodland, scrub/shrub), as well as all guilds combined. Predictions of forest bird distributions were strong (R-2 = 0.85), followed by grassland (0.76), scrub/shrub (0.63) and open woodland (0.60) species. Vegetation properties were generally the strongest determinants of species richness, whereas bioclimatic and lidar-derived vertical structure metrics were of variable importance and dependent upon the guild type. Environmental variables (climate and the physical environment) were also frequently selected predictors, but canopy structure variables were not as important as expected based on more local to regional scale studies. Relatively sparse sampling of canopy structure metrics from the satellite lidar sensor may have reduced their importance relative to other predictor variables across the study domain. We discuss these results in the context of the ecological drivers of species richness patterns, the spatial scale of bird diversity analyses, and the potential of next generation space-borne lidar systems relevant to vegetation and ecosystem studies. This study strengthens current understanding of bird species-climate-vegetation relationships, which could be further advanced with improved canopy structure information across spatial scales.

J	Lyons, Y				Lyons, Youna			Prospects for satellite imagery of insular features and surrounding marine habitats in the South China Sea	MARINE POLICY												This paper investigates the extent to which remote sensing data can contribute to the management of two parallel crises in the South China Sea (SCS); first the ongoing disputes related to islands and related maritime boundaries and second the degradation of the marine environment and the decrease in fish stocks. It demonstrates that remote sensing surveys are the only means to lawfully collect independent and verifiable geographic data on the disputed features without the need to consult all the claimants and thereby add to regional frictions and tensions. These surveys can contribute to the determination of whether these features are submerged or above water at high tide and what their physical characteristics are. This would inform the application of the Law of the Sea and help determine entitlements to maritime zones and thus access to resources. The other category of uses for remote sensing surveys which is explored is the identification and classification of marine habitats and the building of a biogeographic platform. This paper shows the limits created by unavoidable uncertainties in the interpretation of satellite imagery. However, many benefits outweigh the downsides: the potential for national and regional marine spatial planning, for the prioritization of marine environments in need of management, for the implementation by the States bordering the SCS of the international treaties which they have ratified and for ecological monitoring.

J	Miller, PI; Christodoulou, S				Miller, Peter I.; Christodoulou, Stelios			Frequent locations of oceanic fronts as an indicator of pelagic diversity: Application to marine protected areas and renewables	MARINE POLICY												Frequent locations of thermal fronts in UK shelf seas were identified using an archive of 30,000 satellite images acquired between 1999 and 2008, and applied as a proxy for pelagic diversity in the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Networks of MPAs are required for conservation of critical marine habitats within Europe, and there are similar initiatives worldwide. Many pelagic biodiversity hotspots are related to fronts, for example cetaceans and basking sharks around the Isle of Man, Hebrides and Cornwall, and hence remote sensing can address this policy need in regions with insufficient species distribution data. This is the first study of UK Continental Shelf front locations to use a 10-year archive of full-resolution (1.1 km) AVHRR data, revealing new aspects of their spatial and seasonal variability. Frontal locations determined at sea or predicted by ocean models agreed closely with the new frequent front maps, which also identified many additional frontal zones. These front Maps were among the most widely used datasets in the recommendation of UK MPAs, and would be applicable to other geographic regions and to other policy drivers such as facilitating the deployment of offshore renewable energy devices with minimal environmental impact.

J	Ahmad, MD; Kirby, M; Islam, MS; Hossain, MJ; Islam, MM				Ahmad, Mobin-ud Din; Kirby, Mac; Islam, Mohammad Shahidul; Hossain, Md Jakir; Islam, Md Masbahul			Groundwater Use for Irrigation and its Productivity: Status and Opportunities for Crop Intensification for Food Security in Bangladesh	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Bangladesh has a large and growing population that will demand more food and place greater pressure on resources. Dry season irrigated Boro rice production is important for national food security. Dry season irrigation mainly uses groundwater, but the extent of its use is not well known. We assessed groundwater use and water productivity of Boro in the northwest region of Bangladesh using remote sensing based energy balance modelling, crop classification and secondary statistics. The energy balance modelling shows a large spatial variation in the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from about 325 to 470 mm, with an overall spatial average of 365 mm during dry season. The estimated values of ETa correspond well with independent values from field and regional scale soil and water balance modelling results. From spatial estimates of ETa and effective rainfall, we computed regional net groundwater use for Boro production in 2009 as 2.4 km(3). Groundwater is being used unsustainably in some areas, and a spatial time series (1990 to 2010) of pre- and post-monsoon groundwater depth changes in the northwest region of Bangladesh suggests that, with the current level of groundwater use, falling groundwater levels may pose a long term threat to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in much of the region. Boro water productivity varies from 0.95 to 1.35 kg/m(3), allowing the identification of high performing "bright" and low performing "hot" spots and the development of strategies to reduce crop yield/productivity gaps and ensure future food security.

Information regarding island-specific nest site selection and habitat characteristics is important when considering the management needs of the species, including control of invasive plants and protection from introduced predators. Extensive search efforts, using nocturnal vocalization and visual surveys, resulted in locating 71 nesting burrows on the Island of Lana'i. Logistic regression was used to examine the influence of elevation, planar curvature, percent slope, canopy cover, and vegetation type on nest site locations. The top model in predicting Hawaiian Petrel nest site selection was influenced by increasing slopes, an understory dominated by native vegetation, and open canopy. The top model was supported by a model weight (w(1)) of 0.53, with the second model holding most of the remaining weight (w(1) = 0.19) and including elevation as a predictor. Native understory vegetation, dominated by Uluhe ferns (Dicranopteris linearis and Diplopterygium pinnatum), may provide some protection from introduced mammalian predators. Using high resolution imagery and remote sensing techniques, we quantified the remaining native vegetation on Lana'i. With less than 300 ha of upper elevation (> 600 m) native forest remaining, management priority should focus on reducing the spread of invasive vegetation that is quickly dominating nearby Hawaiian Petrel nest sites.																	1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2014	37	1					43	51		10.1675/063.037.0107								WOS:000332813100004						
J	Buttger, H; Nehls, G; Stoddard, P				Buettger, Heike; Nehls, Georg; Stoddard, Penny			The history of intertidal blue mussel beds in the North Frisian Wadden Sea in the 20th century: Can we define reference conditions for conservation targets by analysing aerial photographs?	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Conservation decisions often rely on defining a reference status for habitat and species to enable targets to be set and progress measured. Long-lasting and continual anthropogenic impacts on habitats and species make the setting of undisturbed reference values such as diversity, distribution, population size or other ecological characteristics, difficult. In turn this hampers assessment of ecological status. Within the Wadden Sea, intertidal blue mussel beds are important biogenic structures which can be clearly defined from the surrounding flats. As mussel beds are highly productive habitats, they are considered as biological quality indicators for coastal waters. Nonetheless the reference status provokes controversy in discussions between policymakers, stakeholders and researchers. In order to build on existing knowledge of intertidal blue mussel beds in the North Frisian Wadden Sea, we analysed aerial photographs from the 1930s, 1958, 1989, 1998 and 2010. We supplemented this remote sensing data with annual monitoring data from 1999 to 2009 obtained from analysis of aerial photographs and field surveys. Results show a generally high persistency of blue mussel beds likely over eight decades, although sites were probably not permanent throughout the time period and their areal extent had changed. Mussel beds occur mainly on the east side of the islands which provide shelter against storms from the west. Studies of aerial photographs for the 1930s and 1958 demonstrate the importance of historical data to an assessment of the current status of the beds. In particular they help assess the distribution and extent of mussel beds over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Newman, ME; McLaren, KP; Wilson, BS				Newman, Minke E.; McLaren, Kurt P.; Wilson, Byron S.			Assessing deforestation and fragmentation in a tropical moist forest over 68 years; the impact of roads and legal protection in the Cockpit Country, Jamaica	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Historical data on landuse changes are important for interpreting the current status of natural systems such as forests. Analyses of road network dynamics can be particularly useful as network expansion is often a precursor to and an indicator of increased human activity. Legal protection is often seen as the most viable option available for protecting natural forests; but over the past decade, its effectiveness has been questioned. We assessed the impact of roads and the designation of a forest reserve on deforestation and forest fragmentation in a tropical moist forest, Cockpit Country, Jamaica, from 1942 to 2010. Specifically, we classified multi-temporal images (black and white aerial photographs, IKONOS and Geo-Eye images) using an object based image analysis and we included a vector of digitized roads for each year of assessment during the classification process. We then conducted a fragmentation analysis of the classified images and assessed the relationship between road density and several fragmentation metrics over time, and the spatial influence of the reserves (presence/absence) and roads (Euclidean distance from roads) on deforestation and several fragmentation metrics using generalized linear models. Between 1942 and 2010, road density nearly doubled (from 0.67 km/km(2) to 1.22 km/km2), with significant increases occurring within forest reserves, and was significantly related to the area-weighted mean shape index of the forest (forest patches became more regularly shaped and linear). Initially, relatively high deforestation rates and high levels of fragmentation between 1942 and 1961 were likely related to the large increase in road density. Deforestation and forest fragmentation were more likely to occur closer to roads over all time periods, and the magnitude/significance of this relationship peaked in subsequent time periods after road density doubled; but in the final time period, its influence declined. Legal protection afforded to the forest in the 1950s and 1960s coincided with an increase in total and core forest area and a reduction in deforestation rate, and deforestation and forest fragmentation were significantly lower inside the reserve. Therefore, the Forest Reserves were initially effective; however, their effectiveness waned after 1980. Increased deforestation and fragmentation in the 1980s and the 2000s indicate a more complex pattern of human encroachment, as these changes do not appear to have been influenced by changes to the road network, or by the presence of the Forest Reserves. Further research into the factors influencing human use of these forested areas is needed for effective management of the area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic connectivity of temporary wetlands in the southern Great Plains	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												We quantified fluctuations in the status of individual patches (wetlands) in supporting connectivity within a network of playas, temporary wetlands of the southern Great Plains of North America that are loci for regional biodiversity. We used remote sensing imagery to delineate the location of surface waters in >8,000 playa basins in a similar to 31,900 km(2) portion of Texas and quantified connectivity in this region from 2007 to 2011. We ranked playas as stepping-stones, cutpoints, and hubs at different levels of environmental conditions (regionally wet, dry, and average periods of precipitation) for dispersal distances ranging from 0.5 to 34 km, representing a range of species' vagilities, to provide baseline dynamics within an area likely to experience disrupted connectivity due to anthropogenic activities. An individual playa's status as a stepping-stone, cutpoint, or hub was highly variable over time (only a single playa was a top 20 stepping-stone, cutpoint, or hub in >50 % of all of the dates examined). Coalescence of the inundated playa network usually occurred at >= 10 km dispersal distance and depended on wetland density, indicating that critical thresholds in connectivity arose from synergistic effects of dispersal ability (spatial scale) and wet playa occurrence (a function of precipitation). Organisms with dispersal capabilities limited to <10 km routinely experienced effective isolation during our study. Connectivity is thus a dynamic emergent landscape property, so management to maintain connectivity for wildlife within ephemeral habitats like inundated playas will need to move beyond a patch-based focus to a network focus by including connectivity as a dynamic landscape property.

Characterizing Shorea robusta communities in the part of Indian Terai landscape	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Shorea robusta Gaertn. f. (Sal) is one of the important timber-yielding plants in India, which dominates the vegetation of Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh state in India forming various communities based on its associations. The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled 'Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and GIS'. Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km(2). Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km(2)), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km(2)), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km(2)) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km(2)). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests. Community level information could be used monitoring the status as well as for micro level conservation and planning of the Sal forests in Terai Landscape of Uttar Pradesh.				matin, shafique/F-2111-2015	matin, shafique/0000-0002-8533-2148; CHITALE, VISHWAS/0000-0001-8661-8204												1007-662X	1993-0607				MAR	2014	25	1					121	128		10.1007/s11676-013-0396-z								WOS:000330202600014

Dead component of grasslands, including litter and standing dead material as the accumulated phytomass of grassland productivity from previous years, is a primary connection in nutrient cycles in grasslands, and also conserves soil moisture and redistributes the grassland surface temperature. However, unlike green vegetation, it is hard to estimate the dead component with remote sensing approaches because the spectral signal of dead materials is similar to that of bare soil or soil crust (moss and lichen), with the only difference in the shortwave infrared region near 2000 nm. In the literature, the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), an index based on hyperspectral imagery, is the most popular index for assessing dead cover or dead biomass. However, hyperspectral imagery is still not available for most grasslands worldwide. Therefore, a method to assess dead component using multispectral band imagery (e.g. Landsat imagery in this study) is needed. Grasslands National Park (GNP) in the southern part of Saskatchewan, Canada, has a large amount of accumulated dead vegetation because of long term conservation actions, which makes it a good study area for this project. This study aims to explore the relation between NDVI and dead cover, to investigate how different amounts of dead material change the relation of total biomass and NDVI, and also to test the potential to estimate dead cover using multispectral images. The results show that NDVI and dead cover have positive relationship when dead cover is less than 20%, no correlation when dead cover is between 20 and 80%, and significant negative relation when dead cover is more than 80%; further, the relation of total biomass and NDVI also changes with the same thresholds. The results also indicate that the dead component can be estimated with multispectral images using Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) or Normalized Difference water index (NDWI), but the relationships are highly influenced by bare soil and soil crust.

However, lack of proper management has resulted in the closure of various fisheries, such as the Calico scallop, Argopecten ventricosus, in 1994. One of the main challenges for the management of coastal resources is the selection of critical habitats for conservation considering the economic activities of the communities associated with them. This study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing to assess the roll of rhodoliths and Sargassum spp. as critical habitats in Bahia Concepcion for endangered and commercial species. Underwater surveys, on 72 randomly selected sites within the bay, were conducted to characterize the shallow benthic habitats, fish and invertebrate species abundance and richness during the spring of 2011. Analyses show that rhodoliths are important for the invertebrate assemblages and for at least 4 species protected under the Mexican law, NOM-059, for threatened species. Sargassum spp. and seagrass beds are also relevant for diversity but their annual life cycle limits the time when these are available as habitat for other species. GIS tools proved an innovative and effective method to provide essential information to protect critical habitats such as rhodoliths, Sargassum spp. and seagrasses, for the recovery and conservation of diversity.																	0181-1568	1776-0984				FEB	2014	35	1					49	65		10.7872/crya.v35.iss1.2014.49								WOS:000338762100005

Remote sensing and modeling are often used to estimate river characteristics over large areas, but the uncertainties associated with these estimates and their dependence on the physical characteristics of the segments and their catchments are seldom quantified. Using test data with varying degrees of independence, we derived analytical models of the uncertainty associated with estimates of upstream catchment area (CA), segment slope, and mean annual discharge for all river segments of a digital representation of the hydrographic network of France. Although there were strong relationships between our test data and estimates at the scale of France, there were also large relative local uncertainties, which varied with the physical characteristics of the segments and their catchments. Discharge and CA were relatively uncertain where discharge was low and catchments were small. Discharge uncertainty also increased in catchments with large rainfall events and low minimum temperature. The uncertainty of segment slope was strongly related to segment length. Our uncertainty models were consistent across large regions of France, suggesting some degree of generality. Their analytical formulation should facilitate their use in large-scale ecological studies and simulation models.

PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have facilitated the generation of very high resolution (VHR) environmental data. Exploratory studies suggested that, if used in species distribution models (SDMs), these data should enable modelling species' micro-habitats and allow improving predictions for fine-scale biodiversity management. In the present study, we tested the influence, in SDMs, of predictors derived from a VHR digital elevation model (DEM) by comparing the predictive power of models for 239 plant species and their assemblages fitted at six different resolutions in the Swiss Alps. We also tested whether changes of the model quality for a species is related to its functional and ecological characteristics. Refining the resolution only contributed to slight improvement of the models for more than half of the examined species, with the best results obtained at 5 m, but no significant improvement was observed, on average, across all species. Contrary to our expectations, we could not consistently correlate the changes in model performance with species characteristics such as vegetation height. Temperature, the most important variable in the SDMs across the different resolutions, did not contribute any substantial improvement. Our results suggest that improving resolution of topographic data only is not sufficient to improve SDM predictions - and therefore local management - compared to previously used resolutions (here 25 and 100 m). More effort should be dedicated now to conduct finer-scale in-situ environmental measurements (e.g. for temperature, moisture, snow) to obtain improved environmental measurements for fine-scale species mapping and management.

Rapid expansion of croplands in Chihuahua, Mexico threatens declining North American grassland bird species	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Grasslands are one of the most imperiled ecosystems worldwide. Conversion to cropland and desertification, including shrub encroachment, are primary factors behind the loss of temperate grasslands across the globe. Governments and conservation organizations in North America have identified the highest priority grasslands from Canada to Mexico in an effort to conserve grassland biodiversity, particularly migratory birds. Twenty-nine of 33 (88%) grassland-obligate bird species breeding in western North America's Great Plains are migratory and 90% of these overwinter in the Chihuahuan Desert. The 2.7 M ha Valles Centrales is a region of northern Mexico comprised of desert shrublands, mountains and grassland valleys. It supports wintering populations of 28 migratory grassland bird species from the Great Plains, in addition to threatened and endangered species in Mexico such as Aplomado Falcon (Falco femoralis), Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana mexicana) and others. Using remote sensing, we documented a 6.04% annual rate of cropland expansion in the Valles Centrales from 2006 to 2011, resulting in a loss of 69,240 ha of valley-bottom grasslands and shrub lands. Open grasslands are the principle habitat for most declining, grassland-obligate bird species. Expansion of center-pivot irrigated cropland was the primary driver of grassland loss. The area cleared for agriculture, as determined via remote sensing, exceeded the amount of land that had been permitted for land-use change to cropland, according to government records, by >2000%. As a consequence of this habitat loss, we estimate the winter carrying capacity for 28 species of grassland birds in this region has been reduced by approximately 355,142 individual birds. At the current rate, the ongoing expansion of ground-water irrigated cropland could eliminate the remaining low-slope valley bottom grasslands from the Valles Centrales region by 2025. Cumulative grassland losses in the Chihuahuan Desert could have severe impacts on global populations of declining migratory grassland birds, as well as several threatened and endangered species. Our findings demand an urgent call to action by governments and responsible resource management agencies to work with the agricultural sectors to address land use change, sustainable agriculture and grassland ecosystem services in this globally-important region for grassland birds and biodiversity.

These forests are home to high floral and faunal diversity including a number of local and regional endemics. The forests of the central Menabe have been classified as conservation hot-spots. However, pressure on these forests is strong and deforestation continues on a large scale. To quantify recent forest loss, we used a series of satellite images (1973-2010) for estimating annual deforestation rates. The overall rate was 0.67 %, but it accelerated during certain periods to over 1.5 % with a maximum of 2.55 % per year between 2008 and 2010. Not all areas within the forest block of the central Menabe are affected similarly. Areas surrounding existing clearings show the highest losses of largely undisturbed forest. If deforestation continues at the same rate as during the last years, 50 % of the 1973 forest cover will be gone within the next 11-37 years.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				FEB	2014	14	1			SI		157	166		10.1007/s10113-013-0475-x								WOS:000333261900014

In this paper I explore the power of maps in relation to the technical methods employed and the political context of their production. The internal power of maps is realised in the actions taken by cartographers themselves when making maps, while the external power of maps is both realised by the patrons of cartography and wielded through the use of cartographic products as agents for natural resource management, in particular for defining conservation strategies. An Australian case study of coastal mapping is used to examine the methods employed and motivation behind map production through a series of recent remote sensing initiatives to map Lord Howe Island, New South Wales. Through this case study I explore the subjectivities associated with the placement of boundaries in the scientific practice of cartography. I argue that a new epistemological reading of maps is necessary, as sources of information on socio-politically constructed worlds as much as the phenomenological world of objects. Such a reading is particularly important given recent advances in technologies, such as remote sensing, that are increasingly used to inform coastal management, and which propagate in profound new ways the power of maps.

J	Yang, F; Matsushita, B; Yang, W; Fukushima, T				Yang, Fan; Matsushita, Bunkei; Yang, Wei; Fukushima, Takehiko			Mapping the human footprint from satellite measurements in Japan	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Due to increasing global urbanization and climate change, the quantification of "human footprints" has become an urgent goal in the fields of biodiversity conservation and regional environment management. A human footprint is defined as the impact of a particular human activity on the Earth's surface, which can be represented mainly by impervious surfaces (related to industry and urbanization) and cropland (related to agriculture). Here we present a method called sorted temporal mixture analysis with post-classification (STMAP) for mapping impervious surfaces and cropland simultaneously at the subpixel level to fill the demand for precise human footprint information on a national scale. The STMAP method applies a four-endmember sorted temporal mixture analysis to provide the initial fractions of evergreen forests, deciduous forests, cropland, and impervious surfaces as a first step. Endmembers are selected from the sorted temporal profiles of the MODIS-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as guided by a principal component analysis. The yearly maximum land surface temperatures and averaged stable nighttime light are then statistically analyzed to provide the thresholds for post-classification to further separate cropland from deciduous forest and bare land from impervious surface. As the four outputs of STMAP, the fractions of forest, cropland, impervious surfaces and bare land are derived. We used the reference maps of impervious surfaces and cropland obtained from the Landsat/TM and ALOS precise land-use/land-cover map at the subpixel level to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, respectively. Historical satellite images with high spatial resolution were used to further evaluate the cropland results derived with the STMAP method. The results showed that the STMAP method has promising accuracy for estimating impervious surfaces and cropland in Japan. The root mean square errors obtained with the STMAP method were 6.3% for the estimation of impervious surfaces and 9.8% for the estimation of cropland. Our findings can extend the applications of remote sensing technologies in ecological research and environment management on a large scale.

Rainwater harvesting planning using geospatial techniques and multicriteria decision analysis	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Growing water scarcity and global climate change call for more efficient alternatives of water conservation; rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the most promising alternative among others. However, the assessment of RWH potential and the selection of suitable sites for RWH structures are very challenging for the water managers, especially on larger scales. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a fairly robust methodology for evaluating RWH potential and identifying sites/zones for different RWH structures using geospatial and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a case study. The remote sensing data and conventional field data were used to prepare desired thematic layers using ArcGIS(C) software. Distributed Curve Number method was used to calculate event-based runoffs, based on which annual runoff potential and runoff coefficient maps were generated in the GIS (geographic information system) environment. Thematic layers such as slope, drainage density, and runoff coefficient and their features were assigned suitable weights and then they were integrated in a GIS to generate a RWH potential map of the study area. Zones suitable for different RWH structures were also identified, together with suitable sites for constructing recharge structures (check dams and percolation tanks along the streams). It was found that the study area can be classified into three RWH potential zones: (a) 'good' (241 km(2)), (b) 'moderate' (476 km(2)), and (c) 'poor' (287 km(2)). About 3% of the study area (30 km(2)) is suitable for constructing farm ponds, while percolation tanks (on the ground) can be constructed in about 2.7% of the area (27 km(2)). Of the 83 sites identified for the recharge structures, 32 recharge sites are specially suited to the inhabitants because of their proximity. It is concluded that the integrated geospatial and MCDA techniques offer a useful and powerful tool for the planning of rainwater harvesting at a basin or sub-basin scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Van Den Hoek, J; Ozdogan, M; Burnicki, A; Zhu, AX				Van Den Hoek, Jamon; Ozdogan, Mutlu; Burnicki, Amy; Zhu, A-Xing			Evaluating forest policy implementation effectiveness with a cross-scale remote sensing analysis in a priority conservation area of Southwest China	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												China's Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP) and Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), introduced in 1998 and 1999, respectively, are integral parts of the world's largest reforestation effort. Statereported forest cover data indicate effective policy implementation through net forest cover expansion but overlook the scale-dependence of and spatial variation in forest cover change patterns and also lack reliable data on small-scale and illegal logging. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty over the spatial distribution of forest cover change and ultimately the policies' effectiveness at increasing forest cover. This research uses Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery-derived multitemporal Tasseled Cap variables and a decision tree classifier to map short- and long-term forest cover change across three administrative levels in the priority conservation area of Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province. Results indicate a 73% reduction in the rate of forest cover loss and a more than doubled rate of forest cover gain from 1990-1999 to 1999-2009 across the prefecture, both of which support a positive assessment of policy implementation. However, prefectural results are countered by spatially disparate forest cover gain and loss trends at the county- and township-level in the decade following the policies' introductions. Further, more than half of Diqing's townships, mainly those in the prefecture's south where tourism has been rapidly developing, saw continued net forest cover loss attributable to small-scale timber harvesting for tourism-driven construction. This research thus exposes cross-scale spatially disparate forest cover change indicative of highly differentiated policy implementation effectiveness, and shows the pattern by which regional development has redirected, rather than reduced, forest cover loss, contrary to the goals of the NFPP and SLCP.

They are of crucial importance in the global water cycle and climatic dynamics. Nowadays, wetlands are the most threatened land cover type, nevertheless their spatial distribution and ecological functions are poorly documented. Despite the need for more detailed information, wetland mapping is a rare activity. Few data are available mainly because of the complexity of obtaining good field data. We therefore propose a method based on multi-sensor imagery analysis to characterize land cover patterns of the second largest wetland area of the world (The Cuvette Centrale of the Congo River Basin). The time series of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images are used to map land cover types based on their phenological differences. Flooded areas in the Congo basin have been mapped during different seasons using L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) imagery. The associated model has been improved upon by the addition of elevation data as well as mean canopy heights acquired with light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data. The result of this study is the first detailed spatial distribution of four forested wetland types within the Cuvette Centrale of the Congo River Basin. This study demonstrates that the spatial organization of the floodplain landscape depends on the extent of flooding. The results also show that land cover phenology is closely related to the time period of flooding and solar intensity for this region, similarly to what is observed in the extensive floodplain of the Amazon basin.

Sudden large disturbances (e.g., typhoons and earthquakes) can have a significant and immediate impact on landscapes and ecosystem services. This study explored how precipitation variation (PV) and land use/land cover (LULC) changes caused by multiple disturbances can cumulatively impact ecosystem functioning in the Chenyulan watershed in central Taiwan. We simulated four ecosystem services (water yield production, water purification, soil conservation, carbon storage) and biodiversity using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to analyze the spatiotemporal changes and obtain information regarding changes in the ecosystem. Our results indicate that the Chi-Chi earthquake had the greatest impact on the ecosystem. Specifically, the ecosystem was altered by the earthquake and could no longer absorb disturbances of a similar magnitude as before the earthquake. By differentiating the impacts of the PV and LULC changes on ecosystem services and biodiversity, we observe that the PV had a stronger impact on water yield and soil conservation, whereas the LULC change had a stronger impact on water purification. Our results also suggest that a comprehensive ecosystem management plan should consider the cumulative and hierarchical context of disturbance regimes to prevent reductions in ecological variability and ecosystem resilience, particularly in areas that are more sensitive to large disturbances. In this way, ecosystem resilience may be maintained at a level sufficient to preserve ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services in the event of unexpected large-scale environmental disturbances.

However, detailed data about forest habitat characteristics across large areas are often incomplete due to difficulties associated with field sampling methods. To overcome this limitation we employed a nationally available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing dataset to develop variables describing forest landscape structure across a large environmental gradient in Switzerland. Using a model species indicative of structurally rich mountain forests (hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia), we tested the potential of such variables to predict species occurrence and evaluated the additional benefit of LiDAR data when used in combination with traditional, sample plot-based field variables. We calibrated boosted regression trees (BRT) models for both variable sets separately and in combination, and compared the models' accuracies. While both field-based and LiDAR models performed well, combining the two data sources improved the accuracy of the species' habitat model. The variables retained from the two datasets held different types of information: field variables mostly quantified food resources and cover in the field and shrub layer, LiDAR variables characterized heterogeneity of vegetation structure which correlated with field variables describing the understory and ground vegetation. When combined with data on forest vegetation composition from field surveys, LiDAR provides valuable complementary information for encompassing species niches more comprehensively. Thus, LiDAR bridges the gap between precise, locally restricted field-data and coarse digital land cover information by reliably identifying habitat structure and quality across large areas.

J	Kaba, E; Philpot, W; Steenhuis, T				Kaba, Essayas; Philpot, William; Steenhuis, Tammo			Evaluating suitability of MODIS-Terra images for reproducing historic sediment concentrations in water bodies: Lake Tana, Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Government and NGO funded conservation programs are being implemented in developing countries with the potential benefit of reduced sediment inflow into fresh water lakes. However, these claims are difficult to verify due to limited historical sediment concentration data in lakes and rivers. Remote sensing can potentially aid in monitoring sediment concentration. With almost daily availability over the past ten years and consistent atmospheric correction applied to the images, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter images are potential resources capable of monitoring future concentrations and reconstructing historical sediment concentration records. In this paper, site-specific relationships are developed between reflectance in near-infrared (NIR) images and three factors: total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and Secchi depth for Lake Tana near the mouth of the Gumara River. The first two sampling campaigns on November 27, 2010 and May 13, 2011 are used in calibration. Reflectance in the NIR varies linearly with turbidity (R-2 = 0.89) and TSS (R-2 = 0.95). Secchi depth fit best to an exponential relation with R-2 of 0.74. The relationships are validated using a third sample set collected on November 7, 2011 with RMSE of 11 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) for Turbidity, 16.5 mg l(-1) for TSS and 0.12 meters for Secchi depth. The MAE was 10% for TSS, 14% for turbidity and 0.1% for Secchi depth. Using the relationship for TSS, a 10-year time series of sediment concentration in Lake Tana near the Gumara River was plotted. It was found that after the severe drought of 2002 and 2003 the concentration in the lake increased significantly. The results showed that MODIS images are potential cost effective tools to monitor suspended sediment concentration and obtain a past history of concentration for evaluating the effect of best management practices.

Measuring and predicting abundance and dynamics of habitat for piping plovers on a large reservoir	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Measuring habitat and understanding habitat dynamics have become increasingly important for wildlife conservation. Using remotely-sensed data, we developed procedures to measure breeding habitat abundance for the federally listed piping plover (Charadrius melodus) at Lake Sakakawea, North Dakota, USA. We also developed a model to predict habitat abundance based on past and projected water levels, vegetation colonization rates, and topography. Previous studies define plover habitat as flat areas (<= 10% slope) with <= 30% obstruction of bare substrate. Compared to ground-based data, remotely-sensed habitat classifications (<= 30/>30% bare-substrate obstruction) were 76% correct and omission and commission errors were equal. Due to water level fluctuations, habitat abundance varied markedly among years (1986-2009) ranging from 9 to 5195 ha. The proportion bare substrate declined with the number of years since a contour was inundated until 5 years (beta) over cap = -0.65, SE= 0.05), then it stabilized near zero, and the decline varied by shoreline segment (5, 50, and 95 percentile were (beta) over cap = -0.19, SE= 0.05, (beta) over cap = -0.63, SE = 0.05, and (beta) over cap = 0.91, SE = 0.05, respectively). Years since inundated predicted habitat abundance well at shoreline segments (R-2= 0.77), but it predicted better for the whole lake (R-2= 0.86). The vastness and dynamics of plover habitat on Lake Sakakawea suggest that this is a key area for conservation of this species. Model-based habitat predictions can benefit resource conservation because they can (1) form the basis for a sampling stratification, (2) help allocate monitoring efforts among areas, and (3) help inform management through simulations or what-if scenarios.

J	Cord, AF; Klein, D; Mora, F; Dech, S				Cord, Anna F.; Klein, Doris; Mora, Franz; Dech, Stefan			Comparing the suitability of classified land cover data and remote sensing variables for modeling distribution patterns of plants	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Given the rapid loss of biodiversity worldwide and the resulting impacts on ecosystem functions and services, we more than ever rely on current and spatially continuous assessments of species distributions for biodiversity conservation and sustainable land management. Over the last decade, the usefulness of categorical land cover data to account for the human-induced degradation, transformation and loss of natural habitat in species distribution models (SDMs) has been questioned and the number of studies directly analyzing remotely sensed variables has lately multiplied. While several assumptions support the advantages of remote sensing data, an empirical comparison is still lacking. The objective of this study was to bridge this gap and compare the suitability of an existing categorical land cover classification and of continuous remote sensing variables for modeling the distribution patterns of 30 Mexican tree species. We applied the Maximum Entropy algorithm to predict species distributions based on both data types independently, quantified model performance and analyzed species-land cover relationships in detail. As part of this comparison, we focused on two particular aspects, namely the effects of (1) thematic detail and (2) spatial resolution of the land cover data on model performance. Our analysis revealed that remote sensing data were significantly better model predictors and that the main obstacle of the land cover-based SDMs were their bolder predictions, together with their overall overestimation of suitability. Among the land cover-based models, we found that thematic detail was more important than spatial resolution for SDM performance. However, our results also suggest that the suitability of land cover data differs largely among species and is dependent on their habitat distinctiveness. Our findings have relevant implications for future species distribution modeling studies which aim at complementing their set of topo-climatic predictors by data on land surface characteristics.

High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Is an Important yet Underutilized Resource in Conservation Biology	PLOS ONE												Technological advances and increasing availability of high-resolution satellite imagery offer the potential for more accurate land cover classifications and pattern analyses, which could greatly improve the detection and quantification of land cover change for conservation. Such remotely-sensed products, however, are often expensive and difficult to acquire, which prohibits or reduces their use. We tested whether imagery of high spatial resolution (<= 5 m) differs from lower-resolution imagery (>= 30 m) in performance and extent of use for conservation applications. To assess performance, we classified land cover in a heterogeneous region of Interior Atlantic Forest in Paraguay, which has undergone recent and dramatic human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation. We used 4 m multispectral IKONOS and 30 m multispectral Landsat imagery and determined the extent to which resolution influenced the delineation of land cover classes and patch-level metrics. Higher-resolution imagery more accurately delineated cover classes, identified smaller patches, retained patch shape, and detected narrower, linear patches. To assess extent of use, we surveyed three conservation journals (Biological Conservation, Biotropica, Conservation Biology) and found limited application of high-resolution imagery in research, with only 26.8% of land cover studies analyzing satellite imagery, and of these studies only 10.4% used imagery <= 5 m resolution. Our results suggest that high-resolution imagery is warranted yet under-utilized in conservation research, but is needed to adequately monitor and evaluate forest loss and conversion, and to delineate potentially important stepping-stone fragments that may serve as corridors in a human-modified landscape. Greater access to low-cost, multiband, high-resolution satellite imagery would therefore greatly facilitate conservation management and decision-making.																	1932-6203					JAN 23	2014	9	1							e86908	10.1371/journal.pone.0086908								WOS:000330288000170	24466287

Tropical rainforest biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in the Selva Central, Peru	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Tropical deforestation has reduced the extent of natural forests, which conserve biodiversity, provide essential resources to people, and reduce climate change by storing carbon. Forest conservation projects need tree species data to effectively manage biodiversity while greenhouse gas reduction programs require robust methods to estimate forest carbon. Here, we use field measurements, remote sensing, and Monte Carlo analyses to quantify tree biodiversity and aboveground carbon changes and uncertainties in 5200 km(2) of Amazonian and Yungas rainforest and other land around the Parque Nacional Yanachaga-Chemillen and two other protected areas in the Selva Central, Peru. Field inventories of 17 ha found 438 tree species in 156 families. Field measurements of 10,838 trees and Monte Carlo analyses of uncertainties in measurements, allometric equations, wood density, and the carbon fraction of biomass showed that aboveground live carbon densities were 93 +/- 39 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- 95% confidence interval [CI]) in old-growth forest and 40 +/- 10 Mg ha(-1) in secondary forest. Carbon density was significantly correlated to tree species richness (P < 0.0001). Supervised classification of Landsat images showed a 1989-2005 net deforestation rate of 0.3% y(-1), reduction of forest cover from three-quarters of the area to two-thirds, and net degradation of additional forest equivalent to half the deforested area. A Monte Carlo analysis that combined carbon density and remote sensing uncertainties showed that forest changes caused statistically significant net emissions of 1.6 +/- 0.4 million Mg carbon. Allometric equations and remote sensing accounted for most of the uncertainty. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that, of six factors examined, distance to roads most explained historical deforestation patterns. The protected areas experienced no net deforestation, very low degradation, and very low change close to roads. Projection of potential forest cover to 2021 indicates that a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) project could avoid gross emissions of 2.8 +/- 0.8 million Mg carbon. One-eighth of the area would be eligible for afforestation or reforestation under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), with credit for carbon storage occurring above a projected baseline gross reforestation rate of 1.8% y(-1). These activities could conserve tropical forest carbon and biodiversity. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ten factors, elevation, slope, geological structure, land cover, settlement, the location of Diaoluoshan Nature Reserve, and so on, were chosen to evaluate ecological suitability. Applying the Delphi method to assess the grade and weight of the evaluation indicators, and then on the basis of the 1:50,000 digital topographic map to create digital raster graphics of different assessment factors using Arc GIS 9.1. The regional ecological suitability index (RESI) of each assessment unit was calculated by overlapping of each assessment grid. The RESI value of multifactor weighted superposition was 1.35-4.85 in the research areas, and the land was classified into 5 types, high suitability, suitability, basic suitability, unsuitability, and high unsuitability zone, by using the K-means clustering method. After that, generating spatial distribution map of regional suitability was based on the RESI reclassification, which provided a scientific method for the ecological conservation, resource exploitation, utilization, and management of Diaoluoshan National Forest Park.																	2194-5357		978-3-319-03449-2; 978-3-319-03448-5				2014	254						353	365		10.1007/978-3-319-03449-2_32								WOS:000363268200032

This may form the baseline against which future changes can be measured. Measurements of SST also serve as an entry point to characterize the water dynamics along the African coast and to understand where and when changes have taken place, such that possible short-to medium term scenarios can be developed and used as management tools for precautionary measures. Significant advances in TIR technology have been achieved to build the necessary confidence in satellite-based SST measurements for research, as well as for operational and commercial purposes. An effective dissemination of these EO value added products to African institutions and policy-makers is a key condition for long-term sustainability of coastal and marine resources. The chapter presents a variety of applications using TIR images and SST data that have contributed to develop the necessary knowledge and competences that are critical for the implementation of conservation and management strategies at continental, regional and national scales.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							55	73		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_3	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100004						
B	Andrefouet, S		Barale, V; Gade, M		Andrefouet, Serge			Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs and Their Environments in the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean: Research and Management	REMOTE SENSING OF THE AFRICAN SEAS												The Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean regions offer a wide variety of coastal configurations, including large areas of coral reefs. In regions that include both developed and developing countries, coral reefs and the services they provide are critical for the livelihoods, economies and well being of local communities, while they are at risk due to both anthropogenic and natural threats. Coral reefs also offer to scientific research a unique array of ecological and geological processes specific to these regions. Both applied and fundamental aspects motivate conservation and management projects. Satellite and airborne remote sensing has contributed to scientific and management projects with a variety of sensors and products, including some of the earliest coral reef applications worldwide 30 years ago. High spatial resolution geomorphology, bathymetry and habitat maps provide a biophysical description of the reefs themselves. Oceanic fields, such as sea surface temperature regime and their anomalies, quantify how coral reefs are exposed to weather and climate forcing. The combined local and large scale spatial information help understand how coral reefs status and processes vary across space and time. In particular, data products are increasingly combined to map the resilience of coral reef and associated habitats, and to design conservation plans at different spatial scales. However, both high-tech state-of-the-art and user-friendly remote sensing are still not used as systematically as it could be, while most countries still need basic spatial information consistent at national and international scales, such as habitat maps. Future applied developments will need to address these gaps in priority products. At the same time, on-going research will continue to refine local and regional products relevant for the science and the management of the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean coral reefs and their environments.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							317	335		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_16	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100017

Moverover, the scarecity of database for Indian cities even reflects a greater challenge for urban planner to combat the climate change issues like 'Urban Heat Island' and sharply reducing water and ecological reserves. This paper goes beyond to analyse the effect of 'Urban Heat Island' and critically appraises the issues responsible for occurance of Urban Heat Island in Delhi. Delhi is one of the fast growing Metropolitan City of India with present population of about 17 million persons (census 2011) and it is estimated to grow about 23 million population by the year 2021. After Independence Delhi had 1.43 million population by 1951 and has increased to 8.42 million by 1991. Today the city of Delhi is on the central-stage to reflect and cope with the demand of the complex-cultural-traditional-religion-cosuriopolitian society. Concentration of intense economic activities resultant in an increase of built up areas on the expense of areas covered by water bodies and ecological reserves. Over the past Delhi is also reflecting increasing warming trends in temperature. On the objective of providing solution to the complex integrated problems, the present paper examines the alarming impact of change in land-uses on micro climatic zone and there by generating effect of 'Urban Heat Island'. The paper by exploring the remote sensing data, evaluates the temporal variation of surface temperature and air quality data over the change of water bodies and ecological reserves and its role to strengthen the effect of Urban Heat Island. The paper offers the various low-cost, innovative and traditional options to combat the effect of Urban Heat Island through sustainable spatial integration of land-use and conservation of water bodies. Overall this paper aims to offer workable and implementable solutions to combat the adverse impact of climate change and preserve the well being of the urban community.																			978-94-90354-30-5				2014							1102	1113										WOS:000360101000093

Hollow-bearing trees are an important breeding and shelter resource for wildlife in Australian native forests and hollow availability can influence species abundance and diversity in forest ecosystems. A persistent problem for forest managers is the ability to locate and survey hollow-bearing trees with a high level of accuracy at low cost over large areas of forest. Aims. The aim of this study was to determine whether remote-sensing techniques could identify key variables useful in classifying the likelihood of a tree to contain hollows suitable for wildlife. Methods. The data were high-resolution, multispectral aerial imagery and light detection and ranging (Lidar). A ground-based survey of 194 trees, 96 Eucalyptus crebra and 98 E. chloroclada and E. blakelyi, were used to train and validate tree-senescence classification models. Key results. We found that trees in the youngest stage of tree senescence, which had a very low probability of hollow occurrence, could be distinguished using multispectral aerial imagery from trees in the later stages of tree senescence, which had a high probability of hollow occurrence. Independently, the canopy-height model used to estimate crown foliage density demonstrated the potential of Lidar-derived structural parameters as predictors of senescence and the hollow-bearing status of individual trees. Conclusions. This study demonstrated a 'proof of concept' that remotely sensed tree parameters are suitable predictor variables for the hollow-bearing status of an individual tree. Implications. Distinguishing early stage senescence trees from later-stage senescence trees using remote sensing offers potential as an efficient, repeatable and cost-effective way to map the distribution and abundance of hollow-bearing trees across the landscape. Further development is required to automate this process across the landscape, particularly the delineation of tree crowns. Further improvements may be obtained using a combination of these remote-sensing techniques. This information has important applications in commercial forest inventory and in biodiversity monitoring programs.																	1035-3712	1448-5494					2014	41	8					703	716		10.1071/WR14168								WOS:000353148500008

Combining landscape development intensity (LDI) index and geographical information system (GIS), we obtained the correlation between human activities and conservation effectiveness. It was found that conservation effectiveness of protected areas was mostly decreasing. Furthermore, the correlation between LDI and conservation effectiveness (r = -0.854, p< 0.01) suggested that human activities impose a significant impact on conservation effectiveness in wetland protected areas.																			978-1-60595-186-7				2014							261	265										WOS:000351911500042

The raw data of the rare animals' habitat areas and the monitoring data are usually in large scale and isolated without any semantic information when to comprehensive analyze. In this paper, we introduce the linked data concept to the knowledge for the biologists to reveal the relationship between ecological environment and biological diversity by the semantic analysis. Our key idea is the notion of linking different raw sources via spatial-temporal continuum based on migration habitats discovered by agglomerative clustering with biologic semantic analysis of the linked biotope data. The first step is to derive the habitats by clustering, and then to link the raw data, at last, to analyze the biological significance based on the linked data. One of our results is the clustering areas, an illusive map depicting the breeding and wintering home range of monitored birds, and the other is the linked data platform based on the clustered habitats, and the linked data sets includes the census data of waterfowl and plant, meteorological data, remote sensing data, video data and so on, the core result is the semantic analysis chart which reveal the interaction of species and environment.																			978-1-60595-198-0				2014							143	156										WOS:000351916000018

This paper analyzed the time-spatial revolution process which indicated that, firstly the area of wetland reduced rapidly from remote sensing image in 1988, 2001 and 2005, secondly the exterior of urban changed acutely and the interior were protected well in view of spatial pattern. Moreover, driving force factors were pointed out. Human activities, especially urbanization were the main causes of wetlands degradation. Simultaneity, the development of farming, the construction of infrastructure and nature were important factors. Owing to rapid economic development and urban sprawling, wetlands are encountering threaten to be converting to other land uses.

Spatial analysis of limiting resources on an island: diet and shelter use reveal sites of conservation importance for the Rottnest Island quokka	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. For conservation of any species, we need baseline data that will guide conservation planning strategies. Identifying plant resources used by animal species for food and shelter is the first important step towards fauna conservation. The second step is to determine the extent and distribution of these resources and thus identify prime habitat or habitat that could be improved through suitable management actions. This information provides the necessary spatial targeting required to make the most of few resources and a shortage of time. Aims. Applying this model approach, we identified plant species used as food or shelter resources by the conservationally significant quokka (Setonix brachyurus) across Rottnest Island, Western Australia in the aftermath of the hottest and driest summer on record. Methods. Dietary analysis was carried out using microhistological examination of plant cuticle remains from faecal samples for 67 locations across the island. Plants acting as diurnal rest shelters (n = 73 sites) were identified through observation of individuals flushed during surveys. Identifying key resources requires both a comprehensive analysis of the current use, as well as knowledge of availability of resources to determine selectivity. We therefore compared food plants or rest sites with a comprehensive survey of floristic diversity and abundance for 210 stratified-randomly located sites across the island. Key results. Weidentified eight plant species that quokkas fed on preferentially and identified four plant species that were the principal shelter sites. We then used hyperspectral remote sensing data to map the distribution of these plant species to quantify their distribution and identify key habitat areas. Conclusions. Understanding resource limitation over the most physiologically challenging time of the year provides important information for quokka conservation. Quokkas prefer Malvaceae species as food plants, and use dense, abundant shrubs for shelter. Implications. Quokkas appear to have shifted their use of food plants since a previous study (50 years ago), likely reflecting modification of island vegetation due to anthropogenic influences, fire and herbivory over time. In the face of changing climate, this information will serve as an important guide towards conservation management actions on the island (e.g. future planning of revegetation and habitat protection/enhancement).

In several countries the history of NFIs is very long. For these countries a specific challenge is to keep the inventories up-to-date without sacrificing the advantages associated with long time series. At the turn of the 20th century European NFIs faced some major challenges. In this article we describe the history and the recent developments of the Swedish NFI as an example from which general observations are made and discussed. The Swedish NFI started in 1923 and has evolved from an inventory with a narrow focus on wood resources to an inventory today which aims to provide information about all major forest ecosystem services. It can be concluded that the traditional approaches of most European NFIs, e.g. to collect data through sample plot field inventories, has proved to be applicable even for a wide range of new information requirements. Specifically, detailed data about land use, trees, vegetation, and soils has found new important uses in connection with biodiversity assessments and the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. Though time-consuming and difficult, making NFI information comparable across countries through harmonization appears to be a useful approach. The European National Forest Inventory Network (ENFIN) was formed in 2003 and has been successful in pan-European NFI harmonization.																	0037-5330	2242-4075					2014	48	3							1095	10.14214/sf.1095								WOS:000343873600003

In the field, riparian buffers are usually dimensioned to meet the minimum width required by policies and regulations. In the case of the province of Quebec, Canada, regulation stipulates a width of 1-3 m in agricultural watersheds. However, such small riparian strips offer little protection, especially during the spring-snowmelt period when the soil is saturated, infiltration is low, vegetative cover is poor and soil erosion and runoff are the dominant hydrological processes. In this study, high-resolution, remote sensing, raster-based information is used to evaluate an extended riparian buffer strip concept with variable widths of 5-120 m to assess soil erosion and to convert agricultural riverine areas into soil and water conservation areas. For a studied watershed of 108 km(2) in Quebec, this would enable reducing soil erosion in riverine areas from 361 to 1.0 t year(-1) (1.9 to 0.005 t ha(-1) year(-1)), and thereby reducing soil erosion at the watershed scale by 40% (calculated with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, RUSLE). The extended riparian buffer strip concept would require the conversion of 7% of the 29 km(2) of agricultural land.																	0701-1784	1918-1817					2014	39	3					285	301		10.1080/07011784.2014.942572								WOS:000349640200003

This study assesses the impacts of tourism on the land cover in the Jeseniky mountain region by comparing multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1991, 2001 and 2013) to describe the rate and extent of land-cover change throughout the Jeseniky mountain region. This was achieved through spectral classification of different land cover and by assessing the change in forest; settlements; pasture and agriculture in relation to increasing distances (5, 10 and 15 km) from three tourism site. The results indicate that the area was deforested (11.13%) from 1991 to 2001 than experienced forest regrowth (6.71%) from 2001 to 2013. In first decay pasture and agriculture areas was increase and then in next decay it was decrease. The influence of tourism facilities on land cover is also variable. Around each of the tourism site sampled there was a general trend of forest removal decreasing as the distance from each village increased, which indicates tourism does have a negative impact on forests. However, there was an opposite trend from 2001 to 2013 that indicate conservation area. The interplay among global (tourism, climate), regional (national policies, large-river management), and local (construction and agriculture, energy and water sources to support the tourism industry) factors drives a distinctive but complex pattern of land-use and land-cover disturbance.

Hyperspectral band selection and Classification of Hyperion image of Bhitarkanika mangrove ecosystem, eastern India	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XVI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XVI was part of the International Symposium on Remote Sensing	SEP 22-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				Tropical mangrove forests along the coast evolve dynamically due to constant changes in the natural ecosystem and ecological cycle. Remote sensing has paved the way for periodic monitoring and conservation of such floristic resources, compared to labour intensive in-situ observations. With the laboratory quality image spectra obtained from hyperspectral image data, species level discrimination in habitats and ecosystems is attainable. One of the essential steps before classification of hyperspectral image data is band selection. It is important to eliminate the redundant bands to mitigate the problems of Hughes effect that are likely to affect further image analysis and classification accuracy. This paper presents a methodology for the selection of appropriate hyperspectral bands from the EO-1 Hyperion image for the identification and mapping of mangrove species and coastal landcover types in the Bhitarkanika coastal forest region, eastern India. Band selection procedure follows class based elimination procedure and the separability of the classes are tested in the band selection process. Individual bands are de-correlated and redundant bands are removed from the bandwise correlation matrix. The percent contribution of class variance in each band is analysed from the factors of PCA component ranking. Spectral bands are selected from the wavelength groups and statistically tested. Further, the band selection procedure is compared with similar techniques (Band Index and Mutual information) for validation. The number of bands in the Hyperion image was reduced from 196 to 88 by the Factor-based ranking approach. Classification was performed by Support Vector Machine approach. It is observed that the proposed Factor-based ranking approach performed well in discriminating the mangrove species and other landcover units compared to the other statistical approaches. The predominant mangrove species Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Cynometra ramiflora are spectral identified and the health status of these species are assessed by the selected band. Further, the performance of this band selection approaches are evaluated in multi-sensor image fusion for better mapping of mangrove ecosystems, wherein spatial resolution is enhanced while retaining the optimal number of hyperspectral bands.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-302-1				2014	9239								UNSP 923914	10.1117/12.2067483								WOS:000348312800030

Monitoring and predicting eutrophication of Sri Lankan inland waters using ASTER satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				This study focused on determining the past changes and predicting the future trends in eutrophication of the Bolgoda North lake, Sri Lanka using in situ Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) measurements and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) satellite data. This Lake is located in a mixed land use area with industries, some agricultural lands, middle income and high income housing, tourist hotels and low income housing. From March to October 2013, water samples from five sampling sites were collected once a month parallel to ASTER overpass and Chl-a, nitrate and phosphate contents of each sample were measured using standard laboratory methods. Cloud-free ASTER scenes over the lake during the 2000-2013 periods were acquired for Chl-a estimation and trend analysis. All ASTER images were atmospherically corrected using FLAASH software and in-situ Chl-a data were regressed with atmospherically corrected three ASTER VNIR band ratios of the same date. The regression equation of the band ratio and Chl-a content with the highest correlation, which was the green/red band ratio was used to develop algorithm for generation of 15-m resolution Chl-a distribution maps. According to the ASTER based Chl-a distribution maps it was evident that eutrophication of this lake has gradually increased from 2008-2011. Results also indicated that there had been significantly high eutrophic conditions throughout the year 2013 in several regions, especially in water stagnant areas and adjacent to freshwater outlets. Field observations showed that this lake is receiving various discharges from factories. Unplanned urbanization and inadequacy of proper facilities in the nearby industries for waste management have resulted in the eutrophication of the water body. If the present trends of waste disposal and unplanned urbanization continue, enormous environmental problems would be resulted in future. Results of the present study showed that information from satellite remote sensing can play a useful role in the development of time series Chl-a distribution maps. Such information is important for the future predictions, development and management of this area as well as in the conservation of this water body.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								UNSP 92400I	10.1117/12.2067127								WOS:000348196100013						
J	Wohlfart, C; Wegmann, M; Leimgruber, P				Wohlfart, Christian; Wegmann, Martin; Leimgruber, Peter			Mapping threatened dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in South-east Asia for conservation management	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Habitat loss is the primary reason for species extinction, making habitat conservation a critical strategy for maintaining global biodiversity. Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R-2 = 0.56 to 0.78. We identified three hotspots in SE Asia with a total area of 156,000 km(2), and found Myanmar to have more remaining DDF than the countries in SE Asia. Our approach proved to be a reliable method for mapping DDF and other seasonally influenced ecosystems on continental and regional scales, and is very valuable for conservation management in this region.

Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) have large home ranges and diverse habitat needs and as a result, information on the extent, type, and timing of disturbances is important. In this research we apply a remote-sensing-based disturbance mapping technique to the southeastern extent of a grizzly bear range. We apply a data fusion approach with MODIS 250 m and Landsat 30 m spatial resolution imagery to map disturbances biweekly from 2001-2011. A regression tree classifier was applied to classify the disturbance events based on spatial and temporal characteristics. Fire was attributed as a disturbance based on a national fire database. Results indicate that across the 130,727 km(2) study area, 4,603 km(2) of forest were disturbed over the past decade (2001-2011), impacting 0.35% of the study area annually. Overall, 68.7% of the disturbance events were attributed to forest harvest, followed by well sites 13.4%, fires 9.3% and road development, 8.6%. Primary source habitat contained 3.8% of disturbed land, and primary sink areas had 5.9% disturbed land. Our findings quantify habitat change, which can aid managers by identifying significant areas for grizzly bear conservation.

Stream flow and the water quality of a river are affected by both anthropogenic and natural factors existing within the catchment area, hence it is vital to study watershed and its management. This includes identification of problems and issues impacting the natural resources of the watershed and recommending management solutions that will benefit the community, the economy and the environment and would bring about a sustainable development within the watershed. The present study seeks to generate various thematic maps in GIS domain like Drainage, Geomorphology, Road, Rail, Canal, Forest, Settlement, Land Use Land Cover etc. using high resolution satellite data (IRS LISS IV and Cartosat-1). The application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to give suitable weightage value to various factors in each layer. In this paper, Land Resource Development Plan (LRDP) map has been generated to suggest conservation of forest, Farmbund, Social forestry etc. to protect soil loss, soil erosion and also Water Resource Development Plan (WRDP) map has been generated to suggest to make some structures like Canal, check dam, reservoir for the conservation of water resources. The future implication of the study would be to control damaging runoff and degradation of land and thereby conservation of soil and water.																	2198-3542		978-4-431-54871-3; 978-4-431-54870-6				2014							247	255		10.1007/978-4-431-54871-3_18								WOS:000346740600018

The objective of this paper is to provide ready-to-use information on forest habitats by conducting a multi-scale approach for the delineation of such, and the assessment of their conservation status on multi-spectral satellite imagery of high and very high spatial resolution, as well as LiDAR data. This information should help forest managers in the decision-making process and contribute to a sustainable management. The evaluation of the quality of forest habitats is performed on suitable indicators such as structure and composition on broad-scale for whole landscapes and on fine-scale for individual protected sites. In this context, information layers and direct habitat mapping can help to address the complex task of monitoring forest habitats and to harmonize information output.																			978-3-87907-545-4				2014							49	56		10.1553/giscience2014s49								WOS:000346127000008

The annual soil erosion potential was estimated using Universal Soil Loss Equation and suitable crops for particular watershed was suggested. The average rainfall erosivity factor (R), erodibility factor (K), highest and lowest value of slope length factor (LS), highest and lowest values of crop management factor (C), highest and lowest values of conservation factor (P) have been calculated. Average soil erosion rate of the watershed was estimated to be 8 tonnes/ha/yr. About 13.95% of the watershed area was found to be under slight erosion, 82.21% under the moderate erosion, high and severe erosion found in only 0.01% and remaining area was under very high erosion.

Patterns of grassland productivity, composition and seed abundance, and the diet of the flock bronzewing pigeon Phaps histrionica at one site in northern Australia over a period of marked seasonal change	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Multiple scales of research are needed to understand the ecology and conservation requirements of species whose ecology is characterised by marked spatial and temporal dynamism. The flock bronzewing pigeon may provide a model for the conservation management of species with similar dispersive ecologies. Aims. This study aimed to document the species composition and its variability in seeds consumed by flock bronzewing pigeons across a period of contrasting seasonal conditions, and to relate this diet to variation in food resource availability. Methods. The diet of the flock bronzewing pigeon was described by analysis of the crop contents of samples collected over the period from June 2006 to September 2007 at one pastoral property on the Barkly Tablelands, Northern Territory. Variation in food resource availability was assessed using data from remote sensing, grassland community structure, and direct measurement of soil seed density. Multivariate statistical methods were used to test variation in plant community structure between years and among land units; generalised linear modelling was used to examine inter-annual variation in the abundance of key food plant species and seasonal variation in seed abundance. Key results. Across the period of this study, the diet of flock bronzewing pigeons on the Barkly Tableland was largely restricted to seeds of a small number of plant species within Mitchell grasslands. Dietary patterns varied between years; evidence from remote sensing, grassland community structure, and seed density was consistent with these dietary patterns. Conclusions. Flock bronzewing pigeons appear to be adapted to exploiting rare, episodic events, leading to high seed production by the ephemeral or annual component of perennial tussock grasslands. Key food plant species include the forbs Wedelia asperrima, Trichodesma zeylanicum and Phyllanthus lacerosus and the large-seeded annual grass Chionachne hubbardiana. These species may not be those that provide critical resources during unfavourable periods. Implications. Conservation management of flock bronzewing pigeons will entail strategies to maintain key food species in grazed landscapes, and to ensure replenishment of seed reserves of annual and ephemeral plant species. Management practices to achieve these goals may include rotational wet season spelling of paddocks. More information is required on the focal areas for persistence within these black-soil grassland landscapes.																	1035-3712	1448-5494					2014	41	4					343	355		10.1071/WR14002								WOS:000346585100006

Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands. We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	17					6469	6489		10.1080/01431161.2014.955145								WOS:000345706300006

Due to serious flash floods in urbanised areas of Malaysia, water resource management is a vital issue. This paper reports on a study that has been carried out using remote sensing techniques and hydrological modelling for examining the spatial patterns changes of urban areas and its impacts on surface runoff. The estimation of surface runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS CN) method was performed by integrating both remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Remote sensing is a data sources for monitoring urban growth by quantifying the changes of urban area and its environmental impact are then analysed by using a GIS-based hydrological model. By linking the integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS, the relationship of runoff with urban expansion are further examined. Hence, the changes in runoff due to urbanisation are analysed. This methodology is applied to the central region of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, where rapid urban growth has occurred over the last decade.

Prediction of reef fish spawning aggregations using remote sensing: A review	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE DIGITAL EARTH (ISDE8)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak Convent Bur, Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur, ESRI, FRIM, JKPTG, JUPEM, NRE, ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol			Spawning aggregation is a very important occurrence to particular reef fish species as they use this opportunity to reproduce. However, due to their predictable nature, these aggregations have always been vulnerable to overexploitation. This problem leads to the importance of identifying the exact time and location for reef fish spawning aggregation. Thus, this paper review a little bit about spawning aggregation of reef fish as well as their characteristics, and problems regarding this phenomena. The use of remote sensing in marine applications is also described here in order to discuss how remote sensing can be utilize to predict reef fish spawning aggregation. Based on the unique geomorphological characteristics of the spawning aggregation, remote sensing seems to be a powerful tool to determine their exact times and locations. It has been proved that satellite imagery was able to delineate specific reef geomorphologies such as shelf edges and reef promontories. Despite of the widely use of remote sensing in marine applications, in fact there are still lack of studies had been carried out regarding spawning aggregations of reef fish due to the skeptical point-of-view by certain researchers over the capability of this technique. However, there is actually no doubt that the use of remote sensing will provide a better hand to the authorities in order to establish a more effective monitoring and conservation plan for these spawning aggregations.																	1755-1307						2014	18								UNSP 012115	10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012115								WOS:000345268900115						
J	Liu, JG; Vina, A				Liu, Jianguo; Vina, Andres			PANDAS, PLANTS, AND PEOPLE	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN												Plants are essential for the survival and sustainability of both humans and wildlife species around the world. However, human activities have directly and indirectly affected almost all plants, which in turn have produced cascading effects on humans and wildlife through disruption of crucial ecosystem services and wildlife habitat. Understanding such complex interactions is crucial for developing better policies that reconcile the needs of an ever-growing human population with biodiversity conservation. Using the coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework, this article synthesizes research on the complex interactions of plant species, giant pandas, and people. The CHANS framework is particularly useful for uncovering key patterns and processes behind plant-animal interactions modified by human activities. Our synthesis shows that many human factors, including socioeconomic and demographic, together with other factors (e.g., projected global climate change), exhibit reciprocal interactions with pandas and the plant species that comprise their habitat. Although substantial efforts have been made to preserve plants and wildlife, much work still remains to be done, including the expansion and more effective management of protected areas, use of native plant species in reforestation/afforestation programs, and active participation of local residents in conservation actions.

Illegal encroachment on forest land is one of the major causes of deforestation in Pakistan. This study addresses the issue of forest encroachments in Murree Forest Division (MFD). MFD is a biodiversity-rich popular hill station of Punjab province and hosts thousands of visitors throughout the year. MFD comprises of 19,135 ha (47,285 acres) of state forest land, out of which 1,158.8 ha (2,862 acres) was identified as land encroached upon by the land grabbers, builders, and timber mafia. During the past decade this problem has drastically increased and led to a suo moto initiative by the Lahore High Court (vide Writ Petition No. 1813-2010). For the forensic support to the court, a detailed geographic information system and remote sensing baseline mapping have been carried out in close coordination with the Punjab Forest Department, Survey of Pakistan, Punjab Revenue Department, and WWF-Pakistan. Legal forest boundaries were delineated using high-precision surveying based on a Differential Global Positioning System and total station systems, whereas the encroachments were identified using high-resolution satellite images. The accuracy of these boundaries and encroachments was assessed and validated on the ground as well as on historic maps. The study outcomes were presented to the court as a supporting document of evidence to help them make a better decision against the encroachers and land retrieval. The main goal of the study was to prioritize conversion strategies for sustainable natural resources and segregate them into immediate, mid-term, and long-term process of land retrieval to restoring forests back to their original state. The study prompts the relevant government officials to adopt the latest mapping technologies of GIS, GPS, and RS for efficient forest management practices and sustainable enhancements.																			978-94-017-8757-4; 978-94-017-8756-7				2014	11						263	286		10.1007/978-94-017-8757-4_13	10.1007/978-94-017-8757-4							WOS:000343939800014						
J	Suppan, F; Frey-Roos, F				Suppan, Franz; Frey-Roos, Fredy			Generating Resistance Surfaces for Wildlife Corridor Extraction	PHOTOGRAMMETRIE FERNERKUNDUNG GEOINFORMATION												Experts of wildlife migration often delineate a corridor directly and solely from remote sensing images. Resistance surfaces on the other hand are an intermediate product, if the corridor should be extracted (semi-)automatically, by establishing a knowledge database about spatial behaviour of wildlife. The advantage of a spatial explicit knowledge database is the development of spatial rules in combination with wildlife behaviour, creating a basic database. This database should help to transfer discussions from different expert opinions to more concrete discussions about parameters of spatial rules. The aim of such a knowledge database is the ability to repeat/reproduce the experiment, the reduction of subjectivity of a single expert and the possibility to apply the same method for a large region on a detailed level. Furthermore, the automatic extraction of corridors allows the evaluation of different scenarios like the implementation of new wildlife passages. This study discusses the formulation of spatial rules for wildlife migration in a GIS to generate the basic information of a resistance surface. The application of this method is also discussed in a project called Alpine Carpathian Corridor, where the aim was to safeguard the wildlife migration corridor including intensively used areas (of the landscape).																	1432-8364						2014		5					435	450		10.1127/1432-8364/2014/0235								WOS:000343849000011

Our survey presents an application of utilizing images of a newly launched sensor, Landsat 8, to rapidly identify inland water bodies and produce a screening-level island-wide inventory of wetlands for the first time in Cyprus. The method treats all lentic water bodies (artificial and natural) and areas holding semi-aquatic vegetation as wetland sites. The results show that 179 sites are delineated by the remote sensing application and when this is supplemented by expert-guided identification and ground surveys during favourable wet-season conditions the total number of inventoried wetland sites is 315. The number of wetland sites is surprisingly large since it does not include micro-wetlands (under 2000 m(2) or 0.2 ha) or widespread narrow lotic and riparian stream reaches. In Cyprus, a number of different wetland types occur and often in temporary or ephemerally flooded conditions and they are usually of very small areal extent. Many wetlands are artificial or semi-artificial water bodies, and numerous natural small wetland features are often degraded by anthropogenic changes or exist as remnant patches and are therefore heavily modified compared to their original natural state. The study proves that there is an urgent need for integrated and multidisciplinary study and monitoring of wetlands cover due to either climate change effects and/or anthropogenic interventions. Small wetlands are particularly vulnerable while many artificial wetlands are not managed for biodiversity values. The remote sensing and GIS application are efficient tools for this initial screening-level inventory. The need for baseline inventory information collection in support of wetland conservation is multi-scalar and requires an adaptive protocol to guide effective conservation planning.

RESEARCH ON STURGEON MIGRATION BEHAVIOUR USING A NEW MONITORING, CONTROL AND ALARMING SYSTEM	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												In the last decades, sturgeon species population decreased due to several factors, the most important ones being: habitats fragmentation caused by river bed rehabilitation works, irrational and excessive fishing and poaching phenomena which is extremely difficult to control. In order to gain a better understanding of sturgeon species migration on Lower Danube which is useful in elaborating preventive measures for species conservation, National Institute for Research and Development in Environmental Protection Bucharest (INCDPM) created a complex monitoring, control and alarming system (DK-PRB-01U) which uses acoustic telemetry method. The monitoring system comprises, among others, two sub-systems: a fixed one (DKTB) and a floating one (DKMR-01T), both being able to create detection gates for sturgeon migration and for water quality parameters determination. This new system is capable to send data on-line in order to alarm the research team when an abiotic parameter (e.g. turbidity and water level) registers values above thresholds. In this case, intervention should be performed and systems positioning must not affect the calibration and validation. The system facilitates data gathering without allowing any station loss, therefore has a direct impact on the informational volume regarding sturgeon migration behaviour and reduces the monitoring and maintaining costs.

This was achieved through spectral classification of different land cover by assessing the change in forest; settlements; pasture and agriculture in relation to increasing distances (5, 10 and 15 km) from three tourism sites. The results indicate that the area was deforested (11.13%) from 1991 to 2001 than experienced forest regrowth (6.71%) from 2001 to 2013. In first decay pasture and agriculture area were increase and then in next decay it were decrease. The influence of tourism facilities on land cover is also variable. Around each of the tourism site sampled there was a general trend of forest removal decreasing as the distance from each tourist site increased, which indicates tourism does have a negative impact on forest. However, there was an opposite trend from 2001 to 2013 that indicate conservation area.

Biodiversity of Kargil Cold Desert in the Ladakh Himalaya	INTEGRATIVE OBSERVATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS	Ecological Research Monographs											Biological diversity has long been a source of wonderment and scientific curiosity, but it is now increasingly a source of concern. We attempted to classify, map, and characterize vegetation and its biodiversity content using satellite imagery and field enumeration in the cold desert of the Kargil-Ladakh region located in the Western Himalaya, India. Fair-weather, multi-temporal IRS-P6 LISS III data were subjected to visual interpretation, which estimated rocky barren land as the dominant land cover, followed by vegetation (alpine pasture, alpine scrub, agroforest, and subalpine forest) and snow cover. Asteraceae was reported as the most speciose family, numbering more species than genera. Artemisia emerged as the most speciose genus. Species diversity decreased with increasing altitude, but the maximum was found at transition zones of agroforest and alpine scrub. The highest species similarity was observed between alpine scrub and alpine pastures, indicating pronounced intermixing and interaction. The detailed updated map (at a scale of 1:50,000) with extensive field observation would overcome a long-pending gap in ecological study in the region and may also be used as baseline data for conservation and planning,																	2191-0707		978-4-431-54783-9; 978-4-431-54782-2				2014							253	274		10.1007/978-4-431-54783-9_13	10.1007/978-4-431-54783-9							WOS:000341995800014

Morphometric analysis of Upper Tons basin from Northern Foreland of Peninsular India using CARTOSAT satellite and GIS	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												The morphometric analysis of river basin helps to explore the interrelationship between hydraulic parameters and geomorphologic characteristics. The study has been conducted in the Upper Tons basin of Northern Foreland of Peninsular India. The river basin has been characterized using the topographical maps, CARTOSAT satellite image integrated using the GIS techniques. The drainage density analysis indicates lower values in the north-eastern regions and thus these regions can be categorized as better ground water potential zone. There are in total 10 sub-watersheds which have been delineated; SW-4 has maximum drainage density (4.75), stream frequency (5.61) and drainage texture (26.64) followed by SW-6-10. The prioritized sub-watershed numbers SW-4 and SW-6-10 need conservation practices because of their high erodibility and run-off. SW-1-3 and SW-5 regions have better permeable bed rocks and hence good for water harvesting. The areal parameter indicates elongated shape of basin and moderate to steeper ground slope. The results are supported by extensive field survey. This study can be applied for soil and water management, as well as disaster prevention from similar type of drainage basins.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	8					895	914		10.1080/10106049.2013.868043								WOS:000340495700006

It is important to note that biophysical factors and human induced factors are interlinked in determining NPP patterns. Nevertheless, it is difficult to consider some aspects of human management systems in relation to NPP variations on a global scale analysis than on a local scale analysis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that, at the local scale, particularly in highly intensive systems, land-use/land tenure types influence NPP variations by altering the biophysical conditions of the land. We estimated NPP between 2000 and 2009 using MODIS data and used ANOVA to test the abovementioned hypotheses. Results showed that NPP significantly (p<0.05) varied by land-use/land tenure type. We also found that biophysical factors remained essential in explaining NPP variations even at local scales. These results exhibit the intricacies that exist between the biophysical and human-induced factors in explaining NPP variations within ecological landscapes.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	6					671	687		10.1080/10106049.2013.837101								WOS:000340244100008

We applied a two factorial logistic regression analysis to model the probability of occurrence of sable antelope in hunted and non-hunted areas of northwest Zimbabwe as a function of vegetation cover density (estimated by a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). We validated the results by high-spatial resolution imagery derived tree canopy area. We subsequently compared the predictions from the two models in order to compare sable cover selection between hunted and non-hunted areas. Our results suggest that hunted sables are likely to select closed woodland, while non-hunted ones would prefer more open woodland habitats. We also established a significant positive relationship between NDVI and tree canopy cover, thus emphasizing the importance of remote sensing in studies that measure the impact of hunting on habitat selection of targeted species.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	2					198	210		10.1080/10106049.2012.754499								WOS:000338765800007

To support these requirements, a component of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Kyoto and Carbon (K&C) initiative has been to design and develop capability for a Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) that routinely monitors and reports on local to global changes in the extent of mangroves, primarily on the basis of observations by Japanese L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The GMW aims are as follows: (1) to map progression of change within or from existing (e.g. Landsat-derived) global baselines of the extent of mangroves by comparing advanced land-observing satellite 2 (ALOS-2) phased array L-band SAR 2 (PALSAR-2) data from 2014 with that acquired by the Japanese earth resources satellite (JERS-1) SAR(1992-1998) and ALOSPALSAR (2006-2011); (2) to quantify changes in the structure and associated losses and gains of carbon on the basis of canopy height and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated from the shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM; acquired 2000), the ice, cloud and land-elevation satellite (ICESAT) geoscience laser altimeter system (GLAS; 2003-2010) and L-band backscatter data; (3) to determine likely losses and gains of tree species diversity through reference to International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) global thematic layers on the distribution of mangrove species; and (4) to validate maps of changes in the extent of mangroves, primarily through comparison with dense time-series of Landsat sensor data and to use these same data to describe the causes and consequences of change. The paper outlines and justifies the techniques being implemented and the role that the GMW might play in supporting national and international policies that relate specifically to the long-term conservation of mangrove ecosystems and the services they provide to society.

However, there is no widely-accepted methodology for how to dynamically evaluate the ecosystem service values of urban rivers and lakes. Using data from survey and remote sensing of Nanchang City, China, this article constructs a conceptual framework based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment to propose an integrated approach to evaluate the ecosystem service values of urban rivers and lakes. Furthermore, the article employs a GIS-based Markov chain model to predict the future probable distribution pattern of land use in Nanchang City, while it uses an artificial neural network model to simulate the potential changing of ecosystem service values. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment-based dynamic evaluation shows that in the first period of 1989-1999, provisioning services are dominant, followed by regulating services, supporting services and cultural services, while during the second period of 1999-2008, regulating services rank firstly in the total change of ecosystem service values, followed by supporting services, cultural services and provisioning services. The artificial neural network-based simulation indicates that the total will slightly increase in line with a small undulation in regulating service values, whilst the most changes brought by the provisioning services will be stable. This study is intended to serve as a tool to be used in decision making for proper and informed urban aquatic ecosystem management.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2014	17	2					161	170		10.1080/14634988.2014.907223								WOS:000337162000007

Protected areas in boreal Canada: a baseline and considerations for the continued development of a representative and effective reserve network	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Boreal forests maintain regionally important biodiversity and globally important ecosystem services, such as carbon storage and freshwater resources. Many boreal systems have limited anthropogenic disturbances and are preserved, in effect, to date largely by their harsh climates and remoteness. As of 2011, almost 10% of Canada is subject to some manner of formal protection, with 4.5% of this protected area found within the boreal zone. The management of existing parks and protected areas (PPAs) is shared amongst many federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Although there are currently low levels of anthropogenic development in some portions of the boreal zone (especially the north), if expansion of protected areas is of interest, there are challenges to traditional PPA networks that may be more prominent in the boreal zone than elsewhere: (1) the boreal zone is home to charismatic mammal species with area requirements much larger than typical PPAs; (2) the boreal zone is characterized by natural disturbance regimes that impact large areas; and (3) projected changes to climate for the boreal zone are among the greatest in the world, creating temporal considerations for conservation planning exercises. There is currently no PPA assessment specific to boreal Canada. To address this lack of an assessment, we developed a conservation gap analysis of the current PPA system with respect to a variety of environmental surrogates (ecozones, land cover, vegetation productivity, and landscape structure). The amount of formally protected land varied within each surrogate, with few commonly reported features meeting national or international conservation targets. Furthermore, few reserves met the areal requirements that have been previously recommended to protect large mammals or accommodate the disturbance regimes present. We also discuss considerations and implications of area-based versus value-based protection objectives. While recognizing that there are still scientific challenges around understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of PPAs, based upon our review and assessment, the following considerations should inform conservation options for the boreal zone: (1) representation of the distribution of natural features within the PPA network; (2) effective maintenance of habitat requirements and spatial resilience to both cyclical and directional changes in spatial patterns through large, connected reserves; and (3) implementation of sustainable forest management practices (where applicable) throughout the broader landscape, as traditional on-reserve protection is unlikely to be sufficient to meet conservation goals. The Canadian boreal is unique in possessing large tracts of inaccessible forested lands that are not subject to management interventions, thereby offering functions similar to protected lands. The question of how to more formally integrate these lands into the existing PPA network requires further consideration. Further, the important temporal role of landscape dynamics in designing an effective PPA needs to be further studied as well as development of a better understanding of design needs in the context of a changing climate.

J	Pasher, J; Smith, PA; Forbes, MR; Duffe, J				Pasher, Jon; Smith, Paul A.; Forbes, Mark R.; Duffe, Jason			Terrestrial ecosystem monitoring in Canada and the greater role for integrated earth observation	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Ecosystems are valuable as well as aesthetic. The natural functions of ecosystems can have profound effects on the economy, and human and wildlife health. The aggregate value of these "ecosystem services" may far exceed the economic value derived from resource extraction or industrial development, especially when considering the costs of restoring ecosystems. There is increasing interest, therefore, in monitoring and protecting ecosystems, and accounting for the biodiversity and services they provide. In 2010, Canada undertook a review of ecosystem status and trends that identified the regions and ecosystems where management is most urgently needed. The authors concluded that more large-scale, long-term, standardized, and spatially complete information is needed for effective monitoring and management. Satellite-based earth observation (EO) tools were seen as ameans of addressing this information need. In a separate exercise, a list of priority questions for conservation policy and management at a national level was produced: the resolution of three-quarters of those questions appears to depend on EO tools to a significant or critical extent. Canada has a long and successful history in all aspects of earth observation, placing it amongst the leaders in the international remote sensing community. Whereas the need for measuring ecosystem services to humans and wildlife is increasingly important, the challenges for doing so are increasingly significant and the technology required is increasingly complex. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address emerging conservation priorities including measurement of ecosystem attributes to support habitat conservation for Species at Risk, measuring functional capacity of ecosystems to mitigate effects of climate change, monitoring and mitigating effects of resource extraction, and supporting industrial development in Canada's north. Addressing emerging priorities requires dialogue among ecologists and decision makers, coordinated at regional and national scales, and requires drawing on the best EO technologies and infrastructure available. This review highlights the urgency of a coordinated approach for innovative applications of EO tools toward conservation and discusses some of the key elements that might be included and opportunities and challenges that might be encountered, by such an approach.																	1208-6053	1181-8700					2014	22	2					179	187		10.1139/er-2013-0017								WOS:000337104900005

Plant ecology and conservation in international cooperation: Approaches and methodologies	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation has fostered international efforts to achieve its objectives and targets also through capacity building and technology transfer. To this aim, scientific research and activities are among the most suitable means for the implementation of the strategy in developing countries, where the lack of trained people and appropriate facilities contributes, together with an often uncontrolled development and an increasing population, to put species and ecosystems at risk of extinction. In this issue, a collection of contributions discussing theoretical issues and presenting innovative methods of investigation and practical questions related to plant ecology and conservation is presented for sharing experiences and stimulating new initiatives.

Implementing REDD plus in Papua New Guinea: Can biodiversity indicators be effectively integrated in PNG's National Forest Inventory?	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												UNFCCC's "Cancun safeguards" (COP 16, 2010) provide a strong call for comprehensive steps to prevent harm to biodiversity from Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) activities and to support its conservation. However, as non-binding "principles" and due to their general wording, they are not operational in the present form. Additionally, the scientific literature on biodiversity monitoring for REDD+ is still very limited, particularly when it comes to REDD+ in tropical forests and at the national scale. Whereas some authors suggest that biodiversity integration can be achieved by means of standardised protocols and techniques, others consider that an effective monitoring of biodiversity in tropical forests at the national scale may be an impossible task to achieve in a cost-effective way. However, recent research offers some functional approaches to tackle the many challenges involved. This paper explores the perspectives and limits of developing and effectively incorporating appropriate biodiversity objectives and indicators in Papua New Guinea's multipurpose National Forest Inventory (PNG's NFI). The PNG's NFI is currently being designed under the UN-REDD programme as a key component of the National Forest Monitoring System that PNG is required to establish in order to participate in a future REDD+ mechanism. We conclude that the challenge cannot be effectively tackled only at the design stage of the NFI, as it needs to address a number of issues related to different stages of the REDD+ preparedness process: a. If biodiversity integration is carried out directly at the NFI stage, it will need to rely on proxies derived from indicators designed to monitor carbon stock change; b. At the planning stage, a carbon-biodiversity overlay map analysis would allow for a preliminary selection of areas of high biodiversity that could be threatened by REDD+ activities either directly or indirectly through "leakage"; c. During the implementation stage, the selection could be refined by identifying a sub-sample of sites where forests are undergoing the greatest changes; d. A comprehensive biodiversity monitoring programme involving field measurements of key species could only be designed once the priority areas have been clearly defined and limited in both number and size.

Analysing the relationship between land units and plant communities: The case of Socotra Island (Yemen)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The ecological land scape classification (ELC) allows the identification of homogeneous land units (LUs), which are fundamental for investigation and management purposes. ELC is particularly relevant in international cooperation programmes targeting areas characterized by very scarce and scattered thematic information. In this study, three techniques are compared to find the best classification of LUs of Socotra Island (Yemen): a Self-Organizing Map neural network, the Clustering LARge Applications method and a Two-Step clustering algorithm. In this way, three LU maps of Socotra Island were produced and the relationship between LUs and plant communities, as identified by a phytosociologiacl investigation, was analysed. Based on evaluation procedures, TS method emerged as the most suitable being able to better discriminate the plant communities so as to reach a trade-off between classification complexity and class homogeneity. Even though the identification of LUs depends on the selection of the classification method and criteria, the scale adopted and the specific management and planning purposes, this study represents a contribution towards a standardization of ecological classification systems thanks also to the worldwide availability of georeferenced environmental data.

J	Cole, B; McMorrow, J; Evans, M				Cole, Beth; McMorrow, Julia; Evans, Martin			Empirical Modelling of Vegetation Abundance from Airborne Hyperspectral Data for Upland Peatland Restoration Monitoring	REMOTE SENSING												Peatlands are important terrestrial carbon stores. Restoration of degraded peatlands to restore ecosystem services is a major area of conservation effort. Monitoring is crucial to judge the success of this restoration. Remote sensing is a potential tool to provide landscape-scale information on the habitat condition. Using an empirical modelling approach, this paper aims to use airborne hyperspectral image data with ground vegetation survey data to model vegetation abundance for a degraded upland blanket bog in the United Kingdom (UK), which is undergoing restoration. A predictive model for vegetation abundance of Plant Functional Types (PFT) was produced using a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and applied to the whole restoration site. A sensitivity test on the relationships between spectral data and vegetation abundance at PFT and single species level confirmed that PFT was the correct scale for analysis. The PLSR modelling allows selection of variables based upon the weighted regression coefficient of the individual spectral bands, showing which bands have the most influence on the model. These results suggest that the SWIR has less value for monitoring peatland vegetation from hyperspectral images than initially predicted. RMSE values for the validation data range between 10% and 16% cover, indicating that the models can be used as an operational tool, considering the subjective nature of existing vegetation survey results. These predicted coverage images are the first quantitative landscape scale monitoring results to be produced for the site. High resolution hyperspectral mapping of PFTs has the potential to assess recovery of peatland systems at landscape scale for the first time.

Deforestation in the Ayeyarwady Delta and the conservation implications of an internationally-engaged Myanmar	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Myanmar is a country of huge biodiversity importance that is undergoing major political change, bringing with it new international engagement. This includes access to international markets, which will likely spur investment in export-oriented agriculture, leading to increased pressures on already threatened ecosystems. This scenario is illustrated in the Ayeyarwady Delta, the country's agricultural heartland sustaining high deforestation rates. Using the Delta as a model system, we use an integrated approach to inquire about whether and how imminent agricultural reforms associated with an internationally-engaged Myanmar could introduce new actors and incentives to invest in agricultural expansion that could affect deforestation rates. We use a novel remote sensing analysis to quantify deforestation rates for the Delta from 1978 to 2011, develop business-as-usual deforestation scenarios, and contextualize those results with an analysis of contemporary policy changes within Myanmar that are expected to alter the principal drivers of land-cover change. We show that mangrove systems of Myanmar are under greater threat than previously recognized, and that agriculture has been the principle driver of deforestation on the Delta. The centrality of agriculture to the Myanmar economy indicates that emerging policies are likely to tip the scales towards agricultural expansion, agroindustrial investment and potentially greater rates of deforestation due to the introduction of well-funded investors, insufficient land tenure agreements, and low governance effectiveness. The broad national challenge is to initiate environmental governance reforms (including safeguards) in the face of significant pressures for land grabbing and opportunistic resource extraction.

Biophysical parameters from remote sensing in semiarid region of Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL												Despite being the single Brazilian biome whose limits are restricted to the national territory, little attention has been given to the conservation of the diverse landscape of 'Caatinga'. Given the scarcity of field data to monitor the biophysical parameters of vegetation of 'Caatinga' in semiarid regions of northeastern Brazil, this study aimed to evaluate the seasonality of spatial dynamics, by means of techniques and products of Remote Sensing. The study area included the conservation unit of the National Park of the Furna Feia and its adjacencies, being situated in the municipalities of Mossoro and Barauna (RN, Brazil). Six orbital images of TM LANDSAT 5, orbit 216 and paragraph 63 taken during the period 2007 to 2010 were used. With the aid of the tool Geographic Information System algorithms were implemented with the generation of thematic maps expressing the variability of the parameters of surface albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface temperature. The results were consistent with literature data for different soil uses and climatic variations. These results demonstrate the potential of the geotechnologies for understanding the dynamics of the spatial and temporal patterns of biophysical processes of interaction soil-plant-atmosphere of the semi-arid 'Caatinga'.

Drawing on principles of the ecosystem resilience highlighted in the literature, we built on the theory of dissipative structures to develop a conceptual model of the ecosystem resilience of forests. A hierarchical indicator system was designed with the influencing factors of the forest ecosystem resilience, including the stand conditions and the ecological memory, which were further disaggregated into specific indicators. Furthermore, indicator weights were determined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the coefficient of variation method. Based on the remote sensing data and forest inventory data and so forth, the resilience index of forests was calculated. The result suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem resilience of forests, indicating it is feasible to generate large-scale ecosystem resilience maps with this assessment model, and the results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of forests, which is of great significance to the climate change mitigation.

Here we test the applicability of a simple multibeam sonar classification method developed for fjord environments to map the distribution of shelf-depth substrates and gorgonian coral- and sponge-dominated biotopes. The studied area is a shelf-depth feature Learmonth Bank, northern British Columbia, Canada and the method was applied aiming to map primarily non-reef forming coral and sponge biotopes. Aside from producing high-resolution maps (5 m(2) raster grid), biotope-substrate associations were also investigated. A multibeam sonar survey yielded bathymetry, acoustic backscatter strength and slope. From benthic video transects recorded by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) six primary substrate types and twelve biotope categories were identified, defined by the primary sediment and dominant biological structure, respectively. Substrate and biotope maps were produced using a supervised classification mostly based on the inter-quartile range of the acoustic variables for each substrate type and biotope. Twenty-five percent of the video observations were randomly reserved for testing the classification accuracy. The dominant biotope-defining corals were red tree coral Primnoa pacifica and small styasterids, of which Stylaster parageus was common. Demosponges and hexactinellid sponges were frequently observed but no sponge reefs were observed. The substrate classification readily distinguished fine sediment, Sand and Bedrock from the other substrate types, but had greater difficulty distinguishing Bedrock from Boulders and Cobble. The biotope classification accurately identified Gardens (dense aggregations of sponges and corals) and Primnoa-dominated biotopes (67% accuracy), but most other biotopes had lower accuracies. There was a significant correspondence between Learmonth's biotopes and substrate types, with many biotopes strongly associated with only a single substrate type. This strong correspondence allowed substrate types to function as a surrogate for helping to map biotope distributions. Our results add new information on the distribution of corals and sponges at Learmonth Bank, which can be used to guide management at this location. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sinha, P; Kumar, L; Drielsma, M; Barrett, T				Sinha, Priyakant; Kumar, Lalit; Drielsma, Michael; Barrett, Tom			Time-series effective habitat area (EHA) modeling using cost-benefit raster based technique	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												For successful characterization of ecological processes and prioritization of habitat networks it is necessary to describe and quantify landscape structure and connectivity. However, at landscape scale, it is highly impractical to measure and map all elements of biodiversity, and therefore, biodiversity surrogates are commonly used to represent biodiversity values. Land cover and vegetation are most often used as a biodiversity surrogate. The study investigated how land use change affects the status of the biodiversity surrogates in terms of the loss or gain of habitat (areal extent), loss of habitat condition (degradation) and habitat fragmentation. Effective habitat area (EHA) and raster based cost-benefit analysis (CBA) modeling techniques were used for the assessment of the impact of land use change scenarios on wildlife habitat as biodiversity surrogates. The modeling was carried out on time-series land cover data from 1972 to 2009 for the Liverpool Range of New South Wales (NSW). The model estimated the future condition of vegetation in each and every grid-cell in the region as a function of current condition, existing land cover, and the threatening processes. The results indicated a continuous pattern of clearing in the region, while the habitat conditions were mostly static throughout the study period. There was a decline in EHA after 1993, by 3%. Clearing was identified as the main cause of such decline during the change period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

LAND DEGRADATION IN DOLJ COUNTY, SOUTHERN ROMANIA: ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES, IMPACTS AND RESPONSES	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Central and Eastern Europe is experiencing significant land degradation, at the same time as social, economic and political transformation, and within the broader context of global climate change. This paper uses satellite data, primary field data and secondary information on Romania's social, political and economic dynamics, in a mixed-method case study analysis of the drivers of, and responses to, environmental change and land degradation over the period 1984-2007. The analytical time frame encompasses the Socialist era, as well as transition to European Union membership, allowing identification of the ways in which the dominant political economic and social systems interact with biophysical factors and play out in the landscape. Although the Socialist era is often portrayed as environmentally destructive, results indicate that management during this time developed a relatively stable landscape, albeit at an economic and social cost. In the lead up to the collapse of Socialist governance, the landscape altered more, resulting in worsening land degradation and land cover change. Responses to land degradation have taken two main routes: land abandonment and tree planting. Although aspects of these responses are now more democratic and participatory, at the same time, they share some common ground with Socialist era approaches. Building on the positive aspects of Socialist management strategies yields important lessons in addressing land degradation challenges more broadly. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In recent years, Chongqing and its surroundings have been experiencing severe environmental problems, such as urbanization, pollution, and deforestation, due to the rapid economic development of China's inland region. Understanding the current land-cover status over a wide scale, as well as changes in land-cover over time, are necessary for improving the urban environment and implementing conservation measures in the Chongqing region. In this study, remote-sensing data from 1993 and 2001 were used to analyze land-cover changes. Due to the distinctive mountainous topography of Chongqing, digital topography data shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM)-3 were also used. The results of the analysis showed that urban area increased from 109.91 km(2) (5.7%) in 1993 to 166.84 km(2) (8.7%) in 2001. This increase came at the expense of agricultural and vegetated areas. Although irrigated paddy field and dry farm land decreased due to the development, these two land-cover categories still covered the largest agricultural area. Correlating the land-cover changes with different topography types, the results showed that forest covered a larger area and enjoyed a higher frequency of distribution at higher elevations and on steeper slopes. The increase in urban area, in contrast, was apparently associated with lower elevations and milder slopes. These results indicate that incorporating terrain characteristics into remote-sensing analysis can be a useful tool in developing conservation measures for vegetated and agricultural areas.

It evaluates the stock of NC, analyzes the characteristics of, and identifies the key drivers for, spatial and temporal change in NC in the deltaic region from 2000 to 2010. A main contribution is the novel incorporation of remote sensing data that explains the dynamics of the spatio-temporal change in land use and a set of ecosystem service indicators derived from it The study focuses on key indicators for key ecosystem services related to carbon sequestration, grain production and water supply. The indictors reflect the spatial heterogeneity of NC across diverse ecosystems in the region. Each indicator builds on land use configuration and land use composition information derived from 250 m 16-day MODE and Landsat TM remote sensing data for 2000 and 2010, with adjustment parameters being constructed. The regional evaluation shows an overall degradation of ecosystem services, reducing total NC by 10.4% (or 8.44 billion yuan) in 2000-2010. The spatial distribution of NC exhibits a declining pattern from the south to the north of the delta. At the city level, 15 out of 16 major cities in the region have experienced dramatic loss of NC, and this pattern is significantly correlated with rapid urbanization, population growth and industrialization. Land use/land cover change and deteriorating water quality are dominant factors causing NC depletion, while increased grain productivity and environmental policies help offset the NC losses. Outcomes of this research are useful to policy makers to mitigate the declines in NC through balancing the growth between economy and population. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hennings, I; Herbers, D				Hennings, Ingo; Herbers, Dagmar			Suspended sediment signatures induced by shallow water undulating bottom topography	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Near-surface signatures of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) related to submerged bed forms displayed in visible band data gathered by space-borne imaging sensors are described. Detailed Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data of vertical current velocity component, echo intensity, modulation of SSC and related oceanographic and meteorological observations in a tidal inlet of the North Sea have been analyzed. To understand the associated hydrodynamics of the optical imaging mechanism theoretical considerations based on the Navier Stokes and sediment continuity equations have been carried out. As a first approximation these theoretical results explain signatures of enhanced SSC of in situ measurements and analyzed space-borne images. Strong currents flowing over steep bottom topography are able to stir up the sediments to form both a general continuum of SSC and localized pulses of higher SSC in the vicinity of the causative bed feature itself. The "strain rate" equivalent to the current gradient is an important parameter describing near water surface oceanographic and meteorological phenomena in the visible and microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum observed by shore- and ship-based as well as air- and space-borne remote sensing systems. Significant disagreements between theoretical results of the "strain rate" generated by the surface current and in situ observations at the crests of submerged ridges and sand waves were identified. Possible explanations could be: first, the current velocity may not be barotropic near the crests of such bed forms and second, mass conservation may not only be maintained through an acceleration or deceleration of the flow. This implies that active up- and downwelling effects of the three-dimensional current field can also play a significant role for hydrodynamic interaction between current and underwater bed forms.

Lichen mats, however, can be heavily overgrazed at high deer densities, triggering area abandonment or population declines. Although the species' management and conservation require precise information on the quality of winter grazing areas, no reliable and cost-efficient methods are available to date to measure lichen volume across wide and remote areas. We developed a new Lichen Volume Estimator, LVE, using remote sensing and field measurements. We used a Landsat TM land cover mask to separate lichen heath communities from other vegetation types and, therein, we predicted lichen volume from a two dimensional Gaussian regression model using two indexes: the Normalized Difference Lichen Index, NDLI (Band 5 - Band 4/ Band 5 + Band 4), and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index, NDMI (Band 4 - Band 5 / Band 4 + Band 5). The model was parameterized using 202 ground measurements equally distributed across a gradient ranging from 0 to 80 lichen dm(3)/m(2) (R-2 = 0.74 between predicted and observed ground measurements), and was validated with a ten-fold cross validation procedure (R-2 = 0.67), which also showed a high parameter stability. The LW can be a valuable tool to predict the quality of winter pastures for reindeer and caribou and, thus, help to improve the species' management and conservation. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Landscape-scale variation in plant community composition of an African savanna from airborne species mapping	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Information on landscape-scale patterns in species distributions and community types is vital for ecological science and effective conservation assessment and planning. However, detailed maps of plant community structure at landscape scales seldom exist due to the inability of field-based inventories to map a sufficient number of individuals over large areas. The Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) collected hyperspectral and lidar data over Kruger National Park, South Africa, and these data were used to remotely identify >500000 tree and shrub crowns over a 144-km(2) landscape using stacked support vector machines. Maps of community compositional variation were produced by ordination and clustering, and the importance of hillslope-scale topo-edaphic variation in shaping community structure was evaluated with redundancy analysis. This remote species identification approach revealed spatially complex patterns in woody plant communities throughout the landscape that could not be directly observed using field-based methods alone. We estimated that topo-edaphic variables representing catenal sequences explained 21% of species compositional variation, while we also uncovered important community patterns that were unrelated to catenas, indicating a large role for other soil-related factors in shaping the savanna community. Our results demonstrate the ability of airborne species identification techniques to map biodiversity for the evaluation of ecological controls on community composition over large landscapes.

Savanna woody vegetation classification - now in 3-D	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionThe co-existence of woody plants and grasses characterize savannas, with the horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of trees creating a heterogeneous biotic environment. To understand the influence of biogeophysical drivers on the spatial patterns of 3-D structure of woody vegetation, these patterns need to be explained over large areas to capture the context. Is there a spatially explicit, ecologically meaningful way to capture the patterns and context of 3-D woody vegetation structure? LocationClassification development and testing sites: landscapes in Bushbuckridge Municipality, Sabi Sand Wildtuin and Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga province, north-east South Africa. MethodsThe aforementioned structural classification approach requires appropriate 3-D and spatially explicit remote sensing data. A LiDAR-based canopy height model (CHM) and volumetric pixel (voxel) data from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory Alpha system were used to create the structural classification. First, we segmented the CHM images using multi-threshold and multi-resolution image segmentation techniques, and classified the image segments into four height classes, namely shrub (1-3m), low tree (3-6m), high tree (6-10m) or tall tree (>10m). A hierarchical a priori approach was used to develop classification criteria. The following metrics were calculated for 0.25-ha grid cells based on the cover and spatial arrangement of the four height classes: canopy cover, sub-canopy cover, canopy layers, Simpson's diversity index and cohesion. Top of canopy vegetation was classified using each metric at the 0.25-ha scale, with canopy cover being the primary classification metric. Subsequently, individual layers identified within the canopy were classified using the voxel data. We use a code system for describing classes to ensure standardization between different regions; a more traditional naming system may be used in addition for interpretation. ConclusionThis system provides a more comprehensive classification of the horizontal and vertical structural diversity of savannas compared to the traditional vegetation classification systems. The description of multi-layers within the canopy should allow for a sensitive change detection method. The classification can be used in many current focus areas, including habitat suitability mapping for biodiversity conservation, strategic adaptive management and monitoring land-cover change.

J	Romshoo, SA; Rashid, I				Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad; Rashid, Irfan			Assessing the impacts of changing land cover and climate on Hokersar wetland in Indian Himalayas	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in wetlands and assessing their causal factors is critical for developing robust strategies for the conservation and restoration of these ecologically important ecosystems. In this study, the spatiotemporal changes in the land cover system within a Himalayan wetland and its catchment were assessed and correlated using a time series of satellite, historical, and field data. Significant changes in the spatial extent, water depth, and the land system of the Hokersar wetland were observed from the spatiotemporal analysis of the data from 1969 to 2008. The wetland area has shrunk from 18.75 km(2) in 1969 to 13 km(2) in 2008 with drastic reduction in the water depth of the wetland. The marshy lands, habitat of the migratory birds, have shrunk from 16.3 km(2) in 1969 to 5.62 km(2) in 2008 and have been colonized by various other land cover types. The land system and water extent changes within the wetland were related to the spatiotemporal changes in the land cover and hydrometeorological variables at the catchment scale. Significant changes in the forest cover (88.33-55.78 km(2)), settlement (4.63-15.35 km(2)), and water bodies (1.75-0.51 km(2)) were observed in the catchment. It is concluded that the urbanization, deforestation, changes in the hydrologic and climatic conditions, and other land system changes observed in the catchment are the main causes responsible for the depleting wetland extent, water depth, and biodiversity by adversely influencing the hydrologic erosion and other land surface processes in the catchment. All these causes and effects are manifest in the form of deterioration of the water quality, water quantity, the biodiversity changes, and the decreasing migratory bird population in the wetland.

J	Huang, YH; Jiang, D; Zhuang, DF; Zhu, YQ; Fu, JY				Huang, Yaohuan; Jiang, Dong; Zhuang, Dafang; Zhu, Yunqiang; Fu, Jingying			An improved approach for modeling spatial distribution of water use profit-A case study in Tuhai Majia Basin, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water use profit (WUP) has been recognized as an important indicator of water resources management. This paper presents a set of models for evaluating the spatial distribution of economic and ecological WUP. The outputs of the models are detailed with a higher resolution than those in traditional WUP evaluation. Evapotranspiration (ET), which can be retrieved from remote sensing images, is regarded as the water consumption at the basin scale. The gridded GDP and ecosystem service value (ESV) are derived as indices of economic and ecological profits respectively. This method is applied in the Tuhai Majia Basin, North China. Agriculture is both economically and ecologically fundamental in the study area. The economic WUP of the whole basin (4.87 Yuan/m(3)) is slightly higher than the value of primary industry (3.39 Yuan/m(3)) and lower than the value of the secondary industry and tertiary industry (9.84 Yuan/m(3)). The ecological WUP of the whole basin (87.29 Yuan/m(3)) is quite close to the value of farm land. Water and wet land conservation and the development of barren land are important for ecological WUP improvement. Moreover, the dataset of WUP generated based on our method in this paper can be used for multi-scale analysis and be helpful to basin water resource management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We aim to show that remote sensing (RS), as demonstrated for terrestrial protected areas, has the potential to provide key information to support MPA management. We review existing literature on the use of RS to monitor biodiversity surrogates, e.g. ecological (e.g., primary productivity) and oceanographic (e.g., Sea Surface Temperature) parameters that have been shown to structure marine biodiversity. We then highlight the potential for RS to inform marine habitat mapping and monitoring, and discuss how RS can be used to track anthropogenic activities and its impacts on biodiversity in MPAs. Reasons for low integration of RS in MPA management and current limitations are also presented. This work concludes that RS shows great promise to support wildlife managers in their efforts to protect marine biodiversity around the world, in particular when such information is used in conjunction with data from field surveys.

The Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and the General Habitat Categories (GHC) System have been proposed by the remote sensing and ecological research community, respectively, for the classification of land covers and habitats across various scales. Linking the two systems can be a major step forward towards biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing. The translation between the two systems has proved to be challenging, largely because of differences in definitions and related difficulties in creating one-to-one relationships between the two systems. This paper proposes a system of rules for linking the two systems and additionally identifies requirements for site-specific contextual and environmental information to enable the translation. As an illustration, the LCCS classification of the Le Cesine protected area in Italy is used to show rules for translating the LCCS classes to GHCs. This study demonstrates the benefits of a translation system for biodiversity monitoring using remote sensing data but also shows that a successful translation is often depending on the degree of ecological knowledge of the habitats and its relationship with land cover and contextual information.

The decline of Afro-Palaearctic migrants and an assessment of potential causes	IBIS												There is compelling evidence that Afro-Palaearctic (A-P) migrant bird populations have declined in Europe in recent decades, often to a greater degree than resident or short-distance migrants. There appear to have been two phases of decline. The first in the 1960s-1970s, and in some cases into the early 1980s, largely affected species wintering predominantly in the arid Sahelian zone, and the second since the 1980s has mostly affected species wintering in the humid tropics and Guinea forest zone. Potential drivers of these declines are diverse and are spread across and interact within the migratory cycle. Our knowledge of declining species is generally better for the breeding than the non-breeding parts of their life cycles, but there are significant gaps in both for many species. On the breeding grounds, degradation of breeding habitats is the factor affecting the demography of the largest number of species, particularly within agricultural systems and woodland and forests. In the non-breeding areas, the interacting factors of anthropogenic habitat degradation and climatic conditions, particularly drought in the Sahel zone, appear to be the most important factors. Based on our synthesis of existing information, we suggest four priorities for further research: (1) use of new and emerging tracking technologies to identify migratory pathways and strategies, understand migratory connectivity and enable field research to be targeted more effectively; (2) undertake detailed field studies in sub-Saharan Africa and at staging sites, where we understand little about distribution patterns, habitat use and foraging ecology; (3) make better use of the wealth of data from the European breeding grounds to explore spatial and temporal patterns in demographic parameters and relate these to migratory pathways and large-scale patterns of habitat change and climatic factors; and (4) make better use of remote sensing to improve our understanding of how and where land cover is changing across these extensive areas and how this impacts A-P migrants. This research needs to inform and underpin a flyway approach to conservation, evaluating a suite of drivers across the migratory cycle and combining this with an understanding of land management practices that integrate the needs of birds and people in these areas.																	0019-1019	1474-919X				JAN	2014	156	1					1	22		10.1111/ibi.12118								WOS:000328545700001						
J	Tian, YH; Jim, CY; Wang, HQ				Tian, Yuhong; Jim, C. Y.; Wang, Haiqing			Assessing the landscape and ecological quality of urban green spaces in a compact city	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The interrelated nature of landscape metrics calls for their joint application in analyzing complicated landscape patterns and associated ecological processes. Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types. The findings could inform the landscape-pattern design of UGS in compact cities to optimize their ecological qualities and benefits to both nature and residents, and to reinforce urban nature conservation.

It forms dense and extensive green underwater meadows which provide important ecological functions and services and harbour highly diverse communities; as such it is identified as a priority habitat type for conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Dir 92/43/CEE). Over the last decades many Posidonia oceanica meadows have disappeared or have been altered. Efficient monitoring is the key of the ecosystem conservation. Monitoring of vast areas covered by Posidonia oceanica is extremely difficult, costly and time consuming and generates pronounced need for new methods and tools. This case study presents potential and promote use of lightweight autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with the remote sensing payload as the environmentally non-destructive monitoring method. The study was performed from 2011 to 2013 on the Croatian island Murter during the "Breaking the Surface" - international interdisciplinary field training of marine robotics and applications. Four AUVs equipped with different payloads were performing the missions in the study area. This paper presents results and analysis of different aspects important for the monitoring such as compliance with the existing monitoring indicators and descriptors used to assess the conservation status of P. oceanica, performance of the AUVs and their sensor sets, cost and time efficiency of the monitoring and geographical-localisation accuracy of the data collected.																	2325-369X		978-1-4799-5901-3				2014							758	763										WOS:000400962700127

Take the Ten Tributaries upstream as an example. Based on remote sensing and GWAS technology, soil erosion intensity was calculated and comparatively analyzed using two methods of "soil erosion classification and grading standards" and RUSLE by means of precipitation, vegetation, land use, soil and slope data for the three typical years in Ten Tributaries upstream. The results showed that the inversion results of light and above erosion were roughly the same in 1990, 2000 and 2010. Based on "soil erosion classification and grading standard" minute and moderate erosion was main in three typical years; Minute erosion area was the most based on RUSLE, and the area of minute, light, moderate, Intensive, strength, serious erosion showed a gradual decrease except 1990 year. Compared the both methods, it found that RUSLE considering factor was more comprehensive, closer to the actual simulation, applicable to soil erosion quantitative research.																			978-1-4799-6636-3				2014							717	720		10.1109/ICICTA.2014.174								WOS:000380483200167

Soil conservation is one of the important ecological service functions of ecosystem, which is benefit for improve ecological environment and realize economy sustainable development. The soil conservation functions of ecosystem mainly include maintaining soil fertility, reducing waterway silt-up and protecting topsoil. Beijing area was chosen as study area, of which the ecosystem changed rapidly. Time series LandSat images were used to analyze the dynamic change of spatial pattern of ecosystem in Beijing area in recent thirty years. By using the method of opportunity cost, the study evaluated the ecosystem service value of soil conservation and analyzed its dynamic change of spatial pattern. Results showed that the order of ecosystem service value in Beijing area was 1978 > 1992 > 2000 > 2010. Because of the close relation with soil erosion, the ecosystem service value fluctuated with yearly precipitation. The main contributors of ecosystem service value of soil conservation were forest, of which the proportion could reach above 80%. The government was committed to promoting the percentage of forest cover, so the forest was the stable contributor for soil conservation in Beijing area.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900066

They play an irreplaceable role in biodiversity conservation, control of global climate change, water purification and mitigation of flood disaster. Thus, extracting information of wetlands has become very important. Recent years the rapid development of high spatial resolution remote sensing technology provides great potential for improvement of data sources and advancing methods for quantitative acquisition and analysis of wetland information. It is well known that object-oriented method is a relatively new technology for landscape segmentation. Although there are some reports in application of object-oriented analysis for extraction of wetland information in China, there is still a lack of studies on the impacts of used segmentation techniques on accuracy of classification. In this study, an excellent image region segmentation method which appeared in the recent years, called mean shift segmentation algorithm, was used to extract the information of wetland in the East Dongting Lake of China and the obtained results were compared with those from a conventional segmentation algorithm provided by ENVI EX. The assessment of the results was conducted using four kinds of quantitative indicators and based on the accuracy of interpretation. The results showed that the conventional segmentation algorithm was unable to provide the accurate segmentation results in delineation of wetland areas. Integrating the edge detection information of NDVI and the mean shift segmentation algorithm not only could make it possible segmentation of shallow water bodies, but also could lead to much better classification results than using the traditional method and the mean shift segmentation alone.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900101

Thus, the health status of tree species is worthy of major concern. Every year various tree species especially rare tree species disappear from natural disasters or plant disease and insect pests. However, many trees can be saved if effective measures are taken through early diagnostics of health. Due to the potential of hyperspectral data in detecting the changes of tree leaves in colors, moisture, and materials due to natural disasters or plant disease and insects, hyperspectral data can be used to monitor the health status of trees and achieve the health diagnosis of trees and forests. In this study, a hyperspectral radiometer with spectrum range of 350 nm to 2500 nm from ASD company was used to observe high-density hyperspectral changes of tree leaves due to defoliation for the tree species of metasequoia glyptostroboides and ginkgo biloba, with time period of September 2013 to December 2013. First order differential and its logarithmic transformations were employed for processing the hyspectral data. The results showed that the peak location of visible light reflectance for the tree species was highly related to their health status. The peaks of spectral reflectance appeared at the locations of 550 nm and 650 nm identified the healthy and dead leaves, respectively. In addition, the peaks appeared at yellow band implied the sub-healthy of trees. This finding has critical significance for early health diagnosis of tree species.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900095

Monitoring ecological management could provide the effect of the program and form the information base upon which sound planning decisions were made. The paper monitored forest resources and soil erosion on one example of Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province in three time series using Landsat TM/MSS, GIS and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Monitoring forest resources revealed that forest type area changed with the development of the program, forestry land increased significantly, woodland and young afforestation land increased significantly. At the same time soil erosion area decreased in Zhongyang County by 30556ha from the beginning of the program to the present. Soil erosion intensity decreased from more severe degree to moderate degree. TNSP improved ecological environment significantly in forest resources and soil conservation. The lands with decreased soil erosion intensity happened because of planting trees on barren mountains, returning farmlands with the slope gradient of more than 25 degree to forestland, managing forestland after fulfilling TNSP, and returning slope land to terrace after farmland capital construction. The lands with increased soil erosion intensity because of converting broadleaved forest land to open forest land, shrub land to unused land and slope farmland.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900034

Taken Zhalong national natural reserve(NNR) as a case study, through the application of an index called differenced Normalized Burn Ratio(dNBR) to measure wildfire severity and other RS and GIS spatial analysis tools, the relationships between the wildfire severity and potential environmental factors were studied, the effects of wildfire severity on the habitats of redcrowned cranes and the responses of red-crowned cranes to the wildfire disturbance were also discussed. The following conclusions are achieved: the wildfire severity varied in different functional zones, while the wildfire severity of the core area was the highest among all the zones; that of the buffer zone was the secondary, and the test zone and the ecologically planning zone the lowest. The core zone, which is low-lying and the scope of the altitude is between 148 m and 154 m and the vegetation is dominantly reeds, tends to burn. The responses of the red crane population in the study area were to flee away and colonize new habitats. But the new colonized habitats showed the tendency of being close to the burned areas rather than far away from them. The study provides references for the conservation of the study area.																	2380-8039		978-1-4799-4184-1				2014																		WOS:000366526900081						
J	Takahashi, R; Todo, Y				Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki			The impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation using remote sensing and household data	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW												In recent years, shade coffee certification programs have attracted increasing attention from forest conservation and development organizations. The certification programs could be expected to promote forest conservation by providing a premium price to shade coffee producers. However, little is known about the significance of the conservation efforts generated by certification programs. In particular, the relationship between the impact of the certification and producer characteristics has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation and its relationship with the socioeconomic characteristics of the producers. Remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 was used to gauge the changes in forest area. Employing a probit model, we found that a forest coffee area being certified increased the probability of forest conservation by 193 percentage points relative to forest coffee areas lacking certification. We also found that although economically poor producers tended to engage in forest clearing, the forest coffee certification program had a significant impact on these producers. This result suggests that the certification program significantly affects the behaviors of economically poor producers and motivates these producers to conserve the forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A good example is the Natura 2000 ROSCI0103 Lunca Buzaului (Buzau and Braila Counties, Romania). This protected area was established with the purpose of conserving habitats and species characteristic of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, in a region with significant anthropic stress generated by alluvial deposits exploitation, waste storage, agricultural activity, and hydro energy producing potential. The need to put such area in value requires an integrated approach, based on the use of GIS and remote sensing data. In this study, the following resources have been used: Pleiades panchromatic and multispectral images at 0.5 and 2 m spatial resolution, orthophotos with a 2.5 m spatial resolution, a digital terrain model (DTM) based on a 30 m network, topographical plans with 1: 5000 and 1: 10000 scales, thematic vectors for land using - after Corine Land Cover 2006 data sets. The time difference in the acquirement of images, the exploitation of all the aforementioned data, provides the possibility of having a time scale perspective, between 1970 and 2012. The data have been processed using specific software - ArcGis 10.0 for management of spatially referenced data, ENVI EX for remote sensing data processing and RockWorks 12 for geological and hydrogeological data processing. In the next step, processed remote sensing data, correlated with field collected data has led to the following processes:. Design of the flooding areas, along Buzau River and an environmental impact assessment associated with different scenarios;. Evaluation of actual fluvial erosion processes for the Buzau River system, both under natural state and influenced by the alluvial material extraction activities which are taking place in the area. From geomorphological point of view, the specificity of this habitat is given by the pronounced dynamic processes and, consequently, by the necessity of efficient land management. The results related to the extension of flooding areas at different flow rates, morphological instability, and the presence of erosional risk sections, have been correlated with land use characteristics (from Corine Land Cover) for the entire studied region. Obtained results: GIS data base, flooding and geomorphological risk maps. All these are useful useful for developing effective management plans in order to achieve conservation objectives for species and habitats, for mitigating environmental impact, and for elaborating a geological resources sustainable exploitation strategy.																	1314-2704		978-619-7105-12-4				2014							581	588										WOS:000371300000074

Any drastic and abrupt changes in this system can have repercussion beyond mitigation in form of natural disasters. Remote sensing can play a key role in risk assessment and management, particularly when a few simultaneous reasons coincide, for example, susceptibility to natural disaster and the urban sprawl, spreading over highly vulnerable regions. The present study furnish socioeconomic vulnerability mapping of the Bhagirathi basin through computation of the Socio vulnerability Index (SoVI). SoVI correlates vulnerability to natural or anthropogenic disasters to socio - economic development and illustrates how developmental parameters alter equation of potential effect and recovery in event of a natural catastrophe in the study region. An analytical framework has been imparted to understand possible triggering factors of disasters. Built up area expansion; land use land cover change (LULCC) - deforestation, conversion of forested land into agricultural land and residential settlements, and dam project area; road network development; urbanization; population growth & migration and pilgrimage activities are major drivers which put burden on limited carrying capacity of the natural resources. A guideline for policy making has been presented for an integrated and wholesome development incorporating regional developmental aspiration of the people and ingredients of sustainable development.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						77	84		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-77-2014								WOS:000368425300013

Landuse / landcover mapping was considered as the key component to prioritize locations for constructing appropriate recharge structures. Joganbedi scheme was proposed for this study. Joganbedi is situated 13 km. from Khargone, district Khargone, Madhya Pradesh, India. Command area of the proposed scheme lies in Beda sub-basin which is a tributary of the Narmada River. This area is of hard rock terrain and is occupied by the Deccan basalt. The main objective of the study was surface water conservation and management via multi-spectral information resulting from remotely sensed data to increase irrigation. High resolution GeoEye1 stereo images were used for generation of DEM, contour, landuse/landcover mapping, lineaments and drainage mapping. DEM was used for canal alignment. and further, contours were used to determine catchment, submergence /FRL, and command areas. Landuse/landcover statistics of submergence area helped to identify different land classes within the study area. These parameters are required for scheme planning. Additionally, rainfall data, maximum drawdown level, and dam height were collected as supporting parameters. The study concludes that landuse/landcover mapping is useful in identification of surface water conservation and management plan for irrigation purpose. It also proves that implementation of Joganbedi scheme will increase the cultivated area under irrigation, facilitate the farmers for multi season cropping and help in improving their economic condition.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						405	409		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-405-2014								WOS:000368425300063

SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF DEFORESTATION AND FOREST FRAGMENTATION (1930-2013) IN EASTERN GHATS, INDIA	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				The tropical forests are the most unique ecosystems for their potential economic value. Eastern Ghats, a phytogeographical region of India has rugged hilly terrain distributed in parts of five states, viz. Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The present study is mainly aimed to analyse the trends in deforestation and its role in forest fragmentation of Eastern Ghats. The long term changes in forest cover with its spatial pattern over time has been assessed by analyzing a set of topographical maps and satellite remote sensing datasets. The multi-source and multi-date mapping has been carried out using survey of India topographical maps (1930's), Landsat MSS (1975 and 1985), IRS 1B LISS-I (1995), IRS P6 AWiFS (2005) and Resourcesat-2 AWiFS (2013) satellite images. The classified spatial data for 1930, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013 showed that the forest cover for the mentioned years are 102213 km(2) (45.6%), 76630 (34.2%), 73416 km(2) (32.7%), 71730 km(2) (32%), 71305 km(2) (31.8%) and 71186 km(2) (31.7%) of the geographical area of Eastern Ghats respectively. A spatial statistical analysis of the deforestation rates and forest cover change were carried out based on distinctive time phases, i.e. 1930-1975, 19751985, 1985-1995, 1995-2005 and 2005-2013. The spatial analysis was carried out first by segmenting the study area into grid cells of 5 km x 5 km for time series assessment and determining spatial changes in forests. The distribution of loss and gain of forest was calculated across six classes i.e. < 1 km(2), 1-5 km(2), 5-10 km(2), 10-15 km(2), 15-20 km(2) and > 20 km(2). Landscape metrics were used to quantify spatial variability of landscape structure and composition. The results of study on net rate of deforestation was found to be 0.64 during 1935 to 1975, 0.43 during 1975-1985, 0.23 during 1985-1995, 0.06 during 1995-2005 and 0.02 during 2005-2013. The number of forest patches increased from 2688 (1930) to 13009 (2013). The largest forest patch in 1930 represents area of 41669 km(2) that has reduced to 27800 km(2) by 2013. Thus, it is evident that there is a substantial reduction in the size of the very large forest patches due to deforestation. According to spatial analysis, among the different land use change drivers, agriculture occupies highest area, followed by degradation to scrub and conversion to orchards. The dominant forest type was dry deciduous which comprises 37192 km(2) (52.2%) of the total forest area of Eastern Ghats, followed by moist deciduous forest (39.2%) and semi-evergreen forest (4.8%) in 2013. The change analysis showed that the large scale negative changes occurred in deciduous forests and semi-evergreen forests compared to wet evergreen forests due to high economic potential and accessibility. This study has quantified the deforestation that has taken place over the last eight decades in the Eastern Ghats. The decline in overall rate of deforestation in recent years indicates increased measures of conservation. The change analysis of deforestation and forest fragmentation provides a decisive component for conservation and helpful in long term management of forests of Eastern Ghats.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						637	644		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-637-2014								WOS:000368425300099

IMPROVED CLASSIFICATION OF MANGROVES HEALTH STATUS USING HYPERSPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING DATA	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Mangrove ecosystem plays a crucial role in costal conservation and provides livelihood supports to humans. It is seriously affected by the various climatic and anthropogenic induced changes. The continuous monitoring is imperative to protect this fragile ecosystem. In this study, the mangrove area and health status has been extracted from Hyperspectral remote sensing data (EO-1Hyperion) using support vector machine classification (SVM). The principal component transformation (PCT) technique is used to perform the band reduction in Hyperspectral data. The soil adjusted vegetation Indices (SAVI) were used as additional parameters. The mangroves are classified into three classes degraded, healthy and sparse. The SVM classification is generated overall accuracy of 73% and kappa of 0.62. The classification results were compared with the results of spectral angle mapper classification (SAM). The SAVI also included in SVM classification and the accuracy found to be improved to 82%. The sparse and degraded mangrove classes were well separated. The results indicate that the mapping of mangrove health is accurate when the machine learning classifier like SVM combined with different indices derived from hyperspectral remote sensing data.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						667	670		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-667-2014								WOS:000368425300103

The urban environmental issues related to land use and land cover, greenness, surface wetness and impervious surface were assessed using change detection, SAVI, MNDWI and IBI models respectively. The land surface temperature (LST) was also retrieved from thermal infrared band of each Landsat TM, ETM+ and Landsat 8. Based on these parameters, the urban expansion, urban heat island effect and the relationships of LSTs to other biophysical parameters were analyzed. Results indicate the area ratio of impervious surface in Pune sub-urban zone increased significantly, which grew from 1.41% in 1967 to 8.47% in 1992 and further to 22.45% and 44.7% in 2002 and 2014 respectively. Simultaneously, the intensity of urban heat island increased in observed years. A correlation analyses revealed that, the association of impervious surface to other two variables i.e. greenness and land surface wetness is negatively correlated (R-2 = 0.616 and 0.607 respectively). Whereas, LST possessed a strong positive correlation with impervious surfaces (R-2 = 0.658). The present study provided an integrated research approach and the outcome of the study is very useful in environmental modelling and sustainable development of urban areas and natural resources conservation.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						717	724		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-717-2014								WOS:000368425300111

In this context, ICIMOD and regional partners have evolved Transboundary Landscape concept to address the issues of conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and systems (e.g., biodiversity, rangelands, farming systems, forests, wetlands, and watersheds, etc.). This concept defines the landscapes by ecosystems rather than political/administrative boundaries. The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is extremely heterogeneous, with complex inter linkages of biomes and habitats as well as strong upstream-downstream linkages related to the provisioning of ecosystem services. Seven such transboundary landscapes, identified across west to east extent of HKH, have been considered for programmatic cooperation, include: Wakhan, Karakoram-Pamir, Kailash, Everest, Kangchenjunga, Brahmaputra-Salween, and Cherrapunjee-Chittagong. The approach is people centered and considers the cultural conservation as an essential first step towards resource conservation efforts in the region. Considering the multi-scale requirements of study, the geospatial technology has been effectively adopted towards: (i) understanding temporal changes in landscapes, (ii) long term ecological and social monitoring, (ii) identifying potential bio corridors, (iii) assessing landscape level vulnerability due to climatic and non-climatic drivers, and (iv) developing local plans on extractions of high value economic species supporting livelihoods, agroforestry system and ecotourism, etc. We present here our recent experiences across different landscapes on assessment of three decadal changes, vegetation type mapping, assessment of socio-ecological drivers, corridor assessment, ecosystem services assessment, models for optimal natural resource use systems and long term socio-ecological monitoring.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1309	1317		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1309-2014								WOS:000368425300208

Water is the most crucial for maintaining an environment and ecosystem conducive to sustaining all forms of life. The principle of watershed management is the proper management of all the precipitation by the way of collection, storage and efficient utilization of runoff water and to recharge the ground water. The present study aim's to identify suitable zones for water harvesting structures in Pisangan watershed of Ajmer district, Rajasthan by using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi Criteria Evaluation (MSE). Multi criteria evaluation is carried out in Geographic Information system to help the decision makers in determining suitable zones for water harvesting structures based on the physical characteristics of the watershed. Different layers which were taken into account for multi criteria evaluation are; Soil texture, slope, rainfall data (2000-2012), land use/cover, geomorphology, lithology, lineaments, drainage network. The soil conservation service model was used to estimate the runoff depth of the study area Analytical Hierarchy Processes (AHP) is used to find suitable water harvesting structures on the basis of rainfall. Produced suitability map will help in the selection of harvesting structures such as percolation tanks, storage tank, check dams and stop dams.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1471	1482		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1471-2014								WOS:000368425300232

Multi-century changes in vegetation structure and fuel availability in fire-sensitive eucalypt woodlands	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding how communities change with time since fire is critical for identifying appropriate fire return intervals for biodiversity conservation. In infrequently-burnt communities, vegetation structure, habitat features and fuel availability can change over time-scales much longer than can be measured using contemporary remote-sensing approaches, creating challenges for conservation and fire management. To characterize longer-term patterns of vegetation structural change, we measured vegetation cover, ground cover, tree density and stand basal area across a multi-century time-since-fire sequence derived from growth ring-size relationships in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands of south-western Australia. We hypothesized that: (i) vegetation structural components reflecting fuel availability increase with time since fire; (ii) recovery of vegetation structural components with time since fire requires long time-frames; and (iii) vegetation components indicating senescence are more evident in mature than intermediate fire-age classes. All vegetation structural components showed significant differences between time-since-fire classes (termed 'young', 'intermediate' and 'mature'), and to a lesser extent between years of sampling. The two vegetation structural components with the highest covers overall, and hence likely greatest contributors to fuel availability, were vegetation 4-10 m high and ground fuel. These two layers showed non-monotonic changes indicating a peak at intermediate times since fire (similar to 35-150 or 35-250 years; depending on the model used to estimate stand age), conflicting with the common assumption that fuel availability increases with time since fire. Total stand basal area increased rapidly after fire then appeared to stabilize beyond about 100 years, with competition likely mediating density-dependent thinning such that declining plant density offset increasing trunk size. There was little evidence for an increase in standing dead vegetation in mature woodlands such as would suggest significant senescence when long-unburnt Replacement of mature woodlands with intermediate time-since-fire woodlands with greater cover and connectivity of key fuel layers potentially instigates a self-reinforcing fire regime shift favouring larger and/or more uniform fires. If such changes eventuate, substantial losses in conservation values in E. salubris woodlands are likely. Elucidating these changes in vegetation structure and implications for conservation management only became feasible due to the development of methods to estimate the time since fire of vegetation not burnt for hundreds of years.

Applying the information of slop and vegetation coverage layers into the corresponding space grid by using the function of zonal statistics and analysis, it can realize overlay analysis based on Standards for Classification and Gradation of Soil Erosion (SL190-2007), and obtains the map of soil erosion intensity of the monitoring region. Finally, according to Specifications for Assessment of Forest Ecosystem Services (LY/T1721-2008) and monitoring data of typical plot, the soil and water conservation value from cropland to forest was evaluated quantitatively in 2009. The results showed that the area, on and below the moderate level, was 93600 ha, taking up 50.03% of total conversion of farmland to forest area (185100 ha), which indicates a 14.64 million (t/a) of soil conversion, and a 1520 million Yuan for erosion control. The results of the study showed that the soil and water conservation was very effective.																	2193-1801					DEC 11	2013	2			1					S7	10.1186/2193-1801-2-S1-S7								WOS:000209467400007	24701390

Analysing the gross and net deforestation rates in India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Monitoring of forests has gained vital recognition in the international scenario due to realization of its role in carbon sequestration, biodiversity and global warming. Through advancement of remote sensing and GIS technology it is possible to monitor and analyse gross and net changes in forest ecosystems. This article analyses the deforestation rates and drivers of deforestation in India and summarizes the Government initiatives for conservation of forests based on the published literature. It also reviews gross and net rate of deforestation from the national level to locale scale. At the national level, Forest Survey of India has been carrying out mapping of forest cover on a biennial basis. The current estimate of gross deforestation in India is quite low (-0.43%) for 2009-2011 compared to the global average of -0.6%. Even though considerable progress has been made in the protection of forests, gross deforestation rate continues as a focal hindrance. The deforestation studies carried out in various parts of India are found to be fragmentary and far from being comprehensive. From the regional analysis carried out, it can be seen that the overall net rate of deforestation was relatively high in the North East region (-0.90 to -5.29) and Deccan Peninsula (-0.19 to -3.2) followed by the Western Ghats. For precise estimation of gross and net deforestation, consistency in definitions, uniform methodology and new techniques for quantifying forest cover have been realized.																	0011-3891					DEC 10	2013	105	11					1492	1500										WOS:000329537600018

An Exploratory Assessment of a Smartphone Application for Public Participation in Forest Fuels Measurement in the Wildland-Urban Interface	FORESTS												Wildfire management in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) protects property and life from wildland fire. One approach that has potential to provide information about the amount and location of fuels to forest managers and, at the same time, increase public knowledge and engagement in reducing wildfire threats is public participation in scientific research (PPSR)-also known as citizen science-where members of the public participate in the research process. In this exploratory study, residents of a wildfire-affected community tested a smartphone application to collect data about forest fuels and answered questions about wildfire, their community, and experiences using the application. In this paper, the application is introduced, the volunteers' motivations, attitudes, and behaviors are considered, and the potential of using a PPSR approach for wildfire management discussed. Although there are practical challenges to applying PPSR approaches to wildfire hazard management, the participants in this study demonstrated the potential of PPSR to increase awareness and understanding of actions that can reduce the threat of wildfire. Wildfire managers may consider utilizing PPSR approaches to engage the community in wildfire preparedness.

Mangrove biomass estimation in Southwest Thailand using machine learning	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. Accurate assessments of mangrove biomass at the site-scale are lacking, especially in mainland Southeast Asia. This study assessed tree biomass and species diversity within a 151 ha mangrove ecosystem on the Andaman Coast of Thailand. High-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, medium resolution ASTER satellite elevation data, field-based tree measurements, published allometric biomass equations, and a suite of machine learning techniques were used to develop spatial models of mangrove biomass. Field measurements derived a whole-site tree density of 1313 trees ha(-1), with Rhizophora spp. comprising 77.7% of the trees across forty-five 400 m(2) sample plots. A support vector machine regression model was found to be most accurate by cross-validation for predicting biomass at the site level. Model-estimated above-ground biomass was 250 Mg ha(-1); below-ground root biomass was 95 Mg ha(-1). Combined above-ground and below-ground biomass for the entire 151-ha stand was 345 (+/- 72.5) Mg ha(-1), equivalent to 155 (+/- 32.6) Mg C ha(-1). Model evaluation shows the model had greatest prediction error at high biomass values, indicating a need for allometric equations determined over a larger range of tree sizes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A.; Bohrer, Gil; Harris, Stephen			In search of greener pastures: Using satellite images to predict the effects of environmental change on zebra migration	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Historically, ungulate migrations occurred in most grassland and boreal woodland ecosystems, but many have been lost due to increasing habitat loss and fragmentation. With the rate of environmental change increasing, identifying and prioritizing migration routes for conservation has taken on a new urgency. Understanding the cues that drive long-distance animal movements is critical to predicting the fate of migrations under different environmental change scenarios and how large migratory herbivores will respond to increasing resource heterogeneity and anthropogenic influences. We used an individual-based modeling approach to investigate the influence of environmental conditions, monitored using satellite data, on departure date and movement speed of migrating zebras in Botswana. Daily zebra movements between dry and rainy season ranges were annotated with coincident observations of precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data set and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). An array of increasingly complex movement models representing alternative hypotheses regarding the environmental cues and controls for movement was parameterized and tested. The best and most justified model predicted daily zebra movement as two linear functions of precipitation rate and NDVI and included a modeled departure date as a function of cumulative precipitation. The model was highly successful at replicating both the timing and pace of seven actual migrations observed using GPS telemetry (R-2=0.914). It shows how zebras rapidly adjust their movement to changing environmental conditions during migration and are able to reverse migration to avoid adverse conditions or exploit renewed resource availability, a nomadic behavior which should lend them a degree of resilience to climate and environmental change. Our results demonstrate how competing individual-based migration models, informed by freely available satellite data, can be used to evaluate the weight of evidence for multiple hypotheses regarding the use of environmental cues in animal movement. This modeling framework can be applied to quantify how animals adapt the timing and pace of their movements to prevailing environmental conditions and to forecast migrations in near real time or under alternative environmental scenarios.

A thorough understanding of these processes is essential to determining whether distant populations are connected and how to adapt management plans to patterns in connectivity. Managers may erroneously assume that local populations are isolated when they are actually replenished by distant reefs beyond their jurisdiction. Researchers increasingly rely on numerical hydrodynamic models that simulate the spatio-temporal dispersal of larvae by ocean currents to elucidate these connections and guide marine spatial planners, yet relatively little work has been done to validate these models with empirical data. In this study, we tested a dispersal simulation model against in situ observations of young post-larval fish to investigate a whether larvae settling at La Reunion (in the western Indian Ocean) might have originated at Mauritius, 200 km distant. First, we collected post larval specimens of honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra) shortly after an episodic mass settlement that occurred in 2002 at La Reunion. Using sclerochronology, we established the age of the fish from their otoliths. Finally, we simulated dispersal of larvae from La Reunion, Mauritius, and other reefs in the region by ocean currents using a 20 Eulerian advection-diffusion model driven by current velocities derived from satellite remote sensing. The simulation suggested that larvae spawned at la Reunion were carried away from the island while larvae spawned at Mauritius were carried to La Reunion. The otolith-derived ages of the fish were compatible with this hypothesis, when we accounted for the time required for larvae to drift from Mauritius to La Reunion. The combined results suggest a dispersal connection from Mauritius to la Reunion. To best maintain populations of adult reef fish at La Reunion, managers should protect stocks spawning at Mauritius. Although more study is needed to characterize patterns of regional connectivity and account for seasonal and inter-annual variations in these patterns, the example presented here demonstrates the possibility of distant connections in the western Indian Ocean. We urge managers in the region to look beyond their own jurisdictions, view their jurisdictions as part of a connected network, and undertake a collaborative approach to protecting the network as a whole.

J	Cunningham, S; Guzman, HM; Bates, R				Cunningham, Sarah; Guzman, Hector M.; Bates, Richard			The morphology and structure of the Hannibal Bank fisheries management zone, Pacific Panama using acoustic seabed mapping	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The Hannibal Bank sits within the Coiba UNESCO World Heritage Site in Pacific Panama and is also a fisheries management zone. Despite the protected status of the area and the importance of the Bank for commercial fish species such as snapper and tuna, the seamount has received no detailed survey except some collection of organisms. This study mapped the major topographic features and complexity of the Hannibal Bank seamount using acoustic remote sensing. A survey area of around 125km(2) was defined using existing charts and side-scan sonar data were collected during July 2008. A bathymetric output was imported to ArcGIS where a digital bathymetric model and slope map were created. The Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) extension for ArcGIS was used to calculate bathymetric position index and rugosity, and used to create a map of zones representing the various seabed morphology zones. The Hannibal bank is an elongated, triangular guyot (flat topped seamount), which ranges in depth from 53m to 416m, covers an area of 76km(2) and is 14.4km long and 7.1km wide. Hannibal bank is composed of steep slopes, more gentle slopes, top of the seamount, crests (elevated ridges at the top of the pinnacles), rugose areas (on crests, top of seamount and slope), gullies and pinnacles. The bank is asymmetric in nature with the Northerly side having a relatively gentle slope with gullies across the surface compared to the SouthWest side which is far steeper and more rugose. There are two pinnacles to the North and South East of the bank that range in depth from 180 to 333m. Rocky substrate makes up 22.6km(2) of the bank and sediment 37.8km(2). The bank and its steeply sided, rugose areas and pinnacles provide upright structures which can disrupt and topographically enhance currents, increasing productivity. The rugose areas of Hannibal Bank should be primary targets for further research efforts as they may contain corals and their rugosity indicates that these should be some of the highest faunal diversity areas of the bank. Hannibal Bank is likely to come increasing pressure in the future through climate change and fishing and this study has produced valuable information to assist in the future mapping and management of habitats, associated species and fisheries.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2013	61	4					1967	1979										WOS:000329534400031	24432547

A remote sensing and GIS based study in assessment of the degradation risk of the Kolonnawa marsh	JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SRI LANKA												A majority of the Sri Lankan wetlands is under threat of degradation mainly due to urbanization, population pressure and industrialization. This study was conducted to detect the changes and to assess and map the degradation risk of the Kolonnawa marsh located in the Western Province of Sri Lanka by analyzing the data collected through field surveys, remote sensing and GIS techniques. A questionnaire survey was conducted within 11 Grama Niladhari (GN) Divisions around the marsh to obtain information on household characteristics, interactions with the marsh, awareness on marsh degradation and marsh conservation. According to the temporal change assessment performed with Landsat TM (1992), Landsat ETM+ (2002) satellite images, 32 % of the marsh area has been reduced in 1992 - 2002 period. According to Worldview 2 image, the total marsh area including the associated waterways in 2010 was 144.56 ha. A risk index was formulated considering the risk factors prevailing in the study area. Risk mapping, which was carried out based on the risk index resulted in three risk classes; moderate, high and very high. Mapping based on the risk index was helpful to identify the severity of the degradation risk of the marsh at GN Division level. The study identified that all surrounding GN Divisions pose risk on degradation of the marsh while the highest impact was reported from the Obesekarapura GN Division. The risk matrix was identified as an important tool in prioritizing the areas for conservation.																	1391-4588					DEC	2013	41	4					327	335		10.4038/jnsfsr.v41i4.6256								WOS:000329258000009

A Geographic Information System (GIS)-based approach for relating anthropogenic impact and environmental stress: a case study within the African Albertine Rift	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												This study introduces a potentially cost-effective methodology to assess habitat quality remotely using anthropogenic variables derived from both Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing. We related anthropogenic impact to organism-level response across the Albertine Rift of East-Africa, which was measured using body condition (BC) in Lophuromys aquilus, the dark-coloured brush-furred rat. We chose seven variables to measure anthropogenic impact, ranging from land cover/land use to nighttime light radiance. Using a principal component analysis, we extracted four components that describe human impact and correlated each with BC. We documented that BC tended to be higher in more disturbed areas. We recommend this GIS-based methodology to relate anthropogenic impact to organismal-level response in the Albertine Rift region, and we provide broad guidelines for its application to assess habitat quality for species of conservation concern.																	1010-6049	1752-0762				DEC 1	2013	28	8					707	732		10.1080/10106049.2012.743600								WOS:000328188200003

The use of digital elevation models (DEMs) enables precise mapping of runoff pathways for identifying where greater runoff loads can be intercepted and treated with buffers. Five different DEM-based targeting indexes were compared and contrasted for the degree to which they identify similar locations in watersheds: Flow Accumulation [S.K. Jenson and J.O. Domingue (1988). Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing 54:1593], Wetness Index [I.D. Moore, R.B. Grayson, and A.R. Ladson (1991). Hydrological Processes 5:3], Topographic Index [M.T. Walter, T.S. Steenhuis, V.K. Mehta, D. Thongs, M. Zion, and E. Schneiderman (2002). Hydrological Processes 16: 2041], and the Water Inflow and Sediment Retention Indexes [M. G. Dosskey, Z. Qiu, M.J. Helmers, and D.E. Eisenhauer (2011b). Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 66: 362]. The indexes were applied in two different watersheds, one in New Jersey and one in Missouri. Results showed that they all tend to target similar locations in both watersheds which traces to the importance of larger contributing area to the rankings by each index. Disagreement among indexes traces to other variables which enable more accurate targeting under particular hydrologic circumstances. Effective use of these indexes poses special challenges, including selecting an index that better describes the hydrologic circumstances in a watershed and is simple enough to use, ensuring the accuracy of the DEM, and determining a maximum index value for the appropriateness of vegetative buffers. When properly applied, each index can provide a standardized basis and effective spatial resolution for targeting buffer placement in watersheds.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	2013	49	6					1270	1283		10.1111/jawr.12083								WOS:000327608200004

We developed a logical approach based on remote sensing to monitor the conservation status of P. australis beds in response to environmental gradients and orient future management actions in Lake Garda (northern Italy). During the 2010 growing season we collected data on: (i) the structural and functional status of seven P. australis beds and (ii) land cover in a 50-m buffer around each bed, and we tested four different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from a multi-temporal and multisensor dataset. Double hierarchical clustering based on the VI statistics and environmental variables (morphological, functional and land-use) showed a good consistency between the outputs of the vigor-function analysis and the environmental classification of the P. australis beds considered. Overall, the bed's area was the most influential factor in the data clustering procedures, followed by the descriptors derived from the enhanced vegetation index. Our results confirmed the importance of temporal characteristics of remote sensing data to assess the conservation status of common reed beds and proved the sensitivity of VIs and derived descriptors to local environmental conditions within a homogeneous littoral area. This study supports the utility of remote sensing for monitoring riparian vegetation and analyzing the spatial and temporal response of P. australis populations to human pressure and management actions.

J	Dai, XY; Ma, JJ; Zhang, H; Xu, WC				Dai, Xiaoyan; Ma, Junjie; Zhang, Hao; Xu, Wencheng			Evaluation of ecosystem health for the coastal wetlands at the Yangtze Estuary, Shanghai	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Despite the growing awareness of the important ecological functions and values provided by coastal and estuarine wetlands, wetland degradation continues worldwide due to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Chongming Dongtan wetlands, adjacent to Shanghai, the largest city and industrial and trading port in China in rapid urban expansion and socioeconomic development are currently threatened with biodiversity reduction, wetland loss, contamination, and invasion of exotic plant. Sustainable protection and management of Dongtan Nature Reserve necessitate research to develop diagnostic tools and indicators for a comprehensive and objective assessment of wetland ecosystem health condition. Based on the pressure-state-response framework and ecological and environmental surveys at the Dongtan wetlands, an indicator system was established for evaluating the coastal wetlands ecosystem health, using indicators detected from satellite imagery and current field surveys. Through the establishment of health assessment units and spatial quantification of the indicators, the spatial clustering analysis, integrated with remote sensing and geographic information system technique was applied to make an accurate diagnosis of ecosystem health for Chongming Dongtan wetlands and highlight the areas in subhealthy and unhealthy condition and urgent need of conservation and management. The results from this research indicated that the ecosystem health condition at the Dongtan wetlands showed spatial variation, to a certain extent, corresponding to the distributions of elevation and land cover types. More than 75 % of the total study area was at a relatively healthy level, with 34.19 km(2) for the very healthy zone and 41.08 km(2) for the healthy zone, while the subhealthy and unhealthy zones covered 18.23 and 4.76 km(2), respectively. This study demonstrated the potential for this integrated approach to give objective and effective evaluation of ecosystem health for the dynamic coastal and estuarine wetlands and provide up-to-date information to assist with early warning for ecological security and management decisions for Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				DEC	2013	21	6					433	445		10.1007/s11273-013-9316-4								WOS:000327861300005						
J	Sutton, TT				Sutton, T. T.			Vertical ecology of the pelagic ocean: classical patterns and new perspectives	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Applications of acoustic and optical sensing and intensive, discrete-depth sampling, in concert with collaborative international research programmes, have substantially advanced knowledge of pelagic ecosystems in the 17years since the 1996 Deepwater Fishes Symposium of the Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Although the epipelagic habitat is the best-known, and remote sensing and high-resolution modelling allow near-synoptic investigation of upper layer biophysical dynamics, ecological studies within the mesopelagic and deep-demersal habitats have begun to link lower and upper trophic level processes. Bathypelagic taxonomic inventories are far from complete, but recent projects (e.g. MAR-ECO and CMarZ, supported by the Census of Marine Life programme) have quantitatively strengthened distribution patterns previously described for fishes and have provided new perspectives. Synthesis of net and acoustic studies suggests that the biomass of deep-pelagic fishes may be two to three orders of magnitude greater than the total global commercial fisheries landings. Discrete-depth net sampling has revealed relatively high pelagic fish biomass below 1000m in some regions, and that gelatinous zooplankton may be key energy vectors for deep-pelagic fish production. Lastly, perhaps, the most substantive paradigm shift is that vertical connectivity among fishes across classical depth zones is prevalent- suggesting that a whole-water column approach is warranted for deep ocean conservation and management.																	0022-1112	1095-8649				DEC	2013	83	6					1508	1527		10.1111/jfb.12263								WOS:000327713800002	24298949

Results of simulation studies can be applied to develop sustainable agricultural systems. This study simulated SOC in clayey Humic Hapludox with Century model (version 4.0) in a subtropical climate, with support from historical soil and land-use surveys; GIS and remote sensing techniques. Major reductions in SOC stocks were observed after land under native vegetation was converted to agricultural use, especially under annual crops managed under conventional tillage. Simulations of these soils under current management to the year 2058 showed that soils under conservation systems (especially no tillage) can recover and in some cases even exceed the original SOC stocks under native vegetation.

J	McPherson, EG; Xiao, QF; Aguaron, E				McPherson, E. Gregory; Xiao, Qingfu; Aguaron, Elena			A new approach to quantify and map carbon stored, sequestered and emissions avoided by urban forests	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												This paper describes the use of field surveys, biometric information for urban tree species and remote sensing to quantify and map carbon (C) storage, sequestration and avoided emissions from energy savings. Its primary contribution is methodological; the derivation and application of urban tree canopy (UTC) based transfer functions (t C ha(-1) UTC). Findings for Los Angeles and Sacramento illustrate the complex role of regional and local determinants. Although average tree density and size were substantially greater in Los Angeles, the mean C storage density (8.15 t ha(-1)) was 53 percent of Sacramento's (15.4 t ha(-1)). In Sacramento, native oaks with very high wood densities (815 kg m(-3)) accounted for 30 percent of total basal area. In Los Angeles, the most dominant taxa had relatively low wood densities (350-550 kg m(-3)). The inclusion of relatively more wooded land in the Sacramento study area may partially explain higher C storage levels. In Los Angeles, where development is relatively dense, 14 percent of all trees surveyed shaded more than one building compared to only 2 percent in Sacramento. Consequently, the transfer function for avoided emissions in Los Angeles (2.77 t ha(-1) UTC yr(-1)) exceeded Sacramento (2.72 t ha(-1) UTC yr(-1)). The approach described here improves C estimates and increases the resolution at which C can be mapped across a region.

Aeolian desertification of this area is an important concern. Remote sensing and GIS technology were employed to assess the trends in aeolian desertification from 1975 to 2005. The monitoring results showed that, aeolian desert land increased from 15,112 to 17,214 km(2) during 1975-2005. In addition, it was found that the area of aeolian desertification increased rapidly from 1975 to 1990, was stable from 1990 to 2000, and slightly decreased from 2000 to 2005. Increasing temperature, overgrazing, and drainage of wetlands have been key driving factors of aeolian desertification. Thus, to control the expansion of aeolian desert lands in the source region of the Yellow River and to rehabilitate existing desert areas, the priority should be given to altering human behavior in these areas.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2013	70	7					3245	3254		10.1007/s12665-013-2389-9								WOS:000326928600029

To a large extend, management objectives can be defined in terms of vegetation attributes. Vegetation maps are frequently used in conservation planning and evaluation. Nowadays, remote sensing is one of the most important sources of vegetation cover classifications at different scales. In this paper, the usefulness of moderate resolution images for invasive species Cirsium arvense and Stachys byzanthina mapping at local scale is evaluated. A fuzzy classification approach is tested for improved discrimination of invasive species. The study was carried out in Vazroud rangelands located in the Mazandaran province of Iran. In this study among the analysed Z-score for uncertainty map creation is found that 0.9, 1.0 for TM image and 1.1 for IRS image in normalized are the best based on known attributes of the study area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				DEC	2013	41	4					749	755		10.1007/s12524-013-0261-8								WOS:000326935700002						
J	Takahashi, R; Todo, Y				Takahashi, Ryo; Todo, Yasuyuki			The impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation: A case study from a wild coffee forest in Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In recent years, shade coffee certification programs have attracted increasing attention from conservation and development organizations. Certification programs offer an opportunity to link environmental and economic goals by providing a premium price to producers and thereby contributing to forest conservation. However, the significance of the conservation efforts of certification programs remains unclear because of a lack of empirical evidence. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest conservation. The study was conducted in the Belete-Gera Regional Forest Priority Area in Ethiopia, and remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 were used to gauge the change of forest area. Using propensity score matching estimation, we found that forests under the coffee certification program were less likely to be deforested than forests without forest coffee. By contrast, the difference in the degree of deforestation between forests with forest coffee but not under the certification program and forests with no forest coffee is statistically insignificant. These results suggest that the certification program has had a large effect on forest protection, decreasing the probability of deforestation by 1.7 percentage points. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, PP; Shao, MA				Zhang, Pingping; Shao, Ming'an			Temporal stability of surface soil moisture in a desert area of northwestern China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The patterns of soil moisture in arid environments are very important for the conservation and restoration of vegetation but have been rarely studied due to the difficulty of sampling in these environments. The characterization of the temporal stability of soil moisture and its statistical parameters is much needed. In this study, two sub-fields (southern and northern fields) with different topographies and soil properties in a region of the desert area in northwestern China were chosen to evaluate the temporal persistence of surface soil moisture, identify representative locations for reliably estimating the field mean moisture content, and investigate the factors influencing the temporal stability of soil moisture. Surface soil moisture was measured approximately every two weeks from April to October 2012 with a Theta Probe, for a total of 13 sampling campaigns. Soil moisture for the southern, finer-textured field was higher and more variable than for the northern, coarser-textured field. High Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (p < 0.01) indicated a strong temporal stability of spatial patterns for both fields. Tests of relative difference indicated that soil moisture content was more stable under dry than under wet conditions. The representative locations identified for both fields accurately estimated the field mean moisture content, with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.981 to 0.998 and root mean square errors (RMSEk) ranging from 0.12% to 0.81% vol/vol. Among the methods for estimating the field mean moisture content using the representative locations, i.e. minimal SDRD (standard deviation of relative differences), ITS (index of temporal stability), MABE (mean absolute bias error), and RMSE (root mean square error), the minimal SDRD with a constant offset provided the best results. Correlation analysis revealed that (in descending order of importance) bulk density, total porosity, soil-particle composition, and soil organic carbon were the main factors influencing the temporal stability of soil moisture in this relatively flat region. Locations with relatively higher sand contents tended to have more pronounced temporal stabilities. This study contributes to our understanding of soil moisture patterns in arid environments, which have important implications for ground sampling design, hydrologic modeling, and sustainable land use.

Mapping natural habitats using remote sensing and sparse partial least square discriminant analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This work presents a novel approach for mapping the spatial distribution of natural habitats in the Foothills of Larzac' Natura 2000 listed site located in a French Mediterranean biogeographical region. Sparse partial least square discriminant analysis was used to analyse two RapidEye data sets (June 2009 and July 2010) with the purpose of choosing the most informative spectral, textural, and thematic variables that allow discrimination of habitat classes. The sparse partial least square discriminant analysis selected relevant and stable variables for the discrimination of habitat classes that could be linked to ecological or biophysical characteristics. It also gave insight into the similarities and differences between habitat classes with comparable physiognomic characteristics. The highest user accuracy was obtained for dry improved grasslands (u=91.97%) followed by riparian ash woods (u=88.38%). These results are very encouraging given that these two classes were identified in Annex 1 of the EC Habitats Directive as of Community interest. Due to limited data input requirements and its computational efficiency, the approach developed in this article is a good alternative to other types of variable selection approaches in a supervised classification framework and can be easily transferred to other Natura 2000 sites.					corbane, christina/0000-0002-2670-1302												0143-1161	1366-5901				NOV 10	2013	34	21					7625	7647		10.1080/01431161.2013.822603								WOS:000324459800012

Comparing field-based monitoring and remote-sensing, using deforestation from logging at Important Bird Areas as a case study	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Monitoring sites of biodiversity conservation importance is essential for their conservation. It allows threats to be identified and quantified, priorities to be set, responses to be developed, and facilitates adaptive management. Field-based monitoring protocols need to be simple enough to be widely applied in countries with limited capacity while being sufficiently robust to provide widely reliable data. A simple, globally standardised monitoring protocol is now being implemented at thousands of sites of global avian conservation significance (Important Bird Areas, IBAs) worldwide, but the consistency of the approach across sites, countries and regions remains untested. We tested the match between estimates of the threat to IBAs from logging derived from such monitoring, with standardised deforestation rates derived from remote sensing data for 2000-2005 to determine if the two were consistently related. We found a significant positive correlation between the impact of the threat from logging and the proportion of forest lost (although the gross forest loss did not differ systematically with the two components of the threat impact: scope and severity). The results give us some confidence that the simple field-based protocol being implemented by a diversity of surveyors with varied technical capacity can generate meaningful and consistent monitoring data across the globe.

J	Wallace, CSA; Villarreal, ML; van Riper, C				Wallace, Cynthia S. A.; Villarreal, Miguel L.; van Riper, Charles, III			Influence of monsoon-related riparian phenology on yellow-billed cuckoo habitat selection in Arizona	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimThe western yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis), a Neotropical migrant bird, is facing steep population declines in its western breeding grounds owing primarily to loss of native habitat. The favoured nesting habitat for the cuckoo in the south-western United States is low-elevation riparian forests and woodlands. Our aim was to explore relationships between vegetation phenology patterns captured by satellite phenometrics and the distribution of the yellow-billed cuckoo, and to use this information to map cuckoo habitat. LocationArizona, USA. MethodsLand surface phenometrics were derived from satellite Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), bi-weekly time-composite, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for 1998 and 1999 at a resolution of 1km. Fourier harmonics were used to analyse the waveform of the annual NDVI profile in each pixel. To create the models, we coupled 1998 satellite phenometrics with 1998 field survey data of cuckoo presence or absence and with point data that sampled riparian and cottonwood-willow vegetation types. Our models were verified and refined using field and satellite data collected in 1999. ResultsThe models reveal that cuckoos prefer areas that experience peak greenness 29days later, are 36% more dynamic and slightly (<1%) more productive than their average cottonwood-willow habitat. The results support a scenario in which cuckoos migrate northwards, following the greening of riparian corridors and surrounding landscapes in response to monsoon precipitation, but then select a nesting site based on optimizing the near-term foraging potential of the neighbourhood. Main conclusionsThe identification of preferred phenotypes within recognized habitat can be used to refine future habitat models, inform habitat response to climate change, and suggest adaptation strategies. For example, models of phenotype preferences can guide management actions by identifying and prioritizing for conservation those landscapes that reliably exhibit highly preferred phenometrics on a consistent basis.

LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF WOODY VEGETATION DYNAMICS IN THE CONTEXT OF A 'GREENING SAHEL': A CASE STUDY FROM BURKINA FASO	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												After decades of drought in the Sahel, several studies have reported a (re)greening' of the area. However, most of these studies were based on large scale climatological or remotely sensed observations, with little or no ground truthing. The aim of this study was to assess the local perceptions of the distribution of socio-economically important tree species in the Sub-Sahel of Burkina Faso. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 87 groups of informants from 20 villages belonging to three ethnic groups (Mossi, Fulani and Samo). Univariate and multivariate statistics were used to compare perceptions between the targeted ethnic groups. According to the locals, more than 80 per cent of the 90 listed species were declining, with over 40 per cent identified as threatened, including numerous plants of great economic value. Increasing species were mostly drought-tolerant plants such as Balanites aegyptiaca. A few species were listed as locally extinct. Gender and age did not significantly affect local knowledge, whereas ethnicity did. The major causes of species decline were identified to be drought, deforestation and bushfires. In all ethnic groups, informants observed a southward shift in species distribution. Local perceptions suggest a general decline in woody vegetation. Thus, the alleged (re)greening in the Sahel might not have reversed the degradation of woody species in the area. Data derived from local ecological knowledge were consistent with that of many ecological studies, suggesting the reliability of people's knowledge for obtaining ecological data. Information from this study can be used as baseline for conservation of species identified as threatened. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wang, JY; Liu, YS; Liu, ZG				Wang, Jieyong; Liu, Yansui; Liu, Zhigao			Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Cropland Conversion in Response to the "Grain for Green Project" in China's Loess Hilly Region of Yanchuan County	REMOTE SENSING												To prevent environmental degradation, China's central government launched the "Grain for Green Project" (GGP) in 1999. Since its beginning, the effects and influences of the GGP have been hotly debated among domestic and international scholars and policymakers. This paper is taking the County of Yanchuan in the Loess Plateau as a case study, examines the spatio-temporal patterns of cropland conversion in response to the GGP. This research is methodologically based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS), and also employs personal interviews with local government officials and farmers. The results show that land use/cover patterns in Yanchuan County have changed dramatically after the implementation of GGP. Cropland has decreased remarkably, while orchard land and sparse forest has increased significantly: 23.84% of cropland was converted to orchard, and 22.25% to sparse forest. Simultaneously, the landscape has become more fragmented but also more diversified, forestland has become more dominant. A total of 61.19% of the total converted cropland was on slopes greater than 15 degrees, 64.85% of which was lower-grade land. The converted cropland is mostly located in more accessible areas for convenient management. Partially affected by farmers' self-willingness, sloping cropland was preferred to orchard (economic forest), and some gentle slope (less than 15 degrees) or higher-grade cropland were involved in the GGP. To maintain and reinforce the achievements of the GGP and further contribute to the GGP's sustainability and rural development, the paper recommends that the Chinese government should build a continuous compensation mechanism for the households who lost cropland for the GGP while improving the productivity of flat cropland.																	2072-4292					NOV	2013	5	11					5642	5661		10.3390/rs5115642								WOS:000328626900013

Predictors were selected using variation inflation factor, then related to species density data using generalized additive models.Results The best-supported model included 11 variables and was clearly better (Akaike information criterion weight=0.47) than other models. The density of the Meadow Pipit reaches its highest levels on large areas of extensively used wet meadows as well as pastures where livestock graze and which show high photosynthetic activity in April.Conclusion Some aspects of the environment that were not identified from remote sensing data were vital for determining relatively high density. Conservation efforts for preserving Meadow Pipit populations should focus on maintaining wet meadows and extensively grazed pastures. Given the results, the Meadows Pipit may be classified as a good indicator of traditional agriculture.																	0006-3657	1944-6705				NOV 1	2013	60	4					500	508		10.1080/00063657.2013.849656								WOS:000327175800008

Assessment of river bank erosion in Southern Minnesota rivers post European settlement	GEOMORPHOLOGY												River bank erosion is one of the major sources of sediment for many rivers around the world. With the current emphasis on developing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for impaired waters in the United States, there is heightened interest in quantifying background sediment levels in rivers. In this study, we assessed variations in river bank erosion over time using a combination of 1855 Public Land Survey System plats, aerial photographs from 1938 to 2009, and light detection and ranging (lidar) data from 2005 to 2009 for sediment impaired rivers in Southern Minnesota. Results showed that bank erosion was episodic, making comparisons of erosion rates from dissimilar time intervals unreliable. For comparable time intervals, average river bank retreat rates (0.51 m yr(-1) from 1855 to 1938 vs. 0.37 m yr(-1) from 1938 to 2009) were statistically similar (t = 2.13, p = 0.14) suggesting that bank erosion rates have remained stable since European settlement. Comparisons over shorter time intervals of 1938-1971 and 1971-2009 also showed similar statistical trends (t = 0.76, p = 0.45) with average river bank retreat rates of 0.57 and 0.50 m yr(-1), respectively. However, additional 145 observations of bank retreat were found in the period 1971-2009 relative to 1938-1971, indicating that the number of actively eroding river banks may have increased over time. Contrary to assumptions made in the literature, bank erosion measurements using lidar data showed a poor relationship (r(2) = 0.01 to 0.36) with river bank physical features (face area, inclined surface area, length, slope, height, and aspect), thus suggesting that extrapolating a limited number of bank erosion observations to the whole length of a river will lead to erroneous predictions. This lack of relationship was expected considering that most of these bank physical features do not fully represent bank erosion processes such as seepage, freeze-thaw, river migration, under cutting and sapping. We conclude that, in assessing conservation measures or developing TMDLs to manage river sediment loads, (1) background levels of suspended sediments from river bank erosion should be established using comparable time intervals, and (2) up scaling of discrete volume loss measurements to an entire reach should be avoided.

We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained (D-2) and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5% to 63.1% and 0.77% to 0.97% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry.

National assessment of forest fragmentation in India: Landscape indices as measures of the effects of fragmentation and forest cover change	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Forest fragmentation is considered as one of the major conservation issue. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the national assessment of spatial patterns of forest fragmentation and influence of deforestation on fragmentation in the Indian forests during three decade interval (1975-2005). Mapping of forest cover was carried out based on Landsat MSS and IRS P6 AWiFS data using hybrid classification techniques on 1:250,000 scale. The present study considered biogeographic zones as a major stratum for national level assessment. The forest fragmentation was analysed based on landscape indices which allow quantification and categorisation of complex forest landscapes and depict landscape composition, structure and scenario of fragmentation. The analysis revealed that in all biogeographic zones, more than 90% of total number of forest fragments consists of patches having area less than 1 km(2). At national level the mean forest patch size stands at 187 ha. The total core area was highest for Islands (87.4%) followed by Eastern Himalayas (82.5%), Deccan (78.9%), Deserts (76.4%) and Eastern Ghats (76%). The temporal analysis shows that the loss of Indian forest area as 5.8% during 1975-2005. The annual rate of deforestation has been computed as 0.20% at national level. The decreased mean patch size, increased edge density and increased number of patches from 1975 to 2005 indicates ongoing fragmentation in biogeographic zones. The very high fragmentation in Trans Himalayas is contributed mostly by the natural factors while in other biogeographic zones, increased fragmentation is due to deforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The first objective of the article is to broaden the discussion of fragmentation by addressing social processes that generate it through the construction of roads. Roads impact land cover change worldwide, and their role in Amazonian deforestation is known. The article also seeks to extend the literature on roads to address the social processes and individual behaviors that create the road network architecture. The second objective is to open a discussion about the biodiversity implications of different patterns of forest fragmentation. Our specific focus is the geometry of settlement associated with urban nodes, referred to here as radial fragmentation. The article pursues its objectives by implementing a conceptual framework that extends the pattern-to-process paradigm of landscape ecology by adding a (social) process-to-pattern component. This is accomplished through a mixed-method approach including (1) field-based narratives of the social processes that gave rise to radial fragmentation in the hinterland of the town of Itaituba, an important settlement in the middle Tapajos valley; (2) remote sensing of the evolution of road networks, which we then link to deforestation in a temporal analysis of emergent fragmentation patterns; and (3) computational applications to compare the biodiversity implications of radial and fishbone landscape fragmentation.

Consequently, increased soil erosion can hamper a sustainable land management in the mountainous TGA. This paper presents the model framework TerraCE (Terrace Condition Erosion) for determining the causes for different terrace conditions and terrace degradation based on field surveys and spatial data mining. For a total of 987 bench terrace plots in the Xiangxi catchment we collected data on their state of maintenance and terrace design to account for terrace stability and thus capability of soil conservation. Assessing the driving factors of terrace degradation was done by embedding terrain-based predictors and distance-transforms of remote-sensing data as indicators of environmental and anthropogenic influences. Random forests classification and regression models were applied for data mining. Terrace degradation in the Xiangxi catchment is obvious. The sequence of degradation ranges from 'well maintained' (21%), 'fairly maintained' (44%), and 'partially collapsed' (23%) to 'completely collapsed' (11%) terraces. The cross-validation error of the supervised TerraCE model is below 8%, allowing for reasonable and valid interpretations of the causes of terrace degradation. Data mining reveals indicators for anthropogenic effects such as the distance to settlements or to roads as major drivers for the spatial distribution of terrace conditions. The effect of relief, which can be regarded as the major natural driver for terrace degradation by erosive action is tributary but altered and overlaid by land use dynamics associated with the Three Gorges Dam. An important indicator representing a combined effect of terrain and human activity is the distance to stream channels of different orders. Applying TerraCE we reveal mechanisms of terrace degradation in disturbed environments and present a framework for standardized mapping and analysis of terrace degradation under cultivation. The approach might also be used to develop guidelines for terrace planning in mountainous terraced landscapes of limited carrying capacity, with respect to socio-economic as well as environmental conditions.

J	Lombardo, U; Denier, S; May, JH; Rodrigues, L; Veit, H				Lombardo, Umberto; Denier, Sebastian; May, Jan-Hendrik; Rodrigues, Leonor; Veit, Heinz			Human-environment interactions in pre-Columbian Amazonia: The case of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The reconstruction of past environmental and historical events is much needed in Amazonia, a region at the centre of heated debates about the extent of pre-Columbian human disturbance of the natural ecosystems. Important aspects of this debate are to establish to what extent the rise of social complexity was influenced by the local geo-ecology; and what productive strategies were adopted in order to sustain these societies. The Llanos de Moxos (LM), in the Bolivian Amazon, is a vast floodplain made up of a variety of geo-ecological sub regions that host many different types of pre-Columbian earthworks. Therefore, it offers an excellent opportunity to compare different kinds of archaeological landscapes and their relationship to different pre-Columbian cultures and environmental settings. This paper analyses the links between pre-Columbian earthworks and the local geo-ecology in two regions of the LM: 1) the platform field region (PFR) in the north of Santa Ana de Yacuma, where the highest concentration of raised fields has been documented, and 2) the monumental mounds region (MMR) south and east of Trinidad, where >100 pre-Columbian monumental mounds are found. The study draws from remote sensing and GIS analysis, field work in the Bolivian lowlands, and laboratory analysis. Differences in the way people transformed the landscape in the PFR and MMR seem to respond to differences in the local geo-ecology of the two sites. The results also suggest that environmental conditions exerted an important, though not exclusive, control over the levels of social complexity that were reached in different areas of the LM.

Mapping resource use over a Russian landscape: an integrated look at harvesting of a non-timber forest product in central Kamchatka	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Small-scale resource use became an important adaptive mechanism in remote logging communities in Russia at the onset of the post-Soviet period in 1991. We focused on harvesting of a non-timber forest product, lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), in the forests of the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russian Far East). We employed an integrated geographical approach to make quantifiable connections between harvesting and the landscape, and to interpret these relationships in their broader contexts. Landsat TM images were used for a new classification; the resulting land-cover map was the basis for linking non-spatial data on harvesters' gathering behaviors to spatial data within delineated lingonberry gathering sites. Several significant relationships emerged: (1) mature forests negatively affected harvesters' initial choice to gather in a site, while young forests had a positive effect; (2) land-cover type was critical in determining how and why gathering occurred: post-disturbance young and maturing forests were significantly associated with higher gathering intensity and with the choice to market harvests; and (3) distance from gathering sites to villages and main roads also mattered: longer distances were significantly correlated to more time spent gathering and to increased marketing of harvests. We further considered our findings in light of the larger ecological and social dynamics at play in central Kamchatka. This unique study is an important starting point for conservation-and sustainable development-based work, and for additional research into the drivers of human-landscape interactions in the Russian Far East.

Single and Multi-Date Landsat Classifications of Basalt to Support Soil Survey Efforts	REMOTE SENSING												Basalt outcrops are significant features in the Western United States and consistently present challenges to Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil mapping efforts. Current soil survey methods to estimate basalt outcrops involve field transects and are impractical for mapping regionally extensive areas. The purpose of this research was to investigate remote sensing methods to effectively determine the presence of basalt rock outcrops. Five Landsat 5 TM scenes (path 39, row 29) over the year 2007 growing season were processed and analyzed to detect and quantify basalt outcrops across the Clark Area Soil Survey, ID, USA (4,570 km(2)). The Robust Classification Method (RCM) using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method and Random Forest (RF) classifications was applied to individual scenes and to a multitemporal stack of the five images. The highest performing RCM basalt classification was obtained using the 18 July scene, which yielded an overall accuracy of 60.45%. The RF classifications applied to the same datasets yielded slightly better overall classification rates when using the multitemporal stack (72.35%) than when using the 18 July scene (71.13%) and the same rate of successfully predicting basalt (61.76%) using out-of-bag sampling. For optimal RCM and RF classifications, uncertainty tended to be lowest in irrigated areas; however, the RCM uncertainty map included more extensive areas of low uncertainty that also encompassed forested hillslopes and riparian areas. RCM uncertainty was sensitive to the influence of bright soil reflectance, while RF uncertainty was sensitive to the influence of shadows. Quantification of basalt requires continued investigation to reduce the influence of vegetation, lichen and loess on basalt detection. With further development, remote sensing tools have the potential to support soil survey mapping of lava fields covering expansive areas in the Western United States and other regions of the world with similar soilscapes.

It may also vary in relation to species-specific reproductive strategies and social organization. The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), a highly social and sexually size-monomorphic wild camelid typical of arid lands, is ideal for evaluating behavioural responses of this type, since most studies have done on dimorphic ungulates in temperate environments, where trophic resources are abundant. We recorded the group size and social structure of guanaco during both dry and wet seasons of 2005-2007 in an Argentinean desert, where pumas (Puma concolor) are the sole predators. Remote sensing data were used to calculate five variables that reflected trophic availability and terrain morphology for each guanaco group and for an equivalent number of random controls. Habitat use did not differ between types of social groups but differed between seasons. Guanacos used less productive and less steep areas during the breeding season, irrespective of juvenile:adult ratios in the family groups, and larger groups occupied flatter areas. Overall, guanaco habitat selection prioritizes reducing predation risk to the extent that animals occupy areas offering the minimum productivity capable of meeting their energy requirements.

J	Portillo-Quintero, C; Sanchez-Azofeifa, A; do Espirito-Santo, MM				Portillo-Quintero, Carlos; Sanchez-Azofeifa, Arturo; do Espirito-Santo, Mario Marcos			Monitoring deforestation with MODIS Active Fires in Neotropical dry forests: An analysis of local-scale assessments in Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The detection of vegetation fires using remote sensing has proven useful for highlighting areas undergoing rapid conversion in humid forests, but not in tropical dry forest (TDF). To further understand this relationship, we explored the correlation between MODIS Active Fires and forest cover change at local scales using 3 x 3 km sampling grids in three TDF landscapes in Bolivia; Mexico, and Brazil. Our analysis showed no single overall correlation among sites between the frequency of fires reported by the MODIS Active Fire Mapping product and forest cover change. Also, aggregated patterns of fire occurrence in Brazil and Bolivia did not correspond to areas with high percentage of forest loss, which indicates that the fire/deforestation relationship in TDF is not apparent in a simple fire frequency map. However, statistically significant correlations were found in sampling boxes with 50-60%, 50-70%, 50-95% forest cover at "initial state" of the time series in the Mexican site, Bolivian site and Brazilian site, respectively. Our findings suggest that complex interactions between anthropogenic fire-use, satellite-detected fires, and deforestation in highly fragmented TDF landscapes are difficult to describe at regional scales and might only be possible to analyze using finer resolution sampling grids.

Detection and monitoring of green corridors and their relative functions are very important in terms of landscape management. They also carry information on changing speed from "green to grey" and fragmentation level of the urbanized regions. Analyzing the fragmentation level of the landscape formation reflects the management strategy and overall success of decision makers. This paper aims to assessment landscape fragmentation in relation to green corridor planning for the first time on coastal section of Trabzon and Rize city centers from South Eastern part of the Black Sea. The study area is densely populated coastal region with linear-littoral formation. Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information System (GIS) and in-situ techniques were used to detect pattern and role of green corridors in the study area. Green coverage was extracted by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. SVM classifier performed better on digital aerial images when compared to multispectral satellite data. After the classification, five land use/cover (LULC) classes were obtained: urban green areas, asphalt ways, water, other urban objects and shades with 94.64 and 96.53 overall accuracies for Trabzon and Rize cities, respectively. Shape related landscape metrics were computed to show the level of fragmented green covers in study area. Larger patches were observed in Rize with higher Largest Patch Index (LPI) values. Computed Area Weighted Mean Shape Index (AWMSI) and Area Weighted Mean Patch Fractal Dimension (AWMPFD) values indicated higher urbanization rates in Trabzon city. Green corridor networks were proposed for each city by considering the fragmentation level and landscape design rules. Finally, some implications were done towards creating ecologic cities in the context of sustainable landscape and ecological conservation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Mapping charcoal driven forest degradation during the main period of Al Shabaab control in Southern Somalia	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Following more than 20 years of civil unrest, environmental information for Southern Somalia is scarce while there is clear evidence that the war economy fuelled by the conflict is rapidly depleting the country's natural resources and especially the woody biomass. Wood charcoal production is one of the most relevant businesses supporting war regimes such as the extreme Islamist group Al Shabaab, which has ruled in Southern Somalia from 2006 to 2012 and is still occupying large areas. In this study we map and quantify the tree loss suffered by the region due to the rapid increase in illegal charcoal production and export over recent years. Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery is used to visually count charcoal production sites as a proxy of tree loss in two sample areas within the lower Juba region of Southern Somalia. The image interpretation allows mapping the charcoal production sites as well as estimating tree loss rates above 7% over 5 years. The results are crucial for understanding the exact dimension and effects of the loss of woody biomass and for planning conservation and recovery interventions in the concerned area.

J	Hylander, K; Nemomissa, S; Delrue, J; Enkosa, W				Hylander, Kristoffer; Nemomissa, Sileshi; Delrue, Josefien; Enkosa, Woldeyohannes			Effects of Coffee Management on Deforestation Rates and Forest Integrity	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Knowledge about how forest margins are utilized can be crucial for a general understanding of changes in forest cover, forest structure, and biodiversity across landscapes. We studied forest-agriculture transitions in southwestern Ethiopia and hypothesized that the presence of coffee (Coffea arabica)decreases deforestation rates because of coffee's importance to local economies and its widespread occurrence in forests and forest margins. Using satellite images and elevation data, we compared changes in forest cover over 37 years (1973-2010) across elevations in 2 forest-agriculture mosaic landscapes (1100 km(2) around Bonga and 3000 km(2) in Goma-Gera). In the field in the Bonga area, we determined coffee cover and forest structure in 40 forest margins that differed in time since deforestation. Both the absolute and relative deforestation rates were lower at coffee-growing elevations compared with at higher elevations (-10/20% vs. -40/50% comparing relative rates at 1800 m asl and 2300-2500 m asl, respectively). Within the coffee-growing elevation, the proportion of sites with high coffee cover (>20%) was significantly higher in stable margins (42% of sites that had been in the same location for the entire period) than in recently changed margins (0% of sites where expansion of annual crops had changed the margin). Disturbance level and forest structure did not differ between sites with 30% or 3% coffee. However, a growing body of literature on gradients of coffee management in Ethiopia reports coffee's negative effects on abundances of forest-specialist species. Even if the presence of coffee slows down the conversion of forest to annual-crop agriculture, there is a risk that an intensification of coffee management will still threaten forest biodiversity, including the genetic diversity of wild coffee. Conservation policy for Ethiopian forests thus needs to develop strategies that acknowledge that forests without coffee production may have higher deforestation risks than forests with coffee production and that forests with coffee production often have lower biodiversity value. Efectos de la Administracion Cafetalera sobre las Tasas de Deforestacion y la Integridad de los Bosques Resumen El conocimiento sobre como se utilizan los margenes de los bosques puede ser crucial para el entendimiento general de los cambios en la cubierta boscosa, la estructura de los bosques y la biodiversidad en el paisaje. Estudiamos transiciones bosque-agricultura en el suroeste de Etiopia y partimos de la hipotesis de que la presencia del cafe (Coffea arabica) disminuye las tasas de deforestacion por la importancia del cafe para las economias locales y su ocurrencia extensa en los bosques y los margenes de estos. Usando imagenes de satelite e informacion de elevacion, comparamos los cambios en la cubierta boscosa a traves de 37 anos (1973-2010) a lo largo de elevaciones en 2 paisajes mosaico de bosque y sembradios (1100 km(2) alrededor de Bonga y 3000 km(2) en Goma-Gera). En el campo en el area de Bonga determinamos la cobertura de cafe y la estructura del bosque en 40 margenes de bosque que difirieron en el tiempo desde la deforestacion. Tanto la tasa absoluta como la relativa de deforestacion fueron mas bajas en las elevaciones donde se cultiva cafe comparadas con las de elevaciones mas altas (-10/20% vs. -40/50% comparando tasas relativas en 1800 msnm y 2300-2500 msnm, respectivamente). Dentro de la elevacion donde se cultiva cafe, la proporcion de sitios con una alta cobertura de cafe (>20%) fue significativamente mas alta en los margenes estables (42% de los sitios que habian estado en la misma localidad durante el periodo entero) que en los margenes con cambios recientes (0% de los sitios donde la expansion anual de cultivos habian alterado el margen). El nivel de perturbacion y de estructura del bosque no difirio entre los sitios con 30% o 3% de cafe. Sin embargo, un creciente cuerpo de literatura sobre los gradientes de administracion del cafe en Etiopia reportan los efectos negativos del cafe sobre la abundancia de especies especialistas de bosques. Aunque sea cierto que la presencia de cafe disminuye la conversion de bosque a sembradios de cosecha anual, existe el riesgo de que la intensificacion de la administracion de cafe todavia amenace la biodiversidad del bosque, incluyendo la diversidad genetica del cafe silvestre. La politica de conservacion para los bosques etiopes entonces debe desarrollar estrategias que reconozcan que los bosques sin produccion cafetalera pueden tener riesgos mayores de deforestacion que los bosques con produccion cafetalera y que los bosques con produccion cafetalera seguido tienen un valor bajo de biodiversidad.																	0888-8892					OCT	2013	27	5					1031	1040		10.1111/cobi.12079								WOS:000324931700017	23772911

Floristic diversity in fire-sensitive eucalypt woodlands shows a 'U'-shaped relationship with time since fire	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Understanding ecosystem responses to disturbance is important for effective management of biodiversity. Observed relationships between time since disturbance and diversity have taken a variety of forms, only some of which are explicitly predicted in models of vegetation succession. This makes generalization and predictions for specific communities difficult. Negative relationships have been the predominant diversity response to time since fire in fire-prone Mediterranean-climate ecosystems; however, few studies have analysed responses in infrequently burnt ecosystems such as Mediterranean-climate woodlands dominated by fire-sensitive trees. We used a space-for-time approach and multiple stand-ageing techniques (Landsat imagery, growth ring counts and growth ring-size relationships) to characterize diversity and compositional changes with time since fire (3-370+years) in fire-sensitive Eucalyptus salubris woodlands in south-western Australia. Species density and Pielou's evenness showed an overall U'-shaped response to time since fire, although variability between plots was considerable. Plant functional type and species composition differed with time since fire, with greater richness and cover of ground layer, and long dispersal potential' functional types with increasing time since fire. Conversely, there was an early or intermediate peak in taller and short dispersal potential' functional types. We propose that the unusual U'-shaped diversity-time since fire relationship is driven by competitively dominant tree and shrub layers having maximum cover at intermediate times since fire. Subdominant functional types were able to exploit lower levels of competition in the immediate post-fire period and after density-dependent thinning of the trees and shrubs.Synthesis and applications. Recurrent fire is not required to maintain diversity in these fire-sensitive woodlands as diversity reached a maximum in mature vegetation. Fire intervals of <c. 200years are likely to have adverse consequences on diversity, which is of conservation concern given apparently high recent rates of occurrence of fire. Changes in diversity were not apparent when times since fire were truncated to those available from remote sensing, illustrating that space-for-time studies defined solely by remote sensing may obscure equivalent U'-shaped diversity-time since fire relationships.

J	Li, XS; Wu, BF; Zhang, L				Li Xiao-song; Wu Bing-fang; Zhang Lei			Dynamic monitoring of soil erosion for upper stream of Miyun Reservoir in the last 30 years	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was applied to assess the spatial distribution and dynamic properties of soil loss with geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technologies. To improve the accuracy of soil-erosion estimates, a new C-factor estimation model was developed based on land cover and time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets. The new C-factor was then applied in the RUSLE to integrate rainfall, soil, vegetation, and topography data of different periods, and thus monitor the distribution of soil erosion patterns and their dynamics during a 30-year period of the upstream watershed of Miyun Reservoir (UWMR), China. The results showed that the new C-factor estimation method, which considers land cover status and dynamics, and explicitly incorporates within-land cover variability, was more rational, quantitative, and reliable. An average annual soil loss in UWMR of 25.68, 21.04, and 16.80 t ha(-1) a(-1) was estimated for 1990, 2000 and 2010, respectively, corroborated by comparing spatial and temporal variation in sediment yield. Between 2000 and 2010, a 1.38% average annual increase was observed in the area of lands that lost less than 5 t ha(-1) a(-1), while during 1990-2000 such lands only increased on average by 0.46%. Areas that classified as severe, very severe and extremely severe accounted for 5.68% of the total UWMR in 2010, and primarily occurred in dry areas or grasslands of sloping fields. The reason for the change in rate of soil loss is explained by an increased appreciation of soil conservation by developers and planners. Moreover, we recommend that UWMR watershed adopt further conservation measures such as terraced plowing of dry land, afforestation, or grassland enclosures as part of a concerted effort to reduce on-going soil erosion.																	1672-6316					OCT	2013	10	5					801	811		10.1007/s11629-013-2559-y								WOS:000325070700010

Landscape resource mapping for wildlife research using very high resolution satellite imagery	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Quantifying wildlife-habitat relationships through resource selection analysis (RSA) has traditionally relied on landscape variables extracted at medium-to-coarse scales and general-purpose digital maps. However, RSA at fine scales, facilitated by accurate positional data obtained using GPS-tags, requires improved measures of habitat resources. The combination of cutting-edge remote sensing technology, such as very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery and object-based image analysis (OBIA), can provide landscape maps that are suitable for the extraction of detailed variables at fine scale. We used Quickbird satellite imagery and OBIA to produce a map using the multispectral bands (MULT), and explored the usefulness of the technique for resource identification by combining the panchromatic (highest spatial resolution) and multispectral (spectral information) bands (PAN:MULT) to produce a second map. Each of the mapping methods was used in a heterogeneous braided-river environment in New Zealand to: (1) classify and delimit ground features using an object-based accuracy assessment approach; (2) detect ground features of different sizes; (3) extract independent landscape variables at fine scale (within buffers between 20 and 30m) for separate RSA for introduced hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) and feral cats (Felis catus). Per-pixel accuracy assessment produced overall accuracies of 82% (PAN:MULT) and 79% (MULT). The per-object assessment using shrubs as the testing class yielded further information on classification and delimitation of object accuracy, with accuracies of 80% for shrub patches 30m(2) in MULT and 5m(2) in PAN:MULT. The inclusion of the panchromatic band noticeably improved the identification and delimitation of cover. However, RSA using each of the maps did not yield differences in the best models for cats or hedgehogs. VHSR imagery and OBIA provide a valuable method to identify smaller ground features and thus to produce more detailed landscape maps to study animal habitat use at fine scale. Improvements in ground feature detection achieved by including the panchromatic band may not justify its cost, as it was shown for the studies on cats and hedgehogs presented here. However, the level of detail offered by the panchromatic layer may be useful for addressing other RSA questions or applications at fine scale, such as remote censusing of colonial species.

J	Rashid, I; Romshoo, SA; Vijayalakshmi, T				Rashid, Irfan; Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad; Vijayalakshmi, Tartiparti			Geospatial modelling approach for identifying disturbance regimes and biodiversity rich areas in North Western Himalayas, India	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The present study is a comprehensive effort for making spatially explicit vegetation type information, one of the basic inputs for species and habitat conservation, readily available to the decision makers, resource managers and nature conservationists. The present study was carried out to understand the vegetation composition and structure in Doda area of Western Himalayas, India. During the study, vegetation types were mapped using on-screen image interpretation technique of multispectral high resolution satellite data. A total of ten types of vegetation were delineated from the satellite data. Phytosociological data was collected for the forest, pasture and scrub classes using nested-quadrat approach to characterize the vegetation. A total of ten phytosociological parameters were analyzed. Pinaceae, Rosaceae and Asteraceae were the dominant plant families with most of the identified plant species having a very high medicinal value. Other important component of the study involved landscape modelling, using the Spatial Landscape Analysis Model for identifying disturbance regimes and biodiversity rich landscapes in the area. The model results indicate that most of the area contains a very rich biodiversity repository with only a few areas showing signs of disturbance where terrain is either complex or where the anthropogenic pressures on forest resources are apparent. The forest and nature conservation managers could use the conservation measures suggested on the basis of these research findings for developing biodiversity conservation strategies in the region.

The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), remote sensing, and GIS were used to model the soil loss estimation for soil conservation and vegetation rehabilitation in Nun Nadi watershed for the years 2000 and 2009. The estimated mean soil loss for the year 2000 and 2009 is 3,283.11 and 1,419.39 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The study finds that about 80 % area has low or least risk of erosion and about 7 % is exposed to high or very high risk which indicates the improvement in terms of soil loss if we compare the data of both the time periods. The findings show that the rainfall, LULC change, and elevation are the main responsible factors for the soil loss in Nun Nadi watershed. Conservation measures have been adopted; however, the problem still remains serious and demands urgent attention.																	1866-7511					OCT	2013	6	10					4045	4056		10.1007/s12517-012-0661-z								WOS:000324320400036

Whilst monitoring has commonly revolved around field data, remote sensing can play a key role in establishing baselines of the extent and condition of habitats and associated species diversity as well as quantifying losses, degradation or recovery associated with specific events or processes. Landsat images constitute a major data source for habitat monitoring, capturing broad scale information on changes in habitat extent and spatial patterns of fragmentation that allow disturbances in protected areas to be identified. These data are, however, less able to provide information on changes in habitat quality, species distribution and fine-scale disturbances, and hence data from other spaceborne optical sensors are increasingly being considered. Very High Resolution (VHR) optical datasets have been exploited to a lesser extent, partly because of the relative recency of spaceborne observations and challenges associated with obtaining and routinely extracting information from airborne multi-spectral and hyperspectral datasets. The lack of a shortwave infrared band in many VHR datasets and provision of too much detail (e.g., shadows within and from landscape objects) also present challenges in some cases. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, particularly when used synergistically with optical data, have benefited the detection of changes in the three-dimensional structure of habitats. This review shows that remote sensing has a strong, yet underexploited potential to assist in the monitoring of protected areas. However, the data generated need to be utilized more effectively to enable better management of the condition of protected areas and their surrounds, prepare for climate change, and assist planning for future landscape management.

J	Luck-Vogel, M; O'Farrell, PJ; Roberts, W				Lueck-Vogel, Melanie; O'Farrell, Patrick J.; Roberts, Wesley			Remote sensing based ecosystem state assessment in the Sandveld Region, South Africa	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We present a remote sensing based approach for assessing ecosystem state or intactness to inform land use management and conservation planning. Using segmented multispectral medium resolution satellite imagery, parameters related to the image objects' spectral brightness and heterogeneity, and compactness are used to derive a scoring system of 0 to 10 for the ecosystem intactness, with 0 being completely degraded and 10 being pristine. Linked to the remote sensing approach we suggest a field validation approach that focuses on 10 ecosystem-relevant visually assessed parameters which, when combined, produce a score out of 10 as well. The approach was tested in the South African Sandveld region using a SPOT 5 image from 2009 and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image from 2011. Field assessments took place in 2011. Both image data sets returned consistent results suggesting an inter-sensor transferability of the approach. Inconsistencies between satellite and field scores occurred mainly on sites where crops were currently being grown and on fields where various stages of succession were underway, following abandonment. Masking out of those sites which are of little interest from an ecosystem state perspective would improve overall accuracies. For regions with vegetation types that differ significantly in cover and structure, a stratified approach is suggested to optimise the results per vegetation type. Outputs suggest that the approach with its standardised and robust results and its repeatability provides a suitable tool for long term monitoring of large regions with a degree of detail sufficiently high to allow for fine scale planning.

Hyperspectral imagery can be an important source of information to assist in the evaluation of the habitats' conservation status, as it can provide continuous maps of habitat quality indicators (e.g., life forms, management activities, grass, shrub and tree encroachment) at the pixel level. Such local level information is highly needed for management purposes, e.g., the location of habitat patches and their sizes and quality within a protected site. This paper focuses on the use of continuous fraction images as derived from spectral mixture analysis of hyperspectral imagery (AHS-160), in combination with segmentation techniques, to facilitate habitat quality assessment in a heathland site in the Netherlands. This combined application of techniques on hyperspectral imagery demonstrates the usefulness of information from continuous fraction maps of grass abundance (Molinia caerulea) in heathlands - at and within the patch level - compared to traditional mapping techniques that assess grass encroachment in a limited number of abundance classes at the patch level. It therefore provides a better basis to monitor large areas for processes such as grass encroachment that largely determine the conservation status of Natura 2000 heathland areas. Timely, accurate and up-to-date spatial information on the encroachment of mosses, grasses, shrubs or trees (dominant species) can help conservation managers to take better decisions and to better evaluate the effect of taken measures. While discrepancies exist between the results of field-based vegetation surveys and the proposed remote sensing approach, we provide a discussion on the uncertainty of determining which of both methods is most accurate in relation to dominant species, which is in our case Molinia caerulea, and set forth several reasons why the remote sensing based approach might form a better basis for the monitoring of abundant species and patch evolution through time.

Using a moving window approach on high-resolution geospatiat data on vegetation, a fragmentation index was computed across the entire Indian landscape. On the basis of the index, the forests areas were categorized as high, moderate, low or intact. It was observed that almost half of the forested land is intact in spite of tremendous population pressures, indicating effective protection. Most of the biodiversity-rich forests, such as evergreen, subtropical broadleaf and temperate broadleaf forests, are relatively intact or have a low degree of fragmentation. But highly fragmented regions across the Indian landscape harbour a number of endemic species, some of them of medicinal importance, that need conservation. This study presents an approach to mapping fragmentation caused by socio-economic drivers, namely shifting cultivation, forest villages, infrastructural development, mining and encroachment. This approach provides critical inputs to prioritization and conservation of forests and the associated biodiversity.																	0011-3891					SEP 25	2013	105	6					774	780										WOS:000325057500022

Obtaining check dam information is very important for soil erosion control and river basin management. This study utilizes remote-sensing images in conjunction with Google Earth images and field survey to derive the spatial distribution of the check dams in the Huangfuchuan catchment. Multisource data including topographic maps, Landsat images, and images from Google Earth are collected for check dam identification. The results are verified based on a field survey. The water surface area of the check dams derives from in situ measurement and images present good relationship with the high correlation coefficient of 0.96. Furthermore, the area extent and number of check dams derived from the remote sensing images are similar to those from Google Earth images. Historically, an increase in the check dam number, controlled area, and storage capacity indicate their substantial trapping effects on streamflow and sediment load in the Huangfuchuan catchment. This study may be a good reference for proposing an efficient approach to identify the check dams and provide decision supports for soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau. (C) The Authors.

This study systematically evaluates the impacts that this had on land cover change and other associated aspects during the period 1990-2010 using repeat photography and satellite imagery in combination with interviews with community members. The results of the study clearly reflect the success of community-based forest management in the Dolakha district of the mid-hills of Nepal: during the study period, the rate of conversion of sparse forest into dense forest under community-based management was found to be between 1.13% and 3.39% per year. Similarly, the rate of conversion of non-forest area into forest was found to be between 1.11% and 1.96% per year. Community-based forest management has resulted in more efficient use of forest resources, contributed to a decline in the use of slash-and-burn agricultural practices, reduced the incidence of forest fires, spurred tree plantation, and encouraged the conservation and protection of trees on both public and private land. The resulting reclamation of forest in landside areas and river banks and the overall improvement in forest cover in the area has reduced flash floods and associated landslides.

Despite its importance, research into modelling of forest fire occurrence is lacking for the southern hemisphere, in particular for Chile. We investigated how landscape heterogeneity affects the probability of the occurrence of forest fires in Central Chile. We fitted a logistic regression model which included climatic, topographic, human-related and land-cover variables. Estimated probabilities of forest fire occurrence increased positively with the minimum temperature and precipitation seasonality, and decreased with distance to cities. The model correctly classified 65% of the validation data set. Our predictions suggest that 38% of the study area has a very high probability of forest fire occurrence. Under the assumed future scenario we predict an important increase in the probability of forest fire occurrence. The prediction model should be seen as a tool for addressing urgent protection and prevention issues, which should be discussed and evaluated further.

Changes in these signals can result in recognition mismatches between individuals living in different habitats, leading to reproductive divergence and speciation. For example, numerous studies have shown that differences in avian song may be a potent prezygotic isolating mechanism. Typically, however, detailed studies of environmental pressures on variation in animal behavior have been conducted only at small spatial scales. Here, we use remote-sensing data to predict animal behavior, in this case, bird song, across vast spatial scales. We use remotely sensed data to predict the song characteristics of the little greenbul (Andropadus virens), a widely distributed African passerine, found across secondary and mature rainforest habitats and the rainforest-savanna ecotone. Satellite data that captured ecosystem structure and function explained up to 66% of the variation in song characteristics. Song differences observed across habitats, including those between human-altered and mature rainforest, have the potential to lead to reproductive divergence, and highlight the impacts that both natural and anthropogenic change may have on natural populations. Our approach offers a novel means to examine the ecological correlates of animal behavior across large geographic areas with potential applications to both evolutionary and conservation biology.

Rocky shore ecosystems comprise a mosaic of habitat types and therefore require good technology to extract fine-scale spatial data on habitat extent and quality. Airborne topographic light detection and ranging data and 0.1-m resolution digital aerial photography were used to map and quantify distinct habitats that influence the distribution of biodiversity on rocky shores. The objectives of this study were to create and test the accuracy of a classification system for the rocky shore habitat, to develop remote sensing techniques useful for the conservation of intertidal rocky shores, and to create detailed digital terrain models for five headlands in the Solitary Island Marine Park, mid-north coast, New South Wales, Australia. The intertidal rocky shore habitats were classified according to tidal heights and substrate type. Ground-truthing of remote sensing data was carried out by visual surveys during low tide. Error assessments using precision analysis and classification accuracy tests confirmed the reliability of the technique with <5% error. The data generated from this research can be used as a platform for spatial analysis of this environment, including modelling changes in biodiversity under different climate change scenarios.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2013	29	5					1184	1190		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00142.1								WOS:000326304800020

In response to increased wetness in 2010 and 2011 over the region, prevalent surface water bodies accounted for a significant fraction of the terrestrial water budget of the PC, whereas the NGP, an area with sparse surface water, exhibited a greater increase in groundwater storage concomitant with enhanced seasonal variability. Over the study period from 2003 to 2011, GRACE-based estimates of terrestrial water storage agreed well with combined groundwater, soil moisture, snow water equivalent, and total canopy water storage over the NGP, as surface water is not a significant component in this area. However, closure was improved over the PC if surface water changes were included in the water budget.

We evaluated the productivity and phenology of western South Dakota mixed-grass prairie in the period from 2000 to 2008 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI is based on 250-m spatial resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. Growing-season NDVI images were integrated weekly to produce time-integrated NDVI (TIN), a proxy of total annual biomass production, and integrated seasonally to represent annual production by cool- and warm-season species (C-3 and C-4, respectively). Additionally, a variety of phenological indicators including cool-season percentage of TIN were derived from the seasonal profiles of NDVI. Cool-season percentage and TIN were combined to generate vegetation classes, which served as proxies of the conditions of plant communities. TIN decreased with precipitation from east to west across the study area. However, the cool-season percentage increased from east to west, following patterns related to the reliability (interannual coefficient of variation [CV]) and quantity of midsummer precipitation. Cool-season TIN averaged 76.8% of the total TIN. Seasonal accumulation of TIN corresponded closely (R-2>0.90) to that of gross photosynthesis data from a carbon flux tower. Field-collected biomass and community composition data were strongly related to TIN and cool-season percentage. The patterns of vegetation classes were responsive to topographic, edaphic, and land management influences on plant communities. Accurate maps of biomass production, cool- and warm-season composition, and vegetation classes can improve the efficiency of land management by facilitating the adjustment of stocking rates and season of use to maximize rangeland productivity and achieve conservation objectives. Further, our results clarify the spatial and temporal dynamics of phenology and TIN in mixed-grass prairie.

J	Lechner, AM; Reinke, KJ; Wang, Y; Bastin, L				Lechner, Alex M.; Reinke, Karin J.; Wang, Yan; Bastin, Lucy			Interactions between landcover pattern and geospatial processing methods: Effects on landscape metrics and classification accuracy	ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY												Remote sensing data is routinely used in ecology to investigate the relationship between landscape pattern as characterised by land use and land cover maps, and ecological processes. Multiple factors related to the representation of geographic phenomenon have been shown to affect characterisation of landscape pattern resulting in spatial uncertainty. This study investigated the effect of the interaction between landscape spatial pattern and geospatial processing methods statistically; unlike most papers which consider the effect of each factor in isolation only. This is important since data used to calculate landscape metrics typically undergo a series of data abstraction processing tasks and are rarely performed in isolation. The geospatial processing methods tested were the aggregation method and the choice of pixel size used to aggregate data. These were compared to two components of landscape pattern, spatial heterogeneity and the proportion of landcover class area. The interactions and their effect on the final landcover map were described using landscape metrics to measure landscape pattern and classification accuracy (response variables). All landscape metrics and classification accuracy were shown to be affected by both landscape pattern and by processing methods. Large variability in the response of those variables and interactions between the explanatory variables were observed. However, even though interactions occurred, this only affected the magnitude of the difference in landscape metric values. Thus, provided that the same processing methods are used, landscapes should retain their ranking when their landscape metrics are compared. For example, highly fragmented landscapes will always have larger values for the landscape metric "number of patches" than less fragmented landscapes. But the magnitude of difference between the landscapes may change and therefore absolute values of landscape metrics may need to be interpreted with caution. The explanatory variables which had the largest effects were spatial heterogeneity and pixel size. These explanatory variables tended to result in large main effects and large interactions. The high variability in the response variables and the interaction of the explanatory variables indicate it would be difficult to make generalisations about the impact of processing on landscape pattern as only two processing methods were tested and it is likely that untested processing methods will potentially result in even greater spatial uncertainty.

Broad-Scale Monitoring of Tillage Practices Using Sequential Landsat Imagery	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Crop residue management is an important conservation practice that can preserve soil and water resources. Monitoring how farmers manage their land in terms of tillage practices can provide insights on the effectiveness of the conservation programs so that we can improve the implementation of conservation tillage practices to optimize crop yields and environmental conservation. Remote sensing is a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for tillage monitoring. Previous studies have established the minimum Normalized Difference Tillage Index (minNDTI) technique at a pixel level for tillage mapping by extracting the minimum values from time-series Landsat NDTI spectral profiles. The objective of this study was to evaluate the minNDTI technique and to devise strategies for mapping tillage practices at the field level. We incorporated a multiscale image segmentation approach to fill Landsat 7 scan line corrector (SLC)-off data gaps to facilitate site-specific and broad-scale mapping of tillage practices. The gap-filled Landsat 7 images were combined with Landsat 5 imagery to develop a multitemporal image series for tillage mapping. We then applied object-based approaches and utilized the USDA cropland data layer to produce field-level tillage maps, which were evaluated using field observations and Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC) county-level tillage data. Our results show that the gap-filling procedure is effective for the purpose of tillage mapping. Overall classification accuracies of tillage maps range from 69 to 79%. Comparison between remotely sensed and CTIC tillage data suggests that we can monitor tillage practices systematically using remote sensing imagery.																	0361-5995	1435-0661				SEP-OCT	2013	77	5					1755	1764		10.2136/sssaj2013.03.0108								WOS:000324626600028						
J	Chaplin, J; Brabyn, L				Chaplin, J.; Brabyn, L.			Using remote sensing and GIS to investigate the impacts of tourism on forest cover in the Annapurna Conservation Area, Nepal	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Tourism is Nepal's largest industry, giving people in rural areas an alternative to subsistence farming. Tourism can have an impact on the forest cover of a region as trees provide firewood for cooking and heating and timber for building accommodation. In 1986 the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established to ensure that tourism was managed more sustainably, which includes minimising its impact on the forest cover. This study assesses the impacts of tourism on the forest cover in the Annapurna region by comparing Landsat images from 1999 to 2011. This was achieved through spectral classification of different land cover and by assessing the change in forest cover in relation to increasing distances from tourism villages. A major problem with remote sensing in mountainous regions such as Nepal is shadow caused by the relief. This issue was addressed by only assessing areas which were free from shadow, which in effect meant a sample was used rather than the whole study region. The results indicate that there has been an 8 percent reduction in overall forest extent, but this change varies by region. In the northern, drier regions there has been a net increase in forest cover, while in the southern regions there has been a net reduction in forests. The influence of tourism facilities on forest is also variable. Around each of the tourism villages sampled there was a general trend of forest removal decreasing as the distance from each village increased, which indicates tourism does have a negative impact on forests. However, there was an opposite trend in the northern villages that were well inside the conservation area. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Crawford, TW; Marcucci, DJ; Bennett, A				Crawford, Thomas W.; Marcucci, Daniel J.; Bennett, Andrew			Impacts of residential development on vegetation cover for a remote coastal barrier in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, USA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal barrier environments are heavily influenced by human activities yet there are few examples of landscape ecological work investigating human dimensions of settlement disturbance patterns and processes. We investigated the impacts of residential development on vegetation cover for a remote roadless coastal barrier in Carova, North Carolina that is subject to policies from the federal to local levels and addressed three research questions: How has the region's the policy history influenced patterns of residential parcel development? What are the spatial and temporal patterns of parcel development? How has development impacted patterns of barrier vegetation cover? We traced the influences of the federal 1982 Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) designed to discourage development in risky coastal areas as well as state/local coastal policies and employed remote sensing change detection, NDVI analysis and spatial analysis and regression techniques. Results showed an acceleration of new housing structures since 1990, contrary to the intended effects of CBRA. An estimated vegetation cover loss of 437 m(2) was associated with each newly developed parcel. NDVI varied along spatial and temporal gradients with more recent development having lower NDVI than older development. Recently developed parcels were larger in area, closer to the beach, and contained houses with larger footprints compared to older developed parcels. Our approach represents a place-based analytical framework for coastal barrier landscapes. Beyond the Carova case study, adopting such an approach coupling natural and human systems for the entire eastern US barrier system requires defining a comprehensive set of coastal barrier spatial units to enable typological classification and subsequent systematic investigation to inform debates regarding coastal ecosystem services and sustainability.																	1400-0350					SEP	2013	17	3					431	443		10.1007/s11852-013-0241-8								WOS:000324110200012						
J	Redowan, M				Redowan, Mohammad			Tree Diversity Detection with Mid-Resolution Images and Environmental Data in a Neural Network	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Biodiversity maps are crucial to conservation management. The present study assesses the accuracy of detecting tree diversity in an Italian forest site by combining mid-resolution images from Landsat-TM or Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)'s Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) sensors with environmental data namely elevation, slope, aspect and solar radiation in an artificial Neural Network (NN) classifier. The map accuracies obtained for Landsat-TM and ALOS images are 60 % and 53 % respectively. Use of environmental data increases accuracies to 91 % and 81 % respectively. Landsat-TM detects tree diversity more accurately than ALOS. Both the coarser pixel size and finer spectral resolution of Landsat-TM contributed to its higher accuracy.																	0255-660X					SEP	2013	41	3					567	576		10.1007/s12524-012-0254-z								WOS:000324249800009

For this study, the WRJ-2 watershed falling under Narkhed and Katol Tahsils of Nagpur district, Maharashtra, India is investigated. Various thematic maps (i.e. drainage, geology, soil, geomorphology and land use/ land cover) have been prepared using the remote sensing and GIS techniques. Initially, differential weightage values are assigned to all the thematic maps as per their runoff characteristics. Subsequently, the maps are integrated in GIS environment to identify potential sites for water conservation measures like gully plugs, earthen check dams, continuous contour trenches, percolation tanks, cement bandhara, afforestration and farm ponds, etc. The study depicts that the GIS technique facilitates integration of thematic maps and thereby helps in an identification of micro-zones each with unique characters in-terms of hydrogeology, thus amenable to specific water conservation techniques. It is therefore concluded that, the GIS technique is suitable for an identification of water conservation structures.

J	Li, HK; Pinel, N; Bourlier, C				Li, Hongkun; Pinel, Nicolas; Bourlier, Christophe			Polarized infrared reflectivity of one-dimensional Gaussian sea surfaces with surface reflections	APPLIED OPTICS												Sea surface infrared reflectivity is an important parameter in maritime remote sensing. Usually, single reflection by the sea surface is considered. However, a loss of energy is then reported for large zenith observation angles (theta > 50 degrees) with a peak of about 4% for theta approximate to 80 degrees, because of the neglect of the multiple surface reflections. This paper presents calculations for the polarized infrared reflectivity of one-dimensional sea surfaces (2D problems) with two surface reflections, by introducing a bistatic illumination function with two reflections. The results show good agreement with the ones obtained by a Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. It is also shown that the energy conservation criterion is better satisfied after considering two surface reflections.

J	Blackman, A				Blackman, Allen			Evaluating forest conservation policies in developing countries using remote sensing data: An introduction and practical guide	FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS												Rigorous, objective evaluation of forest conservation policies in developing countries is needed to ensure that the limited financial, human, and political resources devoted to these policies are put to good use. Yet such evaluations remain uncommon. Recent advances in conservation best practices, the widening availability of high-resolution remotely sensed forest-cover data, and the dissemination of geographic information system capacity have created significant opportunities to reverse this trend. This paper provides a nontechnical introduction and practical guide to a relatively low cost method that relies on remote sensing data to support ex post analysis of forest conservation policies. It describes the defining features of this approach, explains the broad empirical challenges to using it and the main strategies for meeting these challenges, catalogs the literature, discusses the requisite data, provides some practical guidance on modeling choices, and describes in detail two recent studies, (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Teo, SP; Chai, PPK; Phua, MH				Teo, Stephen P.; Chai, Paul P. K.; Phua, Mui-How			Conservation Gap Analysis of Dipterocarp Hotspots in Sarawak Using GIS, Remote Sensing and Herbarium Data	SAINS MALAYSIANA												Dipterocarpaceae is the dominant tree family in the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. Borneo (and Sarawak) is the centre of diversity for the dipterocarps. Identification of hotspots is important for forest and biodiversity conservation efforts. Species Occurrence Models (SOMs) were generated for all 247 species of dipterocarps recorded in Sarawak using herbarium occurrence data and based on the best model selected. The species occurrence density map for each genus and category (endemic and non endemic) was generated by overlaying the SOMs of all species in each genus or category. The species occurrence density maps were analyzed with land cover map from Landsat 7-EMT+ images and protected forest areas for identifying hotspots for conservation in Sarawak. Overlaying the SOM maps revealed that areas in central Sarawak and the southwest region (northwest Borneo around Kuching) are the main hotspots of dipterocarp diversity in Sarawak while the coastal lowland areas in the lower Rejang and Baram River which are mainly peat swamp forest are poorer in species occurrence density. In terms of endemism, as with dipterocarp diversity, the mixed diptercarp forest of central Sarawak is also the most important hotspot. Gap analysis revealed that most protected forest areas are in southwest Sarawak (Bako, Kubah, Tanjung Datu and Gunung Gading National Parks) and in the northern part of Sarawak (Niah, Lambir Hills and Mt Mulu National Parks). This leaves the hotspot in the central part of Sarawak least protected. Protected areas only cover between 2 and 4% of the total areas for the different hotspots (75% species density) while majority of the hotspots that are still forested are outside the protected areas.

J	Banerjee, R; Srivastava, PK				Banerjee, Ruman; Srivastava, Prashant K.			Reconstruction of contested landscape: Detecting land cover transformation hosting cultural heritage sites from Central India using remote sensing	LAND USE POLICY												Central India hosts one of the largest repositories of archaeological sites in the world having a semi-arid climate and distinct eco-geography which is prone to rapid change due to human activities. This paper discusses the changes in land use and land cover for the past twenty-three years in the region altering the rich cultural heritage, revealing by the presence of numerous painted rock-shelter sites in the region. The land cover and land use changes in terms of deforestation, urban growth and development and sandstone mining have been evaluated in the present study. Some of the above-mentioned parameters have been quantified using remote sensing and GIS data by peeping into the past and the present demonstrating sufficient practical and scientific value for the present work. The use of landsat satellite data of appropriate spectral and spatial resolution are imperative in this research where two supervised classificatory schemes viz. MLC (maximum likelihood classification) and SVM (support vector machine) are implemented for image classification. Landsat images of the years 1989, 2000 and 2011 have been processed to detect the current and historical changes of cultural heritage sites in its structural and spectral aspects in one of the remote regions of central India that matched the ground truthing from the present day survey and field work. The techniques provided differential results and in terms of accuracy SVM performed better than MLC while detecting natural and archaeological change estimation of the contested landscape of rock art. The change analysis suggests the gradual and steady destruction of natural and cultural wealth of this area leading to complete fragility. The deforestation led to the exposure of painted sandstone rock-shelters with in situ archaeological deposits. In the recent past intensive sandstone mining till the present years is obliterating unique cultural heritage sites in this region of Central India. Finally, a set of guidelines has been recommended to employ good policies to align heritage conservation and development on the right track to promote sustainable land use cost-effectively.

It deals with the generation of bioclimatic indices from temperature and precipitation data, followed by fundamental environmental niche modeling based on the presence-only records of the alpine treeline ecotone (ATE) boundary species. The predicted fundamental environmental niche was validated in Uttarakhand, India using the alpine treeline ecotone boundary (a surrogate to realized niche), which was generated using IRS-P6 (LISS-III) satellite data for year 2006. The result demonstrates the ability of the niche models in assessing the probable extent of Himalayan birch distribution and its presence in treeline ecotone of Uttarakhand and the technique could be further used for modeling future scenario of. the alpine treeline in Indian Himalaya.

Within an agriculturally dominated case study area in Saxony, Germany, a more detailed land use classification, which includes differentiated information on agricultural management practices, was utilized within the raster-based planning support tool GISCAME. "Management" refers to typical, regional crop rotations and soil tillage practices. The focus of this research was based on an indicator-based approach to assess ecosystem services and the development of land use change (LUC) and land management change (LMC) scenarios. The EuroMaps Land Cover data set was specifically developed for the case study and included remote sensing information for the general land use classification and terrestrial mapping information. Furthermore, statistical data on detailed regional agricultural land management were included. The raster-based planning support tool GISCAME was then used to simulate scenarios and visualize results. The LUC and LMC scenarios showed that the more detailed land use classification provided better output for the prioritization of planning alternatives. Further it enabled a refined assessment of the provisioning services (i) food and fodder provision, (ii) biomass provision, the regulation services, (iii) soil erosion protection, (iv) drought risk regulation, (v) flood regulation, (vi) returns from land-based production (i.e. the market value of biomass provision), and (vii) ecological integrity. The results of this study support the view that the application of improved management measures, such as conservation tillage, can significantly enhance the provision of ecosystem services (e.g. soil erosion protection and drought risk regulation) at the landscape level. The study also indicates that a combination of strategic LUC, such as afforestation and LMC, might be an effective way to enhance regulating services with acceptable trade-offs regarding provisioning services. Our approach presents a refined foundation for ecosystem services assessment, which is designed to better support regional planning and the provision of information to non-experts in the participatory processes. For transfer into other regions, standardized land use and land management classification will have to be defined. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we present a high-resolution vegetation map of the island based on combining vegetation analysis and classification with remote sensing. Two different image classification approaches were tested to assess the most accurate one in mapping the vegetation mosaic of Socotra. Spectral signatures of the vegetation classes were obtained through a Gaussian mixture distribution model, and a sequential maximum a posteriori (SMAP) classification was applied to account for the heterogeneity and the complex spatial pattern of the arid vegetation. This approach was compared to the traditional maximum likelihood (ML) classification. Satellite data were represented by a RapidEye image with 5 m pixel resolution and five spectral bands. Classified vegetation releves were used to obtain the training and evaluation sets for the main plant communities. Postclassification sorting was performed to adjust the classification through various rule-based operations. Twenty-eight classes were mapped, and SMAP, with an accuracy of 87%, proved to be more effective than ML (accuracy: 66%). The resulting map will represent an important instrument for the elaboration of conservation strategies and the sustainable use of natural resources in the island. (c) The Authors.

Coastal retreat and improved water quality mitigate losses of seagrass from sea level rise	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The distribution and abundance of seagrass ecosystems could change significantly over the coming century due to sea level rise (SLR). Coastal managers require mechanistic understanding of the processes affecting seagrass response to SLR to maximize their conservation and associated provision of ecosystem services. In Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, vast seagrass meadows supporting populations of sea turtles and dugongs are juxtaposed with the multiple stressors associated with a large and rapidly expanding human population. Here, the interactive effects of predicted SLR, changes in water clarity, and land use on future distributions of seagrass in Moreton Bay were quantified. A habitat distribution model of present day seagrass in relation to benthic irradiance and wave height was developed which correctly classified habitats in 83% of cases. Spatial predictions of seagrass and presence derived from the model and bathymetric data were used to initiate a SLR inundation model. Bathymetry was iteratively modified based on SLR and sedimentary accretion in seagrass to simulate potential seagrass habitat at 10 year time steps until 2100. The area of seagrass habitat was predicted to decline by 17% by 2100 under a scenario of SLR of 1.1m. A scenario including the removal of impervious surfaces, such as roads and houses, from newly inundated regions, demonstrated that managed retreat of the shoreline could potentially reduce the overall decline in seagrass habitat to just 5%. The predicted reduction in area of seagrass habitat could be offset by an improvement in water clarity of 30%. Greater improvements in water clarity would be necessary for larger magnitudes of SLR. Management to improve water quality will provide present and future benefits to seagrasses under climate change and should be a priority for managers seeking to compensate for the effects of global change on these valuable habitats.

J	Wang, LH; Huang, JL; Du, Y; Hu, YX; Han, PP				Wang, Lihui; Huang, Jinliang; Du, Yun; Hu, Yanxia; Han, Pengpeng			Dynamic Assessment of Soil Erosion Risk Using Landsat TM and HJ Satellite Data in Danjiangkou Reservoir Area, China	REMOTE SENSING												Danjiangkou reservoir area is the main water source and the submerged area of the Middle Route South-to-North Water Transfer Project of China. Soil erosion is a factor that significantly influences the quality and transfer of water from the Danjiangkou reservoir. The objective of this study is to assess the water erosion (rill and sheet erosion) risk and dynamic change trend of spatial distribution in erosion status and intensity between 2004 and 2010 in the Danjiangkou reservoir area using a multicriteria evaluation method. The multicriteria evaluation method synthesizes the vegetation fraction cover, slope gradient, and land use. Based on the rules and erosion risk assessment results of the study area in 2004 and 2010, the research obtained the conservation priority map. This study result shows an improvement in erosion status of the study area, the eroded area decreased from 32.1% in 2004 to 25.43% in 2010. The unchanged regions dominated the study area and that the total area of improvement grade erosion was larger than that of deterioration grade erosion. The severe, more severe, and extremely severe areas decreased by 4.71%, 2.28%, and 0.61% of the total study area, respectively. The percentages of regions where erosion grade transformed from extremely severe to slight, light and moderate were 0.18%, 0.02%, and 0.30%, respectively. However, a deteriorated region with a 2,897.60 km(2) area was still observed. This area cannot be ignored in the determination of a general governance scheme. The top two conservation priority levels cover almost all regions with severe erosion and prominent increase in erosion risk, accounting for 7.31% of the study area. The study results can assist government agencies in decision making for determining erosion control areas, starting regulation projects, and making soil conservation measures.																	2072-4292					AUG	2013	5	8					3826	3848		10.3390/rs5083826								WOS:000328626100009

LIDAR-DERIVED CANOPY ARCHITECTURE PREDICTS BROWN CREEPER OCCUPANCY OF TWO WESTERN CONIFEROUS FORESTS	CONDOR												In western conifer-dominated forests where the abundance of old-growth stands is decreasing, species such as the Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) may be useful as indicator species for monitoring the health of old-growth systems because they are strongly associated with habitat characteristics associated with old growth and are especially sensitive to forest management. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is useful for acquiring fine-resolution, three-dimensional data on vegetation structure across broad areas. We evaluated Brown Creeper occupancy of forested landscapes by using lidar-derived canopy metrics in two coniferous forests in Idaho. Density of the upper canopy was the most important variable for predicting Brown Creeper occupancy, although mean height and height variability were also included in the top models. The upper canopy was twice as dense and the mean height was almost 50% higher at occupied than at unoccupied sites. Previous studies have found indicators of canopy density to be important factors for Brown Creeper habitat; however, this represents the first time that lidar data have been used to examine this relationship empirically through the mapping of the upper canopy density that cannot be continuously quantified by field-based methods or passive remote sensing. Our model's performance was classified as "good" by multiple criteria. We were able to map probabilities of Brown Creeper occupancy in similar to 50 000 ha of forest, probabilities that can be used at the local, forest-stand, and landscape scales, and illustrate the potential utility of lidar-derived data for studies of avian distributions in forested landscapes.

The objectives of the present study are to prepare the forest burnt area map and to analyse fire prone areas in Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR), Andhra Pradesh, India using multi-temporal satellite data. Unsupervised classification and visual image interpretation techniques were used to achieve the objectives. The forest cover has been assessed as 2653.9 km(2). The total area affected under forest fire has been estimated as 6858.4 ha in 1973, 35,739.7 ha in 2001 and 38,680.1 ha in 2005, 79,067.3 ha in 2009 and 38,462.1 ha in 2010. The total forest burnt area was low during 1973 (1.9 %) and high during 2009 (21.9 %). The results of fire recurrent analysis shows that an average of 1336.3 ha area was undergoing regular annual forest fires. Burnt area monitoring from satellite data provides useful information to forest managers in effective planning and conservation of forest resources.																	0250-541X					AUG	2013	36	4					437	446		10.1007/s40009-013-0154-y								WOS:000323736900012						
J	Kovacs, F				Kovacs, Ferenc			GIS ANALYSIS OF SHORT AND LONG TERM HYDROGEOGRAPHICAL CHANGES ON A NATURE CONSERVATION AREA AFFECTED BY ARIDIFICATION	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The shrinking of wetlands in Hungary is a striking consequence of recent climatic processes and anthropogenic influence. The investigation of endangered wetland areas is of crucial importance, since the complex phenomenon of climate change superimposed by inadequate management strategies seriously threatens these exceptionally rich and diverse areas. Statistical and spatial assessment is a difficult task as tendencies need to be realised and quantified in a highly variable environment. The quantity of water in the landscape is a key factor from this aspect. The database of the study was made up of medium scale and freely accessible LANDSAT satellite images at the greatest possible temporal resolution. The main object of the investigation was the mapping of aridification on a longer 130 year and a shorter 4 year timescale at the protected Upper Kiskunsag Lakes, being severely hit by droughts in the past decades. When analysing maps and images certain areas were difficult to classify and results did hardly yield a general and uniform long term tendency. Degradation processes were evaluated by applying both an optimistic and pessimistic scenario. In case of the optimistic evaluation, ambiguous patches were always considered to represent the favourable state in the future (the pessimistic approach worked the opposite way). Concerning the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios 5.6 and 33.5% of the study area will be affected negatively by water management strategies and precipitation decrease, respectively. As a consequence a remote sensing based monitoring activity is suggested by using sensors of great resolution in order to support planning, decision making and nature conservation in the future.																	1842-4090					AUG	2013	8	3					113	124										WOS:000323533700013

The relative contribution of terrain, land cover, and vegetation structure indices to species distribution models	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Habitat assessments for biodiversity conservation are often complicated by the lack of detailed knowledge of a study species' distribution. As an alternative to resource-intensive field-based methods to obtain such information, remotely sensed products can be utilized in species distribution models to infer a species' distribution and ecological needs. Here we demonstrate how to arbitrate among a variety of remotely sensed predictor variables to estimate the distribution and ecological needs of an endangered butterfly species occurring mainly in inaccessible areas. We classified 19 continuous environmental predictor variables into three conceptually independent predictor classes, terrain, land cover, and vertical vegetation structure, and compared the accuracy of competing Maxent habitat models consisting of different combinations of each class. Each class contributed, though disproportionately, to our most reliable model that considered all 19 variables. We confirm that variables obtained from remote sensors can effectively estimate the distribution and ecological needs of a relatively unknown imperiled species occurring in inaccessible locations. Importantly, increasing the variety of predictor classes through multi-sensor fusion resulted in greater model accuracy than increasing the absolute number of predictor variables.

A clear vertical land-cover distribution of higher forest-middle village-lower terrace-lowest river' can be found on steep slopes. The local climate and its variation with elevation are essential for the stable local water cycle, and the spatial layout of the landscape elements allows for effective material and energy flow within the landscape. Moreover, the obligatory forest and water resource conservation due to the unique history and culture of Hani adds a social layer of protection. The sustainable development of the Hani landscape is expected to provide valuable insights for the present land and environmental management.

Deriving Hourly Evapotranspiration Rates with SEBS: A Lysimetric Evaluation	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Numerous energy balance (EB) algorithms have been developed to use remote sensing data for mapping evapotranspiration (ET) on a regional basis. Adopting any single or combination of these models for an operational ET remote sensing program requires a thorough evaluation. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) was evaluated for its ability to estimate hourly ET rates of summer tall and short crops grown in the Texas High Plains by using 15 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes acquired during 2006 to 2009. Performance of SEBS was evaluated by comparing estimated hourly ET values with measured ET data from four large weighing lysimeters, each located at the center of a 4.3 ha field in the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, TX. The performance of SEBS in estimating hourly ET was good for crops under both irrigated and dryland conditions. A locally derived, surface albedo-based soil heat flux (G) model further improved the G estimates. Root mean square error and mean bias error were 0.11 and -0.005 mm h(-1), respectively, and the Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency was 0.85 between the measured and calculated hourly ET. Considering the equal or better performance with a minimal amount of ancillary data as compared to with other EB algorithms, SEBS is a promising tool for use in an operational ET remote sensing program in the semiarid Texas High Plains. However, thorough sensitivity and error propagation analyses of input variables to quantify their impact on ET estimations for the major crops in the Texas High Plains under different agro-climatological conditions are needed before adopting the SEBS into operational ET remote sensing programs for irrigation scheduling or other purposes.																	1539-1663					AUG	2013	12	3								10.2136/vzj2012.0110								WOS:000323161600031

Assessment of land degradation east of the Nile Delta, Egypt using remote sensing and GIS techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Land degradation is one of the most common issues in the eastern part of the Nile Delta area that threatens the ongoing agricultural activities and prohibits further reclamation expansions. The different degradation types and the associated risk assessment of some soils types of western Suez Canal region during the period from 1997 to 2010 is discussed. The assessment of the different degradation degrees in the investigated area has been carried out through integrating remote sensing, GIS and GLASOD approaches. Results revealed that the salinization, alkalization, soil compaction and water logging are the main types of land degradation in the area. The main causative factors of human induced land degradation types are; over irrigation, human intervention in natural drainage, improper time use of heavy machinery and the absence of conservation measurements. Low and moderately clay flats, gypsifferous flats, have high to very high risk in both salinization sodication and physical degradation. Values such as EC, ESP, and ground water level reach 104.0 dS/m, 176 % and 60 cm, respectively. These results will be of great help and be basic sources for the planners and decision makers in sustainable planning. The spatial land degradation model was developed based on integration between remote sensing data, geographic information system, soil characteristics and DEM.

Modeling state-level soil carbon emission factors under various scenarios for direct land use change associated with United States biofuel feedstock production	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												Current estimates of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels produced in the US can be improved by refining soil C emission factors (EF; C emissions per land area per year) for direct land use change associated with different biofuel feedstock scenarios. We developed a modeling framework to estimate these EFs at the state-level by utilizing remote sensing data, national statistics databases, and a surrogate model for CENTURY's soil organic C dynamics submodel (SCSOC). We estimated the forward change in soil C concentration within the 0-30 cm depth and computed the associated EFs for the 2011 to 2040 period for croplands, grasslands or pasture/hay, croplands/conservation reserve, and forests that were suited to produce any of four possible biofuel feedstock systems [corn (Zea Mays L)-corn, corn-corn with stover harvest, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L), and miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus Greef et Deuter)]. Our results predict smaller losses or even modest gains in sequestration for corn based systems, particularly on existing croplands, than previous efforts and support assertions that production of perennial grasses will lead to negative emissions in most situations and that conversion of forest or established grasslands to biofuel production would likely produce net emissions. The proposed framework and use of the SCSOC provide transparency and relative simplicity that permit users to easily modify model inputs to inform biofuel feedstock production targets set forth by policy.

However, there is a lack of practical and accurate measures for estimating the continuous distribution of insect diversity across spatially complex landscapes to enforce such conservation strategy. Based on 216 sampling data, we predicted plant and caterpillar species density across a 200 km(2) spatially complex tropical dry forest landscape, using reflectance values of a SPOT 5 satellite imagery, altitude values from a digital elevation model, and improved model performances by incorporating spatial autocorrelation of residuals with kriging interpolation. Spectral information and altitude accounted for 21-25 % of the variation in woody plant species density whereas the residuals did not demonstrate spatial autocorrelation. In contrast, spatial dependence accounted for most of the 35 % explained variation in caterpillar species density; the spatial range of autocorrelation of caterpillars however, is broader than that of host plants. Although local species density of caterpillars and woody plants showed no relationship, specific areas demonstrated an overlap of species diversity for both taxonomic groups. Spatially explicit models with spectral information as predictors have the potential to estimate woody plant species density across complex landscapes, while the prediction of caterpillar diversity could be done analyzing the spatially autocorrelated structure of species density, implicating labor intensive, but not necessarily costly sampling schemes.

However, this impact analysis depends upon accurate geospatial locations of existing practices, which are difficult to obtain. This study demonstrates and evaluates three different methods for obtaining geospatial information for BMPs. This study was focused on the Eagle Creek Watershed, a mixed use watershed in central Indiana. We obtained geospatial information for BMPs through government records, producer interviews, and remote-sensing aerial photo interpretation. Aerial photos were also used to validate the government records and producer interviews. This study shows the variation in results obtained from the three sources of information as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each method. Using only one method for obtaining BMP information can be incomplete, and this study demonstrates how multiple methods can be used for the most accurate picture.

Urban forest corridors in Australia: Policy, management and technology	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM												This paper demonstrates the importance of the remaining urban forests, and the related policy and management issues, by reviewing the current situation in Sydney, Australia. Transport corridor vegetation surveys are used to show challenges and implications for the future. The process of medium to long-term policy formulation, with initial management strategy development at the local level, is outlined. This study also addresses the increasing need for integration with other urban issues, including the existing general urban forest strategies. The benefits of using active remote sensing technologies are illustrated by using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to generate a high resolution, 3-dimensional surface model. Among the major transport corridors in the Sydney metropolitan area, segments of two long-established main roads were selected for detailed studies of the roadside forest resource. Data analysis indicated that roadside trees are very diverse and distributed in a patchy way. Some areas are treeless and some have dense stands. The results also showed high variability in species composition between local areas, with canopy cover and shading varying widely. We identify a number of issues and lessons from conservation, pollution and socio-economic perspectives, which have broader applications, and relate these findings back to policies and planning.																	0165-0203					AUG	2013	37	3			SI		189	199		10.1111/1477-8947.12021								WOS:000322591500005

REVIEW: Managing urban ecosystems for goods and services	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Concomitant with the rise in the proportion of the global human population that resides in urban areas has been growth in awareness of the importance of the provision of ecosystem goods and services to those people. Urban areas are themselves of significance in this regard because of their areal extent, and hence the quantity of services falling within their bounds, and because of the need for local provision of services to urban residents. 2. Here, we review key challenges to the effective management of ecosystem goods and services within urban areas. 3. These challenges include the structure of green space, its temporal dynamics, spatial constraint on ecosystem service flows, occurrence of novel forms of flows, large numbers of land managers, conflicting management goals, possible differences between perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of the distribution and flow of ecosystem services, and the wicked' nature of the problem of ecosystem service management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Urban areas present very particular combinations of challenges and opportunities for the management of ecosystem goods and services. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of green spaces greatly complicates the maintenance and improvement in service provision as well as dramatically inflating costs. Spatial constraints on ecosystem service flows mean that these can be highly dependent on the maintenance of particular areas of connectivity, but also that provision of additional key points of connectivity may be disproportionately beneficial to those flows. The existence of novel forms of flows of ecosystem services in urban areas offers means of overcoming spatial constraints on more natural flows, but will require the development of new kinds of ecosystem process models to inform their design and management. The large numbers of land managers, conflicts between the best approaches for managing for different goods and services, and frequent differences between the perceptions of urban dwellers and the reality of urban landscapes create a complex management context. The management of ecosystem goods and services is closely allied to the challenges of conventional urban planning. However, applied ecology has a broad range of tools available to assist in determining solutions, including the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques, landscape ecology principles and theory (e.g. patch and matrix frameworks, meta-population models), and systematic conservation planning approaches.																	0021-8901					AUG	2013	50	4					830	840		10.1111/1365-2664.12087								WOS:000321762900003

Quantifying fine-scale resource selection by introduced European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in ecologically sensitive areas	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Introduced predators are important drivers of ecosystem change and can threaten native species. The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) was introduced from Britain into New Zealand where it is currently widespread, including in braided-river environments of the interior cold drylands where it might threaten native species such as riparian ground-nesting birds. The establishment of hedgehogs in braided-river environments may be facilitated by adjacent pastoral landscapes that provide food, primarily invertebrates, and dry shelter. Forays by hedgehogs into native prey habitats, such as riverbed floodplains, increase predation pressure. Understanding the spatial ecology of introduced predators can improve effectiveness of control measures. We assessed spatial resource selection by hedgehogs in a braided-river environment by tracking 27 individuals for 4-8 days in summer and autumn using microGPS-backpacks. We extracted fine-scale landscape variables from a map created using very high resolution satellite imagery to model home range placement within the study area. We also assessed habitat composition and ranking within high-use areas using compositional analysis. Hedgehogs established home ranges in pastoral landscapes containing abundant edges and high vegetation productivity (mainly green pastures and shrubs), and selected pastures and patches of shrubs as high-use areas. Hedgehogs avoided riverbed floodplains, suggesting that reported predation events on ground-nesting birds might be a consequence of secondary predation or individual specialization. We recommend that predation of native species by hedgehogs might be best alleviated if trapping is focused on those areas selected by native fauna of conservation concern (e.g. riverbed floodplains), as well some biologically-determined buffer surrounding these sites.

Integrating biophysical and socioeconomic information for prioritizing watersheds in a Kashmir Himalayan lake: a remote sensing and GIS approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Dal Lake, a cradle of Kashmiri civilization has strong linkage with socioeconomics of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. During last few decades, anthropogenic pressures in Dal Lake Catchment have caused environmental deterioration impairing, inter-alia, sustained biotic communities and water quality. The present research was an integrated impact analysis of socioeconomic and biophysical processes at the watershed level on the current status of Dal Lake using multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data, simulation modelling together with field data verification. Thirteen watersheds (designated as 'W1-W13') were identified and investigated for land use/land cover change detection, quantification of erosion and sediment loads and socioeconomic analysis (total population, total households, literacy rate and economic development status). All the data for the respective watersheds was integrated into the GIS environment based upon multi-criteria analysis and knowledge-based weightage system was adopted for watershed prioritization based on its factors and after carefully observing the field situation. The land use/land cover change detection revealed significant changes with a uniform trend of decreased vegetation and increased impervious surface cover. Increased erosion and sediment loadings were recorded for the watersheds corresponding to their changing land systems, with bare and agriculture lands being the major contributors. The prioritization analysis revealed that W5 > W2 > W6 > W8 > W1 ranked highest in priority and W13 > W3 > W4 > W11 > W7 under medium priority. W12 > W9 > W10 belonged to low-priority category. The integration of the biophysical and the socioeconomic environment at the watershed level using modern geospatial tools would be of vital importance for the conservation and management strategies of Dal Lake ecosystem.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This is especially the case in arid and semi-arid areas like Australia, which is known as the driest inhabited continent on earth. Sustainable irrigation management necessitates better understanding of water requirements in order to decrease environmental risks and increase water use efficiency. Although the water requirements of agricultural crops are well established in field and laboratory studies, little research has been conducted to investigate the water requirements of urban green spaces. In addition, most previous research investigations have focused on the water requirements of turf grasses and not on other landscape plant species. Landscape plants can include various species of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting densities and microclimates. Such complicated environments make measuring the water requirements of urban landscapes difficult. This paper reviews previous studies and techniques for measuring the water requirements of urban landscapes and describes how optimum irrigation management strategies for urban landscape vegetation can assist in better water conservation, improved landscape quality and reduced water costs. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical approach that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand but ideally this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition of the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance.

Multi-Criteria Decision Making Approach for Watershed Prioritization Using Analytic Hierarchy Process Technique and GIS	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Watershed prioritization based on the natural resources and physical processes involves locating critical areas of erosion, which produce maximum sediment yield to take up conservation activities on priority basis. The present study was taken up with a specific objective of prioritization of micro-watersheds using Multi-Criteria Decision Approach - Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based SYI model (AHPSYI) under GIS environment for a case study area of Mayurakshi watershed in India. This method basically uses information of Potential Erosion Index (PEI) and Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR), indicative of transport capacity. In the present study, sediment delivery factors viz., topography, vegetation cover, proximity to water courses and soil were translated into GIS layers and integrated using Boolean conditions to create a data layer of spatially distributed SDIs' across the watershed. For assessment of PEI, important watershed parameters viz., land use/land cover, soil, slope, and drainage density maps were integrated in the GIS environment using Weighted Linear Combination method (WLC) by assigning weights to themes and ranks to features of individual theme using AHP technique. A comparison between AHPSYI based sub watershed prioritization map with that of prioritization map based on the observed sediment yield data revealed that about 78 % of the area showed concurrence. Thus, it can be inferred that the watershed prioritization based on only thematic layers can be dependable to maximum extent. Subsequently, proposed approach was adopted for prioritization of the study area at micro watershed scale, where area under high and very high categories together constitutes around 33 % of the study area. Around 100 micro-watersheds out of 276 watersheds are under moderate to very high category respectively, signifying the need for watershed management.

Remote sensing data and geographic information systems techniques, in conjunction with spatial metrics and socio-economic information, were used to facilitate the analysis. The spatial and socio-economic components of Baguio's rapid urbanization over the past 21 years (1988-2009) were the major factors that contributed to dramatic changes in the setting's natural landscape, as indicated by an almost threefold increase in its built-up area, at the expense of other land-use/land-cover classes. Its rapid growth has seen the city's population exceed its designed ceiling of 25,000 people by a factor of at least twelve. Such landscape changes and population growth have resulted in a substantial decrease in the overall annual ecosystem service value (ESV) of Baguio of approximately 60%. The human-to-ESV ratio in the city has also decreased over this same period, from 1:31 (US$/year) in 1988 to just 1:7 in 2009. Although Baguio has enjoyed economic, political and social prominence for more than a century, its rapid population growth and urban expansion are now exerting pressure on its natural landscape, jeopardizing the environmental sustainability of this highly valued hill station. This study offers important insights to all, but especially those in fast-urbanizing regions, as Baguio's case offers learning experience valuable for achieving more successful landscape and urban planning.

Remote sensing of chlorophyll-a as a measure of cyanobacterial biomass in Lake Bogoria, a hypertrophic, saline-alkaline, flamingo lake, using Landsat ETM	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Lake Bogoria is a saline-alkaline lake in the Kenyan Rift Valley, known for supporting dense blooms of cyanobacteria and large flocks of up to 1 million Lesser Flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor). An algorithm for the remote sensing of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), as an indicator of cyanobacterial biomass, has been developed using a time series of Landsat images and in situ measurements. In situ measured reflectance spectra were resampled to Landsat bands, and the near infrared (NIR) band, R-535, was found to be well represented by a linear relationship to Chl-a (R-2 = 0.847; Standard error, SE = 55 mu g l(-1); Samples, N = 14) for concentrations up to 800 lig l(-1). The band ratio R-835/R-660 also showed a strong linear relationship with Chl-a (R-2 = 0.811; SE = 61 mu g l(-1), N = 14). Similar relationships were derived using Landsat satellite imagery and monthly in situ Chl-a data for the period Nov 2003-Feb 2905. The NIR:Red ratio gave a better fit to Chl-a than a single NIR band algorithm when applied to satellite imagery, and the ratio performed best when based on TOA reflectance rather than atmospherically corrected data. Hence an algorithm for Chl-a was derived based on the TOA Landsat reflectance ratio, R-835/R-660, which showed a strong fit against Chl-a (R-2 = 0.801; SE = 69 mu g l(-1), N = 33) despite the limitations of time coincidence for the available satellite-in situ matches (less than 8 days). Lesser Flamingos feed on cyanobacteria in saline-alkaline lakes, therefore the algorithm can be used to monitor changes in their food supply, providing valuable information for their future conservation. The study also allowed characterisation of the optical properties in Lake Bogoria and provides insight into the changes occurring during cyanobacterial bloom and die-off events.

However, land use/cover classification remains a difficult task and it is especially challenging in heterogeneous tropical landscapes where nonetheless such maps are of great importance. The present study aims at establishing an efficient classification approach to accurately map all broad land use/cover classes in a large, heterogeneous tropical area, as a basis for further studies (e.g., land use/cover change, deforestation and forest degradation). Specifically, we first compare the performance of parametric (maximum likelihood), non-parametric (k-nearest neighbor and four different support vector machines - SVM), and hybrid (unsupervised-supervised) classifiers, using hard and soft (fuzzy) accuracy assessments. We then assess, using the maximum likelihood algorithm, what textural indices from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix lead to greater classification improvements at the spatial resolution of Landsat imagery (30 m), and rank them accordingly. Finally, we use the textural index that provides the most accurate classification results to evaluate whether its usefulness varies significantly with the classifier used. We classified imagery corresponding to dry and wet seasons and found that SVM classifiers outperformed all the rest. We also found that the use of some textural indices, but particularly homogeneity and entropy, can significantly improve classifications. We focused on the use of the homogeneity index, which has so far been neglected in land use/cover classification efforts, and found that this index along with reflectance bands significantly increased the overall accuracy of all the classifiers, but particularly of SVM. We observed that improvements in producer's and user's accuracies through the inclusion of homogeneity were different depending on land use/cover classes. Early-growth/degraded forests, pastures, grasslands and savanna were the classes most improved, especially with the SVM radial basis function and SVM sigmoid classifiers, though with both classifiers all land use/cover classes were mapped with producer's and user's accuracies of similar to 90%. Our classification approach seems very well suited to accurately map land use/cover of heterogeneous landscapes, thus having great potential to contribute to climate change mitigation schemes, conservation initiatives, and the design of management plans and rural development policies.

Using high-resolution radar images to determine vegetation cover for soil erosion assessments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Healthy soils are crucial for human well-being. Because soils are threatened worldwide, politicians recognize the need for soil protection. For example, the European Commission has launched the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, which requests the European member states to identify high risk areas for soil degradation. Most states use the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) to assess soil erosion risk at the national scale. The USLE includes different factors, one of them is the vegetation cover and management factor (C factor). Modern satellite-based radar sensors now provide highly accurate vegetation cover data, enabling opportunities to improve the accuracy of the C factor. The presented study proves the suitability for C factor determination based on a multi-temporal classification of high-resolution radar images. Further USLE factors were derived from existing data sources (meteorological data, soil maps, digital elevation model) to conduct an USLE-based soil erosion assessment. The resulting map illustrates a qualitative assessment for soil erosion risk within a plot of about 7*12 km in an agricultural region in Poland that is very susceptible to soil erosion processes. A high erosion risk of more than 10 tonnes per ha and year was assessed to occur on 13.6% (646 ha) of the agricultural areas within the investigated plot. Further 7.8% (372 ha) of agricultural land is threaten by a medium risk of 5-10 tonnes per ha and year. Such a spatial information about areas of high or medium soil erosion risk are crucial for the development of strategies for the protection of soils. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial Access Priority Mapping (SAPM) with Fishers: A Quantitative GIS Method for Participatory Planning	PLOS ONE												Spatial management tools, such as marine spatial planning and marine protected areas, are playing an increasingly important role in attempts to improve marine management and accommodate conflicting needs. Robust data are needed to inform decisions among different planning options, and early inclusion of stakeholder involvement is widely regarded as vital for success. One of the biggest stakeholder groups, and the most likely to be adversely impacted by spatial restrictions, is the fishing community. In order to take their priorities into account, planners need to understand spatial variation in their perceived value of the sea. Here a readily accessible, novel method for quantitatively mapping fishers' spatial access priorities is presented. Spatial access priority mapping, or SAPM, uses only basic functions of standard spreadsheet and GIS software. Unlike the use of remote-sensing data, SAPM actively engages fishers in participatory mapping, documenting rather than inferring their priorities. By so doing, SAPM also facilitates the gathering of other useful data, such as local ecological knowledge. The method was tested and validated in Northern Ireland, where over 100 fishers participated in a semi-structured questionnaire and mapping exercise. The response rate was excellent, 97%, demonstrating fishers' willingness to be involved. The resultant maps are easily accessible and instantly informative, providing a very clear visual indication of which areas are most important for the fishers. The maps also provide quantitative data, which can be used to analyse the relative impact of different management options on the fishing industry and can be incorporated into planning software, such as MARXAN, to ensure that conservation goals can be met at minimum negative impact to the industry. This research shows how spatial access priority mapping can facilitate the early engagement of fishers and the ready incorporation of their priorities into the decision-making process in a transparent, quantitative way.

This study demonstrates the capability of the hyper-dimensional remote sensing data for discriminating diversely-populated tropical mangrove species. It was found that five different tropical mangrove species of Southern Thailand, including Avicennia alba, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera parviflora, Rhizophora apiculata, and Rhizophora mucronata, were correctly classified. The selected data treatment (a well-established spectral band selector) helped improve the overall accuracy from 86% to 92%, despite the remaining confusion between the two members of the Rhizophoraceae family and the pioneer species. It is therefore anticipated that the methodology presented in this study can be used as a practical guideline for detailed mangrove species mapping in other study areas. The next stage of this work will be to exploit the differences between the leaf textures of the two Rhizophoraceae mangroves in order to refine the classification outcome.

J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Planes, S				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Philippe; Planes, Serge			Bridging Ridge-to-Reef Patches: Seamless Classification of the Coast Using Very High Resolution Satellite	REMOTE SENSING												The structure and functioning of coral reef coastal zones are currently coping with an increasing variety of threats, thereby altering the coastal spatial patterns at an accelerated pace. Understanding and predicting the evolution of these highly valuable coastal ecosystems require reliable and frequent mapping and monitoring of both inhabited terrestrial and marine areas at the individual tree and coral colony spatial scale. The very high spatial resolution (VHR) mapping that was recently spearheaded by WorldView-2 (WV2) sensor with 2 m and 0.5 m multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) bands has the potential to address this burning issue. The objective of this study was to classify nine terrestrial and twelve marine patch classes with respect to spatial resolution enhancement and coast integrity using eight bands of the WV2 sensor on a coastal zone of Moorea Island, French Polynesia. The contribution of the novel WV2 spectral bands towards classification accuracy at 2 m and 0.5 m were tested using traditional and innovative Pan-sharpening techniques. The land and water classes were examined both separately and combinedly. All spectral combinations that were built only with the novel WV2 bands systematically increased the overall classification accuracy of the standard four band classification. The overall best contribution was attributed to the coastal-red edge-near infrared (NIR) 2 combination (Kappa(gain) = 0.0287), which significantly increased the fleshy and encrusting algae (User's Accuracy(gain) = 18.18%) class. However, the addition of the yellow-NIR2 combination dramatically impacted the hard coral/algae patches class (Producer's Accuracy(loss) = -20.88%). Enhancement of the spatial resolution reduced the standard classification accuracy, depending on the Pan-sharpening technique. The proposed composite method (local maximum) provided better overall results than the commonly used sensor method (systematic). However, the sensor technique produced the highest contribution to the hard coral thicket (PA(gain) = 30.36%) class with the coastal-red edge-NIR2 combination. Partitioning the coast into its terrestrial and aquatic components lowered the overall standard classification accuracy, while strongly enhancing the hard coral bommie class with the coastal-NIR2 combination (UA(gain) = 40%) and the green-coastal Normalized Difference Ratio (UA(gain) = 11.06%). VHR spaceborne remote sensing has the potential to gain substantial innovative insights into the evolution of tropical coastal ecosystems from local to regional scales, to predict the influence of anthropogenic and climate changes and to help design optimized management and conservation frameworks.

Mapping the extent of abandoned farmland in Central and Eastern Europe using MODIS time series satellite data	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The demand for agricultural products continues to grow rapidly, but further agricultural expansion entails substantial environmental costs, making recultivating currently unused farmland an interesting alternative. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to widespread abandonment of agricultural lands, but the extent and spatial patterns of abandonment are unclear. We quantified the extent of abandoned farmland, both croplands and pastures, across the region using MODIS NDVI satellite image time series from 2004 to 2006 and support vector machine classifications. Abandoned farmland was widespread, totaling 52.5 Mha, particularly in temperate European Russia (32 Mha), northern and western Ukraine, and Belarus. Differences in abandonment rates among countries were striking, suggesting that institutional and socio-economic factors were more important in determining the amount of abandonment than biophysical conditions. Indeed, much abandoned farmland occurred in areas without major constraints for agriculture. Our map provides a basis for assessing the potential of Central and Eastern Europe's abandoned agricultural lands to contribute to food or bioenergy production, or carbon storage, as well as the environmental trade-offs and social constraints of recultivation.

Land cover dynamics following a deforestation ban in northern Costa Rica	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Forest protection policies potentially reduce deforestation and re-direct agricultural expansion to already-cleared areas. Using satellite imagery, we assessed whether deforestation for conversion to pasture and cropland decreased in the lowlands of northern Costa Rica following the 1996 ban on forest clearing, despite a tripling of area under pineapple cultivation in the last decade. We observed that following the ban, mature forest loss decreased from 2.2% to 1.2% per year, and the proportion of pineapple and other export-oriented cropland derived from mature forest declined from 16.4% to 1.9%. The post-ban expansion of pineapples and other crops largely replaced pasture, exotic and native tree plantations, and secondary forests. Overall, there was a small net gain in forest cover due to a shifting mosaic of regrowth and clearing in pastures, but cropland expansion decreased reforestation rates. We conclude that forest protection efforts in northern Costa Rica have likely slowed mature forest loss and succeeded in re-directing expansion of cropland to areas outside mature forest. Our results suggest that deforestation bans may protect mature forests better than older forest regrowth and may restrict clearing for large-scale crops more effectively than clearing for pasture.

Specifically, at the landscape scale, spatial models for the occurrences of species of conservation concern may be improved by the inclusion of RS-based predictors, to help managers to better meet different conservation challenges. In this study, we examine whether predicted distributions of 28 red-listed plant species in north-eastern Finland at the resolution of 25 ha are improved when advanced RS-variables are included as unclassified continuous predictor variables, in addition to more commonly used climate and topography variables. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we studied whether the spatial predictions of the distribution of red-listed plant species in boreal landscapes are improved by incorporating advanced RS (normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference soil index and Tasseled Cap transformations) information into species-environment models. Models were fitted using three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) climate-topography only; (2) remote sensing only; and (3) combined climate-topography and remote sensing variables, and evaluated by four-fold cross-validation with the area under the curve (AUC) statistics. The inclusion of RS variables improved both the explanatory power (on average 8.1 % improvement) and cross-validation performance (2.5 %) of the models. Hybrid models produced ecologically more reliable distribution maps than models using only climate-topography variables, especially for mire and shore species. In conclusion, Landsat ETM+ data integrated with climate and topographical information has the potential to improve biodiversity and rarity assessments in northern landscapes, especially in predictive studies covering extensive and remote areas.

Remotely sensing the spatial and temporal land cover changes in Eastern Mau forest reserve and Lake Nakuru drainage basin, Kenya	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study aimed at characterizing land cover dynamics for four decades in Eastern Mau forest and lake Nakuru basin, Kenya. The specific objectives were to: (i) identify and map the major land cover types in 1973, 1985, 2000 and 2011; (ii) detect and determine the magnitude, rates and nature of the land cover changes that had occurred between these dates, and; (iii) establish the spatial and temporal distribution of these changes. Land cover types were discriminated through partitioning, hybrid classification and spatial reclassification of multi-temporal Landsat imagery. The land cover products were then validated and overlaid in post-classification comparison to detect the changes between 1973 and 2011. The accuracies of the land cover maps for 1973, 1985, 2000 and 2011 were 88%, 95%, 80% and 89% respectively. Six land cover classes, namely forests-shrublands, grasslands, croplands, built-up lands, bare lands and water bodies, were mapped. Forests-shrublands dominated in 1973, 1985 and 2000 covering about 1067 km(2), 893 km(2) and 797 km(2) respectively, but were surpassed by croplands (953 km(2)) in 2011. Bare lands occupied the least area that varied between 2 km(2) and 7 km(2) during this period. Overall, forests-shrublands and grasslands decreased by 428 km(2) and 258 km(2) at the annual average rates of 1% each, whereas croplands and built-up lands expanded by 660 km(2) and 24 km(2) at the annual rates of 6% and 16% respectively. The key hotspots of these changes were distributed in all directions of the study area, but at different times. Therefore, policies that integrate restoration and conservation of natural ecosystems with enhancement of agricultural productivity are strongly recommended. This will ensure environmental sustainability and socio-economic well-being in the area. Future research needs to assess the impacts of the land cover changes on ecosystem services and to project the future patterns of land cover changes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

High-resolution spatiotemporal maps are unavailable for the forests in majority of the tropical regions in Asia because of the persistent cloud cover and haze cover. Recent advances in radar remote sensing have provided weather-independent data of earth surface, thus offering an opportunity to monitor tropical forest change processes with relatively high spatiotemporal resolutions. In this research, we aim to examine the tropical deforestation process and develop a spatial model to simulate future forest patterns under various scenarios. Riau Province from central Sumatra of Indonesia is selected as the study area; this province has received much attention worldwide because the highest CO2 emission resulting from tropical deforestation has been recorded. Annual time series PALSAR data from 2007 to 2010 were analyzed for forest mapping and detecting land cover changes. A spatial model was calibrated using the Bayesian method. Modeling parameters were customized for the local subregions that allocate deforestation on the basis of their empirical relationships to physical and socioeconomic drivers. The model generated landscape spatial patterns mirrored the possible locations and extent of deforested areas by 2030 and provided time-series crucial information on forest landscape under various scenarios for future landscape management projects. The results suggested that the current deforestation process is in a critical stage where some subregions may face unprecedented stress on primary forest costing rivers and forest ecosystems by the end of 2020. The perspective views of Riau Province generated by the model highlighted the need for forest/environmental planning controls for the conservation of environmentally sensitive areas.

A Unified Microwave Radiative Transfer Model for General Planar Stratified Media: Slab Formulation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												A unified microwave radiative transfer (UMRT) model is presented for computing the thermal radiation emitted from any geophysical medium composed of planar layers of either densely or tenuously distributed moderately sized spherical scatterers. UMRT employs the discrete-ordinate eigenanalysis (DOE) method with layer adding to solve the differential radiative transfer equation for such multilayer structures. UMRT inherits the symmetrization and analytical diagonalization and factorization techniques of symmetric and positive definite matrices from the discrete-ordinate tangent linear radiative transfer (DOTLRT) model presented by Voronovich et al. These techniques ensure accuracy, numerical stability, and rapid computation for all matrix operations required for DOE along with a fast Jacobian calculation for radiance assimilation purposes. UMRT extends the applicability of DOTLRT by including both the Mie theory and the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) theory. Other nontrivial extensions within UMRT are the following: 1) The vertical and horizontal radiation intensities are coupled within each layer by applying the reduced Mie or DMRT phase matrices, and 2) the physical temperature profile of a layer is allowed to be linear in height. The symmetry properties of both the reduced Mie and DMRT phase matrices are proved, and the associated scattering and absorption coefficients are compared and discussed. The UMRT slab formulation is validated by imposing energy conservation, and the numerical results for some nominal cases are produced and discussed.																	0196-2892					JUL	2013	51	7	2				4103	4118		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227331								WOS:000320943700003

We investigated, on a continental scale, whether mesopredator abundance is limited from the top down by large predators, as predicted by the mesopredator release hypothesis, or by bottom-up factors. The mesopredator in focus is the red fox Vulpes vulpes, a key predator in many ecosystems due to its strong effects on prey abundance. Location Europe and northern Asia. Methods Data on red fox density were compiled from published papers and reports. For each site, we collated presence-absence data on large carnivores (Lynx lynx, Canis lupus, Canisaureus) and remote sensing data for factors potentially related to bottom-up limitation (winter severity, summer temperature, human density, primary productivity, tree cover). The data were analysed through structural equation modelling. Results The presence of lynx had a direct negative effect on red foxes, suppressing fox abundance. Also winter severity had a negative effect on red fox abundance, and in Eurasia as a whole this effect was partially mediated through lynx. Within the lynx distribution range, winter severity was the only bottom-up factor significantly affecting red fox abundance. Outside the lynx distribution range, primary productivity, summer temperature and human density had a positive effect on red fox abundance. Main conclusions Our results show that apex predators can limit mesopredator abundance on a continental scale, thus supporting the mesopredator release hypothesis. Winter severity also affected red fox abundance, partially due to an interaction between lynx and winter conditions. On the continental scale a complex network of processes operates with varying effects depending on mediation processes. Our results imply that apex predators can have an important effect on ecosystem structure by limiting mesopredator abundance, and we suggest that apex predators may dampen increases in mesopredator abundance driven by global warming.

J	Belletti, B; Dufour, S; Piegay, H				Belletti, Barbara; Dufour, Simon; Piegay, Herve			Regional variability of aquatic pattern in braided reaches (example of the French Rhone basin)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We analysed, at a regional scale, the braiding pattern and the structure of the water channel habitats of 53 braided reaches located in the Rhne hydrographical district (France), in relation to three control factors: (i) spatial location along the network (i.e. slope, altitude), (ii) hydrological conditions and (iii) morphological conditions. This research is based on aerial orthophotos belonging to the French National Geographic Institute (IGN) taken between 2002 and 2006. We defined a regional typology of braided reaches based on the distribution of the variables listed above, and identified five hydro-geographical types of braided reaches. Following this regional classification, we compared the pattern of braided reaches by testing several parameters, which describe the physical characters of water channel habitats (such as braided index, channel sinuosity, or aquatic habitat diversity). We found that discharge appears to be less relevant than sediment supply or groundwater level in structuring the braided geometry and the channel habitat pattern in natural braided rivers at a regional scale. We discussed the importance of local factors, such as the position of the groundwater table and the width of the active channel, for explaining the intensity of the braided pattern. There are numerous cases where the discharge is very low but the braided index high. These findings support management and conservation recommendations of braided rivers for implementing the European Water Framework Directive (2000).																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2013	712	1					25	41		10.1007/s10750-012-1279-6								WOS:000318790800003

Effect of canopy cover and canopy background variables on spectral profiles of savanna rangeland bush encroachment species based on selected Acacia species (mellifera, tortilis, karroo) and Dichrostachys cinerea at Mokopane, South Africa	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The proliferation of woody plant species' on savanna rangelands (i.e. bush encroachment) degrades rangeland quality, thereby threatening the biodiversity conservation effort as well as pastoral farming. Hyperspectral remote sensing offers possibilities for discriminating encroaching bush species in support of management of semi-arid savanna rangelands. As a preliminary step towards establishing a spectral library of common encroaching species on savanna rangelands, the effect of canopy leaf cover, background dry soil and grass on the spectral profiles of the common encroaching species Acacia karroo, Acacia mellifera, Acacia tortilis and Dichrostachys cinerea was analysed. A sample of healthy mature plants in prime, full leaf condition was utilised at an encroached rangeland in Mokopane, South Africa. The spectral signatures were collected in-situ, using a field spectrometer pointed above the sample specimen canopies. The canopy and canopy background variables tended to modify the reflectance of the encroaching bush species in the near infrared (800-1300 nm) in which they were spectrally most separable. Canopy background dry grass tended to increase near infrared reflectance, while dry soil tended to reduce the spectral contrast among the species. These effects were reduced by high leaf content.

To protect their territory the Ecuadorean State has declared and geographically defined, by Decrees, the Zona Intangible Tagaeri Taromenane (ZITT). This zone is located within the UNESCO Yasuni Biosphere Reserve (1989), one of the most biodiverse areas in the world. Due to several hydrocarbon reserve exploitation projects running in the area and the advancing of a large-scale deforestation front, the survival of these groups is presently at risk. The general aim was to validate the ZITT boundary using the geographical references included in the Decree 2187 (2007) by analyzing the geomorphological characteristics of the area. Remote sensing data such as Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Landsat imagery, topographic cartography of IGM-Ecuador, and fieldwork geographical data have been integrated and processed by Geographical Information System (GIS). The ZITT presents two levels of geographic inconsistencies. The first dimension is about the serious cartographical weaknesses in the perimeter delimitation related to the impossibility of linking two rivers belonging to different basins while the second deals with the perimeter line not respecting the hydrographic network. The GIS analysis results clearly show that ZITT boundary is cartographically nonsense due to the impossibility of mapping out the perimeter. Furthermore, GIS analysis of anthropological data shows presence of Tagaeri Taromenane clans outside the ZITT perimeter, within oil production areas and in nearby farmer settlements, reflecting the limits of protection policies for non-contacted indigenous territory. The delimitation of the ZITT followed a traditional pattern of geometric boundary not taking into account the nomadic characteristic of Tagaeri Taromenane: it is necessary to adopt geographical approaches to recognize the indigenous right to their liveable territories in the complex territorialities enacted by different stakeholders.					ferrarese, francesco/0000-0003-1411-4191												1932-6203					JUN 19	2013	8	6							UNSP e66293	10.1371/journal.pone.0066293								WOS:000322361200066	23840436

Rapid changes in institutional and socio-economic conditions, such as the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, often trigger widespread LULCC Yet, it is unclear how effective protected areas are in safeguarding habitat within them during such periods of rapid LULCC. Our goal here was to map changes in forest cover and agricultural lands from 1984 to 2010 in order to assess the effectiveness of two strictly protected areas, Olcsky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves, in temperate European Russia. We analyzed dense time series of Landsat images for three Landsat footprints and applied a support vector machine classification and trajectory-based change detection to map forest disturbance. We then used matching statistics to quantify the effectiveness of the protected areas. Our analyses highlighted considerable post-Soviet LULCC in European Russia. The LULCC maps revealed disturbances on 5.02% of the total forest area, with strongly declining disturbance rates in post-Soviet times. We also found that 39.89% of the agricultural land used in 1988 was abandoned after 1991, leading to widespread forest regrowth. Oksky and Mordovsky State Nature Reserves had a significantly lower probability of forest disturbance (-0.1 to -3.5% lower) in comparison to their surrounding areas. This suggests that protected areas were relatively effective in limiting human-induced forest disturbance in European Russia, despite lower levels of control and an eroding infrastructure for nature protection. Moreover, we found drastic land-cover changes, particularly forest regrowth, in the surroundings of these protected areas, highlighting conservation opportunities. Protected areas can play a key role in biodiversity conservation during periods of rapid LULCC, and remote sensing coupled with matching statistics provide important tools for monitoring the success and failure of conservation efforts.

The evolution of the discipline in the first decade of the 21st century	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												It has been argued that historical biogeography, the study of how processes that occur over long periods of time influence the distribution of life forms, is in the midst of a scientific revolution. The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of historical biogeography during the first decade of the 21st century and to identify major trends for the near future. We constructed a database containing all articles which dealt with historical biogeography published in the Journal of Biogeography during 1998-2010. The database included 610 contributions. Our results indicated that historical biogeography is going through a growth period. The papers analyzed were written by 2018 authors, with a mean of 3.3 authors per paper. Authors from 62 countries were involved, and most of them worked in Europe or North America. The Palearctic was the most analyzed region. Most contributions dealt with terrestrial habitats and were devoted to animal (especially Chordata) and plant taxa. Phylogeography was the most used approach (35%), followed by biota similarity and PAE (13%) and molecular biogeography (12%), with cladistic biogeography and event-based methods at 6% each. Some of the future challenges that historical biogeography faces are summarized: (1) to increase the study of taxa which are underrepresented according to the segment of biodiversity they represent; (2) to balance the amount of work devoted to different biogeographical regions; (3) to increase biogeographical knowledge of aquatic habitats; (4) to maintain the diversity of approaches, preventing the reduction of time, spatial, and taxonomic scales addressed by the discipline; and (5) to continue integrating historical biogeography along with other sources of information from other disciplines (e. g. ecology, paleontology, geology, isotope chemistry, remote sensing) into a richer context for explaining past, present, and future patterns of biodiversity on Earth.

J	Chen, W; Mied, RP				Chen, Wei; Mied, Richard P.			River velocities from sequential multispectral remote sensing images	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We address the problem of extracting surface velocities from a pair of multispectral remote sensing images over rivers using a new nonlinear multiple-tracer form of the global optimal solution (GOS). The derived velocity field is a valid solution across the image domain to the nonlinear system of equations obtained by minimizing a cost function inferred from the conservation constraint equations for multiple tracers. This is done by deriving an iteration equation for the velocity, based on the multiple-tracer displaced frame difference equations, and a local approximation to the velocity field. The number of velocity equations is greater than the number of velocity components, and thus overly constrain the solution. The iterative technique uses Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt methods and our own algorithm of the progressive relaxation of the overconstraint. We demonstrate the nonlinear multiple-tracer GOS technique with sequential multispectral Landsat and ASTER images over a portion of the Potomac River in MD/VA, and derive a dense field of accurate velocity vectors. We compare the GOS river velocities with those from over 12 years of data at four NOAA reference stations, and find good agreement. We discuss how to find the appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions to allow optimization of the technique for specific rivers.																	0043-1397					JUN	2013	49	6					3093	3103		10.1002/wrcr.20267								WOS:000322241300002

Incorporating uncertainty associated with habitat data in marine reserve design	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10-90%) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitat-mapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Deus, D; Gloaguen, R				Deus, Dorothea; Gloaguen, Richard			Remote Sensing Analysis of Lake Dynamics in Semi-Arid Regions: Implication for Water Resource Management. Lake Manyara, East African Rift, Northern Tanzania	WATER												We show here that a remote sensing (RS) approach is a cost-efficient and accurate method to study water resource dynamics in semi-arid areas. We use a MODIS surface reflectance dataset and a Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to map the variability of Lake Manyara's water surface area using a histogram segmentation technique. The results indicate that Lake Manyara's water surface coverage has been decreasing from 520.25 km(2) to 30.5 km(2) in 2000 and 2011 respectively. We observe that the lake water surface and the lake water balance displayed a similar pattern from 2006 to 2009, probably initiated by heavy rainfall and low temperature in 2006. Lake water surface area appears to have an inverse relationship with MODIS evapotranspiration (ET) and MODIS land surface temperature (LST). We imply that recent fluctuations of Lake Manyara's surface water area are a direct consequence of global and regional climate fluctuations. We therefore conclude that, by means of RS it is possible to provide timely and up-to-date water resource information to managers and hence enable optimized and operational decisions for sustainable management and conservation. We suggest that the method employed in this research should be applied to monitor water resource dynamics provided that remotely sensed datasets are available.

ASSOCIATION OF SCISSOR-TAILED FLYCATCHERS (TYRANNUS FORFICATUS) WITH SPECIFIC LAND-COVER TYPES IN SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Scissor-tailed Flycatchers (Tyrannus forficatus) are insectivorous Neotropical migrants that breed in the south-central United States. We examined their fine-scale (circles 300 m in radius centered on observed flycatcher locations) associations with different land cover types in south-central Texas. Scissor-tailed Flycatchers use a sit-and-scan foraging strategy; therefore, we expected the species would be positively associated with open land cover types (vegetation with little or no canopy) such as grassland, pasture/hayfield and cropland, and negatively associated with forest and shrubland given that the latter could obstruct visual scanning. We conducted 44 surveys from 9 May 2011 to 15 December 2011 by slowly driving (30 km/h) rural roads throughout 15 counties in south-central Texas and 3 near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Using ArcGIS, we quantified the percent cover of four general land cover types (urban/developed land, forest/shrub, grassland/pasture/hay, and cropland) within 300 m of each flycatcher location. Statistical analysis involved comparing the land cover of the flycatcher locations to a set of random points along the same routes. On average, flycatcher locations had significantly more grassland/pasture/hay than did random points (38.8 vs. 31.2%) and significantly less forest/shrub (29.9 vs. 36.7%). Therefore, although flycatchers may associate with open land cover at a rate greater than its overall availability, they generally occupy locations that have a mix of open and closed land cover. Knowledge of flycatcher habitat use at a fine-scale could be useful to the successful conservation of this species.																	1559-4491					JUN	2013	125	2					314	321		10.1676/12-096.1								WOS:000320893300011

Spatial Modeling of Tropical Deforestation Using Socioeconomic and Biophysical Data	SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY												Tropical forests are disappearing at an alarming rate. In Central America, a hectare of forest is cleared for agriculture every 5 min. This study was conducted in a forested 4,000 ha watershed of central Honduras to find deforestation causes based on socio-economic characteristics of population. First, a multitemporal analysis of Landsat TM imagery was conducted to determine deforestation rates and agricultural-forest boundaries. A GIS buffer procedure allowed determining which households were at the deforestation front and which households were located at the rest of the area (control). GIS techniques were used to extract biophysical information such as slope, elevation, land cover, temperature, precipitation, etc. Then, we set up a data base with more than 50 socioeconomic variables (level of education, income, children per family, major economic activity, use of conservation practices, etc.). Around 500 households, distributed all over the watershed, were visited, interviewed and GPS-located. A multivariate statistical analysis allowed an exploratory analysis to eliminate non useful and redundant variables and then to determine what variables appear to be important predictors of deforestation behavior among rural families. A resulting logistic regression model showed that household with lower annual income heads and with less use of conservation practices were more statistically prone to clear the forest (alpha = 0.001). The study uncovered the complexity of this problem and confirmed the need of using GIS-remote sensing techniques to combine socioeconomic and environmental data in several time-space dimensions to find the causes and trends of tropical deforestation.

J	Schmitt-Harsh, M				Schmitt-Harsh, Mikaela			Landscape change in Guatemala: Driving forces of forest and coffee agroforest expansion and contraction from 1990 to 2010	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This study examines the land-use/cover change (LUCC) dynamics and drivers for two prominent land-use/cover systems in Guatemala: natural forests (FOR) and coffee agroforests (CAF). To-date, very little research has examined the LUCC dynamics of CAF, in large part due to the high degree of spectral similarity that exists between agroforests and other forest-cover types. Given the ecosystem and livelihood services provided by shade-grown coffee production, it is increasingly necessary to map and identify the dynamics and drivers of CAF changes over space and time. This research uses remote sensing analysis, land transition matrices, and multinomial regression models to examine LUCC dynamics over two ten-year intervals (1990-2000; 2000-2010) in Guatemala. Spatially explicit biophysical (e.g. slope, elevation) and accessibility (e.g. distance to roads) factors are used to model and compare drivers of change for CAF and FOR. Results demonstrate LUCC dynamics and drivers for the two land-use/cover systems to be complex over space and time. For example, FOR losses are evident for both time intervals, largely associated with conversion to CAF and croplands (CPL) in low slope, low altitude areas, and in areas close to existing croplands, respectively. CAF losses are also evident in the 1990s, but are outpaced by expansion in the 2000s. Losses are associated with conversion to CPL, particularly near roads and existing croplands, while expansion and/or persistence of CAF occurs near cities. These results suggest that conservation programs aimed at tree cover preservation and expansion should consider natural forests and managed agroforests separately. Further, such programs should be tailored to specific locations and institutional settings given the influence of topography and accessibility factors in determining localized patterns of landscape transformations over space and time.

J	Altamirano, A; Aplin, P; Miranda, A; Cayuela, L; Algar, AC; Field, R				Altamirano, Adison; Aplin, Paul; Miranda, Alejandro; Cayuela, Luis; Algar, Adam C.; Field, Richard			High rates of forest loss and turnover obscured by classical landscape measures	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Loss of native forest is a key conservation concern globally, for reasons of biodiversity, climate change and ecosystem services. Landscape measures are used widely to characterize forest loss and associated landscape structure, but often without regard for structure imposed by the data used, and associated assumptions. Notably, forest loss is often expressed simply as net change in forest cover over time, but this approach does not account for turnover (i.e. the gross losses and gains of forest). It also ignores forest age (e.g. young regrowth forest or mature forest), which is significant in conservation terms. We investigate the effects of removing common data constraints on landscape characterization, as typically used in landscape dynamic analyses. We produced fine-resolution (0.0225 ha) classified maps from satellite imagery of the temperate Araucania Region of Chile, for 1986, 1999 and 2008. We calculated areas of land-use classes and associated landscape indices. Landscape measures and trends through time varied markedly around the region, with forest loss and fragmentation confined to areas not designated as protected. Net ('headline') figures masked very large turnover through time, with about 30% of unprotected land switching land use each decade. Accounting for this, in unprotected areas the loss of established native forest was 2.4% and 3.5% per year in the two time periods, much higher than equivalent 'standard' figures. Using finer-resolution data increased estimates of native forest loss and reversed temporal trends in patch density and mean patch size, compared with the commonly-used National Vegetation Classification (6.25 and 4.5 ha resolution). Interestingly, mean patch size of native forest actually switched, from a decreasing trend to an increasing one, with continued deforestation. We conclude that landscape characterization can lead to effective conservation practices, but it is necessary to use appropriate data resolution, define the data domain carefully and examine change through time, including the degree of dynamism (turnover) within the landscape: our results suggest a strong need to consider continuity of forest cover as well as overall totals.

J	Rajao, R				Rajao, Raoni			Representations and discourses: the role of local accounts and remote sensing in the formulation of Amazonia's environmental policy	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												This paper discusses the dynamics behind the establishment of scientific representations (e.g. reports, measurements, experiments) to the detriment of local representations (e.g. oral accounts, metaphors, symbols) in environmental policy-making in the Global South. To this end, the paper attempts to understand why local accounts of the Amazon in recent decades have gradually been replaced by satellite-based remote sensing (RS) technology in the region's policy-making. RS technology is shown to provide representations that match policy-makers discourses as regards the importance of: visibility, since satellite images are believed to provide a transparent window from which the Amazon can be seen by policy-makers working from centres of power; comprehensiveness, since the data obtained through RS claims to represent the entire region; and determinacy, as forecasting and spatial correlation techniques establish deterministic links between particular factors (e.g. the presence of farmers, inflation) and environmental issues (e.g. increases in deforestation). From this examination, it is argued that rather than focusing on identifying the essential differences between local and scientific representation, more attention should be paid to how different kinds of representations are in harmony or conflict with historically rooted governance discourses. The article also indicates that in order to revalue local representations in environmental policy-making it is necessary to challenge particular discourses which are "taken-for-granted" in governance practices at the present time.

Estimating Crop Water Use via Remote Sensing Techniques vs. Conventional Methods in the South Platte River Basin, Colorado	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We compared two methods of estimating crop water consumption to assess whether remote sensing techniques provide consumptive use (CU) estimates commensurate with conventional methods. Using available historical satellite and meteorological data, we applied Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution using Internalized Calibration (METRIC) to 317,455ha in the South Platte basin, in northeastern Colorado, for the 2001 irrigation season. We then compared these derived CU estimates with values calculated by using the Colorado Water Conservation Board's South Platte Decision Support System StateCU model. Evaluating the data by irrigation ditch service area, we disaggregated the output to allow for comparison by service area size, crop type, irrigation method, water supply source, and water availability. We concluded that METRIC is a suitable alternative to StateCU in the South Platte basin and could help to identify areas with inhibited crop growth or deficit irrigation practices. In addition, METRIC could be used as a complement to StateCU to refine StateCU model parameters, allowing for more accurate estimates of crop water shortages and groundwater recharge associated with irrigation delivery and application.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2013	49	3					498	517		10.1111/jawr.12051								WOS:000319897500003

Wesley			USING LOW-COST SIDE-SCAN SONAR FOR BENTHIC MAPPING THROUGHOUT THE LOWER FLINT RIVER, GEORGIA, USA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												An efficient, low-cost approach for mapping habitat features in navigable streams is needed to support the research and management of aquatic ecosystems at the landscape level. We developed a method that uses high-resolution (455kHz) side-scan sonar imagery obtained with the inexpensive (similar to$2000) Humminbird (R) Side Imaging system and ArcGIS to produce sonar image maps (SIMs) used to interpret and map habitat features such as substrates and large woody debris, in addition to continuously recording depth along the survey route. This method was recently demonstrated and evaluated in several small streams in southwestern Georgia (30-50m width, 40km mapped). To evaluate the feasibility of this method for mapping substrate and depth in larger rivers and over greater spatial extents, we conducted a sonar survey and generated SIMs for 124km of the lower Flint River (85-140m width). We interpreted the SIMs to digitize and classify substrate and bank boundaries. To assess classification accuracy, we visually inspected substrate at randomly assigned reference locations. A comparison of reference and map data revealed an overall classification accuracy of 84%. These results were consistent with previous findings and indicate that low-cost side-scan sonar is also an effective mapping tool for larger rivers. The sonar survey did, however, result in more missing and unsure substrate data and a lower map accuracy for fine-textured substrates than previously achieved when mapping smaller streams. We found a strong, positive relationship (r2=0.89) between the sonar range and the proportion of unsure substrate in the map, suggesting that a multi-pass, parallel-transect sonar survey could be used to maintain high-image resolution when stream widths exceed 100m and/or obstructions, such as islands, are encountered. Applications for sonar-based habitat maps are widespread and numerous. The ability to produce these maps efficiently at low-cost is within the grasp of researchers and managers alike.

Habitat suitability modelling for Gaur (Bos gaurus) using multiple logistic regression, remote sensing and GIS	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL RESEARCH												The aim of this study is to produce georeferenced ecological information about the suitable habitats available for gaur Bos gaurus in Chandoli tiger reserve, India (17 degrees 04 00 N to 17 degrees 19 54 N and 73 degrees 40 43 E to 73 degrees 53 09 E). Habitat suitability index (H.S.I.) was developed using multiple logistic regression (MLR) integrated with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). Satellite imageries of study area, acquired from Indian remote sensing satellite-P6, linear imaging self-scanning satellite-III of 2005, was digitally processed, whereas topographic maps were used for generating the collateral data in a GIS framework. Various layers of different variables such as forest density, Landuse land cover, measures of proximity to disturbances and water resources and a digital terrain model were created from satellite and topographic data. These layers along with global positioning system location of gaur presence/absence and MLR technique were integrated in a GIS environment for modelling the H.S.I. of gaur. The results indicate that approximately 91.80 km(2) (31.14%) of the forest of tiger reserve is highly suitable for gaur, whereas, 115.18 km(2) (39.07%) is suitable, 72.12 km(2) (24.47%) moderately suitable and 15.67 km(2) (5.32%) is least suitable. The accuracy level of this model is 70.7%. However, model is potent enough to advocate that forests of this area are most appropriate for declaring it as a reserve, for gaur conservation.																	0971-2119					JUN 1	2013	41	2					189	199		10.1080/09712119.2012.739089								WOS:000319106600011

Valuation of ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands in northwest Mexico	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Coastal wetlands are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, supporting diverse natural functions and providing important services to human societies. In this context, strategies have recently been developed to maintain these coastal wetlands in a sustainable way, however, wetlands are under pressure, particularly due to land use changes, because they have traditionally been treated as areas of low economic value or even as risky areas for human health. As a result, wetlands have suffered some loss and substantial habitat alteration, which are associated with high social costs. Thus, inventories are required to identify these environments and define and value their services to obtain appropriate information relevant to conservation strategies. This research introduces a spatial component for classifying wetland types and further evaluation of their ecosystem services (ES), assessing their current distribution and extent using standardized remote sensing techniques for wetland mapping. A value transfer approach was performed to generate baseline estimates of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands, validating it through a meta-analysis of a database of wetland estimates, with northwest Mexico wetlands as case study. We found that saltmarshes were the most important wetland in terms of covered area and also that socio-economic variables, such as income, are important in explaining wetland values. The results show that in 2003, a value of 1 billion USD per year was delivered to the local citizens by the surrounding wetlands provided as services and benefits. In a spatially explicit manner, this approach highlights the contribution made by wetlands to the well-being of communities. We argue that in the future design of management plans, the conservation of these environments should be a priority, regarding both, ecologically and economically views. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifying suitable habitats is critical to wetland management and restoration. In this study, by developing an object-oriented segmentation approach in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis and remote sensing image data, we analyzed and assessed the suitability of habitat for waterbirds in the West Songnen Plain, China. Nesting locations were used to validate the precision. The results show that the area of good, fair, poor, and not suitable habitat for waterbirds is 216 x 10(3) ha, 329 x 10(3) ha, 109 x 10(3) ha, and 283 x 10(3) ha, respectively. Approximately 23.48% of the total area of the West Songnen Plain is good suitable habitat. The results also indicate the great potential of this approach for objectively and effectively evaluating habitat suitability for waterbirds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An illustration is given in this study describing the payment compensation to water resource conservation and soil losses in Erlongshan reservoir catchment, China. A semi-distributed hydrological SWAT model was applied to establish compensation standard considering six scenarios of land use changes by combined application of remote sensing and geographic information systems. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) method is applied to evaluate the function of soil and water conservation, of which marginal opportunity cost and market value methods have been explored calculate the cost and benefit of water and soil conservation ecological function from provider and beneficiaries. Finally the ecological compensation of soil and water conservation for different land-use scenarios is calculated incorporating benefit apportion coefficient. The results provide an economically evaluated and market-oriented standard for the study of eco-compensation of environmental services and will be of great benefit to the implementation of soil and water conservation at a mesoscale catchment scale.

Even small natural or anthropogenic disturbances can cause severe changes in the distributional pattern of seagrass meadows. Satellite imageries provide a suitable means to detect and assess such changes in space and time in remote and inaccessible areas. Present study aims to understand the distribution pattern of seagrasses after the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 with the help of Indian Remote Sensing satellite data and in situ ground surveys with hand held GPS. As no geospatial data bases were available for the pre-tsunami period, the changes in seagrass cover were compared with the ground estimates available in the literature and also using pre-tsunami satellite data sets. The study found severe loss of seagrasses in the northern Andaman particularly in the Interview and North reef islands and in the Nicobar group of islands including Great Nicobar and Trinket islands. The investigation revealed the presence of 2,943.38 ha of seagrass covering the entire Andaman and Nicobar islands, and that 1,619.41 ha of seagrasses had been denuded during this period. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami in 2004 was the major reason for the loss of seagrasses in these islands. The seagrass spatial map generated in the present study can be used for the development of conservation and management plans and also to restore the denuded seagrasses of this region.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2013	48	2					173	181		10.1007/s12601-013-0014-1								WOS:000335400200003

Image Texture Predicts Avian Density and Species Richness	PLOS ONE												For decades, ecologists have measured habitat attributes in the field to understand and predict patterns of animal distribution and abundance. However, the scale of inference possible from field measured data is typically limited because large-scale data collection is rarely feasible. This is problematic given that conservation and management typical require data that are fine grained yet broad in extent. Recent advances in remote sensing methodology offer alternative tools for efficiently characterizing wildlife habitat across broad areas. We explored the use of remotely sensed image texture, which is a surrogate for vegetation structure, calculated from both an air photo and from a Landsat TM satellite image, compared with field-measured vegetation structure, characterized by foliage-height diversity and horizontal vegetation structure, to predict avian density and species richness within grassland, savanna, and woodland habitats at Fort McCoy Military Installation, Wisconsin, USA. Image texture calculated from the air photo best predicted density of a grassland associated species, grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), within grassland habitat (R-2 = 0.52, p-value <0.001), and avian species richness among habitats (R-2 = 0.54, p-value <0.001). Density of field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), a savanna associated species, was not particularly well captured by either field-measured or remotely sensed vegetation structure variables, but was best predicted by air photo image texture (R-2 = 0.13, p-value = 0.002). Density of ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), a woodland associated species, was best predicted by pixel-level satellite data (mean NDVI, R-2 = 0.54, p-value <0.001). Surprisingly and interestingly, remotely sensed vegetation structure measures (i.e., image texture) were often better predictors of avian density and species richness than field-measured vegetation structure, and thus show promise as a valuable tool for mapping habitat quality and characterizing biodiversity across broad areas.

Estimating Vegetation Beta Diversity from Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy and Unsupervised Clustering	REMOTE SENSING												Airborne remote sensing has an important role to play in mapping and monitoring biodiversity over large spatial scales. Techniques for applying this technology to biodiversity mapping have focused on remote species identification of individual crowns; however, this requires collection of a large number of crowns to train a classifier, which may limit the usefulness of this approach in many study regions. Based on the premise that the spectral variation among sites is related to their ecological dissimilarity, we asked whether it is possible to estimate the beta diversity, or turnover in species composition, among sites without the use of training data. We evaluated alternative methods using simulated communities constructed from the spectra of field-identified tree and shrub crowns from an African savanna. A method based on the k-means clustering of crown spectra produced beta diversity estimates (measured as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) among sites with an average pairwise correlation of similar to 0.5 with the true beta diversity, compared to an average correlation of similar to 0.8 obtained by a supervised species classification approach. When applied to savanna landscapes, the unsupervised clustering method produced beta diversity estimates similar to those obtained from supervised classification. The unsupervised method proposed here can be used to estimate the spatial structure of species turnover in a landscape when training data (e.g., tree crowns) are unavailable, providing top-down information for science, conservation and ecosystem management applications.

Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing of Turfgrass Quality, Water Stress, and Water Use under Different Soil and Irrigation Treatments	REMOTE SENSING												Optical and thermal remote sensing data were acquired at ground level over several turfgrass species under different soil and irrigation treatments in northern Colorado, USA. Three vegetation indices (VIs), estimated based on surface spectral reflectance, were sensitive to the effect of reduced water application on turfgrass quality. The temperature-based Grass Water Stress Index (GWSI) was also estimated by developing non-transpiring and non-water-stressed baselines. The VIs and the GWSI were all consistent in (i) having a non-linear relationship with the water application depth; and, (ii) revealing that the sensitivity of studied species to water availability increased in order from warm season mix to Poa pratensis L. and then Festuca spp.. Implemented soil preparation treatments had no significant effect on turfgrass quality and water stress. The differences between GWSI-based estimates of water use and the results of a complex surface energy balance model (METRIC) were not statistically significant, suggesting that the empirical GWSI method could provide similar results if the baselines are accurately developed under the local conditions of the study area.																	2072-4292					MAY	2013	5	5					2327	2347		10.3390/rs5052327								WOS:000319438900016

Studies on forest health and vegetation changes in Greece under the effects of climate changes	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Greece, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, is projected to be among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is therefore quite urgent to adapt forest management to the changing climate in order to enhance biodiversity and to enable the conservation of healthy and productive forests. In the framework of the project LIFE+ AdaptFor (www.life-adaptfor.gr), an effort was made to understand the ecological responses and the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in the face of climate change; the overall aim of the project is the development and implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies. Four study areas were selected where changes in vegetation, quite likely attributed to climate change, have already been observed (dieback of Scots pine and Greek fir, intrusion of conifers in broadleaved forests). To investigate the synergism of climatic parameters' alterations in the development of the occurring phenomena, time series of temperature and precipitation for the period 1950-2009 were produced and parameters of forest status were investigated, including mapping of vegetation changes through remote sensing. The findings support the hypothesis that climate change has an impact on forest health; the dieback of tree species can be attributed to outbreaks of pathogens (fungi and insects) which are associated with climatic parameters. However, the intrusion of conifer species into broadleaved forests showed no direct connection to climatic parameters, something that needs to be further investigated. In all cases, insufficient or inappropriate management practices applied in the areas exacerbated the occurring phenomena.																	0960-3115					MAY	2013	22	5			SI		1133	1150		10.1007/s10531-013-0451-2								WOS:000319140500003

Remote Sensing and GIS Based Approach for Identification of Artificial Recharge Sites	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the capabilities of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques for the demarcation of suitable sites for artificial recharge of groundwater aquifers, in the Loni watershed, located in Unnao and Raebareli districts, Uttar Pradesh, India. In this study, the SCS-CN model, groundwater depth data and morphological parameters (bifurcation ratio, elongation ratio, drainage density, ruggedness number, relief ratio, and circulatory ratio) have been used to delineate the recharge sites for undertaking water conservation measures. Augmentation of water resource is proposed in the watershed by constructing runoff storage structures, like check dam, percolation tank and nala bund. The site suitability for these water harvesting structures is determined by considering spatially varying parameters, like runoff potential, slope, groundwater fluctuation data and morphometric information of the watershed. GIS has been used as an effective tool to store, analyse and integrate spatial and attribute information pertaining to runoff, slope, drainage, groundwater fluctuation and morphometric characteristics for such studies.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAY	2013	27	7					2671	2689		10.1007/s11269-013-0310-7								WOS:000318004800047

Golam; Banu, Mehmuna R.; Seker, Dursun Zafer			Monitoring the drastic growth of ship breaking yards in Sitakunda: a threat to the coastal environment of Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The vast coastal and marine resources that occur along the southern edge of Bangladesh make it one of the most productive areas of the world. However, due to growing anthropogenic impacts, this area is under considerable environmental pressure from both physical and chemical stress factors. Ship breaking, or the dismantling and demolition of out-of-service ocean-going vessels, has become increasingly common in many coastal areas. To investigate the extent of ship breaking activities in Bangladesh along the Sitakunda coast, various spatial and non-spatial data were obtained, including remote sensing imagery, statistical records and published reports. Impacts to coastal and marine life were documented. Available data show that ship breaking activities cause significant physical disturbance and release toxic materials into the environment, resulting in adverse effects to numerous marine taxonomic groups such as fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Landsat imagery illustrates that the negatively impacted coastal area has grown 308.7 % from 367 ha in 1989 to 1,133 ha in 2010. Physicochemical and biological properties of coastal soil and water indicate substantially elevated pollution that poses a risk of local, regional and even global contamination through sea water and atmospheric transport. While damage to the coastal environment of Bangladesh is a recognized hazard that must be addressed, the economic benefits of ship breaking through job creation and fulfilling the domestic demand for recycled steel must be considered. Rather than an outright ban on beach breaking of ships, the enterprise must be recognized as a true and influential industry that should be held responsible for developing an economically viable and environmentally proactive growth strategy. Evolution of the industry toward a sustainable system can be aided through reasonable and enforceable legislative and judicial action that takes a balanced approach, but does not diminish the value of coastal conservation.

Assessment and monitoring of long-term forest cover changes in Odisha, India using remote sensing and GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Deforestation and fragmentation are important concerns in managing and conserving tropical forests and have global significance. In the Indian context, in the last one century, the forests have undergone significant changes due to several policies undertaken by government as well as increased population pressure. The present study has brought out spatiotemporal changes in forest cover and variation in forest type in the state of Odisha (Orissa), India, during the last 75 years period. The mapping for the period of 1924-1935, 1975, 1985, 1995 and 2010 indicates that the forest cover accounts for 81,785.6 km(2) (52.5 %), 56,661.1 km(2) (36.4 %), 51,642.3 km(2) (33.2 %), 49,773 km(2) (32 %) and 48,669.4 km(2) (31.3 %) of the study area, respectively. The study found the net forest cover decline as 40.5 % of the total forest and mean annual rate of deforestation as 0.69 % year(-1) during 1935 to 2010. There is a decline in annual rate of deforestation during 1995 to 2010 which was estimated as 0.15 %. Forest type-wise quantitative loss of forest cover reveals large scale deforestation of dry deciduous forests. The landscape analysis shows that the number of forest patches (per 1,000) are 2.463 in 1935, 10.390 in 1975, 11.899 in 1985, 12.193 in 1995 and 15.102 in 2010, which indicates high anthropogenic pressure on the forests. The mean patch size (km(2)) of forest decreased from 33.2 in 1935 to 5.5 in 1975 and reached to 3.2 by 2010. The study demonstrated that monitoring of long term forest changes, quantitative loss of forest types and landscape metrics provides critical inputs for management of forest resources.

Identifying the affected marine areas and the scale of influence on ecosystems is critical to assess the impacts of degraded water quality and to inform planning for catchment management and marine conservation. Studies using remotely-sensed data have contributed to our understanding of the occurrence and influence of river plumes, and to our ability to assess exposure of marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. However, refinement of plume modeling techniques is required to improve risk assessments. We developed a novel, complementary, approach to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. We used supervised classification of MODIS-Aqua true-color satellite imagery to map the extent of plumes and to qualitatively assess the dispersal of pollutants in plumes. We used the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest coral reef system, to test our approach. We combined frequency of plume occurrence with spatially distributed loads (based on a cost-distance function) to create maps of exposure to suspended sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We then compared annual exposure maps (2007-2011) to assess inter-annual variability in the exposure of coral reefs and seagrass beds to these pollutants. We found this method useful to map plumes and qualitatively assess exposure to land-based pollutants. We observed inter-annual variation in exposure of ecosystems to pollutants in the GBR, stressing the need to incorporate a temporal component into plume exposure/risk models. Our study contributes to our understanding of plume spatial-temporal dynamics of the GBR and offers a method that can also be applied to monitor exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to plumes and explore their ecological influences.

Hence, climate change is threatening human well-being and health. People spend the majority of their time indoors. Therefore, indoor temperatures (especially during the night) are of special importance with respect to well-being and health. Indoor air temperature depends on outdoor air temperatures, but is for example modified by type of urban structure, housing area, and may be also influenced by differences in the behavior of the inhabitants. Especially in cities, outdoor air temperatures depend on urban structure e.g. housing density, building arrangement, unpaved areas, types of urban structures, urban green, and other factors. Hence, the questions arise how types of urban structures are related to inner-urban temperature differences and how outdoor air temperatures influence indoor temperatures in dependence on urban housing conditions. This work is a part of a pilot study conducted during the summer 2010 which gathered data from remote sensing, mobile measurements, stationary measurements of air temperatures and relative humidity in areas with different housing structures, and of indoor as well as outdoor temperatures in occupied apartments. Household-survey data reported the subjective perception of heat stress. The study resulted in rather complex relationships between type of housing areas, indoor and outdoor temperatures, morning and evening temperatures, indoor and outdoor temperatures as well as subjective heat perception. Green spaces and types of residential areas are related to air temperatures. More green resulted in lower temperatures. Temperatures have a tendency to increase with increasing story number and are significantly higher in the top floor. An indoor heat island effect corresponding to the outdoor effect could be shown for the homes: Distance to city center is a predicting variable for both outdoor and indoor air temperatures. The subjective feeling of heat strain did not clearly reflect measured temperature differences but varies according to adaptation behavior. Indoor evening temperatures are most strongly related to heat perception. Indoor and outdoor temperatures are not clearly correlated because of several modifying factors. The results of this study underline the importance of conservation and development of building structures and types of urban structures which stay abreast of changes by global warming. In this context, special attention has to be paid to indoor temperatures.

This NTA protected a unique area worldwide, with extraordinarily high giant clam densities (up to 337 individuals per m(2) on 20-m transect). In 2012, a stock assessment survey revealed a dramatic decrease of the clam population. The reduced densities peaked at 38 ind m(-2) and the stock in the NTA decreased from 20.1 +/- 6.0 million to 1.9 +/- 0.55 million clams (mean +/- 95% confidence interval). Losses of similar proportions were observed throughout the atoll. Remarkably, the 83% overall loss of this natural resource used daily for consumption and for exports of clam meat to Tahiti Island went unnoticed by the local population. Field clues, including the size of live juveniles attached to the inside of dead shells, pointed to a massive mortality occurring about 3 years before the 2012 survey. Examinations of sea surface temperature satellite data identified a high range of temperature variations before March 2009. In agreement with past and recent events in other atolls, this anomaly is the most likely explanation of the massive loss of giant clams in Tatakoto Atoll, although the exact hydrological and biological secondary mechanisms that occurred in the lagoon remain unclear.

Satellite-based primary forest degradation assessment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2000-2010	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Primary forest extent, loss and degradation within the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were quantified from 2000 to 2010 by combining directly mapped forest cover extent and loss data (CARPE) with indirectly mapped forest degradation data (intact forest landscapes, IFL). Landsat data were used to derive both map inputs, and data from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimetry System) sensor were employed to validate the discrimination of primary intact and primary degraded forests. In the year 2000, primary humid tropical forests occupied 104 455 kha of the country, with 61% of these forests classified as intact. From 2000 to 2010, 1.02% of primary forest cover was lost due to clearing, and almost 2% of intact primary forests were degraded due to alteration and fragmentation. While primary forest clearing increased by a factor of two between 2000-2005 and 2005-2010, the degradation of intact forests slightly decreased. Fragmentation and selective logging were the leading causes of intact forest degradation, accounting for 91% of IFL area change. The 10 year forest degradation rate within designated logging permit areas was 3.8 times higher compared to other primary forest areas. Within protected areas the forest degradation rate was 3.7 times lower than in other primary forest areas. Forest degradation rates were high in the vicinity of major urban areas. Given the observed forest degradation rates, we infer that the degradation of intact forests could increase up to two-fold over the next decade.

J	Hamilton, S				Hamilton, Stuart			ASSESSING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE IN DISPLACING MANGROVE FOREST	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												To fill a gap in the marine science literature, I calculated the amount of mangrove deforestation in tropical estuaries that is attributable to commercial aquaculture. The eight countries analyzed were Indonesia, Brazil,. India, Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Ecuador. Together these countries contain approximately 36% of the world's remaining mangrove forest. One precommercial aquaculture remote sensing survey and one current remote sensing survey were undertaken in the major mangrove holding estuaries in each nation. The time period of the analysis varied by country based on the first arrival of large-scale commercial aquaculture, with the majority of initial surveys occurring in the early to mid-1970s and all the current surveys occurring post-2004. The surveys classified the land cover of 110,557 randomly located estuarine point locations and examined the land-cover change over time for each of these discreet locations. Among the largest and most representative account of global mangrove to aquaculture conversion, this study revealed that mangrove forests have lost 51.9% of their aerial extent during the analysis period. Of the mangrove loss during this period, I estimate that commercial aquaculture accounted for 28% of total mangrove loss across all nations resulting in approximately 544,000 ha of mangrove forest converted to aquaculture. There were significant differences in mangrove loss and mangrove to aquaculture conversion from nation to nation and even within nations.

J	Brandolin, PG; Avalos, MA; De Angelo, C				Brandolin, Pablo G.; Avalos, Miguel A.; De Angelo, Carlos			The impact of flood control on the loss of wetlands in Argentina	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems on Earth, but historically they have been degraded and destroyed by humans. The south east of Cordoba province in central Argentina was covered by hundreds of wetlands in a vast matrix of grasslands and savannas. In the last few centuries, this area has been mostly transformed into agriculture, forcing wetlands to become the last refuge for remaining wildlife. Since the mid-1970s, a gradual increase in rainfall has enlarged the area occupied by wetlands. To reverse the situation, vast flooded regions were altered by the construction of artificial drainage channels, including important areas for conservation of biodiversity. A non-supervised classification of satellite images was used to assess the changes in flooded areas of south-eastern Cordoba before the main floods (19871988) and after channelizations occurred (2007). Areas with high channelization (Cordoba) and non-channelization (Santa Fe) were compared for years with the same amount of accumulated rainfall. The pluviometric registers in both regions showed a trend of increasing annual rainfall, and this was reflected in a 65.9% increase (64 837 ha) of the flooded area in Santa Fe. Conversely, the channelized area in Cordoba suffered a loss of 12% of its ponds, corresponding to a 14.7% reduction of the flooded area (11 655 ha). A greater reduction in the flooded area (42.1%) was observed when considering only the western portion of the Cordoba site where most of the channelization occurred. These results indicate that besides the mitigation of floods, the channelization in Cordoba favoured agriculture expansion at the expense of wetlands, thereby destroying these wildlife refuges. Wetlands are important for their biodiversity, ecosystem services, and cultural legacy. In central Argentina the channelization process still continues, so it is of the utmost importance to support conservation actions leading to sustainable management and territorial planning of this region.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Modelling soil erosion risk based on RUSLE-3D using GIS in a Shivalik sub-watershed	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												The RUSLE-3D (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation-3D) model was implemented in geographic information system (GIS) for predicting the soil loss and the spatial patterns of soil erosion risk required for soil conservation planning. High resolution remote sensing data (IKONOS and IRS LISS-IV) were used to prepare land use/land cover and soil maps to derive the vegetation cover and the soil erodibility factor whereas Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to generate spatial topographic factor. Soil erodibility (K) factor in the sub-watershed ranged from 0.30 to 0.48. The sub-watershed is dominated by natural forest in the hilly landform and agricultural land in the piedmont and alluvial plains. Average soil loss was predicted to be lowest in very dense forest and highest in the open forest in the hilly landform. Agricultural land-1 and agriculture land-2 to have moderately high and low soil erosion risk, respectively. The study predicted that 15% area has 'moderate' to 'moderately high' and 26% area has high to very high risk of soil erosion in the sub-watershed.																	0253-4126	0973-774X				APR	2013	122	2					389	398		10.1007/s12040-013-0276-0								WOS:000317606500009						
J	Deus, D; Gloaguen, R; Krause, P				Deus, Dorothea; Gloaguen, Richard; Krause, Peter			Water Balance Modeling in a Semi-Arid Environment with Limited in situ Data Using Remote Sensing in Lake Manyara, East African Rift, Tanzania	REMOTE SENSING												The purpose of this paper is to estimate the water balance in a semi-arid environment with limited in situ data using a remote sensing approach. We focus on the Lake Manyara catchment, located within the East African Rift of northern Tanzania. We use a distributed conceptual hydrological model driven by remote sensing data to study the spatial and temporal variability of water balance parameters within the catchment. Satellite gravimetry GRACE data is used to verify the trends of the inferred lake level changes. The results show that the lake undergoes high spatial and temporal variations, characteristic of a semi-arid climate with high evaporation and low rainfall. We observe that the Lake Manyara water balance and GRACE equivalent water depth show comparable trends; a decrease after 2002 followed by a sharp increase in 2006-2007. Our modeling confirms the importance of the 2006-2007 Indian Ocean Dipole fluctuation in replenishing the groundwater reservoirs of East Africa. We thus demonstrate that water balance modeling can be performed successfully using remote sensing data even in complex climatic settings. Despite the small size of Lake Manyara, GRACE data showed great potential for hydrological research on smaller un-gauged lakes and catchments in similar semi-arid environments worldwide. The water balance information can be used for further analysis of lake variations in relation to soil erosion, climate and land cover/land use change as well as different lake management and conservation scenarios.

For the modelling of the species habitat on small spatial scales, the availability of suitable habitat variables is crucial. Collecting data in the field often incurs considerable costs. Forest agencies, however, collect data on forest structure and composition on a large extent and with a fine grain (200 m 200 m) during their forest inventories. Despite this the potential use of these data for habitat modelling and therefore conservation and wildlife management is still broadly neglected. Here, we evaluated and compared the performance of models based on environmental data derived purely from forest inventories, inventory data plus additional ecological information gained during the inventory, and aerial photographs to model the habitat of a forest species, the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.). The best models developed from each of the three data sources showed a similar performance over the area (28 450 ha) and the considered grain (50 ha grids); all models had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value 0.85, and various other metrics used for evaluating the models showed little differences. In all calibration plots, the predicted probabilities of presence were very similar to that of the observed probabilities, which indicated that our maps of the habitat suitability are a good representation of the real occurrences. This modelling of the capercaillies habitat using existing forest inventory data was successful because the variables collected in standard inventories also have some meaning for the ecology of the species. To model the habitat of forest species that need special resources outside the scope of forestry, possible additional variables could be sampled at low extra costs during such large inventories. There is therefore the potential for forest inventories, currently undertaken to support commercial forestry, to be applied in conservation, thereby supporting a multifunctional forestry.																	0015-752X					APR	2013	86	2					241	253		10.1093/forestry/cps081								WOS:000316272400010						
J	Soulis, KX; Valiantzas, JD				Soulis, Konstantinos X.; Valiantzas, John D.			Identification of the SCS-CN Parameter Spatial Distribution Using Rainfall-Runoff Data in Heterogeneous Watersheds	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method is widely used for predicting direct runoff volume for a given rainfall event. However, previous results indicated that when the CN value is determined from measured rainfall-runoff data in a natural watershed it is not possible to attribute a single CN value to the watershed, but actually the calculated CN values vary systematically with the rainfall depth. In a previous study, the authors investigated the hypothesis that the observed correlation between the calculated CN value and the rainfall depth in a watershed reflects the effect of the inevitable presence of soil-cover complex spatial variability along watersheds. In this study, a method to determine SCS-CN parameter values from rainfall-runoff data in heterogeneous watersheds is proposed. This method exploits the observed correlation between the calculated CN values and the rainfall depths in order to identify the spatial distribution of CN values along the watershed taking in to account the specific characteristics of the watershed. The proposed method utilizes the available rainfall-runoff data, remote sensing data and GIS techniques in order to provide information on spatial watershed characteristics that drive hydrological behavior. Furthermore, it allows the estimation of CN values for specific soil-land cover complexes in more complex watersheds. The proposed method was tested in a small experimental watershed in Greece. The watershed is equipped with a dense hydro-meteorological network, which together with a detailed land cover and soil survey using remote sensing and GIS techniques provided the detailed data required for this analysis.

J	Wasige, JE; Groen, TA; Smaling, E; Jetten, V				Wasige, John E.; Groen, Thomas A.; Smaling, Eric; Jetten, Victor			Monitoring basin-scale land cover changes in Kagera Basin of Lake Victoria using ancillary data and remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The Kagera Basin is a high value ecosystem in the Lake Victoria watershed because of the hydrological and food services it provides. The basin has faced large scale human induced land use and land cover changes (LUCC), but quantitative data is to date lacking. A combination of ancillary data and satellite imagery were interpreted to construct LUCC dynamics for the last century. This study is an initial step towards assessing the impact of LUCC on sustainable agriculture and water quality in the watershed. The results show that large trends of LUCC have rapidly occurred over the last 100 years. The most dominant LUCC processes were gains in farmland areas (not detectable in 1901 to 60% in 2010) and a net reduction in dense forest (7% to 2.6%), woodlands (51% to 6.9%) and savannas (35% to 19.6%) between 1901 and 2010. Forest degradation rapidly occurred during 1974 and 1995 but the forest re-grew between 1995 and 2010 due to forest conservation efforts. Afforestation efforts have resulted in plantation forest increases between 1995 and 2010. The rates of LUCC observed are higher than those reported in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and other parts of the world. This is one of the few studies in SSA at a basin scale that combines multi-source spatio-temporal data on land cover to enable long-term quantification of land cover changes. In the discussion we address future research needs for the area based on the results of this study. These research needs include quantifying the impacts of land cover change on nutrient and sediment dynamics, soil organic carbon stocks, and changes in biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using remote sensing energy balance and evapotranspiration to characterize montane landscape vegetation with focus on grass and pasture lands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Water and energy balance interactions with vegetation in mountainous terrain are influenced by topographic effects, spatial variation in vegetation type and density, and water availability. This is the case for the mountainous areas of northern Portugal, where ancestral irrigated meadows (lameiros) are a main component of a complex vegetation mosaic. The widely used surface energy balance model METRIC was applied to four Landsat images to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy balance terms in the identified land cover types (LCT). A discussion on the variability of evapotranspiration (ET) through the various vegetation types was supported by a comparison between the respective crop coefficients and those available in the literature corresponding to the LC, which has shown the appropriateness of METRIC estimates of ET. METRIC products derived from images of May and June - NDVI, surface temperature, net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and ET - were used to characterize the LCTs, through application of principal component analysis. Three principal components explained the variance of observed variables and their varimax rotated loadings allowed a good explanation of the behaviour of the explanatory variables in association with the LCTs. Information gained contributes to improve the characterization of the study area and may further support conservation and management of these mountain landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The challenge increases if the floristic variation within vegetation types (i.e., subtype variation of species composition) is the target. A desirable way to deal with this task may be to address such vegetation patterns with remote-sensing approaches. In particular data from multispectral sensors are easy to obtain, globally accessible, and often provide a high temporal resolution. They hence offer a comprehensive basis for vegetation mapping. The potential of such sensors for vegetation mapping has, however, never been thoroughly investigated. In particular, a systematic test regarding the spectral capabilities of these data for an assessment of detailed floristic variation has not been implemented to date. We thus addressed in this study the question how the ability of optical sensors to map floristic variation is affected by their respective spectral coverage and number of bands. To answer this question, we simulated monotemporal and multiseasonal data of eleven multispectral sensors. These data were used to model gradual transitions in species composition (i.e., floristic gradients) within three types of spontaneous vegetation typical for Central Europe using Partial Least Squares regression. Comparison of the model fits (ranging up to R-2 = 0.76 in cross-validation) illustrated the potential of multispectral data for detailed vegetation mapping. The results show that spectral coverage of the entire solar-reflective domain is the most important sensor characteristic for a successful assessment of floristic variation. Model and sensor performances as well as limitations are thoroughly discussed, and recommendations for sensor development are made based on the final conclusions of this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using satellite image-based maps and ground inventory data to estimate the area of the remaining Atlantic forest in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimation of large area forest attributes, such as area of forest cover, from remote sensing-based maps is challenging because of image processing, logistical, and data acquisition constraints. In addition, techniques for estimating and compensating for misclassification and estimating uncertainty are often unfamiliar. Forest area for the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil was estimated from each of four satellite image-based land cover maps, and an independent estimate was obtained using observations of forest/non-forest for more than 1000 points assessed as part of the Santa Catarina Forest and Floristic Inventory. The latter data were also used as an accuracy assessment sample for evaluating the four maps. The map analyses consisted of identifying classification errors, constructing error matrices, calculating associated accuracy measures, estimating bias, and constructing 95% confidence intervals for proportion forest estimates using a model-assisted regression estimator. Overall accuracies for the maps ranged from 0.876 to 0.929. The standard errors of the estimates were all smaller than the standard error of the simple random sampling estimate by factors ranging from approximately1.23 to approximately 1.69. The model-assisted regression estimator lends itself to easy implementation for adjusting for estimated classification bias and for constructing confidence intervals. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The case of nesting sea turtles in the Mediterranean	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Artificial night lights pose a major threat to multiple species. However, this threat is often disregarded in conservation management and action because it is difficult to quantify its effect. Increasing availability of high spatial-resolution satellite images may enable us to better incorporate this threat into future work, particularly in highly modified ecosystems such as the coastal zone. In this study we examine the potential of satellite night light imagery to predict the distribution of the endangered loggerhead (Caretta caretto) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtle nests in the eastern Mediterranean coastline. Using remote sensing tools and high resolution data derived from the SAC-C satellite and the International Space Station, we examined the relationship between the long term spatial patterns of sea turtle nests and the intensity of night lights along Israel's entire Mediterranean coastline. We found that sea turtles nests are negatively related to night light intensity and are concentrated in darker sections along the coast. Our resulting GLMs showed that night lights were a significant factor for explaining the distribution of sea turtle nests. Other significant variables included: cliff presence, human population density and infrastructure. This study is one of the first to show that night lights estimated with satellite-based imagery can be used to help explain sea turtle nesting activity at a detailed resolution over large areas. This approach can facilitate the management of species affected by night lights, and will be particularly useful in areas that are inaccessible or where broad-scale prioritization of conservation action is required.

J	Fan, FL; Deng, YB; Hu, XF; Weng, QH				Fan, Fenglei; Deng, Yingbin; Hu, Xuefei; Weng, Qihao			Estimating Composite Curve Number Using an Improved SCS-CN Method with Remotely Sensed Variables in Guangzhou, China	REMOTE SENSING												The rainfall and runoff relationship becomes an intriguing issue as urbanization continues to evolve worldwide. In this paper, we developed a simulation model based on the soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method to analyze the rainfall-runoff relationship in Guangzhou, a rapid growing metropolitan area in southern China. The SCS-CN method was initially developed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and is one of the most enduring methods for estimating direct runoff volume in ungauged catchments. In this model, the curve number (CN) is a key variable which is usually obtained by the look-up table of TR-55. Due to the limitations of TR-55 in characterizing complex urban environments and in classifying land use/cover types, the SCS-CN model cannot provide more detailed runoff information. Thus, this paper develops a method to calculate CN by using remote sensing variables, including vegetation, impervious surface, and soil (V-I-S). The specific objectives of this paper are: (1) To extract the V-I-S fraction images using Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis; (2) To obtain composite CN by incorporating vegetation types, soil types, and V-I-S fraction images; and (3) To simulate direct runoff under the scenarios with precipitation of 57mm (occurred once every five years by average) and 81mm (occurred once every ten years). Our experiment shows that the proposed method is easy to use and can derive composite CN effectively.

Open-source mapping and services for Web-based land-cover validation	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Monitoring land-cover changes on sites of conservation importance allows environmental problems to be detected, solutions to be developed and the effectiveness of actions to be assessed. However, the remoteness of many sites or a lack of resources means these data are frequently not available. Remote sensing may provide a solution, but large-scale mapping and change detection may not be appropriate, necessitating site-level assessments. These need to be easy to undertake, rapid and cheap. We present an example of a Web-based solution based on free and open-source software and standards (including PostGIS, OpenLayers, Web Map Services, Web Feature Services and GeoServer) to support assessments of land-cover change (and validation of global land-cover maps). Authorised users are provided with means to assess land-cover visually and may optionally provide uncertainty information at various levels: from a general rating of their confidence in an assessment to a quantification of the proportions of land-cover types within a reference area. Versions of this tool have been developed for the TREES-3 initiative (Simonetti et al., 2011). This monitors tropical land-cover change through ground-truthing at latitude/longitude degree confluence points, and for monitoring of change within and around Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by Birdlife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In this paper we present results from the second of these applications. We also present further details on the potential use of the land-cover change assessment tool on sites of recognised conservation importance, in combination with NDVI and other time series data from the eStation (a system for receiving, processing and disseminating environmental data). We show how the tool can be used to increase the usability of Earth observation data by local stakeholders and experts, and assist in evaluating the impact of protection regimes on land-cover change.

Around 7000 protected areas seek to safeguard the continent's rich biodiversity, but many of them face increasing management challenges. Human disturbances permeating into the parks directly and indirectly affect the ecological functioning and integrity of protected areas. With the envisaged expansion of the protected area network and further expected population and economic growth in the region, the competition between nature conservation and resources demands is likely to increase. The regular monitoring of land cover in and around protected areas can support the early detection of conservation conflicts. In this paper, we evaluate the use of the annual time series of MODIS Land Cover (LC) type product between 2003 and 2009 to monitor land cover changes at continental scale. We use the mean classification confidence and change frequency as indicators to assess the temporal consistency of the MODIS LC classifier for accurately monitoring land cover changes. We discuss the perspectives and issues for an automated monitoring of land cover changes in African protected areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thinking spatially: The importance of geospatial techniques for carnivore conservation	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Today, 27% of the known mammalian carnivore species are either extinct or threatened, undermining the health of many ecosystems, which provide resources and services that are crucial for human development. Carnivore research and management have been limited by the predominantly cryptic nature of carnivores, sometimes also by their large-scale habitat requirements and their remote distributions. As a consequence, many carnivore species currently remain under-studied. The increased availability and facilitated interpretation of remote-sensing imagery, combined with recent developments in landscape ecology and geographic information systems, have provided a wealth of analytical tools to overcome many of these traditional setbacks. These can be coupled with advances in multivariate statistics and species distribution models to formalise the link between spatial patterns in environmental variables and species occurrence. Such methods allow a greater understanding of the processes shaping habitat use, the effects of poaching and land-cover change, and assist in the design and monitoring of more targeted actions towards carnivores' long-term conservation.

Climate Impacts of Land-Cover and Land-Use Changes in Tropical Islands under Conditions of Global Climate Change	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Land-cover and land-use (LCLU) changes have significant climate impacts in tropical coastal regions with the added complexity of occurring within the context of a warming climate. The individual and combined effects of these two factors in tropical islands are investigated by use of an integrated mesoscale atmospheric modeling approach, taking the northeastern region of Puerto Rico as the test case. To achieve this goal, an ensemble of climate simulations is performed, combining two LCLU and global warming scenarios. Reconstructed agricultural maps and sea surface temperatures form the past (1955-59) scenario, while the present (2000-04) scenario is supported with high-resolution remote sensing LCLU data. Here, the authors show that LCLU changes produced the largest near-surface (2-m AGL) air temperature differences over heavily urbanized regions and that these changes do not penetrate the boundary layer. The influence of the global warming signal induces a positive inland gradient of maximum temperature, possibly because of increased trade winds in the present climatology. These increased winds also generate convergence zones and convection that transport heat and moisture into the boundary layer. In terms of minimum temperatures, the global warming signal induces temperature increases along the coastal plains and inland lowlands.

The impacts of shrimp farming on land use, employment and migration in Tumbes, northern Peru	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Export-oriented shrimp aquaculture appeared in the coastal landscape of Peru in the late 1970s. Its rapid development has entailed both positive and negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the newly emerging shrimp farming territory of the Tumbes river delta. Here we combine ground surveys and interviews with remote sensing analysis of the transformed environment in order to characterize and quantify the nature, origin and scale of the environmental and social impacts caused by the intrusion of aquaculture. Results show that shrimp farming has encroached on several land cover categories and converted 17% of the Peruvian mangrove. We provide an overview of the history and nature of those impacts. Minimum full-time equivalent employment, which occurred during a white-spot epidemic, was attained in 2001 with 439 full-time jobs; employment peaked in 2006, with 2660 full-time jobs. However, considering indirect benefits, remittances and the prevalence of part-time jobs, the population reliant on aquaculture probably exceeds 10,000. A geographical analysis of social networks reveals how shrimp farming draws a sustained influx of population from the Andes and how it modifies the interaction between population and the natural coastal environment. Recent sectorial improvements towards achieving a more sustainable management of the coastal resources are analysed, and additional recommendations predicated on a more integrated approach are provided.

J	Militao, T; Bourgeois, K; Roscales, JL; Gonzalez-Solis, J				Militao, Teresa; Bourgeois, Karen; Roscales, Jose L.; Gonzalez-Solis, Jacob			Individual migratory patterns of two threatened seabirds revealed using stable isotope and geolocation analyses	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Intraspecific variability in the migratory movements of seabirds is being revealed far more complex than hitherto recognized, and our lack of understanding undermines their effective protection. Our aim is to test whether the isotopic values of a single feather of two threatened seabirds, the Mediterranean (Puffinus yelkouan) and the Balearic (Puffinus mauretanicus) shearwaters allow the geographic assignment of birds to their non-breeding areas. Location These two species are known to use three main non-breeding areas: the NE Atlantic Ocean, the W Mediterranean and the Aegean-Black seas. Methods We clustered in three groups the 13C and 15N values of the first primary feather (P1), inferred to be grown during the non-breeding period, of 34 Mediterranean and 56 Balearic shearwaters accidentally caught by longliners. To link the isotopic values of P1 to its corresponding non-breeding area, we performed a discriminant function analysis (DFA) based on the three clusters and applied this function to feathers of known origin: P1 from seven Mediterranean shearwaters from Hyeres Archipelago (France) tracked with geolocators and body feathers from six chicks from Balearic shearwaters. To link the moulting patterns to the areas where the feathers were grown, we applied the DFA to a sequence of primary feathers of eight Balearic and five Mediterranean shearwaters (caught by longliners). Results Isotopic and tracking data indicate that none of the Mediterranean shearwaters migrated to the Atlantic. The cluster and discriminant function analyses revealed that 8% of Balearic and 54% of Mediterranean shearwater moulted P1 in the Mediterranean Sea. Migratory movements were reflected in the changing isotopic values of the primary sequences. Main conclusions Stable isotope analyses (SIA) are a powerful approach to reveal the intraspecific variability in the migratory patterns of seabirds that use distinct isotopic areas over their annual cycle. The assignment of birds to their non-breeding areas by means of SIA is a simple and effective tool that can help to evaluate the impact of human activities in remote areas not only at population but also at individual level, which is an essential knowledge for the management and conservation of threatened species.

However, this procedure that includes data collection, periodical observations, and multivariate risk assessment analysis is difficult to accomplish with the traditional practices and methods since it is time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, many archaeological sites and monuments are located at inaccessible areas, far away from the main road network and urban areas. Satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can successfully confront this problem by providing the scientists with integrated monitoring of the study areas and the unique advantage to store and manipulate a large amount of spatial and attribute data simultaneously. Actually the monitoring and identification of several natural and anthropogenic hazards in the vicinity of the cultural heritage sites in Cyprus, seems to be one of the main priorities of its governmental and municipal authorities. This study aims to integrate both satellite remote sensing techniques and GIS in a multidisciplinary approach, for monitoring anthropogenic and natural hazards with the use of archived and up-to-date multitemporal remotely sensed images in the study area, namely in areas nearby cultural heritage sites and monuments in Cyprus. In this study anthropogenic hazards include urbanisation and extended land use changes in the surroundings of archaeological sites and natural hazards concern seismicity and sea erosion.

Spatial distribution and carbon stock of the Saxaul vegetation of the winter-cold deserts of Middle Asia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Carbon stocks and carbon accumulation in the earth's drylands have gained increasing attention. The winter-cold deserts of Middle Asia, i.e. in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, cover an area of 2.5 million km(2). Within these deserts, the two Saxaul species White Saxaul (Haloxylon persicum Bunge ex Boiss. & Buhse) and Black Saxaul (Haloxylon aphyllum (Minkw.) Iljin) are dominant woody species with a potential distribution area of about 500,000 km(2). From the 1950s until today, the Saxaul vegetation has been degraded through logging and over-grazing. In this paper, we estimate the current and potential living above ground and below ground biomass of the Saxaul vegetation and its carbon stock. The living above ground biomass ranges between 1.5 t/ha and 3 t/ha. The potential carbon stocks above ground and below ground amount to 29.4-52.1 million t and 22-81.4 million t, respectively. Today, only 11%-28% of the potential biomass and carbon stock have remained. The carbon stock of the Saxaul vegetation is low compared to other ecosystems of the earth, but restoration and conservation of Saxaul vegetation is one way to sequester carbon through vegetation for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, which do not have much other woody vegetation.

Forest patch connectivity diagnostics and prioritization using graph theory	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Landscape level forest connectivity regulates species level biodiversity, wildlife movement, seed dispersal and ecological factors. Geospatial assessment of forest connectivity at the landscape level is realized as one of the important frameworks to prioritize the biodiversity conservation strategies. The paper presents an approach to identify the optimal threshold distance and set of forest patches (component) using graph theory to propose potential connectivity alternatives over fragmented tropical deciduous forest tracts in parts of Eastern Ghats of India. The study analyzed 598 forest patches (derived from remote sensing data) constituting an area of 3502.87 km(2) which is distributed over 10,807 km(2). Optimal threshold distance and components were derived using graph theory based connectivity indices namely, Integral Index of Connectivity importance value (dIIC), Landscape Coincidence Probability importance value (dLCP) and also addressing patch size, number, inter distance and relative importance of each patch in the totality of the landscape. The study identified a total of 191 components at an optimal threshold distance of 250 m for potential connectivity. A component consisting of 145 patches of which 5 patches having high relative importance value within the component were identified for prioritizing the connectivity efforts. Further analysis on the three fractions of dIIC (dIICintra, dIICflux and dIICconnector) justified the importance of individual patches for connectivity. Proposed connectivity could enhance the forest habitat network through these potential patches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Range Management Affects Native Ungulate Populations in Peninsula Valdes, a World Natural Heritage	PLOS ONE												Sheep rearing is the main productive activity in Patagonian rangelands, where guanacos are the only native ungulate. Ranchers perceive a decrease in range carrying capacity as guanaco numbers increase, therefore guanaco conservation within private lands becomes a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly evident in the World Natural Heritage Peninsula Valdes (PV), where there is a need to harmonize livestock production and biodiversity conservation. While sheep rearing prevails as the primary land use in the area, some ecotourism initiatives have been implemented to complement livestock production. In order to study how land use affected guanaco distribution, we characterized PV's ranches in terms of land subdivision, primary productivity, stocking-rate and management type, and assess how these variables affected guanaco encounter rates. Smaller ranches were composed of smaller paddocks (mean size 4.8 km(2)), which showed higher values of the remote-sensing derived Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI) (mean 0.14) and held higher sheep densities (mean 108.0 sheep/km(2)), while larger management units (mean size 23.8 km(2)), showed lower EVI values (mean 0.12) and lower stocking-rates (mean 36.7 sheep/km(2)). This pattern suggests that primary productivity has been a decisive factor to determine the minimal paddock size set by ranchers in PV, apparently precluding excessive land-subdivision in less productive areas. Guanaco encounter rate, expressed as number of guanacos per travelled kilometre, was inversely related to EVI and stocking-rate. However, land subdivision was the better predictor of guanaco encounter-rate within only sheep ranches, finding more guanacos per kilometre as paddock size increased. In contrast, in ranches where ecotourism was implemented as a complementary activity, guanaco encounter-rates were greater, regardless of paddock size. Our results suggest that the implementation of an additional activity by which landowners derive benefits from wildlife has prompted a beneficial outcome for guanacos, presumably through a decrease in harassment intensity. Finally, we propose possible mechanisms by which land subdivision may affect guanaco distribution and potential alternatives for the inclusion of wildlife conservation in a context of extensive livestock production.																	1932-6203					FEB 4	2013	8	2							e55655	10.1371/journal.pone.0055655								WOS:000314691100062	23390546

A review of earth observation using mobile personal communication devices	COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES												Earth observation using mobile personal communication devices (MPCDs) is a recent advance with considerable promise for acquiring important and timely measurements. Globally, over 5 billion people have access to mobile phones, with an increasing proportion having access to smartphones with capabilities such as a camera, microphone, global positioning system (GPS), data storage, and networked data transfer. Scientists can view these devices as embedded sensors with the potential to take measurements of the Earth's surface and processes. To advance the state of Earth observation using MPCDs, scientists need to consider terms and concepts, from a broad range of disciplines including citizen science, image analysis, and computer vision. In this paper, as a result of our literature review, we identify a number of considerations for Earth observation using MPCDs such as methods of field collection, collecting measurements over broad areas, errors and biases, data processing, and accessibility of data. Developing effective frameworks for mobile data collection with public participation and strategies for minimizing bias, in combination with advancements in image processing techniques, will offer opportunities to collect Earth sensing data across a range of scales and perspectives, complimenting airborne and spaceborne remote sensing measurements.

J	Murphy, M; McGovern, E; Pavia, S				Murphy, Maurice; McGovern, Eugene; Pavia, Sara			Historic Building Information Modelling - Adding intelligence to laser and image based surveys of European classical architecture	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) is a novel prototype library of parametric objects, based on historic architectural data and a system of cross platform programmes for mapping parametric objects onto point cloud and image survey data. The HBIM process begins with remote collection of survey data using a terrestrial laser scanner combined with digital photo modelling. The next stage involves the design and construction of a parametric library of objects, which are based on the manuscripts ranging from Vitruvius to 18th century architectural pattern books. In building parametric objects, the problem of file format and exchange of data has been overcome within the BIM ArchiCAD software platform by using geometric descriptive language (GDL). The plotting of parametric objects onto the laser scan surveys as building components to create or form the entire building is the final stage in the reverse engineering process. The final HBIM product is the creation of full 3D models including detail behind the object's surface concerning its methods of construction and material make-up. The resultant HBIM can automatically create cut sections, details and schedules in addition to the orthographic projections and 3D models (wire frame or textured) for both the analysis and conservation of historic objects, structures and environments.

J	Sun, J; Southworth, J				Sun, Jing; Southworth, Jane			Remote Sensing-Based Fractal Analysis and Scale Dependence Associated with Forest Fragmentation in an Amazon Tri-National Frontier	REMOTE SENSING												In the Amazon, the development and paving of roads connects regions and peoples, and over time can form dense and recursive networks, which often serve as nodes for continued development. These developed areas exhibit robust fractal structures that could potentially link their spatial patterns with deforestation processes. Fractal dimension is commonly used to describe the growth trajectory of such fractal structures and their spatial-filling capacities. Focusing on a tri-national frontier region, we applied a box-counting method to calculate the fractal dimension of the developed areas in the Peruvian state of Madre de Dios, Acre in Brazil, and the department of Pando in Bolivia, from 1986 through 2010. The results indicate that development has expanded in all three regions with declining forest cover over time, but with different patterns and rates in each country. Such differences were summarized within a proposed framework to indicate deforestation progress/level, which can be used to understand and regulate deforestation and its evolution in time. In addition, the role and influence of scale was also assessed, and we found local fractal dimensions are not invariant at different spatial scales and thus concluded such scale-dependent features of fragmentation patterns are here mainly shaped by the road paving.

Representative case studies are presented in the special issue "Advances in Remote Sensing of Agriculture". To complement the examples published within the special issue, a few main applications with regional to global focus were selected for this review, where remote sensing contributions are traditionally strong. The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated. The review concludes with some key recommendations.

The inventory approach is a realistic method for estimating the organic carbon pool in China's wetlands at the national scale. An updated data and inventory approach were used to estimate the amount of organic carbon stored in China's wetlands. Primary results are as follows: (1) the organic carbon pool of China's wetlands is between 5.39 and 7.25 Pg, accounting for 1.3%-3.5% of the global level; (2) the estimated values and percentages of the organic carbon contained in the soil, water and vegetation pools in China's wetlands are 5.04-6.19 Pg and 85.4%-93.5%, 0.22-0.56 Pg and 4.1%-7.7%, 0.13-0.50 Pg and 2.4%-6.9%, respectively. The soil organic carbon pool of China's wetlands is greater than our previous estimate of 3.67 Pg, but is lower than other previous estimates of 12.20 and 8-10 Pg. Based on the discussion and uncertainty analysis, some research areas worthy of future attention are presented.

Satellite detection of earlier wheat sowing in India and implications for yield trends	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Wheat is a staple crop throughout much of India, but in many areas it is commonly sown past the optimum window for yields. Recent technologies, such as adoption of no-till practices or earlier maturing cotton and rice varieties, have enabled some farmers to sow wheat earlier, but repeatable and publicly available measurements of sow date trends are lacking. Here we utilize satellite measurements since 2000 to estimate sow dates over a decade throughout wheat growing areas in India. Comparisons with ground-based sow dates in Punjab confirmed the reliability of satellite estimates, and data from two independent satellite sensors were used as a robustness check. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) shifts toward earlier sowing of wheat throughout much of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, with insignificant changes in Punjab. A production-weighted average of the entire region indicates that, on average, wheat was sown 1 week earlier by 2010 than it was at the beginning of the decade. Using previously published experimental estimates of yield gains from earlier sowing, we estimate that an overall yield gain of at least 5% averaged across India can be explained by the sow date trend. Given that national yield changes since 2000 have been less than 5%, our results indicate that the sow date shift has been a major factor in yield changes over the past decade, and that the net yield effect of all factors other than sow date has been close to zero, perhaps even negative. The results also indicate that sow dates in much of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh are nearing or already at the optimum window for yields, so that yield benefits from sow date shifts will likely diminish in the next decade.

Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using a chronological series of remote sensing data. Impacts of landscape change on local livelihoods were investigated in seven villages through interviews with various stakeholders. The study reveals that the complex mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However, over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways can be maintained.

ESTIMATION OF JUVENILE SALMON HABITAT IN PACIFIC RIM RIVERS USING MULTISCALAR REMOTE SENSING AND GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												We conducted a regional classification and analysis of riverine floodplain physical features that represent key attributes of salmon rearing habitats. Riverine habitat classifications, including floodplain area and river channel complexity, were derived at moderate (30m) spatial resolution using multispectral Landsat imagery and global terrain data (90m) encompassing over 3400000km2 and most North Pacific Rim (NPR) salmon rivers. Similar classifications were derived using finer scale (i.e. 2.4-m resolution) remote sensing data over a smaller set of 31 regionally representative flood plains. A suite of physical habitat metrics (e.g. channel sinuosity, nodes, floodplain width) were derived from each dataset and used to assess the congruence between similar habitat features at the different spatial scales and to evaluate the utility of moderate scale geospatial data for determining abundance of selected juvenile salmon habitats relative to fine scale remote sensing measurements. The resulting habitat metrics corresponded favorably (p<0.0001) between the moderate scale and the fine scale floodplain classifications; a subset of these metrics (channel nodes and maximum floodplain width) also were strong indicators (R2>0.5, p<0.0001) of floodplain habitats defined from the finer scale analysis. These relationships were used to estimate the abundance and distribution of three critical shallow water floodplain habitats for juvenile salmon (parafluvial and orthofluvial springs, and shallow shore) across the entire NPR domain. The resulting database provides a potential tool to evaluate and prioritize salmon conservation efforts both within individual river systems and across major catchments on the basis of physical habitat distribution and abundance.

Identifying nascent wetland forest conversion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wetlands cover large areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, their extent and distribution have not been accurately mapped. While wetland forests remain largely undisturbed, increasing threats by anthropogenic activities have been observed in areas with high population density per arable or exploitable land. The scarcity of terra firma forests in some territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has forced local communities to develop cropping methods that allow for cultivation in periodically flooded areas. Assessing wetlands extent and status is critical for long term conservation of these highly vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, we use multi-source and multi-resolution optical and radar remotely sensed data and elevation derived indices to map the wetlands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Results showed that wetlands are a significant part of the landscape in the country, covering an estimated 440,000 km(2) or 19.2 % of the total country area. By combining the wetlands map with a previously produced land cover depiction of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a map including forested wetlands as a thematic class was derived. We investigated whether high terra firma population density and low percent remaining terra firma forest are related at the lowest administrative level (Sector); specifically, we tested these two variables as predictors of wetland forest cover loss. A polynomial regression relating population and primary terra firma forest to wetland forest cover loss yielded an r (2) of 0.76, illustrating a nascent and significant land cover change dynamic. Areas most at risk for future wetland forest loss lie in the western Cuvette, and include (north-south) the Sud-Ubangi, Mongala, Equateur and Mai-Ndombe Districts. By quantifying available upland forest resources and overlaying with population density, it was possible to identify stressed areas inside of the forest domain (traditionally known for having generically high levels of forest resources). Results illustrate the need for addressing issues of wetland forest management and protection in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, especially where increasing populations are exhausting primary terra firma forest resources.																	0923-4861					FEB	2013	21	1					29	43		10.1007/s11273-012-9277-z								WOS:000314691500003

The imprint of humans on landscape patterns and vegetation functioning in the dry subtropics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Dry subtropical regions (DST), originally hosting woodlands and savannas, are subject to contrasting human pressures and land uses and different degrees of water limitation. We quantified how this variable context influences landscape pattern and vegetation functioning, by exploring the associations between three groups of variables describing (i) human pressures (population density, poverty, and market isolation) and climate (water availability), (ii) landscape pattern (woody cover, infrastructure, paddock size, etc.), and (iii) vegetation functioning (magnitude and stability of primary productivity), in regions of Asia, Africa, Australia, and America. We collected data from global socioeconomic databases and remote sensing products for 4525 samples (representing uncultivated and cultivated conditions), located along 35 transects spanning semiarid to subhumid conditions. A Reciprocal Averaging ordination of uncultivated samples revealed a dominant gradient of declining woody cover accompanied by lower and less stable productivity. This gradient, likely capturing increasing vegetation degradation, had a negative relationship with poverty (characterized by infant mortality) and with market isolation (measured by travel time to large cities). With partial overlaps, regions displayed an increasing degradation ranking from Africa to South America, to Australia, to North America, and to Asia. A similar analysis of cultivated samples, showed a dominant gradient of increasing paddock size accompanied by decreasing primary productivity stability, which included all regions except Asia. This gradient was negatively associated with poverty and population density. A unique combination of small paddocks and high infrastructure differentiated Asian cultivated samples. While water availability gradients were related to productivity trends, they were unrelated to landscape pattern. Our comparative approach suggests that, in DST, human pressures have an overwhelming role driving landscape patterns and one shared with water availability shaping vegetation functioning.																	1354-1013					FEB	2013	19	2					441	458		10.1111/gcb.12060								WOS:000314219200011	23504783

When bugs reveal biodiversity	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												One of the fundamental challenges of conservation biology is gathering data on species distribution and abundance. And unless conservationists know where a species is found and in which numbers, it is very difficult to apply effective conservation efforts. In today's age of increasingly powerful monitoring tools, instant communication and online databases, one might be forgiven for thinking that such knowledge is easy to come by. However, of the approximately 5,400 terrestrial mammals on the IUCN Red List, no fewer than 789 (ca. 14%) are listed as Data Deficient (IUCN 2012) IUCN's term for haven't got a clue. Until recently, the only way to gather information of numbers and distribution of terrestrial mammals (and many other vertebrates) was through observational-based approaches such as visual records, the presence of tracks or spoor or even identification from bushmeat or hunters' trophies pinned to the walls in local villages. While recent technological developments have considerably improved the efficacy of such approaches, for example, using remote-sensing devices such as audio- or camera-traps or even remote drones (Koh & Wich 2012), there has been a growing realization of the power of molecular methods that identify mammals based on trace evidence. Suitable substrates include the obvious, such as faecal and hair samples (e.g. Vigilant et al. 2009), to the less obvious, including environmental DNA extracted from sediments, soil or water samples (e.g. Taberlet et al. 2012), and as recently demonstrated, the dietary content of blood-sucking invertebrates (Gariepy et al. 2012; Schnell et al. 2012). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Calvignac-Spencer et al. (2013) present a potentially powerful development in this regard; diet analysis of carrion flies. With their near global distribution, and as most field biologists know, irritatingly high frequency in most terrestrial areas of conservation concern (which directly translates into ease of sampling them), the authors present extremely encouraging results that indicate how carnivorous flies may soon represent a strong weapon in the conservation arsenal.

A remote sensing approach to biodiversity assessment and regionalization of the Canadian boreal forest	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Successful conservation planning for the Canadian boreal forest requires biodiversity data that are both accessible and reliable. Spatially exhaustive data is required to inform on conditions, trends and context, with context enabling consideration of conservation opportunities and related trade-offs. However, conventional methods for measuring biodiversity, while useful, are spatially constrained, making it difficult to apply over wide geographic regions. Increasingly, remotely sensed imagery and methods are seen as a viable approach for acquiring explicit, repeatable and multi-scale biodiversity data over large areas. To identify relevant remotely derived environmental indicators specific to biodiversity within the Canadian boreal forest, we assessed indicators of the physical environment such as seasonal snow cover, topography and vegetation production. Specifically, we determined if the indicators provided distinct information and whether they were useful predictors of species richness (tree, mammal, bird and butterfly species). Using cluster analysis, we also assessed the applicability of these indicators for broad ecosystem classification of the Canadian boreal forest and the subsequent attribution of these stratified regions (i.e. clusters). Our results reveal that the indicators used in the cluster creation provided unique information and explained much of the variance in tree (92.6%), bird (84.07%), butterfly (61.4%) and mammal (22.6%) species richness. Spring snow cover explained the most variance in species richness. Results further show that the 15 clusters produced using cluster analysis were principally stratified along a latitudinal gradient and, while varied in size, captured a range of different environmental conditions across the Canadian boreal forest. The most important indicators for discriminating between the different cluster groups were seasonal greenness, a multipart measure of climate, topography and land use, and wetland cover, a measure of the percentage of wetland within a 1 km(2) cell.

It is important to evaluate the effectiveness of World Heritage site management. As a part of the South China Karst World Natural Heritage, Yunnan Shilin Karst was included in the World Heritage list on 27 June 2007. To quantify the effects of the Yunnan Shilin Karst site conservation, the changes in ecosystem service value of the Yunnan Shilin Karst area and the nearby buffer zone were analyzed by utilizing remote-sensing images, geographic information system and an ecosystem service value model. The results indicate that significant conservation effects of the Yunnan Shilin Karst have been made since 1992, and of the buffer zone since 2004.																	1866-6280					FEB	2013	68	3					821	832		10.1007/s12665-012-1785-x								WOS:000313449900019

Application of multi-scale remote sensing imagery to detection and hazard analysis	NATURAL HAZARDS												To both collect terrain data rapidly and save labor costs, the present study employs high-spatiotemporal-resolution imaging through Formosat-2 and aerial photography through unmanned aerial vehicles. In daily visits to the same area, images taken by Formosat-2 can be employed as data for long-term observation. Unclouded images from 2006 to 2010 processed with a false-color overlay and calculated of the normalized difference vegetation index are selected as terrain data. Aerial photos taken by unmanned aerial vehicles are utilized ground-truth data. These two types of data are analyzed to proceed with supervised classification. The results reveal that in the study area mangroves are the most exuberant in summer. The growth of mangroves in Sihcao Wetland remained in dynamic equilibrium from 2006 to 2010 without any sharp increase or decrease in quantity. This proposed method is believed to be suitable to investigate and preserve mangroves by long-term image monitoring and to avoid any unnatural influence on these conservation areas.																	0921-030X					FEB	2013	65	3					2241	2252		10.1007/s11069-012-0472-2								WOS:000313008500056

D.; Collischonn, Walter; Buarque, Diogo Costa			Validation of a full hydrodynamic model for large-scale hydrologic modelling in the Amazon	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A key aspect of large river basins partially neglected in large-scale hydrological models is river hydrodynamics. Large-scale hydrologic models normally simulate river hydrodynamics using simplified models that do not represent aspects such as backwater effects and flood inundation, key factors for some of the largest rivers of the world, such as the Amazon. In a previous paper, we have described a large-scale hydrodynamic approach resultant from an improvement of the MGB-IPH hydrological model. It uses full Saint Venant equations, a simple storage model for flood inundation and GIS-based algorithms to extract model parameters from digital elevation models. In the present paper, we evaluate this model in the Solimoes River basin. Discharge results were validated using 18 stream gauges showing that the model is accurate. It represents the large delay and attenuation of flood waves in the Solimoes basin, while simplified models, represented here by Muskingum Cunge, provide hydrographs are wrongly noisy and in advance. Validation against 35 stream gauges shows that the model is able to simulate observed water levels with accuracy, representing their amplitude of variation and timing. The model performs better in large rivers, and errors concentrate in small rivers possibly due to uncertainty in river geometry. The validation of flood extent results using remote sensing estimates also shows that the model accuracy is comparable to other flood inundation modelling studies. Results show that (i) river-floodplain water exchange and storage, and (ii) backwater effects play an important role for the Amazon River basin hydrodynamics.

J	Olea, PP; Mateo-Tomas, P				Olea, Pedro P.; Mateo-Tomas, Patricia			Assessing Species Habitat Using Google Street View: A Case Study of Cliff-Nesting Vultures	PLOS ONE												The assessment of a species' habitat is a crucial issue in ecology and conservation. While the collection of habitat data has been boosted by the availability of remote sensing technologies, certain habitat types have yet to be collected through costly, on-ground surveys, limiting study over large areas. Cliffs are ecosystems that provide habitat for a rich biodiversity, especially raptors. Because of their principally vertical structure, however, cliffs are not easy to study by remote sensing technologies, posing a challenge for many researches and managers working with cliff-related biodiversity. We explore the feasibility of Google Street View, a freely available on-line tool, to remotely identify and assess the nesting habitat of two cliff-nesting vultures (the griffon vulture and the globally endangered Egyptian vulture) in northwestern Spain. Two main usefulness of Google Street View to ecologists and conservation biologists were evaluated: i) remotely identifying a species' potential habitat and ii) extracting fine-scale habitat information. Google Street View imagery covered 49% (1,907 km) of the roads of our study area (7,000 km(2)). The potential visibility covered by on-ground surveys was significantly greater (mean: 97.4%) than that of Google Street View (48.1%). However, incorporating Google Street View to the vulture's habitat survey would save, on average, 36% in time and 49.5% in funds with respect to the on-ground survey only. The ability of Google Street View to identify cliffs (overall accuracy = 100%) outperformed the classification maps derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) (62-95%). Nonetheless, high-performance DEM maps may be useful to compensate Google Street View coverage limitations. Through Google Street View we could examine 66% of the vultures' nesting-cliffs existing in the study area (n = 148): 64% from griffon vultures and 65% from Egyptian vultures. It also allowed us the extraction of fine-scale features of cliffs. This World Wide Web-based methodology may be a useful, complementary tool to remotely map and assess the potential habitat of cliff-dependent biodiversity over large geographic areas, saving survey-related costs.

It is a sensitive indicator for environment change. Climate is the uppermost factor deciding vegetation type and distributing on the earth, while vegetation is the brightest reflection and integration symbol about climate. Using the distribution of arid and humid regions of China, the typical semi-arid/semi-humid region(Xilamulun river) as a study areas. Xilamulun river has important ecological significance because it is ecological conservation and water source protection area of Northern china. As an index of denoting basin's vegetation cover,NDVI is influenced by many climatic factors such as precipitation and average air temperature.The influence of precipitation on vegetation coverage of xilamulun river basin was qualitatively analyzed using multi-temporal Landsat TM (MSS) image during the recent 10 years,and analyze the vegetation dynamic changes in xilamulun river basin and its relationship with human activities. Firstly, the influence of exterior factor, such as phonology and relative radiometric correction, on NDVI was removed by normalization of different period remote sensing image. Preliminary Comparison of coverage in Xilamulun river,The coverage appeared to have a increase trend from 2000 to 2010. Therefore, Through protracted efforts the basin has made great achievements in the protection and nurturing of the ecological environment, of which afforestation is an outstanding example. Analysis of dynamic changes of the vegetation covers in two phases from 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2010, respectively. The vegetation cover showed an 1 increased trend from 2000 to 2010, which increased significantly in 2000 to 2005.The spring and winter showed in the opposite direction change in 2000 to 2005, but the same direction change trend in 2005 to 2010 by synthesized analysis of relationship of precipitation and vegetation cover. There are also an opposite direction change trend in spring and fall in two phases. The main factors influencing the vegetation cover change is human activity rather than climate factors in 2000 to 2010. According to the comprehensive analysis of precipitation and related data of the protection of the ecological environment in BalM right banner, human activities were proven as the main reason of vegetation fraction change during 2000-2010, such as conversion of cropland to forest, ecological migration, afforestation by the BalM right banner. Finally, the residual analysis of NDVI indicates that human activities have promoted or destroyed the vegetation cover in some areas of xilamulun river basin.																	2334-3168						2013							307	312										WOS:000342772000060

The paper addresses the role of satellite remote sensing technologies as a tool for monitoring, assessment, reporting and verification of carbon credits. In particular, image fusion techniques were used to assess and monitor forests based on moderate resolution images of MODIS and TM data. The result showed that satellite image fusion could provide more spatial details and better spectral information compared with the original image and thus prove to be an excellent tool for monitoring carbon storage change for REDD.																	2161-024X						2013																		WOS:000339361500167

A method of modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) combined with K-T transformation was proposed to distinguish water body from mountain shadow. First, MNDWI of original image was calculated and the threshold values were set across the interval (0.25, 0.8). Then the original image was processed by K-T transformation method, and the pixels were extracted using the third component (wetness) threshold value of less than -80. Finally, the two images were added together after mask processing, thus water information was identified. The results showed that this method of combing MNDWI with K-T transformation could not only remove the influence of mountain shadow of MNDWI method alone, but also avoid the confusion of water and buildings existing in image after K-T transformation. The extraction accuracy of water body was up to 93%, which suggests that this approach has better performance than some previous methods such as single-band threshold technique and the spectrum-photometric method.																	2161-024X						2013																		WOS:000339361500144

Distribution of Commiphora wightii (Arnt.) Bhand. in Rajasthan with Special Emphasis on its Conservation Planning in Arid Areas	VEGETOS												Commiphora wightii (Arnott) Bhand., commonly known as 'Guggal', is an important medicinal plant that has been categorized as threatened but International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has put it under data deficient (DD) category. Consequently, placing it in 'Data Deficient' category of IUCN requires detailed information on its spatial distribution and other related aspects. Hence we report here the results of our appraisal of Guggal in Rajasthan, using remote sensing and ground truthing. A base map of Guggal was prepared using Geographical Information System (GIS) open source software Quantum GIS, SAGA. Landsat ETM+ and ASTER GDEM (Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model) Satellite Data were used. By clipping Aster GDEM Data with district boundary it was then provided color range to get elevation information. A digital elevation model of Rajasthan physiography was developed from ASTER and GDEM Data that has 30 m resolution. GIS layers of area of occurrences for Guggal plant and elevation were created. This map along with topographic sheets of 1:50000 were used for field traversing and ground truthing in 35 expeditions from 2009 to 2012. From the ground data, GPS data of longitude, latitude and altitude of each survey points were used in creating GIS layers in a 3D elevation map as also Guggal distribution and density map in 20 districts of Rajasthan. Results revealed that Guggal predominantly occurs in hilly and piedmonts zone. Its density was low in southeast Rajasthan (2-5 plants/ha) compared to western Rajasthan (8-10 plants/ha. In view of better vigour and survival in native sites in western Rajasthan's bioclimatic conditions, its ex-situ and in-situ conservation will be more successful in the districts of Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore and Jodhpur than in other areas.																	0970-4078	2092-7843					2013	26				SI		113	120		10.5958/j.2229-4473.26.2s.129                                                   								WOS:000335969200017

Despite their great value, mangroves have one of the highest rates of degradation of any global habitat, which is about 1% of the existing area per year. In fact, the socioeconomic value and ecosystem services of mangroves as a natural product are underestimated. The ecosystem services provided by mangroves are often ignored by the ongoing process of mangrove conversion. This is a major reason why conservation of this ecosystem is not a popular alternative. Thus, the main objective of this study is to evaluate the changes in mangrove forests and valuation of their ecosystem services. SPOT 5 imageries of years 2000 and 2010 have been used for change detection analysis. The vegetation index such as NDVI and AVI and unsupervised classification technique were employed in image processing. In order to obtain the value of socioeconomic impact from the mangrove changes and biodiversity disturbances, the ecosystem service valuation (ESV) model was applied. Results show that the total value of the existing mangrove forest ecosystem service was RM1,901,859.84. The value per unit area is about RM 1,650.92 /ha. The total values of others were RM161, 33.2 (crop land) and RM3,107,500 (water bodies), respectively. It is evident that Sungai Merbok's Mangrove Forest Reserve is very important for coastal ecology, where the orientation of mangrove ecosystem is huge and serves to provide essential services for the community. It also plays a crucial role in providing ecological balance to the coastal environment.																	0302-9743		978-3-642-39643-4				2013	7972						611	622										WOS:000335143000044

In this paper we present the latest advancements on fluorescence hyperspectral lidar imaging recently achieved at IFAC-CNR in terms of instrumentation and novel applications. In particular, the paper focuses on the upgrading of some key technical features, such as: the scan speed of the sensor, spatial resolution at the surface and field of view of the instrument. The upgrading of these technical characteristics has also made it possible to successfully extend the applicability of the technique to the diagnostics on wall paintings, which requires an improved spatial resolution. Finally, we outline the potential of a new concept of fluorescence lidar imaging system, based on the integration of hyperspectral and fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy, which enhances the capabilities of the technique for the characterization of the materials to be investigated in cultural heritage assets.

The Structure, Distribution, and Biomass of the World's Forests	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 44	Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics											Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. We review the environmental factors controlling their structure and global distribution and evaluate their current and future trajectory. Adaptations of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services.

Previously known soil cation optima of the pteridophyte species were first used in calibration, i.e. to infer soil cation concentrations for sites on the basis of their pteridophyte species composition. Multiple linear regression based on spectral reflectance values in the Landsat image was then used to derive an equation that allowed the prediction of these calibrated soil values for unvisited sites in the study area. The predictive accuracy turned out to be high: the mean absolute error, as estimated by leave-one-out cross-validation, was just 7% of the total range of calibrated soil values. This method for detailed mapping of natural environmental variability in lowland tropical rainforest has applications for land-use planning, such as wildlife management, forestry, biodiversity conservation, and payments for carbon sequestration.

Modelling surface energy fluxes over a dehesa ecosystem using a two-source energy balance model and medium resolution satellite data	REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XV	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XV part of the 20th International Symposium on Remote Sensing	SEP 23-26, 2013	Dresden, GERMANY	Int Soc Opt Engn				The dehesa, the most widespread agroforest ecosystem in Europe (approximate to 3 million ha), is recognized as an example of sustainable land use and for its importance in rural economy ([1] [2]). It is characterized by widely-spaced oak trees (mostly Quercus Ilex L.), combined with crops, pasture and shrubs in the sub-canopy region. The estimation of the ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) using remote sensing may assist the monitoring of its state from local to regional scales, improving the management and the conservation of the ecosystem. Thermal-based energy balance techniques which distinguish soil/substrate and vegetation contributions to the radiative temperature and radiation/turbulent fluxes have proven to be reliable in the estimation of the energy surface fluxes, and therefore in the estimation of ET. In particular, the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model of Norman et al. ([3]) and Kustas and Norman ([4]) has shown to be robust for semi-arid sparse canopy-cover landscapes. With the objective of evaluating the model over this environment, an energy flux measurement system has been used. It was installed in a dehesa located in Southern Spain (38 degrees 12' N; 4 degrees 17' W, 736 m a.s.l) with 1 km homogeneous fetch in wind direction. The quality of the measured data fluxes has been tested with the energy-balance closure criterion ([5] [6]) yielding an average closure of 86% which is within the error range found in similar studies. The TSEB model was evaluated in the area for 2012 summer season, using images from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor and ground measured meteorological data. The half-hourly estimates were compared with the flux tower measurements, obtaining a RMSD between modeled and measured energy fluxes within the closure balance error.

Identification of impacts on the Egyptian Nile using Remote Sensing and GIS	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS IV	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications IV	SEP 23-25, 2013	Dresden, GERMANY	SPIE				Nile River, the longest river in the world, 6,695 km long from its remotest headstream, the Luvironza River in Burundi, central Africa, to its delta on the Mediterranean Sea, NE Egypt. The Nile River islands form an attractive agricultural area characterized with its nightly fertile soils, easy source, and its suitability to a wide range of land use. The present use of these Nile islands does not reach the maximum capability of these resources due to improper land use of these areas. The current study aims at identifying the changes of the Nile course and its islands during the last three decades using remote sensing and GIS techniques in order to provide the scientific bases, which help in planning the most suitable programs of land use, soil management and conservation. Six MSS, eight TM and Eight ETM+ satellite images dated to 1972,1984 and 2002 respectively were used to study the changes occurred during the above-mentioned periods. The study area was divided into five sectors along the Nile River course i.e. Aswan - Qena, Qena - Assiut, Assiut Qalubia, Qalubia - Damietta and Qalubia - Rosetta. The changes in Nile course from early seventieth to middle eighteenth were decreased by 51.34 Km(2), from middle eighteenth to the millennium were decreased by 40.30 Km(2). The overall change in Nile course area decreased by 91.64 Km(2) in the investigation period. Belonging to the islands number and their areas in the investigation period, the changes in islands number from early seventieth to middle eighteenth were increased by 171 islands, from middle eighteenth to the millennium were decreased by 86 islands. Meanwhile, the islands areas from early seventieth to middle eighteenth were decreased by 4512.39 Feddan., from middle eighteenth to the millennium were decreased by 5446.97 Feddan. The overall change in the investigation period for the total number of the islands was increased by 85 islands, meanwhile the islands areas were decreased by 9959.36 Feddan. Changes of soil characteristics of some islands were recognized. It is found that, there is no regular pattern of the changes that related to soil characteristics due to many reasons i.e. differences in human agricultural practices, differences in Nile deposition, which differ from year to year, and differences in Nile water levels. Conservation and management program was suggested for the optimum use of these islands.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9763-5				2013	8893								UNSP 889317	10.1117/12.2027759								WOS:000327619300032

It has been agreed on that there is no general solution on deriving information on habitats due to different data availability and spectral as well as textural behaviour of habitat main types (e.g. woodlands, grasslands, etc.). Therefore the monitoring should be rather multi-scale, versatile, user-friendly, and cost-efficient for predefined indicators. In the presented study, five Central European test sites of natural vegetation communities in an Alpine area (1), a temperate forest (2), a Pannonian grassland (3), a shallow lake (4) and a Carpathian grassland (5) have been investigated by multi-temporal remote sensing. For these studies, different time-series of RapidEye images from the years 2009 to 2011 and LandSat data from the year 1984 to 2010 were acquired. The amount of the images was depending on required acquisitions dates as well as weather conditions. The definition of the indicators was relying on the available ground truth data as well as the demands und judgement of the managing authorities in the nature conservation areas. The selected methods for deriving of the indicators depend on the time-series as well as the available calibration and validation data. The techniques vary between unsupervised classification, object-based approaches and supervised classification methods with algorithms such as support vector machines (e.g. SVM) or classification trees (e.g. See5). Often, the named methods are utilized in combined approaches. The resulting indicators for the monitoring are shrub encroachment (for 1), share of naturally occurring tree type (for 2), differentiation of grassland types (for 3 and 5) and the changing extent of a reed belt (for 4). All indicators seem to be valid and useful for the authorities within the conservation areas. In this article a specific example of the share of natural tree types in a temperate forest in Germany will be explained in detail.

In particular, remote sensing techniques that do not require the use of scaffolds or lifts, such as fluoresence lidar, can provide useful information to obtain an overall assessment of the status of the investigated surfaces and can be exploited to address analytical studies in selected areas. Here we present the results of a joint Italian-Swedish project focused on documenting and recording the status of some sections of the part closed to the public by using fluorescence hyperspectral imaging lidar. The lidar used a tripled-frequency Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm as excitation source and an intensified, gated 512x512-pixel CCD as detector. The lidar had imaging capabilities thanks to a computer-controlled scanning mirror. The fluorescence characteristics of fresco wall paintings were compared to those of fresco fragments found at the same archaeological site and separately examined in the lab using FT-IR and Raman techniques for the identification of pigments. The fluorescence lidar was also used to remotely detect the growth of phototrophic biodeteriogens on the walls. The fluorescence lidar data were compared with results from biological sampling, cultivation and laboratory analysis by molecular techniques.

In this paper we focus on the development of an automatic tree-crown detection and classification approach, which is in line individual-based investigations in the tropical mountain environment. Airborne laser scanning of discrete type was used with a very high granularity (>10 returns per square meter). The individual tree crown detection reached an accuracy of 51% while supervised classification of palm-trees reached an accuracy of 69%. Accuracy measurements are given in the paper. The detection and characterization of individual tree crowns is the first step in the development of a monitoring approach for the tropical mountain forest.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9763-5				2013	8893								UNSP 88930B	10.1117/12.2029912								WOS:000327619300008

The results showed that the annual soil erosion modulus in Shanchonghe watershed is 19.05 t / (hm(2)*a), the annual soil erosion amount is 2744.23 t/a. The soil erosion spatial distribution is very different. These areas have strong soil erosion, which height is more than 2000 meters above sea level, or which slope is bigger than 25 degree, or bare surfaces, or sloping farmlands. These are the focus areas of governance of soil erosion in Shanchonghe watershed.

The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant-human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600 km(2). Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000 km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275 km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% Cl = 0.99-1.2) elephant/km(2). Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being subadults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant-human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant-human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant-human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.

J	Mulligan, M				Mulligan, Mark			WaterWorld: a self-parameterising, physically based model for application in data-poor but problem-rich environments globally	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												This paper describes a spatially explicit, physically based global model for water balance. Its key innovations include the fact that it comes with all data required for application, is very high spatial resolution (1 km or 1-hectare resolution) and yet global in extent and is particularly well suited to heterogeneous environments with little or no available data. The model, WaterWorld, is capable of producing a hydrological baseline representing the mean water balance for 1950-2000 and allows users to apply ensemble scenarios for climate change or examine the impact of policy options for land cover change or land management interventions. WaterWorld is focused on policy support, especially in conservation hydrology and development applications and is delivered through a simple web interface, requiring little local capacity for use. The paper discusses the paucity of hydrological data and the urgency of hydrological problems in much of the less-developed world, which reinforce the need for tools like WaterWorld. We discuss the types of hydrological problems that models might contribute to managing and the requirements of models applied to such problems. By way of example, applications of WaterWorld to understanding large-scale patterns of water resources and uncertainty around adaptation to climate change are described.

Data collection and mapping of habitats has been boosted by the rapid growth of remote sensing. An island-wide combined survey, focused on Aleppo oak (Q. infectoria) habitats, was undertaken using freely available on-line satellite imagery (Google Earth) and field inspection. The results of the survey, in combination with a weighting methodology, identified areas with high conservation value-Important Oak Areas (IOAs), for potential habitat protection.

Protected under the habitat directive, EU member states have to undertake surveillance of habitats and species of community interest and report every six years on habitat range and distribution, conservation status and the future prospects of the habitats within and outside of protected sites. Remote sensing techniques have been applied successfully to monitor habitat changes relevant for Natura 2000 monitoring using multi-temporal satellite image data, but many challenges remain especially outside protected sites to assess the development of habitats over time. A flexible information layer concept was developed within the FP7 project MS.MONINA to address the complex task of monitoring natural habitats. In this paper the new approach to classify grassland land cover classes in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, will be presented. Based on ecological parameters experts defined simple description models, which were used by image analysts to extract corresponding image features for four different grassland types. Information layer operators were defined to extract image features for subsequent classifications.																	1432-8364						2013		5					415	426		10.1127/1432-8364/2013/0188								WOS:000325507600002

Numerous studies have examined habitat use by the red-crowned crane, but integrated multi-scale habitat use information is lacking. We evaluated the effects of several habitat variables quantified across many spatial scales on crane use and abundance in two periods (2000 and 2009) at Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. The natural wetlands decreased in area by 30,601 ha (-6.9%) from 2000 to 2009, predominantly as a result of conversion to aquaculture ponds and farmland, and the remaining was under degradation due to expansion of the exotic smooth cordgrass. The cranes are focusing in on either larger patches or those that are in close proximity to each other in both years, but occupied patches had smaller size, less proximity and more regular boundaries in 2009. At landscape scales, the area percentage of common seepweed, reed ponds and paddy fields had a greater positive impact on crane presence than the area percentage of aquaculture ponds. The cranes were more abundant in patches that had a greater percent area of common seepweed and reed ponds, while the percent area of paddy fields was inversely related to crane abundance in 2009 due to changing agricultural practices. In 2009, cranes tended to use less fragmented plots in natural wetlands and more fragmented plots in anthropogenic paddy fields, which were largely associated with the huge loss and degradation of natural habitats between the two years. Management should focus on restoration of large patches of natural wetlands, and formation of a relatively stable area of large paddy field and reed pond to mitigate the loss of natural wetlands																	1674-5507						2013	59	5					604	617		10.1093/czoolo/59.5.604								WOS:000324341700002						
J	Jusoff, K				Jusoff, Kamaruzaman			Malaysian Mangrove Forests and their Significance to the Coastal Marine Environment	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Mangrove forests are one of the most productive and bio-diverse wetland environments on earth. Yet these unique coastal tropical forest environments are among the most threatened habitats in the world. Some key progress points in mangrove conservation, restoration, and research in Malaysia are highlighted. Based on an intensive literature review, the ecology and ecological management, distribution and areas of existing mangroves in the world and Malaysia, issues associated with mangrove conservation and restoration are discussed. Growing in the intertidal areas and estuary mouths between land and sea, mangroves provide critical habitat for diverse marine and terrestrial flora and fauna. Important for the flora and fauna is the opportunity to continue living in a sustainable environment and in suitable conditions. A potential stand is the place that obtains the possibility of germination and establishment of a plant species according to their physical, chemical, and biological demands. In many cases it is seen that because of unsuitable selection of site and species, afforestation and reforestation projects are forced to fail after spending time, cost, and labor. The population boom and rapid economic developments have greatly reduced mangrove areas in Malaysia despite the Malaysian government launching a series of programs to protect mangroves in the 1980s and establishing mangrove ecosystems as high-priority areas for improving environmental and living resource management. The issues, threats, and significant values of mangroves also were highlighted. A more systematic protection strategy using ecological engineering management-based, active restoration and rehabilitation measurements still are urgently needed in order to preserve these valuable resources in Malaysia.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2013	22	4					979	1005										WOS:000323402700001

Decisions on land conservation practices in a semi-arid region considering hydrological and social drivers	CLIMATE AND LAND SURFACE CHANGES IN HYDROLOGY	IAHS Publication				International Association of Hydrological Sciences Symposium on Climate and Land Surface Changes in Hydrology / IAHS-IAPSO-IASPEI Joint Assemply	JUL 22-26, 2013	Gothenburg, SWEDEN	Int Assoc Hydrolog Sci, Commiss Coupled Land Atmosphere Syst, Int Assoc Hydrolog Sci, Commiss Remote Sens, Int Assoc Hydrolog Sci, Commiss Surface Water, Global Energy & Water Exchanges Project, Global Land Atmosphere Syst Study				In tropical regions, such as the Brazilian semi-arid zone, climatic and hydrological regimes are highly variable. This variability is a determinant for defining land occupation, but farmers' social and economic characteristics are also important. This paper presents results of an investigation of hydrological and sediment yield from one small catchment due to land-use changes, considering both climatic and human factors. The study analysed observed time series of rainfall, runoff and sediment yield from an experimental catchment, and information from farmer interviews. The results show that clusters of a few intense events in a year determine annual runoff and sediment yield. The selection of land conservation practices can be aided by hydrological modelling based on information about farmers' willingness to adopt land conservation practices and on their farms' production systems and location within the catchment.																	0144-7815		978-1-907161-37-7				2013	359						352	357										WOS:000323627400054						
J	Kodandapani, N				Kodandapani, Narendran			CONTRASTING FIRE REGIMES IN A SEASONALLY DRY TROPICAL FOREST AND A SAVANNA ECOSYSTEM IN THE WESTERN GHATS, INDIA	FIRE ECOLOGY												Tropical dry forests and savannas constitute more than half of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest in India, the Nilgiri landscape, and a predominantly savanna ecosystem in the Sathyamangalam landscape, were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr in the Nilgiri landscape and 44.1 yr in the Sathyamangalam landscape. Tree (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher in the Nilgiri landscape compared to the Sathyamangalam landscape. Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests in the Nilgiri landscape, but total fuel loads were higher in the tropical dry thorn forests of the Sathyamangalam landscape. Thus, the two landscapes revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires in the Nilgiri landscape. The dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.																	1933-9747						2013	9	2					102	115		10.4996/fireecology.0902102								WOS:000323702400008

In particular, model forecasters and satellite community use their respective products to develop ground particulate matter estimations but few experiments have explored how the remote sensing approaches compare to the high resolution models.. In this paper we focus on studying the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) regression based estimates in comparison to more direct bias corrected outputs from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, We use a two-year dataset (2005-2006) and apply urban, season and hour filters to illustrate the agreement between estimated and in-situ measured fine particulate matter from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). We first begin by analyzing the correspondence between ground aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from an AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) Cimel sun/sky radiometer with both satellite and model products in one urban location; we show that satellite readings perform better than model outputs, especially during the summer (R-MODIS>=0.65, R-CMAQ>=0.37). This is a clear symptom of the difficulty in the models to properly model realistic optical properties. We then turn to a direct assessment of PM2.5 presenting individual comparisons between ground PM2.5 measurements with satellite/model predictions and demonstrate the higher accuracy from model estimations (R-MODIS(urban) >= 0.74, R-CMAQ(urban) >= 0.77; R-MODIS(non-urban) >= 0.48, R-CMAQ(non-urban) >= 0.78). In general, we find that the bias corrected CMAQ estimates are superior to satellite based estimators except at very high resolution. Finally, we show that when using both model and satellite approximations as separate estimators merged optimally, our product (PM2.5 average) becomes closer to real measurements with improved correlations (R-AVE similar to 0.8 6) in urban areas during the summer.																	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9514-3				2013	8723								UNSP 872319	10.1117/12.2027430								WOS:000323425300020

Two remote sensing images (1996, 2004) were applied to obtain land use change information, and the most recently published value equivalent were used to valuate ecosystem services. The total value of ecosystem services in Xinjian County was 4588.2 million Yuan in 1996 and 4587.8 million Yuan in 2004, with a decrease of 340.8 thousand Yuan mainly due to the declining areas of cropland, wetland and water body. We concluded that future local land use plan should give priority to the conservation of these ecosystems, in order to promote and maintain the balance of local ecosystem.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-649-9				2013	295-298						722	725		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.295-298.722								WOS:000320828200139

J.; Riddell, Edward S.; Cullum, Carola; Petersen, Robin			Kruger National Park research supersites: Establishing long-term research sites for cross-disciplinary, multiscaled learning	KOEDOE												Researchers interested in studying the effects of fire or herbivory in the Kruger National Park (KNP) often focus their research activities on the experimental burn plots or herbivore exclosure camps, respectively. These are manipulated sites that apply treatments, for example annual fires or total exclusion of fire and herbivores. However, many projects aim to study or monitor patterns and processes emerging under non-manipulated conditions, typically at sites with contrasting geologies and rainfall. Yet, these sites are usually selected in a haphazard and uncoordinated manner for different projects and, as a consequence, it is often not possible to integrate datasets and knowledge. An alternative to the ever-increasing number of unrelated sites scattered across the park are the 'KNP research supersites' which have been earmarked to geographically focus future research effort, acting as data-rich, long-term sites for monitoring and research. In this paper, we introduced the four recently established KNP research supersites, which cover the rainfall gradient and geological contrast of the KNP, presenting their rationale, selection criteria and location, along with existing datasets that describe their herbaceous biomass, woody cover, phenology, fire history, levels of herbivory. Additional site-specific datasets, which are already available, or which are in preparation, were outlined together with details for assessing these open-source datasets online. Conservation implications: The KNP research supersites will become increasingly used for research, monitoring and remote-sensing calibration and ground-truthing purposes. Scientists are encouraged to gain from, and contribute towards, these sites, which will facilitate long-term data collection, data-sharing and co-learning and, ultimately, lead to a more integrated, multiscaled and multitemporal understanding of savannahs.																	0075-6458						2013	55	1							UNSP 1107	10.4102/koedoe.v55i1.1107								WOS:000321300700008

In this paper, geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques are applied over a study of granite watershed area of similar to 200 km(2) with semi-arid climatic conditions for estimating surface runoff using a modified soil conservation service curve number method and subsequent site selection for water harvesting structures such as check dams and percolation ponds to enhance recharge of groundwater. Further, some of the sites selected for appropriate construction of recharge structures through analytic hierarchy process were investigated for site efficacy. All the recharge sites selected were found feasible and appropriately suitable.

W.; Shapcott, Alison; Russell-Smith, Jeremy			Ecological implications of standard fire-mapping approaches for fire management of the World Heritage Area, Fraser Island, Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												The characterisation of spatiotemporal fire patchiness is requisite for informing biodiversity conservation management in many landscape settings. Often, conservation managers are reliant on manually derived fire-history mapping products that delineate fire perimeters. An alternative standard approach concerns the application of remote sensing, typically using band combination indices obtained from relatively fine-scale imagery sensors. For Fraser Island, a World Heritage Area in subtropical, fire-prone eastern Australia, we contrast diagnostic fire-regime characteristics for different vegetation types over a 20-year period (1989-2008) as derived from historical manual, and remotely sensed, fire-mapping approaches. For the remote sensing component we adapt a commonly used approach utilising a differenced normalised burn ratio (dNBR) index derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. Manual mapping resulted in overestimation of fire-affected area (especially large fires) and fire frequency, whereas the dNBR procedure resulted in underestimation of fire-affected area under low fire-severity conditions, and overestimation of fire patchiness. Of significance for conservation management, (1) age class and related distributions for flammable vegetation types differed markedly between the two mapping approaches, (2) regardless, both methods demonstrated that substantial fuel loads had accumulated in flammable vegetation types by the end of the study period and (3) fuel age was shown to have a more significant effect than did seasonality on the incidence of very large (. 1000 ha) fires. The study serves as an introduction to ongoing research concerning the measurement and application of fire patchiness to conservation management in flammable eastern Australian vegetation types.

J	Munyati, C; Ratshibvumo, T; Ogola, J				Munyati, Christopher; Ratshibvumo, Thihanedzwi; Ogola, Jason			Landsat TM image segmentation for delineating geological zone correlated vegetation stratification in the Kruger National Park, South Africa	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Image classification approaches are widely used in mapping vegetation on remotely sensed images. Vegetation assemblages are equivalent to habitats. Whereas sub-pixel classification approaches potentially can produce more realistic, homogenous habitat maps, pixel-based hard classifier approaches often result in non-homogenous habitat zones. This salt-and-pepper habitat mapping is particularly a challenge on images of savannas, given the characteristic patchy texture of scattered trees and grass. Image segmentation techniques offer possibilities for homogenous habitat classification. This study aimed at establishing the extent to which established, field surveyed and geology-related vegetation types in South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP) can be reproduced using image segmentation. Rain season Landsat TM images were used, selected to coincide with the peak in vegetation productivity, which was deemed the time of year when discrimination between key habitats in KNP is most likely to be successful. The multiresolution segmentation mode in eCognition 5.0 was employed, object classification accomplished using the nearest neighbour (NN) classifier, using object texture and training area mean values in the NN feature space. Compared to delineations of the vegetation types of KNP on a digital map of the vegetation zones that was tested, image segmentation successfully mapped the zones (overall accuracy 85.3%, K-boolean AND = 82.7%) despite slight shifts in the location of vegetation zone boundaries. Maximum likelihood classification (MLC) of the same images was only 37% accurate (K-boolean AND = 24.2%). Whereas the vegetation zones resulting from MLC were non-homogenous, with considerable spectral confusion among the vegetation zones, image segmentation produced more homogenous vegetation zones, comparably more useful for conservation management, because realistic and meaningful habitat maps are important in biodiversity conservation as input data upon which to base management decisions. Image segmentation appears to be a useful approach in mapping savanna vegetation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Between July 2006 and March 2010, 27 satellite transmitters were deployed at sea on juvenile loggerheads Caretta caretta captured as bycatch in the Uruguayan and Brazilian pelagic longline fisheries operating in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Tracking duration ranged from 3 to 639 d (mean +/- SD: 259 +/- 159 d; n = 27), during which turtles moved between latitudes of 25 to 45 degrees S and longitudes 35 to 54 degrees W. High-use areas for the tracked turtles were over the continental shelf and slope within the Uruguayan, Argentinian, and Brazilian exclusive economic zones and in adjacent international waters. Diving information was available for 5 turtles. The maximum dive depth recorded varied between 100 and 300 m. Two turtles demonstrated potential bottom-feeding behaviors by diving to depths that corresponded closely with the depth of the seafloor (<200 m) at their given location. The sea surface temperature encountered by tagged turtles was on average 19.8 +/- 2.3 degrees C (range: 10.2 to 28.4 degrees C), and turtles showed an affinity for waters supporting moderate to high primary productivity levels (0.43 +/- 0.89 mg m(-3) chlorophyll a). Latitudinal movements varied by season and sea surface temperature. These findings, along with those of other studies conducted in the region, demonstrate the need to strengthen ongoing collaborative efforts between neighboring countries and other international partnerships to further the research and management of sea turtles in this area.																	0171-8630						2013	479						235	250		10.3354/meps10222								WOS:000317356300017

Plot and transect surveys of lands inside and outside pasture fences and general linear mixed models revealed complex relationships among buffelgrass, native vegetation, distance from pasture fences, and three categories of land disturbance (undisturbed, moderate, and severe). Results illustrate that buffelgrass invasion is extensive in lands surrounding pastures, and that buffelgrass abundance declines steeply with distance from pasture fences. The role of disturbance is weak but significant in its interaction with distance from the fence. Buffelgrass is more successful at colonizing severely disturbed lands than native vegetation, and its decline in abundance on severely. disturbed lands is relatively more gradual than on other disturbance regimes, so landscapes where severely disturbed lands are interspersed with buffelgrass pastures could become centers of extensive buffelgrass invasion. In light of its potential to transform the Sonoran Desert, bnffelgrass outside pastures warrants attention in a region-wide control scheme, as well as in future research, which ideally would involve remote sensing.																	1939-7291	1939-747X				JAN-MAR	2013	6	1					187	195		10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00047.1								WOS:000316840300019

As such, protection of mangroves is an urgent priority. This work provides some new information on patterns of degradation in the Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world, which are home to more than 35 reptile species, 120 commercial fish species, 300 bird species and 32 mammal species. Using radar imagery, we contrast and quantify the recent impacts of cyclone Sidr and anthropogenic degradation on this ecosystem. Our results, inferred from changes in radar backscatter, confirm already reported trends in coastline retreat for this region, with areas losing as much as 200 m of coast per year. They also suggest rapid changes in mangrove dynamics for Bangladesh and India, highlighting an overall decrease in mangrove health in the east side of the Sundarbans, and an overall increase in this parameter for the west side of the Sundarbans. As global environmental change takes its toll in this part of the world, more detailed, regular information on mangroves' distribution and health is required: our study illustrates how different threats experienced by mangroves can be detected and mapped using radar-based information, to guide management action.

It provides a behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build road networks, typically abandoned upon removal of hardwoods. Logging road networks provide access to land, and the settlers who take advantage of them clear fields and pastures that accentuate their spatial signatures. In shaping agricultural activities, these networks organize emergent patterns of forest fragmentation, even though the loggers move elsewhere. The goal of the article is to explicate how loggers shape their road networks, in order to theoretically explain an important type of forest fragmentation found in the Amazon basin, particularly in Brazil. This is accomplished by adapting graph theory to represent the spatial decision-making of loggers, and by implementing computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road networks. The economic behavior of loggers is conceptualized as a profit maximization problem, and translated into spatial decision-making by establishing a formal correspondence between mathematical graphs and road networks. New computational approaches, adapted from operations research, are used to construct graphs and simulate spatial decision-making as a function of discount rates, land tenure, and topographic constraints. The algorithms employed bracket a range of behavioral settings appropriate for areas of terras devolutas, public lands that have not been set aside for environmental protection, indigenous peoples, or colonization. The simulation target sites are located in or near so-called Terra do Meio, once a major logging frontier in the lower Amazon Basin. Simulation networks are compared to empirical ones identified by remote sensing and then used to draw inferences about factors influencing the spatial behavior of loggers. Results overall suggest that Amazonia's logging road networks induce more fragmentation than necessary to access fixed quantities of wood. The paper concludes by considering implications of the approach and findings for Brazil's move to a system of concession logging.

J	Bargiel, D				Bargiel, D.			Capabilities of high resolution satellite radar for the detection of semi-natural habitat structures and grasslands in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The loss of species is an ongoing process threatening the services provided by ecosystems for humanity. In agricultural areas, which globally occupy the largest areas, species diversity is strongly dependent on the farmers' management. If management allows for a landscape structure with many remnants of natural or semi-natural vegetation, the diversity and amount of flora and fauna is higher compared to intensive agricultural landscapes with large, continuous field parcels and a low crop variety. Knowledge of agricultural management is crucial for the development and monitoring of political strategies that aim to enhance or conserve species in agricultural areas. Remote sensing is a cost effective way to acquire this knowledge for large spatial areas with high temporal resolution. Since 2008, modern satellite-based radar sensors deliver images of unprecedented high quality. Since the acquisition of radar images is not restricted by atmospheric conditions, it is very capable of multitemporal classifications. In the presented study, possibilities for supervised multitemporal classification of non crop areas are investigated based on TerraSAR-X images and two different classifiers (Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest). The best results were achieved for the classification of woody structures where producer's accuracies are above 80%. Despite lower values for the other classes (flower strips 75%, grasslands 75.8% and herbaceous 57%), these classes are easily recognized. This is illustrated by different map examples. The presented results can contribute essentially to the monitoring, investigation and increasing of habitat structures in agricultural areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian and in-channel vegetation functions as a roughness element and dissipates flow energy, maintaining stable channel geometry. Ash Creek, a tributary of the Bad River in western South Dakota contains a high proportion of incised channels, remnants of historically high grazing pressure. Best management practices (BMP), including off-stream watering sources and cross fencing, were implemented throughout the Bad River watershed during an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 319 effort to address high sediment loads. We monitored prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) establishment within stream channels for 16 yr following BMP implementation. Photos were used to group stream reaches (n=103) subjectively into three classes; absent (estimated <5% cover; n=64), present (estimated 5-40% cover; n=23), and dense (estimated >40% cover; n=16) based on the relative amount of prairie cordgrass during 2010 assessments of ephemeral channels. Reaches containing drainage areas of 0.54 to 692 ha were delineated with the use of 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were extracted from 5 to 39 sample points proportional to reach length using a series of Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) satellite imagery. Normalized NDVI (nNDVI) of 2 152 sample points were determined from pre- and post-BMP images. Mean nNDVI values for each reach ranged from 0.33 to 1.77. ANOVA revealed significant increase in nNDVI in locations classified as present prairie cordgrass cover following BMP implementation. Establishment of prairie cordgrass following BMP implementation was successfully detected remotely. Riparian vegetation such as prairie cordgrass adds channel roughness that reduces the flow energy responsible for channel degradation.

Decision of threshold values for extraction of turbidity for inland wetland using IRS P6 LISS III data	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Wetland is a kind of natural resource with fast dynamic changes. Around 50% of the earth's wetlands are estimated to have already disappeared worldwide over the last hundred years through conversion to industrial, agricultural, and residential developments. It is important for wetland protection and management to accurately map the wetland distribution by remote sensing and GIS. A study of the water turbidity and water quality of the wetland is essential to assess the fitness of the water for various purposes-irrigation, drinking, other domestic use, and industry. In the present study, an attempt has been made to know the inland wetland of Salem taluk of Salem district and to monitor changes in turbidity conditions for post-monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. With the IRS P6 LISS III satellite image, indices images were generated for the extraction of water spread boundary. An automatic determination method of the threshold was examined to produce masks for the extraction of turbidity, and a turbidity map was generated which classifies turbidity into high, medium, and low. From the analysis, it has been observed that the inland wetlands of post-monsoon constitute 489 ha of the study area, of which 21.3% is subjected to high turbidity. Pre-monsoon spread constitutes 362.81 ha, of which 15.7% is subjected to high turbidity in pre-monsoon. Thus, this study highlights the usefulness of remotely sensed data for wetland mapping, seasonal monitoring, and characterization. The result indicates that turbidity conditions are moderate and low in pre-monsoon and moderate in post-monsoon seasons.																	1866-7511					JAN	2013	6	1					109	114		10.1007/s12517-011-0324-5								WOS:000313069000010

Basin-scale and travertine dam-scale controls on fluvial travertine, Jiuzhaigou, southwestern China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Travertine deposition in fluvial systems builds dams and other forms that create diversity in geomorphic processes, morphology, and associated wetland ecosystems. In Jiuzhaigou Natural Reserve, Sichuan Province, China, we investigate the relation between contemporary fluvial travertine morphology, slope, and water chemistry at the fluvial-system scale and at the local scale of large individual dams in order to address two fundamental questions. First, what factors determine the spatial distribution of such large valley-spanning, or primary, travertine dams? Second, what factors govern smaller but distinctive travertine dams and other secondary travertine morphology present on the sloping downstream side of primary travertine dams? Through remote sensing analysis and field work, we recognize two factors as paramount in controlling spatial distribution of primary fluvial travertine dams: watershed-scale steps in the longitudinal profile and water chemistry, based on a proxy for dissolved calcite. In the steep Jiuzhaigou watershed, hillslope erosion processes that contribute large boulders to the channel influence the majority of the primary dams. However, two valley-spanning primary dams, Pearl Shoals and Norilang Lakes, appear to be dominated by travertine precipitation. The submerged upstream sides of these two dams are nearly vertical with heights >30 m. Slope varies with position along the longitudinal profiles over the downstream sides of these two primary dams because the profile shapes are convex With downstream-dam profile lengths >500 m, flow encounters secondary travertine morphology organized as an array of travertine bedforms that vary with local channel slope along the convex profiles. The secondary travertine bedforms include sequences of repeating patterns including smaller dams that impound correspondingly small waterbodies. Morphologic differences between two types of secondary dams are quantified on the basis of their relative size, spacing, and the slope on which they form. Increasing slope is correlated with a decrease in height of secondary travertine bedforms according to a power law where y=0.0053x(-1.68). Results of the investigation demonstrate that slope, a main influence on river hydrodynamics, influences and is influenced by fluvial travertine morphology at two discrete fluvial scales. This work advances our understanding of geomorphic factors that influence travertine morphology, a critical need for conservation and management of travertine natural resources and their wetland ecosystems.

J	Evans, TL; Costa, M				Evans, Teresa L.; Costa, Maycira			Landcover classification of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands using ALOS/PALSAR, RADARSAT-2 and ENVISAT/ASAR imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal is part of a large continuous tropical wetland that exhibits a high biodiversity of flora and fauna species, and many threatened habitats. The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into "Lakes" and "Not Lakes". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the "Lakes" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A meta-analysis of terrestrial aboveground biomass estimation using lidar remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimating biomass of terrestrial vegetation is not only a rapidly expanding research area, but also a subject of tremendous interest for reducing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). The accuracy of biomass estimates, and rate of biomass change, is not only important in the context of carbon markets emerging under REDD, but also for characterizing uncertainty in estimates of carbon cycling and the global carbon budget. There is particular interest in mapping biomass so that carbon stocks and stock changes can be monitored consistently across a range of scales - from relatively small projects (tens of hectares) to national or continental scales - but also so that other benefits of forest conservation can be factored into decision making (e.g. biodiversity and habitat corridors). We conducted an analysis of reported biomass accuracy estimates from more than 70 refereed articles using different remote sensing platforms (airborne and spaceborne) and sensor types (optical, radar, and lidar), with a particular focus on lidar since those papers reported the lowest errors when used in a synergistic manner with other coincident multi-sensor measurements. We show systematic differences in accuracy between different types of Iidar systems flown on different platforms but, perhaps more importantly, differences between forest types (biomes) and plot sizes used for field calibration and assessment. We discuss these findings in relation to monitoring, reporting and verification under REDD, and also in the context of more systematic assessment of factors that influence accuracy and error estimation.

The paper describes the procedure to implement this integrated approach in the real-world situations of surveillance of archaeological and built heritage. Targeted tests were carried out on the case study of the Domus Tiberiana sited along the northern side of the Palatino Hill in the central archaeological area of Rome, Italy, and displacements of the monument were monitored over almost one year of acquisition. The GBInSAR - TLS integration provided updated information about the condition of the archaeological structures in relation to their history of instability mechanisms, and did not highlighted a general worsening for the stability of the entire monument Point-wise and prompt detection of displacement anomalies and/or sudden changes in displacement trends proved the suitability of the method to support early warning procedures, also to evaluate effects on the masonry due to human activities.

Therefore there is a need for rigorous research into smart home energy management systems that could assist the end-user in achieving this goal. This paper addresses the issue of electrical energy conservation in the home through the adoption of smart technologies (one instantiation of smart technologies). Smart objects are everyday artefacts augmented with sensing, processing and networking capabilities that enable them not only to communicate with people and other smart objects, but also discover where they are and what objects are in the vicinity. The smart home, on the other hand, is an automated home equipped with smart objects and a home network that is able to transport information between the objects and the Internet. This research focusses on the design and implementation of a smart home energy management system that integrates smart technologies such as the smart phone, cloud, wireless, web server and motes. The research analyses literature on existing smart home energy systems and technologies and draws lessons from the analysis on how the proposed architecture should be structured. When completed this system will allow the end-user to switch single or group of appliances by means of an Android-based smart phone, be they within their home or at a remote location. In emergencies, an authorised authority such as the municipality could potentially control electrical appliances in a whole neighbourhood.																			978-1-905824-38-0				2013																		WOS:000349785100013

The earthquake was about 5.9 Richter scale and made many victims. The previous research showed that the most damaged area was around the Opak Sesar in Bantul. This fact actually indicates that the Opak Sesar had the influence for the damage on that earthquake. Bantul District is a region which has variation of landuse such as settlement, agriculture area, tourism, and conservation area. Unfortunately, the distribution of this landuse still not considers on the disaster management aspects. This paper is purposed to clasify and mapping the Bantul area in two main classes, settlement and non settlement area based on earthquake management consideration and using the remote sensing and geography information system method. The settlement is the most essensial part which include the human so it should be saved more than other area. The mapping considered some parameters, which every parameters has to be scored to clasify the area. The mapping process used Landsat 7 ETM+ image of Bantul area, recorded in 2007 and secondary data from the previous research in 2006. This research can be also to evaluate the existing 'Regional Planning' from Bantul goverment. The results of this paper actually not to change the real landuse condition directly, but it can be a suggestion area design for the goverment to manage the area planning at the future.

B	Joshi, PK; Priyanka, N			Informat Resources Management Assoc	Joshi, P. K.; Priyanka, Neena			Geo-Informatics for Land Use and Biodiversity Studies	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS: CONCEPTS, METHODOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 1												The dynamics of land use/land cover (LU/LC) is a manifestation of the cyclic correlation among the kind and magnitude of causes, impacts, responses and resulting ecological processes of the ecosystem. Thus, the holistic understanding of the complex mechanisms that control LU/LC requires synergetic adoption of measurement approaches, addressing issues, and identifying drivers of change and state of art technologies for mitigation measures. As the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the LU/LC increases, its impact on biodiversity becomes even more difficult to anticipate. Thus, in order to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of change in landscape and its relationship to biodiversity, it is necessary to reliably identify and quantify the indicators of change. In addition, it is also important to have better understanding of the technologies and techniques that serve as complimentary tool for land mitigation and conservation planning. Against this background, the chapter aims to synthesize LU/LC studies worldwide and their impacts on biodiversity. This chapter explores identification and analysis of key natural, socio-economic and regulatory drivers for LU/LC. Finally, it attempts to collate some LU/LC studies involving usage of geospatial tools, such as satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and integrative tools, besides conventional approaches that could assist decision makers, land managers, stakeholders and researchers in better management and formulation of conservation strategies based on scientific grounds.																			978-1-4666-2039-1; 978-1-4666-2038-4				2013							1913	1939		10.4018/978-1-4666-2038-4.ch114	10.4018/978-1-4666-2038-4							WOS:000418007600115

ESTIMATION OF BIOMASS POTENTIAL BASED ON CLASSIFICATION AND HEIGHT INFORMATION	ISPRS HANNOVER WORKSHOP 2013	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing Hannover Workshop	MAY 21-24, 2013	Hannover, GERMANY	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				On the way to make energy supply independent from fossil resources more and more renewable energy sources have to be explored. Biomass has become an important energy resource during the last years and the consumption is rising steadily. Common sources of biomass are agricultural production and forestry but the production of these sources is stagnating due to limited space. To explore new sources of biomass like in the field of landscape conservation the location and available amount of biomass is unknown. Normally, there are no reliable data sources to give information about the objects of interest such as hedges, vegetation along streets, railways and rivers, field margins and ruderal sites. There is a great demand for an inventory of these biomass sources which could be answered by applying remote sensing technology. As biomass objects considered here are sometimes only a few meters wide, spectral unmixing is applied to separate different material mixtures reflected in one image pixel. The spectral images are assumed to have a spatial resolution of 5-20m with multispectral or hyperspectral band configurations. Combining the identified material part fractions with height information and GIS data afterwards will give estimates about the location of biomass objects. The method is applied to test data of a Sentinel-2 simulation and the results are evaluated visually.																	2194-9034						2013	40-1	W-1					263	268										WOS:000358215100047

Many soil and water conservation measurements have been applied in this basin to decrease soil erosion and recover vegetation. However, these measurements impact the hydrological process and streamflow. This paper presents an application of a biophysically based eco-hydrological model -The Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) in the Jinghe River Basin to study the impacts of soil and water conservation measurements including vegetation construction and engineering construction. This is the first time that the model is applied in a large basin (> 10000km(2)) and some adjustments of the model (such as stream routing, reservoir operation and soil and water conservation engineering) were conducted to fit for large basin application. Field observation data, literature values and remote sensing data were used to calibrate and verify the model's parameters, and the verification showed that the model can represent the eco-hydrological dynamic processes in this basin. Three scenarios were set and simulated, which results were compared to quantify the vegetation construction and soil and water conservation engineering impacts on streamflow. The results show that the soil and conservation decrease annual streamflow by 8.36% (0.122 billion m(3)), and the largest decrease happened in 2000s. The soil and water conservation engineering has larger impacts than vegetation construction.																			978-7-302-33544-3				2013							2627	2636										WOS:000343761503022

From Aral Sea to Aralkum: An Ecological Disaster or Halophytes' Paradise	PROGRESS IN BOTANY 74	Progress in Botany											The Aral Sea no longer exists. Only the Small Aral Sea has now again a constant water level. The former Aral Sea, once the fourth largest lake on the globe, is almost dry, and the desiccated seafloor is a new desert, called the Aralkum. It is the source of salt-enriched dust and sandstorms. These are affecting large proportions of the villages and agricultural systems in the whole region, as well as livelihood and health of the people. This new desert has developed within about 50 years. It is caused by human activities; thus, it is an artificial desert, but all the ongoing processes follow natural laws and are most interesting for science. The area can be called the largest primary succession experiment of mankind or depending on viewpoint, one of the biggest ecological catastrophes. About 70 % of the area is salt desert; thus, halophytes play a major role. One-fourth of the flora are species from Chenopodiaceae. Within the last decades, many new developmental projects have been performed in the region. However, most of them need basic knowledge which only can be provided by scientific expertise. So it is necessary to bring together interdisciplinary and international scientists not only on ecology and geography (with remote sensing and GIS methods), but also climatologists and soil scientists, with social science and economy as well as with nature conservation organisations, developmental and health agencies, and other main stakeholders of the area. Research on the scientific aspects of the Aralkum area has been done in the last years, mainly on dust storms and climate, on soil substrate, but also on vegetation dynamics and flora, as well as on the specific site conditions in such a continental salt desert which are the basis of highly diverse and dynamic halophytic communities adjacent to the tugai woodlands, the riverine forest remnants.																	0340-4773		978-3-642-30967-0; 978-3-642-30966-3				2013	74						351	398		10.1007/978-3-642-30967-0_13	10.1007/978-3-642-30967-0							WOS:000351426200013

Remotely sensed indicators of forest conservation status: Case study from a Natura 2000 site in southern Portugal	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The successful implementation of habitat conservation measures demands regular and spatially explicit monitoring and reporting on conservation status at a range of scales, based on indicators of both habitat range and condition (structure and functions required for long-term maintenance). Such is the case with the Natura 2000 protected areas in Europe. Focusing on the cork oak (Quercus suber) forests of one such area, the Serra de Monchique in southern Portugal, we test the complementarity and joint effectiveness of airborne multispectral and laser scanning (lidar) in providing robust indicators of conservation status. Principal forest types and other land covers are mapped to an accuracy of up to 70% (11 land cover classes) and 81% (5 classes) by fusing the two remote sensing datasets, results that are superior to using either one alone. Using previously tested relationships between lidar height metrics, forest vegetation structure and species diversity, we develop a map predicting areas of high (22% of area), medium (25%) and low (53%) condition. We recommend the further development and testing of remotely sensed range and condition indicators of conservation status for their application in important forested sites across Europe and beyond.

The aim of this article is (i) to review the state of the use of high-resolution remote sensing for ecological studies in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) and (ii) to suggest further potential avenues of research in the region using this technology. It has been recognized that the recent improvements in remote sensing have enabled researchers to categorize and spatially map species and communities and to detect vegetation types based on ecological gradients and environmental drivers. Across the globe, the use of current high-resolution imagery in vegetation studies is increasing due to their improved efficiency, as fine-scale vegetation information is needed for both theoretical understanding of the processes involved and conservation towards the maintenance of ecological functions of natural ecosystems. Remote sensing is particularly useful in the IHR, where field-based mapping of forest vegetation and land cover using conventional techniques is a cost-and time-intensive effort. Mapping fine-scale patterns of tree species using high-resolution remote-sensing data has important implications for the understanding and monitoring of ecosystem function and biodiversity patterns in forests.

Monitoring studies or even surveys of species and community diversity in changing landscapes or disturbed areas require an assessment of the land cover changes over time. Here, we present a method combining remote sensing and structural equation models (SEM) to describe and analyse landscape dynamics. We focus on the mount Oku as an example, which is a mountain area located in north-west Cameroon. This site hosts the largest remaining tract of Central African cloud forest, a biodiversity hotspot threatened by contemporary land-use changes. Our aim is to characterize land cover changes over the last three decades and to quantify and elucidate the causes of deforestation and forest fragmentation. For this purpose, we integrate several Landsat satellite images taken between 1978 and 2007 in a Geographic Information System (GIS), and compare changes in land-use types. We assess forest fragmentation over this period by comparing the number, the area and the perimeter of forest fragments, and derive a forest fragmentation index. Finally, we quantify the respective effects of natural (altitude, slope) and human (human density, distance to villages) factors on deforestation using SEM. We evidence two periods in the dynamics of the cloud forest cover: a period of intense deforestation (1978-2001), followed by a period of re-afforestation (2001-2007). The forest cover lost 62.1% of its area (12,060 ha) between 1978 and 2001, corresponding to an averaged deforestation rate of 579 ha.yr(-1). Deforested areas were mainly converted into crop lands (+75.6% between 1978 and 1988), under the pressure of an increasing human density, which was multiplied by 20 between 1921 and 2005 and doubled during the last 18 years. After 2001, the forest cover stabilized with the appearance of numerous small fragments of secondary forest, reflecting the success of the local biodiversity protection programs. Despite this recent progression of the forest cover, the proportion of ancient forest has continuously decreased from 1978 to 2007, indicating that deforestation is still ongoing. In 2007, the forest cover was a mosaic composed of 66% of recent secondary forests (i.e. forests appeared after 1978) and only 34% of ancient forests (i.e. present before 1978). Between 1978 and 2007, the number of forest fragments increased from 2627 to 5183, their average area decreased from 7.4 to 1.8 ha, and perimeter from 912 to 446 m, and the forest fragmentation index increased by 285.7%. Deforestation started from lower altitudes (<2300 m, before 1988) and progressed towards higher altitudes (2100-2900 m) between 1988 and 2001. SEM showed that altitude and slope had a significant negative effect on human density, explaining why the deforestation has been low on steep slopes and/or at higher altitudes. Our study reveals that the last fragments of the primary cloud forest of mount Oku could be definitively lost in the next decades. As tropical primary forests are irreplaceable ecosystems that host numerous endemic species, we recommend (1) to urgently protect the last remnants of ancient forest for their biological value; clear-cuts, grazing in forest interior and fires should be excluded from these areas, and (2) to extend secondary forests around ancient forest fragments so that they can act as a protective buffer and be managed as community forests and used for hunting and logging activities.																	1253-8078					DEC	2012	159	4					451	466		10.1080/12538078.2012.750583								WOS:000316540600007

For the development of sustainable harvest and conservation practices, better knowledge about the mushroom's habitat is indispensable. However, few approaches allow monitoring T. indicum's distribution on a large geographic scale. Apart from the difficulty to directly monitor them by Remote Sensing and GIS technology, a particular challenge arises from the sampling limitations for this seasonal mushroom. This problem is common in geology, where underground mineral resources must be mapped without direct observations. Geologists apply the 'Weights of Evidence' method for such situations, and this approach may have potential for underground mushrooms as well. We thus constructed potential habitat maps for T. indicum using the Weights of Evidence method. Based on field survey and published sources, ten influential indicators associated with T. indicum were selected and mapped for Longyang district in southwestern Yunnan, China. Two predictive models were established from independent environmental layers. In order to build better understanding of the models' predictive ability, apart from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the Area Adjusted Frequency (AAF) approach was also applied for model evaluation. For the final map, the best-performing model was selected. The resulting habitat map could provide guidance for future conservation activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dickson, B; Kapos, V				Dickson, Barney; Kapos, Valerie			Biodiversity monitoring for REDD+	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Increasing emphasis on social and environmental safeguards for REDD+ in the UNFCCC and work under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have prompted growing interest in biodiversity monitoring for REDD+, but most discussions of REDD+ monitoring have so far centred on greenhouse gas emissions and removals at national level. Challenges in monitoring biodiversity for REDD+ include choosing which aspects of biodiversity to monitor, the difficulty of attributing particular changes to REDD+ and the likely scarcity of resources for biodiversity monitoring. Three responses can help address these challenges. First, already-agreed policy targets can help to identify what should be monitored. Second, making links to existing biodiversity monitoring and to monitoring to estimate GHG emissions and removals (both remote sensing and ground based inventories) can provide some solutions. Finally, developing clear theories of change can assist in determining which changes in biodiversity can be attributed to REDD+.

Regular monitoring has to be capable of detecting rapid changes in forest extent, i.e. deforestation, and subtle changes to the forest cover caused by logging and/or fire, described as forest degradation. Particularly the early detection of illegal logging activities is important for the conservation of tropical forests. In the present study, a forest disturbance monitoring approach was developed and tested, which makes use of high resolution satellite imagery. A time series consisting of three images, acquired between May 2009 and June 2010, was analyzed covering a remote area of tropical peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The forest area was assessed by an object-oriented classification. Logging activities and the impact of fire were detected by a pixel-based spectral mixture analysis. Forest, non-forest and logging trails could be differentiated with an overall classification accuracy of 91.5% (Kappa of 0.87). A high forest disturbance rate of 8.7% was found in the study area. Low impact logging could be detected reliably and the progress was tracked over time. The results show that the timely detection of forest disturbances is necessary because of the fast regrowth of vegetation. The study emphasises the importance of high resolution satellite imagery for tropical forest monitoring and for timely updating forest status assessments, which is important for the implementation of REDD.																	1939-1404					DEC	2012	5	6			SI		1811	1820		10.1109/JSTARS.2012.2202638								WOS:000313009300026

The evolution of two great Mediterranean Deltas: Remote sensing to visualize the evolution of habitats and land use in the Gediz and Rhone Deltas	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Land cover and land cover change, both in time and space, were analyzed in the Gediz Delta (Turkey) and the Rhone Delta (Camargue, France) to determine the evolution of two great deltas in the Mediterranean basin. Geographical information Systems and remote sensing were used to estimate the impact of land use changes on habitats over a 35 year period from 1975 to 20W. The first images used MSS captures from 1975 with a spatial resolution of 80 m; precision was gained from 1980 with the use of LandSat satellite images (spatial resolution of 30 m in multi-band modes) and then with satellite images from Spot 4, Spot 5 and Google Earth Pro. The images were classified using GEO Image and then analyzed and laid out with the aid of ArcGis and Quantum GIS 1.7.0 software programs. The data was verified using a confusion matrix, which provided between 85 and 95% global precision rates. This qualitative data on the evolution reveals that despite important conservation measures (including Ramsar site, National Park, and Natural Park status) both deltas have been subject to substantial changes over this time period. Important declines in natural habitats such as sansouires, beaches, dunes and reed beds have been replaced by increased areas of urbanization and annual agricultural crops. This analysis demonstrates the important pressures that continue to impact the delicate natural Mediterranean habitats and puts in evidence the need to enforce current legislation in order to conserve the deltas in the future.

Recent advances in object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine-learning algorithms offer new image classification tools; however, few comparisons of different approaches have been discussed to date. We applied OBIA to delineate wetland plant functional types (PFTs) for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China and Ramsar wetland conservation site, from a spring 2008 Landsat TM image. We targeted major PFTs that represent dominant vegetation groups along wetland inundation gradients and affect ecosystem biogeochemical cycles and ecological habitats. Classification results were compared among: a) several "small" object segmentation scales (with average object sizes 1350-9000 m(2)); b) algorithms from six families of statistical machine-learning classifiers (Bayesian, Logistic, Neural Network, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines) and c) two hierarchical levels of vegetation classification, a generalized 3-class set and a more specific 6-class set. We also examined the response of classification accuracy to four basic object-level texture metrics. The highest accuracies (> 85-90%) and best agreement among algorithms occurred at coarser object scales rather than close-to-pixel scales. No single machine-learning algorithm was consistently superior at all scales, although support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network most frequently provided the highest overall and PFT-specific accuracies. Including texture metrics had both positive and negative low-magnitude effects on classification accuracy that were not consistent among scale values, algorithms or PFT classes. Individual PFTs differed in scales at which they were best discriminated from others, reflecting their unique landscape positions, ecology of dominant species and disturbance agents. There was a 29-35% disagreement between mapped areas of generalized PFTs and their respective subclasses, suggesting potential mismatches between the ecological classification scheme and PFT landscape patch structure, and raising concern on error propagation in multi-scale classifications. We conclude that OBIA with machine-learning classifiers is useful for landscape vegetation analyses, however, considerations of spatial scale and image segmentation outcomes are critical in mapping PFTs and should be more thoroughly investigated in future work.

Mapping daily evapotranspiration at Landsat spatial scales during the BEAREX'08 field campaign	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Robust spatial information about environmental water use at field scales and daily to seasonal timesteps will benefit many applications in agriculture and water resource management. This information is particularly critical in arid climates where freshwater resources are limited or expensive, and groundwater supplies are being depleted at unsustainable rates to support irrigated agriculture as well as municipal and industrial uses. Gridded evapotranspiration (ET) information at field scales can be obtained periodically using land-surface temperature-based surface energy balance algorithms applied to moderate resolution satellite data from systems like Landsat, which collects thermal-band imagery every 16 days at a resolution of approximately 100 m. The challenge is in finding methods for interpolating between ET snapshots developed at the time of a clear-sky Landsat overpass to provide complete daily time-series over a growing season. This study examines the efficacy of a simple gap-filling algorithm designed for applications in data-sparse regions, which does not require local ground measurements of weather or rainfall, or estimates of soil texture. The algorithm relies on general conservation of the ratio between actual ET and a reference ET, generated from satellite insolation data and standard meteorological fields from a mesoscale model. The algorithm was tested with ET retrievals from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model and associated DisALEXI flux disaggregation technique, which uses Landsat-scale thermal imagery to reduce regional ALEXI maps to a finer spatial resolution. Daily ET at the Landsat scale was compared with lysimeter and eddy covariance flux measurements collected during the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote sensing EXperiment of 2008 (BEAREX08), conducted in an irrigated agricultural area in the Texas Panhandle under highly advective conditions. The simple gap-filling algorithm performed reasonably at most sites, reproducing observed cumulative ET to within 5-10% over the growing period from emergence to peak biomass in both rainfed and irrigated fields.

We undertake a geographic information system and remote sensing analysis to identify the rarest and least protected forests in biodiversity hotspots. World Wildlife Fund ecoregions with terrestrial forest were subset from 34 biodiversity hotspots and forest cover calculated from GlobCover data at a 300 m pixel resolution. There were 276 ecoregions in 32 biodiversity hotspots classified as containing terrestrial forests. When the first quartile of forest ecoregions was subset based on smallest extent of forest cover in protected areas, there were 69 rare forests identified within 20 biodiversity hotspots. Most rare forest ecoregions (45) occurred on islands or island archipelagos and 47 rare forest ecoregions contained less than 10 % forest cover in protected areas. San F,lix-San Ambrosio Islands Temperate Forests, Tubuai Tropical Moist Forests, Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago Tropical Moist Forests, and Yap Tropical Dry Forests were identified as the least protected and possibly most vulnerable forests within biodiversity hotspots. These ecoregions cover less than 500 km(2), forest cover is less than 50 km(2), and there are no protected areas. There is a need to update classifications and boundaries of protected areas, insure that islands are included in global land cover datasets, and identify levels of endemism and endangerment within forest ecoregions. This should improve our ability to compare, prioritize, and monitor forests in biodiversity hotspots.

In the past three decades the impacts of these biotic modifiers have been investigated as ecosystem engineers, niche constructors, facilitators and keystone species. This environmental modulation can vary spatially from extremely local to global, temporally from days to geological time, and taxonomically from a few to a very large number of species. Modulation impacts are pervasive and affect, inter alia, the climate, structural environments, disturbance rates, soils and the atmospheric chemical composition. Biotic modifiers may profoundly transform the projected environmental conditions, and consequently have a significant impact on the predicted occurrence of the focal species in species distribution models (SDMs). This applies especially when these models are projected into different geographical regions or into the future or the past, where these biotic modifiers may be absent, or other biotic modifiers may be present. We show that environmental modulation can be represented in SDMs as additional variables. In some instances it is possible to use the species (e.g. biotic modifiers) in order to reflect the modulation. This would apply particularly to cases where the effect is the result of a single or a small number of species (e.g. elephants transforming woodland to grassland). Where numerous species generate an effect (such as tree species making a forest, or grasses facilitating fire) that modulates the abiotic environment, the effect itself might be a better descriptor for the aggregated action of the numerous species. We refer to this effect as the modulator. Much of the information required to incorporate environmental modulation effects in SDMs is already available from remote-sensing data and vegetation models.

Regional landscape attributes need to be considered in the integrative research of wetlands to allow habitat-specific management. Here we investigated the distribution and the habitat diversity of the wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont in the Caqueta Department of Colombia. Based on the landscape approach we combined geomorphic, hydro-chemical and biotic attributes. We used remote sensing based interpretation and ground truth verification. We found 896 wetlands covering up to 11 % of the study area. Our estimate of the wetland area does not reflect the true historic wetland area (occasionally flooded area) because 76.9 % of the flooded active floodplain area has been converted to pastures. Including the pastures the estimated wetland area is 29.3 % of the study region. We identified 7 wetland habitats. The method we applied can be used to map small and middle sized wetlands achieving an acceptable overall accuracy. These wetlands provide important ecosystem services and act as corridors for biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes such as the Caqueta region. Our results provide support for the wise use of tropical wetlands and may help to improve landscape management in the Amazon basin.

Abiotic and biotic controls of cryptobenthic fish assemblages across a Caribbean seascape	CORAL REEFS												The majority of fish studies on coral reefs consider only non-cryptic species and, despite their functional importance, data on cryptic species are scarce. This study investigates inter-habitat variation in Caribbean cryptobenthic fishes by re-analysing a comprehensive data set from 58 rotenone stations around Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands. Boosted regression trees were used to associate the density and diversity of non-piscivorous cryptobenthic fishes, both in the entire data set and on reef habitats alone, with 14 abiotic and biotic variables. The study also models the habitat requirements of the three commonest species. Dead coral cover was the first or second most important variable in six of the eight models constructed. For example, within the entire data set, the number of species and total fish density increased approximately linearly with increasing dead coral cover. Dead coral was also important in multivariate analyses that discriminated 10 assemblages within the entire data set. On reef habitats, the number of species and total fish density increased dramatically when dead coral exceeded similar to 55 %. Live coral cover was typically less important for explaining variance in fish assemblages than dead coral, but live corals were important for maintaining high fish diversity. Coral species favoured by cryptobenthic species may be particularly susceptible to mortality, but dead coral may also provide abundant food and shelter for many fishes. Piscivore density was a key variable in the final models, but typically increased with increasing cryptobenthic fish diversity and abundance, suggesting both groups of fishes are responding to the same habitat variables. The density of territorial damselfishes reduced the number of cryptobenthic fish species on reef habitats. Finally, habitats delineated by standard remote sensing techniques supported distinct cryptobenthic fish assemblages, suggesting that such maps can be used as surrogates of general patterns of cryptic fish biodiversity in conservation planning.

The ecosystem functioning dimension in conservation: insights from remote sensing	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												An important goal of conservation biology is the maintenance of ecosystem processes. Incorporating quantitative measurements of ecosystem functions into conservation practice is important given that it provides not only proxies for biodiversity patterns, but also new tools and criteria for management. In the satellite era, the translation of spectral information into ecosystem functional variables expands and complements the more traditional use of satellite imagery in conservation biology. Remote sensing scientists have generated accurate techniques to quantify ecosystem processes and properties of key importance for conservation planning such as primary production, ecosystem carbon gains, surface temperature, albedo, evapotranspiration, and precipitation use efficiency; however, these techniques are still unfamiliar to conservation biologists. In this article, we identify specific fields where a remotely-sensed characterization of ecosystem functioning may aid conservation science and practice. Such fields include the management and monitoring of species and populations of conservation concern; the assessment of ecosystem representativeness and singularity; the use of protected areas as reference sites to assess global change effects; the implementation of monitoring and warning systems to guide adaptive management; the direct evaluation of supporting ecosystem services; and the planning and monitoring of ecological restorations. The approaches presented here illustrate feasible ways to incorporate the ecosystem functioning dimension into conservation through the use of satellite-derived information.

Malcolmia littorea: The isolated Italian population in the European context	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												We compared the coenological information of the only Italian population of Malcolmia littorea (L.) R. Br. with published phytosociological releves, including ones of this species, throughout its European range. With the aim of highlighting the main climatic features influencing the distribution patterns of M. littorea, we integrated coenological data with some climatic variables and considered major drivers for plant distribution at the European scale. Finally, we analysed the population extent of M. littorea in Italy, in order to assess its conservation status at regional level. The DCA analysis, performed on a matrix 139 releves x 183 species, separated the releves according to their floristic composition, showing a geographic gradient from Portugal to Mediterranean coasts, until Italy; with Mediterranean releves clearly separated from Atlantic ones as well. Along the beach-inland gradient, the analysis highlights that the species is typical of fixed dunes habitats (more inland, mainly stabilised dunes), although in the Atlantic it can also be found in mobile dunes. The analysis of climatic variables in relation to M. littorea distribution, suggested that the species is sensitive to low winter temperature and to summer drought. The only Italian population of M. littorea is subjected to many threats, due to its small dimensions (<1 ha), isolation from the rest of its distribution area, that ranges from Portugal to France (until the Camargue region) and intensive human disturbances. Using both field and remote sensing information, we showed a considerable decrease of the occupied surface in Italy, leading us to suggest that the IUCN threat category of M. littorea in Italy should be reassessed from endangered to critically endangered.

This is especially true for animals in seasonal savanna environments in Africa, despite this biome's importance for both conservation and development goals. We studied the impacts of spatial and temporal variability in environmental conditions, along with individual and social factors, on home range sizes in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in northeastern Namibia. Our data set spans 4 years, is derived from 32 satellite tracking collars, and contains over 35,000 GPS locations. We used the local convex hull method to estimate home range size from 31 buffalo captured at 6 sites. We used a variety of remotely sensed data to characterize potential anthropogenic and natural boundaries, as well as seasonal and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions. Using an information-theoretic, mixed effects approach, our analyses showed that home ranges varied over two orders of magnitude and are among the largest recorded for this species. Variables relating to vegetation and habitat boundaries were more important than abiotic environmental conditions and individual or social factors in explaining variation in home range size. The relative contributions of environmental, individual, social, and linear boundary variables to intraspecific home range size have rarely been examined and prior to this had not been assessed for any species in seasonal savannas of Africa. Understanding the factors that condition space-use patterns of wildlife in this area will lead to better-informed conservation and sustainable development decisions.

Scampering in the city: Examining attitudes toward black-tailed prairie dogs in Denver, Colorado	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The conservation of prairie dogs in the Western United States is contentious, as prairie dogs are often considered pests. This research addresses the ecological and social outlook for prairie dog colonies in Denver, Colorado. Remote sensing analysis was applied to identify potential locations for colony reintroduction. To assess the social outlook, knowledge and attitudinal surveys were distributed to residents living near existing colonies and potential colony sites. Statistical analysis of responses provided insight into relationships amongst ecological knowledge, access to educational literature, demographics, and attitudes toward prairie dogs. Results indicated that women view prairie dogs more favorably than men; ecological knowledge was strongly associated with favorableness toward prairie dogs; and residents living near existing colonies were more favorable toward prairie dogs. We conclude that prairie dogs have the potential to be sustained in Denver. This study may help wildlife managers in targeting neighborhood-level education efforts to specific demographics and (mis) conceptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet, global soil degradation assessments are based on qualitative expert judgments or remotely sensed quantitative proxy values that suffice to raise awareness but are too coarse to identify appropriate sustainable land management interventions. Studies in China and Sub Saharan Africa illustrate the considerable impact of degradation on crop production but also point to the need for solutions dependent on location specific agro-ecological conditions and farming systems. The development of a comprehensive approach should be feasible to better assess both extent and impact of soil degradation interlinking various scales, based on production ecological approaches and remote sensing to allow disentangling natural and human induced causes of degradation. A shared common knowledge base cataloguing hard-won location-specific interventions is needed for successfully preventing or mitigating degradation.

Runoff Modeling in an Agro-Forested Watershed Using Remote Sensing and GIS	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												A hybrid technique was used for the runoff production and its routing in an agro-forested watershed located within the Kanha National Park in Central India with the use of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data. In this technique, a modified Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method and a two-dimensional overland flow model were combined. Modified SCS-CN method estimated daily net rainfall fractions were used as an input to the overland flow model along with other remote-sensing-derived inputs such as the digital elevation model (DEM), rainfall, and roughness factor for routing of the produced runoff. The model works on a cell basis and routs produced runoff from one cell to next following the maximum downslope directions. The flow model uses the diffusive wave approximations of the St. Venant equations for routing surface water. The model was tested by calibrating the Strickler coefficient K, which is inversely proportional to resistance to flow, and comparing the observed and simulated daily change in the water levels for two gauging sites. The calibrated average values of K for different subcatchments were 15.7, 21.7, 23.4, and 28.4 for Kurkuti, Sijhora, between the gauging sites, and downstream catchments, respectively. The model was tested for some statistical parameters like the Nash Sutcliffe coefficientand RMSE using residuals between observed and simulated data, and found to be within the acceptable limits. The results show that the hybrid technique works well to extend the application of curve number to address the routing phase of runoff. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000466.

Spatial Mapping of Runoff from a Watershed Using SCS-CN Method with Remote Sensing and GIS	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												This study aims to simulate runoff depth using the Soil Conservation Service-curve number (SCS-CN) method with remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. In this study, the SCS-CN technique adapted for Indian conditions has been used for the generation of CNs for an ungauged watershed. The USDA SCS-CN method is used for estimating the runoff depth in the Manimuktha subwatershed. Monthly and annual runoff values have been obtained from the daily runoff values of the watershed. A base map, soil map, and land use map of the study area have been prepared using remote sensing data and Survey of India (SOI) toposheets. The vector layers have been generated in GIS software. The SCS model is then applied to estimate the daily runoff from the watershed and validated, comparing it with the observed runoff of a few selected events of the monsoon periods of 1980-2009. The statistical analysis indicates that the SCS-CN method can be applied to predict runoff depths of an ungauged watershed. The present study reveals that the remote sensing and GIS-based SCS-CN model can be used effectively to estimate the runoff from the ungauged Indian watersheds of similar geo-hydrological characteristics.

Yet not much is known if these models also perform well in wetland ecosystems. The objectives of this study were to (i) develop spectral informed soil taxonomic prediction models and assess their accuracy; (ii) quantify the relationships between soil classes and environmental co-variates derived from remote sensing and geospatial sources; and (iii) compare the effects of spatial resolution (10, 30, and 250 m) of three remote sensing images to delineate soil classes. The study was conducted in a subtropical wetland: Water Conservation Area-2A, the Florida Everglades, U.S. Soil series were collected at 108 sites and three satellite images acquired (i) satellite pour l'observation de la terre (SPOT, 10 m), (ii) Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+, 30 m), and (iii) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 250 m). Classification trees were used to predict soil series using spectral data and ancillary environmental datasets. Prediction models derived from spectral data performed better when compared to a control model without spectral inputs. The soil series prediction model derived using SPOT spectral data "without bedrock depth" and the model derived using MODIS spectral data "with bedrock depth" showed the best results based on accuracy measures and Kappa coefficient. Results suggest that the variability of soil series can be explained by bedrock/parent material > topographic variables > vegetation properties derived from remote sensing.

EVALUATING HABITAT-ASSOCIATION MODELS FOR THE SALTMARSH SPARROW	CONDOR												Habitat models that associate organisms with features of their environment can help identify areas for planning conservation strategies. These models, however, should be tested with new data before their conclusions are widely accepted. The Saltmarsh Sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus) is a species of growing conservation concern along the Atlantic coast of North America. In a previous study, we developed models for Saltmarsh Sparrow presence and nesting habitat. Sparrow occupancy was best predicted from raw reflective properties of marshes derived from remote sensing, whereas sparrow nesting was best predicted from a classification of marsh plant communities. To test these models, we surveyed a stratified random sample of sites for which the probability of sparrow presence had been predicted and compared the observations to the predicted probability of presence and nesting generated from the models. The models' performance, assessed by the area under a receiver-operating characteristic curve and the deviance of observations from the models' predictions, was significantly better than expected by chance alone. Because sparrows are predicted to occur in many places where they are unlikely to nest, monitoring sparrow presence alone will not identify areas important for their nesting.																	0010-5422					NOV	2012	114	4					856	864		10.1525/cond.2012.110197								WOS:000311882700020

This information will serve diverse applications, including stimulating new research and providing the basis for assessments.

A Strategy for Rangeland Management Based on Best Available Knowledge and Information	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Adapting what we currently know about ecosystems to a future where rangelands are changing is a new frontier in rangeland management. Current tools for knowledge discovery and application are limited because they cannot adequately judge ecological relevance of knowledge to specific situations. We propose development of integrated knowledge systems (KSs)-collections of resources (e.g., data, analytical tools, literature) drawn from disparate domains and organized around topics by process-based conceptual models. An integrated KS would define relevance by ecological attributes (e.g., soils, climate, vegetation) and location as a flexible mechanism for organizing, finding, and applying knowledge to rangeland management. A KS provides knowledge sources within a decision-making framework that defines what knowledge is needed and how it will be used to make decisions. Knowledge from a KS can identify appropriate spatial and temporal scales to address specific resource questions or objectives. Several factors currently limit KS development and implementation. These include limited interoperability of disparate information and knowledge systems; lack of consistent geographic referencing of knowledge; incomplete and inconsistent documentation of the origin, history and meaning of data and information; underexploited application of remote sensing products; limited ability to extrapolate and share local knowledge and unstructured information; and lack of training and education of professionals that can link ecological and technical fields of study. The proposed KS concept and recommendations present an opportunity to take advantage of emerging technologies and the collective knowledge of rangeland professionals to address changing ecosystems and evolving threats. If we keep on with a "business as usual" approach to finding and using information, we will struggle to meet our responsibilities as rangeland professionals.

Eigenvalue Estimation of Hyperspectral Wishart Covariance Matrices From Limited Number of Samples	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Estimation of covariance matrices is a fundamental step in hyperspectral remote sensing where most detection algorithms make use of the covariance matrix in whitening procedures. We present a simple method to estimate all p eigenvalues of a Wishart-distributed sampled covariance matrix (with which an improved covariance can be constructed) when the number of samples (n) is small, n/p > 1 and less than a few tens. Our method is based on the Marcenko-Pastur (M-P) law, theory of eigenvalue bounds, and energy conservation. We compute an apparent multiplicity for each sampled eigenvalue and then shift the sampled eigenvalues according the maximum likelihood location (M-P mode). We impose energy conservation in two distinct regions; small eigenvalues and large eigenvalues, where the transition between the two regions is found by solving successive first-order regression equation for the sampled data. The method also improves the condition number of the data (small eigenvalues are shifted upward in values), hence, it is also "regularization," where the regularization is a multiplicative vector regularization as opposed to the traditional additive scalar regularization where all eigenvalues are shifted upward by the same value.																	0196-2892					NOV	2012	50	11	1				4384	4396		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2191415								WOS:000310888000014

Heathland conservation status mapping through integration of hyperspectral mixture analysis and decision tree classifiers	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring the conservation status of natural habitats is an essential aspect of effective conservation management. Not only data on habitat occurrence are needed, but also detailed information on the structural and functional characteristics of the habitat patches is crucial for an adequate conservation status assessment. Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images performs well in discriminating dominant land cover and vegetation classes, but the accuracy drops significantly for the classification of more subtle differences in conservation status that are related to structural characteristics. This study proposes a method to facilitate ecological conservation status assessment based on decision tree modeling of subpixel fraction estimates steered by ecological expert knowledge. In particular, it contributes to the spatially explicit assessment of an important structural aspect of dry heathland vegetation, namely the heather age structure, using Airborne Hyperspectral line-Scanner radiometer (AHS-160) data of the Kalmthoutse Heide in northern Belgium. We implemented a subpixel unmixing approach to identify the percentage of heather, sand and shadow in each heather pixel, and subsequently applied a decision tree classification to allocate each pixel to a certain age class. As such, our method provides a tool that contributes to the information required for an appropriate management and successful conservation of natural heathlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, more comprehensive assessment of vegetation structure could be achieved for mixed-grass prairie by integrating field survey, topographic position (summit, mid and toeslope) and spectral reflectance data. Thus, we examined the variation of mixed-grass prairie structural attributes (canopy leaf area, standing crop mass, canopy height, nitrogen, and water content) and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) with variation in topographic position at the Grand River National Grassland (GRNG), South Dakota. We conducted the study on a 36,000-ha herbaceous area within the GRNG, where randomly selected plots (1 km(2) in size) were geolocated and included summit, mid and toeslope positions. We tested for effects of topographic position on measured vegetation attributes and VIs calculated from Landsat TM and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data collected in July 2010. Leaf area, standing crop mass, canopy height, nitrogen, and water content were lower at summits than at toeslopes. The simple ratio of Landsat Band 7/Band 1 (SR71) was the VI most highly correlated with canopy standing crop and height at plot and landscape scales. Results suggest field and remote sensing-based grassland assessment techniques could more comprehensively target low structure areas at minimal expense by layering modeled imagery over a landscape stratified into topographic position groups.

Raymond, Jr.			Changes of crop rotation in Iowa determined from the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service cropland data layer product	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Crop rotation is one of the important decisions made independently by numerous farm managers, and is a critical variable in models of crop growth and soil carbon. In Iowa and much of the Midwestern United States (US), the typical management decision is to rotate corn and soybean crops for a single field; therefore, the land-cover changes each year even though the total area of agricultural land-use remains the same. The price for corn increased from 2001 to 2010, which increased corn production in Iowa. We tested the hypothesis that the production increase was the result of changes in crop rotation in Iowa using the annual remote sensing classification (the cropland data layer) produced by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service. It was found that the area planted in corn increased from 4.7 million hectares in 2001 to 5.7 million hectares in 2007, which was correlated with the market price for corn. At the county level, there were differences in how the increase in corn production was accomplished. Northern and central counties had little land to expand cultivation and generally increased corn production by converting to a corn-corn rotation from the standard corn-soybean rotation. Southern counties in Iowa increased corn production by expanding into land that was not under recent cultivation. These changes affect the amount of soil carbon sequestration.

J	Tattoni, C; Rizzolli, F; Pedrini, P				Tattoni, Clara; Rizzolli, Franco; Pedrini, Paolo			Can LiDAR data improve bird habitat suitability models?	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Habitat suitability models are based on digital maps that very often describe the environment at a human scale and, hence miss ecological structures and features that are important for wildlife. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data, laser scanning acquired by remote sensing, can fill this gap by providing useful information not only on the spatial extent of habitat types but also information on the vertical height. The advantage of LiDAR derived variables lays also in the availability at a large scale, instead of just in the survey sites. In this work we evaluated the effect of three LiDAR derived variables (tree height, percentage of trees in open areas and length of ecotone) on the performance of habitat models, developed for four farmland bird species. For each species multiple runs of stepwise Logistic Regression (LR) and Maximum Entropy Models (Maxent) were performed. For each run we included and excluded the LiDAR variables and recorded the improvement in model performance using the AUC, AIC, Sensitivity, Specificity. Model results were applied in a GIS in order to create habitat suitability maps. Results for the RL models showed that for most of the species at least one LiDAR variable was selected and significant (p < 0.05). Additionally the inclusion LIDAR data gave a positive percentage of contribution to the AUC of the Maxent models. The models calculated using LiDAR derived variables identified a smaller area on the map, with a better overlap with open areas, thus showing a more realistic spatial pattern. The interpretation of these variable is also more straightforward, both from the ecological point of view and when defining management guidelines. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Adapting to a Changing World: Unraveling the Role of Man-Made Habitats as Alternative Feeding Areas for Slender-Billed Gull (Chroicocephalus genei)	PLOS ONE												Current rates of wildlife habitat loss have placed increasing demands on managers to develop, validate and implement tools aimed at improving our ability to evaluate such impacts on wildlife. Here, we present a case study conducted at the Natural Area of Donana (SW Spain) where remote sensing and stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) analyses of individuals were combined to unravel (1) the effect of variations in availability of natural food resources (i.e. from natural marshes) on reproductive performance of a Slender-billed Gull (Chroicocephalus genei) population, and (2) the role of two adjacent, artificial systems (a fish farm and saltmines) as alternate anthropogenic feeding areas. Based on long-term (1983-2004) remote-sensing, we inferred the average extent of flooded area at the marshland (a proxy to natural resource availability) annually. Estimated flooded areas (ranging from extreme drought [ca. 151 ha, 1995] to high moisture [15,049 ha, 2004]) were positively related to reproductive success of gulls (estimated for the 1993-2004 period, and ranging from ca. 0 to 1.7 fledglings per breeding pairs), suggesting that habitat availability played a role in determining their reproductive performance. Based on blood delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of fledglings, 2001-2004, and a Bayesian isotopic mixing model, we conclude that saltmines acted as the main alternative foraging habitat for gulls, with relative contributions increasing as the extent of marshland decreased. Although adjacent, anthropogenic systems have been established as the preferred breeding sites for this gull population, dietary switches towards exploitation of alternative (anthropogenic) food resources negatively affected the reproductive output of this species, thus challenging the perception that these man-made systems are necessarily a reliable buffer against loss of natural feeding habitats. The methodology and results derived from this study could be extended to a large suite of threatened natural communities worldwide, thus providing a useful framework for management and conservation.

J	Adhikari, S; Southworth, J				Adhikari, Sanchayeeta; Southworth, Jane			Simulating Forest Cover Changes of Bannerghatta National Park Based on a CA-Markov Model: A Remote Sensing Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Establishment of protected areas (PA) has been one of the leading tools in biodiversity conservation. Globally, these kinds of conservation interventions have given rise to an increase in PAs as well as the need to empirically evaluate the impact of these PAs on forest cover. Few of these empirical evaluations have been geared towards comparison of pre and post policy intervention landscapes. This paper provides a method to empirically evaluate such pre and post policy interventions by using a cellular automata-Markov model. This method is tested using remotely sensed data of Bannerghatta National park (BNP) and its surrounding, which have experienced various national level policy interventions (Indian National Forest Policy of 1988) and rapid land cover change between 1973 and 2007. The model constructs a hypothetical land cover scenario of BNP and its surroundings (1999 and 2007) in the absence of any policy intervention, when in reality there has been a significant potential policy intervention effect. The models predicted a decline in native forest cover and an increase in non forest cover post 1992 whereas the actual observed landscape experienced the reverse trend where after an initial decline from 1973 to 1992, the forest cover in BNP is towards recovery post 1992. Furthermore, the models show a higher deforestation and lower reforestation than the observed deforestation and reforestation patterns for BNP post 1992. Our results not only show the implication of national level policy changes on forest cover but also show the usefulness of our method in evaluating such conservation efforts.

An Initial Assessment of SMOS Derived Soil Moisture over the Continental United States	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The recently available Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) 1.4 GHz based soil moisture retrievals for the year of 2010 and the first nine months of 2011 are assessed over the continental United States (CONUS) region, along with soil moisture retrievals produced at Princeton University based on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) 10.7 GHz channel using the Land Surface Microwave Emission Model (LSMEM) and in-situ measurements from the Natural Resource Conservation Service's (NRCS) Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). The assessment is carried out using a performance metric developed by Crow (J. Hydromet., 2007), which calculates the ability of soil moisture estimates to correct errors in surface moisture predictions through a linear Kalman filter. Within the Crow framework, SMOS retrievals show the same level of skill as AMSR-E/LSMEM or SCAN when evaluated on the days where both are available. But the SMOS product is significantly less available than AMSR-E/LSMEM or SCAN, especially on rainy days, therefore it is less able to reproduce the rainfall-moisture dynamics and consequently achieves a lower performance metric if all available data are used from all products. Detailed analysis shows that, with uncertainties, the performance of both SMOS and AMSR-E/LSMEM generally decays with thicker vegetation and wetter climate but is not significantly influenced by topography. We expect SMOS to further improve its accuracy through validation studies and its availability under rainy conditions as well.

Comparing the information content of coral reef geomorphological and biological habitat maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

The Effectiveness of Contrasting Protected Areas in Preventing Deforestation in Madre de Dios, Peru	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Accurate monitoring of the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in decreasing deforestation is increasingly important given the vital role of forest protection in climate change mitigation. Recent studies on PA effectiveness have used remote-sensing imagery to compare deforestation rates within PAs to surrounding areas. However, remote-sensing data used in isolation provides limited information on the factors contributing to effectiveness. We used landscape-modelling techniques to estimate the effectiveness of ten PAs in Madre de Dios, Peru. Factors influencing PA effectiveness were investigated using in situ key-informant interviews. Although all of the PAs studied had positive effectiveness scores, those with the highest scores were ecotourism and conservation concessions, where monitoring and surveillance activities and good relations with surrounding communities were reported as possible factors in decreasing deforestation rates. Native community areas had the lowest scores, with deforestation mainly driven by internal resource use and population growth. Weak local governance and immigration were identified as underlying factors decreasing the effectiveness of protection, whereas good relations with surrounding communities and monitoring activity increased effectiveness. The results highlight the need to combine remote sensing with in situ information on PA management because identification of drivers and deterrents of deforestation is vital for improving the effectiveness of protection.

It takes only 1.5 min using 16 processors on a cluster of NSF TeraGrid to compute 3-D solution of Maxwell equations of 8 by 8 square wavelengths. With the improved computational efficiency, we computed results using areas up to 32 by 32 square wavelengths. With the larger surface area, we were able to compute cases with larger rms heights up to 8 cm at SMAP radar frequency of 1.26 GHz that corresponds to kh = 2.28. New results computed include the cross-polarization. The five tests on the accuracy of results were performed: convergence with realizations, convergence with discrete samplings, convergence with sample surface sizes, energy conservation for each realization, and reciprocity for each realization. The numerical results show that for a single realization VH = HV within 0.5 dB in the backscattering direction showing that reciprocity is obeyed. Results were compared with experimental data, and both co-polarization and cross-polarization were in good agreements with experimental data.																	0196-2892					OCT	2012	50	10	2				4025	4035		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2189776								WOS:000309361700011

J.; Erasmus, Barend			Mapping tree species composition in South African savannas using an integrated airborne spectral and LiDAR system	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mapping savanna tree species is of broad interest for savanna ecology and rural resource inventory. We investigated the utility of (i) the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) hyperspectral data, and WorldView-2 and Quickbird multispectral spectral data and (ii) a combined spectral + tree height dataset (derived from the CAO LiDAR system) for mapping seven common savanna tree species or genera in the Sabi Sands Reserve and communal lands adjacent to Kruger National Park, South Africa. We convolved the 72 spectral bands of the CAO imagery to eight and four multispectral channels available in the WorldView-2 and Quickbird satellite sensors, respectively. A combination of the simulated WorldView-2 data and LiDAR tree height imagery was also assessed for species classification. First, the simulated WorldView-2 imagery provided a higher classification accuracy (77% +/- 3.1 (mean +/- standard deviation)) when compared to the simulated Quickbird (65% +/- 1.9) and CAO (65% +/- 1.2) data. Secondly, the combined spectral + height dataset provided a slightly higher overall classification accuracy (79% +/- 1.8) when compared to the WorldView-2 spectral only dataset. The difference was however, statistically significant (p<0.001; one-way analysis of variance for 30 bootstrapped replicates (n = 100) of the independent validation dataset). Higher classification accuracies were observed for trees with large crowns such as S. birrea, S. africana and A. nigrescens as compared to trees with small crowns. Species composition and diversity maps of trees with large crowns were consistent with established knowledge in the area. For example, the results showed higher tree diversity (number of different species per ha) in the Sabi Sands game reserve than in the communal areas. This study highlights the feasibility of remote sensing of tree species at the landscape scale in African savannas and the potential applicability of WorldView-2 sensor in mapping savanna tree species with a large crown.
