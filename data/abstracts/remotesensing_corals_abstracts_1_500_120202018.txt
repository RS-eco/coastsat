Based on given bio-optical and noise probabilistic models, CRBs can be computed efficiently for any set of ocean color parameters and any sensor configuration, directly providing the minimum estimation variance that can be possibly attained by any unbiased estimator of any targeted parameter. Here, CRBs are explicitly developed using (1) two water reflectance models corresponding to deep and shallow waters, resp., and (2) four probabilistic models describing the environmental noises observed within four Sentinel-2 MSI, HICO, Sentinel-3 OLCI and MODIS images, resp. For both deep and shallow waters, CRBs are shown to be consistent with the experimental estimation variances obtained using two published remote-sensing methods, while not requiring one to perform any inversion. CRBs are also used to investigate to what extent perfect a priori knowledge on one or several geophysical parameters can improve the estimation of remaining unknown parameters. For example, using pre-existing knowledge of bathymetry (e.g., derived from LiDAR) within the inversion is shown to greatly improve the retrieval of bottom cover for shallow waters. Finally, CRBs are shown to provide valuable information on the best estimation performances that may be achieved with the MSI, HICO, OLCI and MODIS configurations for a variety of oceanic, coastal and inland waters. CRBs are thus demonstrated to be an informative and efficient tool to characterize minimum uncertainties in inverted ocean color geophysical parameters.

J	Moffitt, DL; Kumar, L				Moffitt, David L.; Kumar, Lalit			Remote Sensing of a Shallow, Fringing Reef Platform for Analysis of Island Sector Susceptibility and Development of a Coastal Vulnerability Index	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Like many islands in middle latitudes, Pacific islands are often fringed by protective coral reefs that attenuate wave energy impacting the coastline. Measurement of the extent and distribution of shallow reef platforms by remote sensing of bathymetry enables an assessment of the relative exposure or protection of each part of an island. Fringing reefs are one of a number of physical variables relevant to the coastline's susceptibility to erosion and inundation resulting from extreme weather and conditions exacerbated by climate change and rising sea levels. In this research the extent of shallow reef platform around Lifuka Island, Tonga, was determined using a modified Stumpf band ratio method applied to Landsat 8 and high-resolution Quickbird satellite imagery, with aerial LIDAR data available for ground-truth purposes. The results indicate that both sets of satellite imagery provide a means of measuring the bathymetry to at least 15 m with a correlation (R-2) value of 0.87 for Landsat 8 and to 15 m with a correlation (R-2) value of 0.86 for Quickbird, when compared with the LIDAR survey. This article forms part of the research into the preparation of a coastal vulnerability index to inform decision-making and risk assessment for Pacific Island nations at the subisland scale. The mapping of the fringing reef by remote sensing allows its spatial distribution to be considered in the assessment of risk to coastal regions to inundation and erosion processes. Further, it demonstrates the value of freely available Landsat data for planning adaptation to climate change in developing nations at a level pertinent to local governance of villages and communities.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2018	34	1					122	135		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00143.1								WOS:000422738000012						
J	Barnes, BB; Garcia, R; Hu, CM; Lee, Z				Barnes, Brian B.; Garcia, Rodrigo; Hu, Chuanmin; Lee, Zhongping			Multi-band spectral matching inversion algorithm to derive water column properties in optically shallow waters: An optimization of parameterization	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) and other water quality parameters from satellite remote sensing data covering optically shallow environments has historically been problematic due to difficulties in separating the benthic signal from that of the water column. While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2018	204						424	438		10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.013								WOS:000418464400031

Changing Landscape of Marine National Park and Sanctuary, Gulf of Kachchh: Ecological Assessment of Mangroves and Coral Reefs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES												This paper assesses the ecological changes in mangroves and coral reefs of Marine National Park and Sanctuary (MNP&S), Gulf of Kachchh, Gujarat, India during 1972-2014. Landsat 1 Multi Spectral Scanner data were used for 1972 to map the mangroves and coral reefs whereas Landsat 8 Optical Land Imager data were used to map the coral reef extent only, in MNP&S in 2014. Published literature sources were used to record the area of mangroves and coral reefs of MNP&S for various years between 1972 and 2014, and the changes were analyzed. For the year 1972, total mangrove area mapped is 175.36 sq. km and the total reef area mapped comes out to be 402.14 sq. km. The total area of reef in MNP&S computed for 2014 is 443.49 sq. km. Our analysis shows that MNP&S witnessed severe loss of mangroves till 1992, with annual rate of mangrove degradation being 2.89%. Exploitation by local communities and careless release/spillage of oil and brine by nearby industries were found to be two major anthropogenic factors responsible for degradation of mangroves over a period of four decades. Major reasons found for degradation of reefs in MNP&S were mining and deposition of sediments. The area estimates for coral reefs reported in this paper for 2014 are the latest figures available for coral reefs in this region. It is recommended that monitoring of coastal habitats in MNP&S should be done regularly to understand the changes in the ecology of the area.																	0369-8203	2250-1762				DEC	2017	87	4					889	900		10.1007/s40010-017-0457-3								WOS:000418819200031						
J	Hamylton, SM				Hamylton, Sarah M.			Mapping coral reef environments: A review of historical methods, recent advances and future opportunities	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Coral reef environments support high levels of marine biodiversity, they are important sites for coastal habitation and they provide a range of goods and ecosystem services such as nearshore fisheries, economic revenue from tourism and breeding sites for seabirds and turtles. Mapping is a fundamental activity that underpins our understanding of coral reef environments and helps to shape policies in resource management and conservation. This is particularly the case for quantifying the area of landcover types associated with reef environments, including coral patches, seagrasses and mangroves, but also for monitoring how these change over time and modelling how spatial patterns apparent on reefs are related to environmental drivers. Field techniques and aerial photography have historically played a crucial role in mapping coral reef environments, which has recently seen a transition toward the processing of satellite remote sensing images. This paper examines a series of maps produced of Low Isles, the most mapped island on the Great Barrier Reef, to review historical methods for mapping coral reefs because of the critical importance of understanding how past maps were made, which determines appropriate uses to which they can be put. Recent advances and future opportunities for the application of mapping technologies to coral reefs are also evaluated, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms for airborne surveys, delivery of information through web-based platforms and improvements in the quality of information for making and presenting maps. Maps have transformed the way we have responded to both historic and contemporary coral reef problems. This timely review communicates how maps, and the fast growing technologies that are employed to produce them, are central to our understanding of coral reef environments. Recent advances that may drive exciting new environmental management tools are identified.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2017	41	6					803	833		10.1177/0309133317744998								WOS:000418042100006						
J	Caras, T; Hedley, J; Karnieli, A				Caras, Tarnir; Hedley, John; Karnieli, Arnon			Implications of sensor design for coral reef detection: Upscaling ground hyperspectral imagery in spatial and spectral scales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Remote sensing offers a potential tool for large scale environmental surveying and monitoring. However, remote observations of coral reefs are difficult especially due to the spatial and spectral complexity of the target compared to sensor specifications as well as the environmental implications of the water medium above. The development of sensors is driven by technological advances and the desired products. Currently, spaceborne systems are technologically limited to a choice between high spectral resolution and high spatial resolution, but not both. The current study explores the dilemma of whether future sensor design for marine monitoring should prioritise on improving their spatial or spectral resolution. To address this question, a spatially and spectrally resampled ground-level hyperspectral image was used to test two classification elements: (1) how the tradeoff between spatial and spectral resolutions affects classification; and (2) how a noise reduction by majority filter might improve classification accuracy. The studied reef, in the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat), Israel, is heterogeneous and complex so the local substrate patches are generally finer than currently available imagery. Therefore, the tested spatial resolution was broadly divided into four scale categories from five millimeters to one meter. Spectral resolution resampling aimed to mimic currently available and forthcoming spaceborne sensors such as (1) Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) that is characterized by 25 bands of 6.5 nm width; (2) VEN.sS with 12 narrow bands; and (3) the WorldView series with broadband multispectral resolution. Results suggest that spatial resolution should generally be prioritized for coral reef classification because the finer spatial scale tested (pixel size < 0.1 m) may compensate for some low spectral resolution drawbacks. In this regard, it is shown that the post-classification majority filtering substantially improves the accuracy of all pixel sizes up to the point where the kernel size reaches the average unit size (pixel < 0.25 m). However, careful investigation as to the effect of band distribution and choice could improve the sensor suitability for the marine environment task. This in mind, while the focus in this study was on the technologically limited spaceborne design, aerial sensors may presently provide an opportunity to implement the suggested setup.																	0303-2434					DEC	2017	63						68	77		10.1016/j.jag.2017.07.009								WOS:000411848500007						
J	Zarco-Perello, S; Simoes, N				Zarco-Perello, Salvador; Simoes, Nuno			Ordinary kriging vs inverse distance weighting: spatial interpolation of the sessile community of Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico	PEERJ												Information about the distribution and abundance of the habitat-forming sessile organisms in marine ecosystems is of great importance for conservation and natural resource managers. Spatial interpolation methodologies can be useful to generate this information from in situ sampling points, especially in circumstances where remote sensing methodologies cannot be applied due to small-scale spatial variability of the natural communities and low light penetration in the water column. Interpolation methods are widely used in environmental sciences; however, published studies using these methodologies in coral reef science are scarce. We compared the accuracy of the two most commonly used interpolation methods in all disciplines, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK), to predict the distribution and abundance of hard corals, octocorals, macroalgae, sponges and zoantharians and identify hotspots of these habitat-forming organisms using data sampled at three different spatial scales (5, 10 and 20 m) in Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico. The deeper sandy environments of the leeward and windward regions of Madagascar reef were dominated by macroalgae and seconded by octocorals. However, the shallow rocky environments of the reef crest had the highest richness of habitat-forming groups of organisms; here, we registered high abundances of octocorals and macroalgae, with sponges, Millepora alcicornis and zoantharians dominating in some patches, creating high levels of habitat heterogeneity. IDW and OK generated similar maps of distribution for all the taxa; however, cross-validation tests showed that IDW outperformed OK in the prediction of their abundances. When the sampling distance was at 20 m, both interpolation techniques performed poorly, but as the sampling was done at shorter distances prediction accuracies increased, especially for IDW. OK had higher mean prediction errors and failed to correctly interpolate the highest abundance values measured in situ, except for macroalgae, whereas IDW had lower mean prediction errors and high correlations between predicted and measured values in all cases when sampling was every 5 m. The accurate spatial interpolations created using IDW allowed us to see the spatial variability of each taxa at a biological and spatial resolution that remote sensing would not have been able to produce. Our study sets the basis for further research projects and conservation management in Madagascar reef and encourages similar studies in the region and other parts of the world where remote sensing technologies are not suitable for use.																	2167-8359					NOV 30	2017	5								e4078	10.7717/peerj.4078								WOS:000417096100005	29204321

Estimating regional coral reef calcium carbonate production from remotely sensed seafloor maps	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Carbonate production on coral reefs is responsible for the provision of beach sands, for the maintenance of seawater chemical balances and for the growth of reef structure and associated habitat complexity. Key carbonate producers including hard coral, crustose coralline algae, foraminiferal sand and Halimeda were mapped from satellite imagery (spatial resolution 2.5 m, mean overall accuracy = 81%) and an upscaling model was applied to estimate carbonate production. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of employing different calcification rates for live coral on the upscaling model. Contemporary coral reef carbonate production for the 21 reef platforms of the Capricorn-Bunker Group (southern Great Barrier Reef) is estimated to be between 489,000 and 659,000 t per year based on seawater chemistry, community composition, calcification rates and reef structural complexity (rugosity). The upscaling model was relatively insensitive to different parameterisations of live coral calcification employed, probably due to live coral being a relatively minor contributor by area (approximately 18% of total reef area throughout the study region). This suggests regional scale seafloor characteristics, such as percentage of area dominated by substrates prone to dissolution (e.g. coral rubble), have a strong bearing on calcium carbonate production and need to be given greater consideration The upscaling framework presented provides a new method for quantifying regional carbonate production that could be applied globally, and provides a valuable baseline against which future changes to carbonate production in this region can be assessed.

We analyzed the data for the period between the northwest and southeast monsoon 2007-2011. A pelagic hotspot index was constructed from a model of multi-spectrum satellite-based oceanographic data in relation to skipjack fishing performance. Results showed that skipjack catch per unit efforts (CPUEs) increased significantly in areas of highest pelagic hotspot indices. The distribution and dynamics of habitat hotspots were detected by the synoptic measurements of SST, SSHA and Chl-a ranging from 29.5 degrees to 31.5 degrees C, from 2.5 to 12.5 cm and from 0.15 to 0.35 mg m(-3), respectively. Total area of hotspots consistently peaked in May. Validation of skipjack CPUE predicted by our model against observed data from 2012 was highly significant. The key pelagic habitat corresponded with the Chl-a front, which could be related to the areas of relatively high prey abundance (enhanced feeding opportunity) for skipjack. We found that the area and persistence of the potential skipjack habitat hotspots for the 5 years were clearly identified by the 0.2 mg m(-3) Chl-a isopleth, suggesting that the Chl-a front provides a key oceanographic indicator for global understanding on skipjack tuna habitat hotspots in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, especially within Coral Triangle tuna.

Satellite imagery is useful for assessing particle transport from land to sea. However, in the oligotrophic and shallow waters of tropical lagoons, the bottom reflection of downwelling light usually hampers the use of classical optical algorithms. In order to address this issue, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was developed and tested. The proposed application concerns the lagoon of New Caledoniathe second longest continuous coral reef in the worldwhich is frequently exposed to river plumes from ultramafic watersheds. The SVR model is based on a large training sample of in-situ turbidity values representative of the annual variability in the Voh-Kone-Pouembout lagoon (Western Coast of New Caledonia) during the 2014-2015 period and on coincident satellite reflectance values from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). It was trained with reflectance and two other explanatory parametersbathymetry and bottom colour. This approach significantly improved the model's capacity for retrieving the in-situ turbidity range from MODIS images, as compared with algorithms dedicated to deep oligotrophic or turbid waters, which were shown to be inadequate. This SVR model is applicable to the whole shallow lagoon waters from the Western Coast of New Caledonia and it is now ready to be tested over other oligotrophic shallow lagoon waters worldwide.

However, the process is not straightforward, the main limitation being the need for field data. The Self-calibrated Spectral Supervised Shallow-water Modeler (4SM) method was tested to obtain coastal bathymetry without the use of any field data. Using Landsat-8 multispectral images from 2013 to 2016, a bathymetric time series was produced. Groundtruthed depths and an alternative method, Stumpf's Band Ratio Algorithm, were used to verify the results. Retrieved (4SM) vs groundtruthed depths scored an average r(2) (0.90), and a low error (RMSE = 1.47 m). 4SM also showed, over the whole time series, the same average accuracy of the control method (40%). Advantages, limitations and operability under complex atmosphere and water column conditions, and high and low-albedo bottom processing capabilities of 4SM are discussed. In conclusion, the findings suggest that 4SM is as accurate as the commonly used Stumpf's method, the only difference being the independence of 4SM from previous field data, and the potential to deliver bottom spectral characteristics for further modeling. 4SM thus represents a significant advance in coastal remote sensing potential to obtain bathymetry and optical properties of the marine bottom.

J	Haya, LOMY; Fujii, M				Haya, La Ode Muhammad Yasir; Fujii, Masahiko			Mapping the change of coral reefs using remote sensing and in situ measurements: a case study in Pangkajene and Kepulauan Regency, Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY												As elsewhere in Indonesia, local inhabitants in the Pangkajene and Kepulauan (PANGKEP) Regency, Spermonde Archipelago area and along the south-west coast of Sulawesi traditionally regard the coral reefs as their livelihood source. Since human activities as well as natural disturbances pose major threats to the coral reefs, these livelihoods may also be at risk. Currently, no comprehensive information on the status and condition of coral reefs in this area is available for this resource management. We determined the changes of coral reef habitat over a period of 20 years from 1994 to 2014 using a satellite Landsat multi-temporal image substantiated with in situ measurement data collected in 2014. The spectral value of coral reefs was extracted from multi-temporal Landsat imagery data, while the diffuse attenuation coefficient of water was obtained by using statistical analysis between the ratio of live coral cover and the spectral value of the visible bands. By using the unsupervised classification integrated with the data ground truth, it is stated that there has been a decline in live coral cover over a period of 20 years from 7716 ha in 1994 to 4236 ha in 2014, with a degradation rate of 174 ha/year. Based on the results, the ratio of the coral cover in the coral reef transects varied from the average of 24% for live corals to 96% for coral rubbles, implying the degraded status of coral reefs in the study area.																	0916-8370	1573-868X				OCT	2017	73	5					623	645		10.1007/s10872-017-0422-4								WOS:000412313300008

A Study on the Delineation of Coral Reefs in Andaman and Lakshadweep Islands Using RISAT-1 Data	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Coral reefs are one of the most diverse of all marine ecosystems and are often referred to as the "rain-forests of the sea''. Though they cover less than one per cent of Earth's surface, they are home to one quarter of all ocean species by providing food and shelter to them. Optical remote sensing has been widely employed for mapping and monitoring coral reefs. But the application of microwave remote sensing has been an alternate domain in this area. This study explores the possibility of utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of Radar Imaging Satellite-I, India's first indigenous microwave satellite to delineate the coral reefs in Andaman and Lakshadweep Islands in the Indian Ocean. The dual polarized data, after reducing the speckle has been classified to delineate the coral reefs in the vicinity of both islands. SAR has a performance comparable with passive optical sensors under favourable conditions of imaging, viz. optimum tidal current and surface winds. The study results are compared with the international coral reef reference map and are found to be highly promising, with an overall accuracy of 98.3% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.944 for fringing reefs in Andaman region. For the atolls in Lakshadweep region, the overall accuracy is found to be 92.99% and the Kappa coefficient is estimated at 0.7377. This study tries to explore a different horizon for microwave remote sensing in coral reef studies. It is seen that, optical and microwave remote sensing can provide a mutually supporting platform in coral reef delineation, in terms of imaging depth as well as climatic conditions.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2017	45	5					873	885		10.1007/s12524-016-0634-x								WOS:000413689600014

We present a novel probabilistic approach to jointly estimate the seafloor reflectance and water properties while flexibly incorporating varied domain knowledge and in situ measurements. The inversion transforms remote radiance data with an atmospheric correction followed by a water column correction. Benthic reflectance and water optical properties are both represented by linear mixtures of endmember spectra. We combine remote measurements, prior knowledge and field data using a flexible Bayesian optimal estimation, solving for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) combination of water column properties, seafloor reflectance, and depth. We then demonstrate performance in controlled simulations and in overflights of a coral reef in Hawaii with coincident in situ measurements. The measurement approach helps lay a foundation for wide-area airborne mapping of the condition of threatened coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs.

However, various sources of error may make the observed subsurface remote-sensing reflectance deviate from the model, resulting in an increased retrieval error when inverting the model based on classical least-squares fitting. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic forward model of shallow water reflectance variability that describes two of the main sources of error, namely, (1) the environmental noise that includes every source of above-water variability (e.g., sensor noise and rough water surface), and (2) the potentially complex inherent spectral variability of each benthic class through their associated spectral covariance matrix. Based on this probabilistic model, we derive two inversion approaches, namely, MILE (Maximum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise) and MILEBI (Maximum Likelihood estimation including Environmental noise and Bottom Intra-class variability) that utilize the information contained in the proposed covariance matrices to further constrain the inversion while allowing the observation to differ from the model in the less reliable wavebands. In this paper, MILE and MILEBI are compared with the widely used least-squares (LS) criterion in terms of depth, water clarity and benthic cover retrievals. For these three approaches, we also assess the influence of constraining bottom mixture coefficients to sum to one on estimation results. The results show that the proposed probabilistic model is a valuable tool to investigate the influence of bottom intra-class variability on subsurface reflectance, e.g., as a function of optical depth or environmental noise. As expected, this influence is critical in very optically shallow waters, and decreases with increasing optical depth. The inversion results obtained from synthetic and airborne data of Quiberon Peninsula, France, show that MILE and MILEBI generally provide better performances than LS. For example, in the case of airborne data with depth ranging from 0.44 to 12.00 m, the bathymetry estimation error decreases by about 32% when using MILE and MILEBI instead of LS. Estimated maps of bottom cover are also more consistent when derived using sum-to-one constrained versions of MILE and MILEBI. MILE is shown to be a simple but powerful method to map simple benthic habitats with negligible influence of infra-class variability. Alternatively, MILEBI is to be preferred if this variability cannot be neglected, since taking bottom covariance matrices into account concurrently with mean reflectance spectra may help the bottom discrimination, e.g., in the presence of overlapping classes. This study thus shows that taking potential sources of error into account through appropriate para-meterizations of spectral covariance may be critical to improve the remote sensing of shallow waters, hence making MILE and MILEBI interesting alternatives to LS.

This study proposed a water depth inversion method that is processed using a two-step strategy. First, a log-dual-band ratio transform model is employed by combining blue, yellow, red, and red edge bands. Second, a multivariable linear regression model is constructed to determine water depth. The experimental study is conducted in a reef island in the South China Sea, and the WorldView-2 satellite data is used as the test data. Results demonstrated that the proposed method needs a few parameters in the model, and can effectively and reliably characterize the correlation between the spectral features and water depth.																	1865-0473	1865-0481				SEP	2017	10	3					331	337		10.1007/s12145-017-0299-1								WOS:000407240900004

A diver-operated hyperspectral imaging and topographic surveying system for automated mapping of benthic habitats	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												We developed a novel integrated technology for diver-operated surveying of shallow marine ecosystems. The HyperDiver system captures rich multifaceted data in each transect: hyperspectral and color imagery, topographic profiles, incident irradiance and water chemistry at a rate of 15-30 m(2) per minute. From surveys in a coral reef following standard diver protocols, we show how the rich optical detail can be leveraged to generate photopigment abundance and benthic composition maps. We applied machine learning techniques, with a minor annotation effort (<2% of pixels), to automatically generate cm-scale benthic habitat maps of high taxonomic resolution and accuracy (93-97%). The ability to efficiently map benthic composition, photopigment densities and rugosity at reef scales is a compelling contribution to modernize reef monitoring. Seafloor-level hyperspectral images can be used for automated mapping, avoiding operator bias in the analysis and deliver the degree of detail necessary for standardized environmental monitoring. The technique can deliver fast, objective and economic reef survey results, making it a valuable tool for coastal managers and reef ecologists. Underwater hyperspectral surveying shares the vantage point of the high spatial and taxonomic resolution restricted to field surveys, with analytical techniques of remote sensing and provides targeted validation for aerial monitoring.

Uninhabited islands were turned into new resort islands; evergreen tropical forests were cut, to be replaced by fields and new built-up areas. All these changes happened without a proper monitoring and urban planning strategy from the Maldivian government due to the lack of national land-use and land-cover (LULC) data. This study aimed to realize the first land-use map of the entire Maldives archipelago and to detect land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) using high-resolution satellite images and socioeconomic data. Due to the peculiar geographic and environmental features of the archipelago, the land-use map was obtained by visual interpretation and manual digitization of land-use patches. The images used, dated 2011, were obtained from Digital Globe's WorldView 1 and WorldView 2 satellites. Nine land-use classes and 18 subclasses were identified and mapped. During a field survey, ground control points were collected to test the geographic and the matic accuracy of the land-use map. The final product's overall accuracy was 85%. Once the accuracy of themap had been checked, LULCC maps were created using images from the early 2000s derived from Google Earth historical imagery. Post-classification comparison of the classified maps showed that growth of built-up and agricultural areas resulted in decreases in forest land and shrubland. The LULCC maps also revealed an increase in land reclamation inside lagoons near inhabited islands, resulting in environmental impacts on fragile reef habitat. The LULC map of the Republic of the Maldives produced in this study can be used by government authorities to make sustainable landuse planning decisions and to provide better management of land use and land cover.

Synergistic Use of Remote Sensing and Modeling to Assess an Anomalously High Chlorophyll-a Event during Summer 2015 in the South Central Red Sea	REMOTE SENSING												An anomalously high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) event (>2 mg/m(3)) during June 2015 in the South Central Red Sea (17.5 degrees to 22 degrees N, 37 degrees to 42 degrees E) was observed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. This differs from the low Chl-a values (<0.5 mg/m(3)) usually encountered over the same region during summertime. To assess this anomaly and possible causes, we used a wide range of oceanographical and meteorological datasets, including Chl-a concentrations, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), mixed layer depth (MLD), ocean current velocity and aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from different sensors and models. Findings confirmed this anomalous behavior in the spatial domain using Hovmoller data analysis techniques, while a time series analysis addressed monthly and daily variability. Our analysis suggests that a combination of factors controlling nutrient supply contributed to the anomalous phytoplankton growth. These factors include horizontal transfer of upwelling water through eddy circulation and possible mineral fertilization from atmospheric dust deposition. Coral reefs might have provided extra nutrient supply, yet this is out of the scope of our analysis. We thought that dust deposition from a coastal dust jet event in late June, coinciding with the phytoplankton blooms in the area under investigation, might have also contributed as shown by our AOD findings. However, a lag cross correlation showed a two-month lag between strong dust outbreak and the high Chl-a anomaly. The high Chl-a concentration at the edge of the eddy emphasizes the importance of horizontal advection in fertilizing oligotrophic (nutrient poor) Red Sea waters.

Satellite Remote Sensing for Coastal Management: A Review of Successful Applications	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Management of coastal and marine natural resources presents a number of challenges as a growing global population and a changing climate require us to find better strategies to conserve the resources on which our health, economy, and overall well-being depend. To evaluate the status and trends in changing coastal resources over larger areas, managers in government agencies and private stakeholders around the world have increasingly turned to remote sensing technologies. A surge in collaborative and innovative efforts between resource managers, academic researchers, and industry partners is becoming increasingly vital to keep pace with evolving changes of our natural resources. Synoptic capabilities of remote sensing techniques allow assessments that are impossible to do with traditional methods. Sixty years of remote sensing research have paved the way for resource management applications, but uncertainties regarding the use of this technology have hampered its use in management fields. Here we review examples of remote sensing applications in the sectors of coral reefs, wetlands, water quality, public health, and fisheries and aquaculture that have successfully contributed to management and decision-making goals.

Hyperspectral remote sensing imagery combined with field validation were used to map and characterise the 300-km coast including shore type, land cover and vehicle track footprint. Adjacent to Ningaloo Marine Park, only sparse coastal vegetation cover was present. However, there exists an extensive (1256 km) vehicle track network with the highest densities near accommodation nodes and sandy beaches (over 65% of tracks). Areas managed for conservation had fewer tracks and the lowest track density (0.3 km/km(2)) compared to pastoral stations (similar to 1.9 km/km(2)). The cumulative lengths of tracks were highest on pastoral stations used for livestock grazing, coastal access and camping (945 km out of the total of 1256 km of tracks). The fragility of the arid landscape and this assessment of off-road vehicle impact obtained through detailed mapping of tracks indicate the need for management measures to mitigate the damage and cope with the increasing numbers of visitors.

The Gulf of Carpentaria heated Torres Strait and the Northern Great Barrier Reef during the 2016 mass coral bleaching event	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The 2015/16 ENSO event increased the temperature of waters surrounding northeast Australia to above 30 degrees C, with large patches of water reaching 32 degrees C, for over two months, which led to severe bleaching of corals of the Northern Great Barrier Reef (NGBR). This study provides evidence gained from remote sensing data, oceanographic data and oceanographic modeling, that three factors caused this excessive heating, namely: 1) the shutdown of the North Queensland Coastal Current, which would otherwise have flushed and cooled the Northern Coral Sea and the NGBR through tidal mixing 2) the advection of warm (>30 degrees C) water from the Gulf of Carpentaria eastward through Torres Strait and then southward over the NGBR continental shelf, and 3) presumably local solar heating. The eastward flux of this warm water through Torres Strait was driven by a mean sea level difference on either side of the strait that in turn was controlled by the wind, which also generated the southward advection of this warm water onto the NGBR shelf. On the NGBR shelf, the residence time of this warm water was longer inshore than offshore, and this may explain the observed cross-shelf gradient of coral bleaching intensity. The fate of the Great Barrier Reef is thus controlled by the oceanography of surrounding seas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fritz, C; Schneider, T; Geist, J				Fritz, Christine; Schneider, Thomas; Geist, Juergen			Seasonal Variation in Spectral Response of Submerged Aquatic Macrophytes: A Case Study at Lake Starnberg (Germany)	WATER												Submerged macrophytes are important structural components of freshwater ecosystems that are widely used as long-term bioindicators for the trophic state of freshwater lakes. Climate change and related rising water temperatures are suspected to affect macrophyte growth and species composition as well as the length of the growing season. Alternative to the traditional ground-based monitoring methods, remote sensing is expected to provide fast and effective tools to map submerged macrophytes at short intervals and over large areas. This study analyses interrelations between spectral signature, plant phenology and the length of growing season as influenced by the variable water temperature. During the growing seasons of 2011 and 2015, remote sensing reflectance spectra of macrophytes and sediment were collected systematically in-situ with hyperspectral underwater spectroradiometer at Lake Starnberg, Germany. The established spectral libraries were used to develop reflectance models. The combination of spectral information and phenologic characteristics allows the development of a phenologic fingerprint for each macrophyte species. By inversion, the reflectance models deliver day and daytime specific spectral signatures of the macrophyte populations. The subsequent classification processing chain allowed distinguishing species-specific macrophyte growth at different phenologic stages. The analysis of spectral signatures within the phenologic development indicates that the invasive species Elodea nuttallii is less affected by water temperature oscillations than the native species Chara spp. and Potamogeton perfoliatus.

Characterisation of Hydrological Response to Rainfall at Multi Spatio-Temporal Scales in Savannas of Semi-Arid Australia	WATER												Rainfall is the main driver of hydrological processes in dryland environments and characterising the rainfall variability and processes of runoff generation are critical for understanding ecosystem function of catchments. Using remote sensing and in situ data sets, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall, rainfall-runoff response, and effects on runoff coefficients of antecedent soil moisture and ground cover at different spatial scales. This analysis was undertaken in the Upper Burdekin catchment, northeast Australia, which is a major contributor of sediment and nutrients to the Great Barrier Reef. The high temporal and spatial variability of rainfall are found to exert significant controls on runoff generation processes. Rainfall amount and intensity are the primary runoff controls, and runoff coefficients for wet antecedent conditions were higher than for dry conditions. The majority of runoff occurred via surface runoff generation mechanisms, with subsurface runoff likely contributing little runoff due to the intense nature of rainfall events. MODIS monthly ground cover data showed better results in distinguishing effects of ground cover on runoff that Landsat-derived seasonal ground cover data. We conclude that in the range of moderate to large catchments (193-36,260 km(2)) runoff generation processes are sensitive to both antecedent soil moisture and ground cover. A higher runoff-ground cover correlation in drier months with sparse ground cover highlighted the critical role of cover at the onset of the wet season (driest period) and how runoff generation is more sensitive to cover in drier months than in wetter months. The monthly water balance analysis indicates that runoff generation in wetter months (January and February) is partially influenced by saturation overland flow, most likely confined to saturated soils in riparian corridors, swales, and areas of shallow soil. By March and continuing through October, the soil "bucket" progressively empties by evapotranspiration, and Hortonian overland flow becomes the dominant, if not exclusive, flow generation process. The results of this study can be used to better understand the rainfall-runoff relationships in dryland environments and subsequent exposure of coral reef ecosystems in Australia and elsewhere to terrestrial runoff.

However, the current regional scale hard coral distribution of geomorphic and ecological zones, essential for reefs management in the context of global warming and ocean acidification, is not well documented. We analyzed data from field surveys, Landsat-8 and GF-1 images to map the distribution of hard coral within geomorphic zones and reef flat ecological zones. In situ surveys conducted in June 2014 on nine reefs provided a complete picture of reef status with regard to live coral diversity, evenness of coral cover and reef health (live versus dead cover) for the Xisha Islands. Mean coral cover was 12.5% in 2014 and damaged reefs seemed to show signs of recovery. Coral cover in sheltered habitats such as lagoon patch reefs and biotic dense zones of reef flats was higher, but there were large regional differences and low diversity. In contrast, the more exposed reef slopes had high coral diversity, along with high and more equal distributions of coral cover. Mean hard coral cover of other zones was < 10%. The total Xisha reef system was estimated to cover 1 060 km(2), and the emergent reefs covered similar to 787 m(2). Hard corals of emergent reefs were considered to cover 97 km(2). The biotic dense zone of the reef flat was a very common zone on all simple atolls, especially the broader northern reef flats. The total cover of live and dead coral can reach above 70% in this zone, showing an equilibrium between live and dead coral as opposed to coral and algae. This information regarding the spatial distribution of hard coral can support and inform the management of Xisha reef ecosystems.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				MAY	2017	35	3					501	514		10.1007/s00343-017-5336-x								WOS:000399168400004

Changes in shallow-reef community composition along environmental gradients on the East African coast	MARINE BIOLOGY												Abiotic determinants of community composition on shallow reefs are seldom examined at a scale transcending biogeographic regions, and knowledge for the western Indian Ocean is sparse. To address this deficit, turnover in reef community composition was quantified, using gradient forest analyses, along gradients of nine abiotic variables collected in situ or via remote sensing at 54 sites across and within three bioregions: Tropical Western Indian Ocean (Tropical WIO), Delagoa and Natal, spanning 4800 km of east African coastline (5.2-31.1 degrees S). All oceanographic variables differed significantly among bioregions. At a scale across bioregions, wave height declined northwards, while temperature increased. Values for suspended inorganic sediments, chlorophyll-a concentration [chl-a], turbidity and nutrients were all lowest in Delagoa, in association with the scarcity of rivers there. The most novel and unexpected finding was that the northwards decline in wave action was more strongly associated with changes in community composition across bioregions than any other variable. Temperature was the second-most important variable at that scale. Within bioregions, temperature and [chl-a] had strongest relationships with community composition in the Tropical WIO. By contrast, in Delagoa, reef profile, susceptibility to sand inundation and reef heterogeneity were most strongly associated with community composition; and in Natal, depth, turbidity and suspended sediment were foremost. Variables of greatest importance within bioregions distilled to (1) those influencing food/energy supply ([chl-a], turbidity, depth and suspended sediments), which were of particular importance in the Tropical WIO and Natal bioregions, and (2) those altering sand inundation and small-scale current dynamics of reefs (profile, heterogeneity and depth), which were leading factors in the Delagoa Bioregion.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				MAY	2017	164	5							101	10.1007/s00227-017-3130-0								WOS:000399218700005

Modeling abundance, growth, and health of the solitary coral Scolymia wellsi (Mussidae) in turbid SW Atlantic coral reefs	MARINE BIOLOGY												Corals from the genus Scolymia have high-sediment-shifting capabilities and are generally associated with habitats with low light levels (shallow shaded/high-turbidity reefs and mesophotic reefs > 30 m depth). Here, the spatio-temporal dynamics in abundance, growth, and health (i.e., proportion of bleached/dead tissue) of the solitary coral Scolymia wellsi was modeled in the Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil, using boosted regression trees. Models were built using a yearly time series (2006-2008) of digital images of fixed benthic areas (photo-quadrats) and fixed S. wellsi individuals (n = 65). Samples were obtained in sites separated by up to 130 km and subjected to a wide range of biotic/abiotic conditions (as measured in situ and by remote sensing). Scolymia wellsi abundance was highest on inshore turbid reefs, although high nutrient availability (as inferred by the concentration of particulate organic carbon) and temperature were more important than turbidity (Kd(490)) itself for explaining this latter pattern. Bleaching affected mainly larger (older) individuals inhabiting inshore reefs, where S. wellsi abundance was highest, possibly reflecting natural coral senescence and/or negative density-dependent effects. Coral growth declined with size and with increased contact with turf algae/cyanobacterial mats, these latter organisms well recognized as major competitors for benthic space and coral disease facilitators. Species-specific coral population studies exploring different spatial scales (reef scale and coral scale) and a wide range of biotic/abiotic conditions may provide important insights on the ecological processes operating at the reef community and ecosystem levels.

Methods for Investigating Sediment Flux under High-Energy Conditions on the Southeast Florida Continental Shelf using Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) in a Geographic Information System (GIS) Dataframe	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Laser Airborne Depth Sounding (LADS) bathymetric surveys conducted in 2001 and 2008 bracket two hurricane landfalls (Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005) in Broward County, southeast Florida, thus providing an opportunity to investigate changes in bottom topography as a result of wave and current action. The seafloor in this region is characterized by a wide range of sedimentary features that are normally stabilized (held in place) by outcrops of carbonate bedrock and coral reefs. During high-energy events, however, the sedimentary deposits are partially mobilized by waves and currents. This methodological study used the two LADS bathymetric surveys to construct triangulated irregular networks (TINs, which are a digital means of representing surface morphology) surfaces using the ESRI (R) ArcGIS 3D Analyst extension. The two bathymetric TIN surfaces were compared to ascertain spatial gains and losses by landform. Comparison of TIN surfaces provides a means to estimate changes in sediment volume and infer variability in cross-shore sediment transport. Application of this methodological procedure is constrained to locations where seafloor features have been interpreted from the LADS bathymetry so that sediment volume changes can be related to specific landform units.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2017	33	2					452	462		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16A-00014.1								WOS:000397355700019

In recent years, methods based on radiative transfer model inversion have shown promising results for extracting information about seabed type, bottom depth and water constituents from hyperspectral imagery. However, low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to low water-leaving radiance combined with environmental variability make it very difficult to design an optimal processing algorithm. Here, we selected a state-of-the-art, forward semi-analytical model in which we included a mixing model of four seabed albedo, namely sand, corals, algae and seagrass. The purpose of this paper was then to compare different setups of the inversion scheme, each one having its own theoretical strengths and weaknesses regarding the different confounding factors. Six inversion setups were implemented, corresponding to the combinations between (i) three cost functions: least square (LS), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and least square on spectral derivative (LSD), and (ii) two physical constraints imposed on the seabed type retrieval: abundance sum-to-one constraint (ASC) and a relaxed version (RASC). Performances of bathymetry and seabed type retrieval were evaluated on hyperspectral data acquired in a coral reef environment in Reunion Island. Our results showed that the accuracy and robustness of the bathymetric estimation were greatly influenced by the choice of the inversion setup. RASC-LSD produced the overall best performances even if SAM-based inversion setups showed particularly low error dispersion with respect to Lidar derived bathymetry. RASC-LSD also produced the most accurate results in terms of spatial coverage of benthic components on a very shallow area (inner part of a fringing reef). The results on our study areas clearly highlighted the interest of relaxing the ASC when the bottom depth is shallow. In deeper areas, ASC versions of LS- and LSD-based inversion setups produced the best seabed type mapping results. Only broad seabed types could be retrieved in areas deeper than 10 m.

Trade-offs between data resolution, accuracy, and cost when choosing information to plan reserves for coral reef ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conservation planners must reconcile trade-offs associated with using biodiversity data of differing qualities to make decisions. Coarse habitat classifications are commonly used as surrogates to design marine reserve networks when fine-scale biodiversity data are incomplete or unavailable. Although finely-classified habitat maps provide more detail, they may have more misclassification errors, a common problem when remotely-sensed imagery is used. Despite these issues, planners rarely consider the effects of errors when choosing data for spatially explicit conservation prioritizations. Here we evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and resolution of hierarchical coral reef habitat data (geomorphology and benthic substrate) derived from remote sensing, in spatial planning for Kubulau District, Fiji. For both, we use accuracy information describing the probability that a mapped habitat classification is correct to design marine reserve networks that achieve habitat conservation targets, and demonstrate inadequacies of using habitat maps without accuracy data. We show that using more detailed habitat information ensures better representation of biogenic habitats (i.e. coral and seagrass), but leads to larger and more costly reserves, because these data have more misclassification errors, and are also more expensive to obtain. Reduced impacts on fishers are possible using coarsely-classified data, which are also more cost-effective for planning reserves if we account for data collection costs, but using these data may under-represent reef habitats that are important for fisheries and biodiversity, due to the maps low thematic resolution. Finally, we show that explicitly accounting for accuracy information in decisions maximizes the chance of successful conservation outcomes by reducing the risk of missing conservation representation targets, particularly when using finely classified data.

Potential impacts of land use change dynamics and submarine groundwater discharge on fringing reefs of Kuroshima Island, Japan	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The land based sources of pollution are major threat to the reef ecosystems; therefore, it is important to ascertain the temporal and spatial change pattern of coral cover at local scale to understand the causal links between reef degradation and ground discharge impact with changing land use practices. The land use change dynamics and its impacts on surrounding reefs were investigated using aerial photographs of 1977, 1994 and 2005 of Kuroshima Island, Japan by integrating remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) approach. And the impact of groundwater associated nutrient discharge was estimated using Rn-222(radon) as an SGD (submarine groundwater discharge) tracer. Findings indicate that the land used for grazing has increased (597%) during the study period and most of this increase has been at the expense of forest and shrub land. The landscape development intensity (LDI) index, was used to evaluate the impact of land driven activities on coral assemblages. LDI results infer that north-eastern watershed (2.84), south-eastern watershed (3.02) and north-western watersheds (2.75 to 2.88) are most critical watersheds with higher LDI in comparison to other watersheds due to the enormous increase in pasture land. The benthic cover change analysis indicates the overgrowth of seagrass (99.5%) and microalgal productivity (99.6%) especially in the northern, western and southeastern part of the Island during 1977 to 2005. The groundwater discharge with high concentration of land-derived nutrients was observed as the main source for the reduction in coral cover around Kuroshima island.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					245	254		10.1007/s11852-017-0495-7								WOS:000399030200022						
J	Pu, R; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Because the depth of shallow water is changeable by the sediment deposition and the ocean waves, the periodic monitoring at shoe area is needed. Utilization of satellite images are well matched for widely and repeatedly monitoring at sea area. Sea bottom terrain model using by remote sensing data have been developed and these methods based on the radiative transfer model of the sun irradiance which is affected by the atmosphere, water, and sea bottom. We adopted that general method of the sea depth extraction to the satellite imagery, WorldView-2; which has very fine spatial resolution (50cm/pix) and eight bands at visible to near-infrared wavelengths. From high-spatial resolution satellite images, there is possibility to know the coral reefs and the rock area's detail terrain model which offers important information for the amphibious landing. In addition, the WorldView-2 satellite sensor has the band at near the ultraviolet wavelength that is transmitted through the water. On the other hand, the previous study showed that the estimation error by the satellite imagery was related to the sea bottom materials such as sand, coral reef, sea alga, and rocks. Therefore, in this study, we focused on sea bottom materials, and tried to improve the depth estimation accuracy. First, we classified the sea bottom materials by the SVM method, which used the depth data acquired by multi-beam sonar as supervised data. Then correction values in the depth estimation equation were calculated applying the classification results. As a result, the classification accuracy of sea bottom materials was 93%, and the depth estimation error using the correction by the classification result was within 1.2m.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042208	10.1117/12.2280305								WOS:000418795400005						
J	Nayak, S				Nayak, Shailesh			Coastal zone management in India - present status and future needs	GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												The coastal zone is a region where land, ocean and atmosphere interact and hence it is dynamic in nature. India has a long coastline which was not adequately monitored until the advent of the satellite remote sensing era in the 70s. India has a very robust remote sensing program that the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) series of satellites were effectively used to monitor coastal habitats, landforms, shoreline, water quality, etc., and changes were identified during the last 40 years. The classification system for coastal habitats and the classification and geometric accuracies of products were standardized. Detailed information for mangroves communities and characteristics of coral reefs were generated. The high and low tide lines were delineated seamlessly for the entire coastline using satellite data. All these data were organized in a GIS and the coastal database for the entire country was created. Impacts of various hazards on such as cyclones, tsunami and sea level changes on coastal habitats were documented. Based on topography, shoreline changes and tides, coastal multi-hazard vulnerability maps were characterized by employing the elevation data derived from satellite data and were prepared for the coastline of India. The information on ocean color and sea surface temperature was used to generate potential fishery advisories, which are provided daily to fishermen. The coastal database was utilized effectively to identify coastal regulation zones, marine protected areas, vulnerable zones, etc. Various services for tsunami, fishery and coral reef bleaching were generated for societal benefits. It is planned to develop models for the coastal zone, so that impeding dangers and likely changes in the coastal zone can be predicted and suitable actions can be undertaken. It is necessary to integrate socio-economic data with the knowledge database of coastal zone to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities and the changing climate on the coastal zone.																	1009-5020	1993-5153					2017	20	2			SI		174	183		10.1080/10095020.2017.1333715								WOS:000409348200011

A fundamental challenge to remotely sensed mapping of coastal shallow waters is due to the significant disparity in the optical properties of the water column caused by the interaction between the coast and the sea. The objects to be classified have weak signals that interact with turbid waters that include sediments. In real scenarios, the absorption and backscattering coefficients are unknown with different sources of variability (river discharges and coastal interactions). Under normal circumstances, another unknown variable is the depth of shallow waters. This paper presents the development of algorithms for retrieving information and its application to the classification and mapping of objects under coastal shallow waters with different unknown concentrations of sediments. A mathematical model that simplifies the radiative transfer equation was used to quantify the interaction between the object of interest, the medium and the sensor. The retrieval of information requires the development of mathematical models and processing tools in the area of inversion, image reconstruction and classification of hyperspectral data. The algorithms developed were applied to one set of real hyperspectral imagery taken in a tank filled with water and TiO2 that emulates turbid coastal shallow waters. Tikhonov method of regularization was used in the inversion process to estimate the bottom albedo of the water tank using a priori information in the form of stored spectral signatures, previously measured, of objects of interest.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0897-9; 978-1-5106-0898-6				2017	10198								UNSP 1019818	10.1117/12.2262760								WOS:000404782800038

Geoform and Landform Classification of Continental Shelves using Geospatially Integrated IKONOS Satellite Imagery	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Geomorphological characterization of coastal environments along continental shelves depends on accurate interpretation of mesoscale lithic and elastic benthic geoforms and landforms. Using the Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS), cognitive visual interpretations of seafloor geoforms and their associated landforms were conducted along a diverse segment of the southeast (SE) Florida continental shelf. GeoEye IKONOS-2 satellite imagery provided the remotely sensed visual medium on which interpretations were based. With ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software, classification maps were created from the cognitive interpretations to show spatial distribution results of geoform and landform features throughout the study area. Additionally, smaller-scale "call-out figures" documented specific geomorphological associations among the classified units. Analysis attribute tables compared and contrasted the abundance (i.e. number of classifying vector polygons) and calculated areas for each geoform and landform classified. It was determined that classification of geoform and landform benthic features along continental shelves can be achieved where water clarity conditions allow for the cognitive visual interpretation of such seafloor formations. Future studies may build upon the classification of continental shelf geoforms and landforms to integrate more transient biogeomorphological features of the marine environment (e.g., sediment distribution, biological species identification, density of flora and fauna present), thus creating a more detailed and inclusive classification of a selected coastal region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					1	22		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16A-00003.1								WOS:000394926100001

Hydrodynamic influences on acoustical and optical backscatter in a fringing reef environment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Observations of hydrodynamics along with optical and acoustical water characteristics in a tropical fringing reef environment reveal a distinct signature associated with flow characteristics and tidal conditions. Flow conditions are dominated by tidal forcing with an offshore component from the reef flat during ebb. Measurements span variable wave conditions enabling identification of wave effects on optical and acoustical water properties. High-frequency acoustic backscatter (6 MHz) is strongly correlated with tidal forcing increasing with offshore directed flow and modulated by wave height, indicating dominant hydrodynamic influence. Backscatter at 300 and 1200 kHz is predominantly diurnal suggesting a biological component. Optical backscatter is closely correlated with high-frequency acoustic backscatter across the range of study conditions. Acoustic backscatter frequency dependence is used along with changes in optical properties to interpret particle-size variations. Changes across wave heights suggest shifts in particle-size distributions with increases in relative concentrations of smaller particles for larger wave conditions. Establishing a connection between the physical processes of a fringing tropical reef and the resulting acoustical and optical signals allows for interpretation and forecasting of the remote sensing response of these phenomena over larger scales.

Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The size spectrum of an ecological community characterizes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size. Size spectra are often used as ecosystem indicators of marine systems. They have been fitted to data from various sources, including groundfish trawl surveys, visual surveys of fish in kelp forests and coral reefs, sediment samples of benthic invertebrates and satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll. Over the past decades, several methods have been used to fit size spectra to data. We document eight such methods, demonstrating their commonalities and differences. Seven methods use linear regression (of which six require binning of data), while the eighth uses maximum likelihood estimation. We test the accuracy of the methods on simulated data. We demonstrate that estimated size-spectrum slopes are not always comparable between the seven regression-based methods because such methods are not estimating the same parameter. We find that four of the eight tested methods can sometimes give reasonably accurate estimates of the exponent of the individual size distribution (which is related to the slope of the size spectrum). However, sensitivity analyses find that maximum likelihood estimation is the only method that is consistently accurate, and the only one that yields reliable confidence intervals for the exponent. We therefore recommend the use of maximum likelihood estimation when fitting size spectra. To facilitate this, we provide documented R code for fitting and plotting results. This should provide consistency in future studies and improve the quality of any resulting advice to ecosystem managers. In particular, the calculation of reliable confidence intervals will allow proper consideration of uncertainty when making management decisions.

J	Mohamed, H; Negm, A; Salah, M; Nadaoka, K; Zahran, M				Mohamed, Hassan; Negm, Abdelazim; Salah, Mahmoud; Nadaoka, Kazuo; Zahran, Mohamed			Assessment of proposed approaches for bathymetry calculations using multispectral satellite images in shallow coastal/lake areas: a comparison of five models	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Bathymetric information for shallow coastal/lake areas is essential for hydrological engineering applications such as sedimentary processes and coastal studies. Remotely sensed imagery is considered a time-effective, low-cost, and wide-coverage solution for bathymetric measurements. This study assesses the performance of three proposed empirical models for bathymetry calculations in three different areas: Alexandria port, Egypt, as an example of a low-turbidity deep water area with silt-sand bottom cover and a depth range of 10.5 m; the Lake Nubia entrance zone, Sudan, which is a highly turbid, unstable, clay bottom area with water depths to 6 m; and Shiraho, Ishigaki Island, Japan, a coral reef area with varied depths ranging up to 14 m. The proposed models are the ensemble regression tree-fitting algorithm using bagging (BAG), ensemble regression tree-fitting algorithm of least squares boosting (LSB), and support vector regression algorithm (SVR). Data from Landsat 8 and Spot 6 satellite images were used to assess the performance of the proposed models. The three models were used to obtain bathymetric maps using the reflectance of green, red, blue/red, and green/red band ratios. The results were compared with corresponding results yielded by two conventional empirical methods, the neural network (NN) and the Lyzenga generalised linear model (GLM). Compared with echosounder data, BAG, LSB, and SVR results demonstrate higher accuracy ranges from 0.04 to 0.35 m more than Lyzenga GLM. The BAG algorithm, producing the most accurate results, proved to be the preferable algorithm for bathymetry calculation.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JAN	2017	10	2							42	10.1007/s12517-016-2803-1								WOS:000392065200022						
J	Freeman, LA; Freeman, SE				Freeman, Lauren A.; Freeman, Simon E.			Rapidly obtained ecosystem indicators from coral reef soundscapes	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Present-day coral reef ecosystem monitoring techniques can be costly, labor-intensive point measurements that can potentially introduce intractable sampling bias and error. Here we report correlations between visually obtained ecological assessment metrics and concurrently recorded aspects of the underwater biological soundscape over coral reefs at 23 sites spanning the Hawaiian Islands archipelago. Sites from the 'cool tropics' oceanographic habitat grouped along a principal component defined by an acoustic sliding scale: from protected or more remote sites at which lower frequencies were more dominant, to degraded sites which produced soundscapes dominated by higher frequency sound. Positive correlations between ambient biological sounds below 2 kHz and the density of benthic invertebrates (Pearson's rho = 0.61-0.76), their predators (rho = 0.65-0.8), organism-scale bathymetric complexity (rho = 0.6-0.62) and the quantity of crustose coralline algae (rho = 0.6-0.62) suggest a connection between this part of the spectrum, habitat complexity and the density of benthic fauna. A positive correlation was also observed between the daytime soundscape in the 2 to 20 kHz band and the proportion of benthic fleshy macroalgal cover (rho = 0.63-0.7), an indicator of reef degradation. This study indicates the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and spatially integrative remote sensing of the ecological state of coral reefs. Such quantitative methods could be used to ecologically assess vast areas of reef habitat autonomously in near real-time and could be important for remote in situ detection and characterization of subtle but significant ecological changes brought about by climate change and other more localized anthropogenic impacts.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				DEC 15	2016	561						69	82		10.3354/meps11938								WOS:000391695800005

Geomorphology and late Holocene accretion history of Adele Reef: a northwest Australian mid-shelf platform reef	GEO-MARINE LETTERS												The mid-shelf reefs of the Kimberley Bioregion are one of Australia's more remote tropical reef provinces and such have received little attention from reef researchers. This study describes the geomorphology and late Holocene accretion history of Adele Reef, a mid-shelf platform reef, through remote sensing of contemporary reef habitats, shallow seismic profiling, shallow percussion coring and radiocarbon dating. Seismic profiling indicates that the Holocene reef sequence is 25 to 35 m thick and overlies at least three earlier stages of reef build-up, interpreted as deposited during marine isotope stages 5, 7 and 9 respectively. The cored shallow subsurface facies of Adele Reef are predominantly detrital, comprising small coral colonies and fragments in a sandy matrix. Reef cores indicate a 'catch-up' growth pattern, with the reef flat being approximately 5-10 m deep when sea level stabilised at its present elevation 6,500 years BP. The reef flat is rimmed by a broad low-relief reef crest only 10-20 cm high, characterised by anastomosing ridges of rhodoliths and coralliths. The depth of the Holocene/last interglacial contact (25-30 m) suggests a subsidence rate of 0.2 mm/year for Adele Reef since the last interglacial. This value, incorporated with subsidence rates from Cockatoo Island (inshore) and Scott Reefs (offshore), provides the first quantitative estimate of hinge subsidence for the Kimberley coast and adjacent shelf, with progressively greater subsidence across the shelf.

J	Rankey, EC				Rankey, Eugene C.			On facies belts and facies mosaics: Holocene isolated platforms, South China Sea	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Although the general criteria for recognition and environmental interpretation of different carbonate facies are well-established, a predictive understanding of the areal extent and spatial patterning of facies bodies and why they might organize into facies belts or facies mosaics is poorly constrained. To explore patterns and process dynamics of facies on isolated carbonate platforms, quantitative analysis of thematic maps derived from remote sensing images of 27 Holocene atolls of the Paracel and Spratly chains in the South China Sea explores variability within and among platforms. On these systems, most annular shelf-margin reefs are less than 500 m wide on both chains; inboard of the reefs, reef sand aprons range up to 500 m (Spratlys) and 1000 m (Paracels) wide. Around individual platforms, Spratly Chain sand apron widths are wider to the north-west, whereas apron widths in the Paracel Chain are more symmetrical; collectively, data indicate log-normal width-exceedance probability distributions. Platform-interior patch reefs include area-exceedance probability distributions and gap size distributions (lacunarity) consistent within chains, but distinct between the chains. To understand the processes underlying distinct distributions, simulations explored distinct growth scenarios. Results suggest that differences may represent distinct process classes: proportional growth processes with multiplicative random effects (reef sand aprons -belts), versus non-linear, size-proportional growth of randomly aged and distributed elements (patch reefs - mosaics). The probabilistically distinct sizes and spatial patterns of geomorphic elements within these general process classes are interpreted to represent 'variations on themes' related to the different impacts of tropical storms, winter cold fronts and circulation in each chain. The results highlight fundamentally different growth patterns impacting the sizes and distribution of facies belts and mosaics on isolated carbonate platforms. Because these types of bodies ultimately construct stratigraphy, the themes could be applied to understand and predict variability in the architecture of subsurface reservoir analogues.

A confounding regional warm-water mass bleaching event followed by a coral disease outbreak during this same time frame made the assessment of dredging-related impacts to coral reefs adjacent to the federal channel difficult but still feasible. The current study sought to better understand the sedimentation impacts that occurred in the coral reef environment surrounding Port from of Miami, to distinguish those impacts other regional events or disturbances, and provide supplemental information on impact assessment that will inform discussions on compensatory mitigation requirements. To this end, in water field assessments conducted after the completion of dredging and a time series analysis of tagged corals photographed pre-, during, and post-dredging, are used to discern dredging-related sedimentation impacts for the Inner Reef north. Results indicate increased sediment accumulation, severe in certain times and places, and an associated biological response (e.g., higher prevalence of partial mortality of corals) extended up to 700 m from the channel, whereas project-associated monitoring was limited to 50 m from the channel. These results can contribute to more realistic prediction of areas of indirect effect from dredging projects needed to accurately evaluate proposed projects and design appropriate compliance monitoring. Dredging projects near valuable and sensitive habitats subject to local and global stressors require monitoring methods capable of discerning non-dredging related impacts and adaptive management to ensure predicted and unpredicted project-related impacts are quantified. Anticipated increasing frequency and intensity of seasonal warming stress also suggests that manageable-but-unavoidable local stressors such as dredging should be partitioned from such seasonal thermal stress events.																	2167-8359					NOV 17	2016	4								e2711	10.7717/peerj.2711								WOS:000388425600006	27896036

However, the use of these data for near-shore habitats is hindered by the proximity of the coast, therefore further investigation is needed. We compared remote-sensing SST from the MODIS sensor (aboard the Aqua satellite) to near-shore seawater temperature (ST) recorded in situ with data loggers at 5 locations in the western Mediterranean Sea. In situ ST data were collected at 5 m depth over a similar to 6 yr period and at depths below 5 m at 3 of the locations. We evaluated the suitability of MODIS to represent the temperature at shallow subtidal depths relative to different modes of variability. MODIS reproduced seasonal variability with high correlations (r > 0.98) and biases (0.59 +/- 0.03 degrees C) only slightly higher than the accuracy of the loggers (0.50 degrees C). MODIS also captured interannual variability with no systematic biases. When evaluated for intra-seasonal temperature variability, MODIS showed limited biases (up to 0.79 degrees C) with a tendency to overestimate the variability (between 4 and 64%) in both cold and warm seasons. Finally, MODIS over-/underestimated only the most extreme unseasonably cold/warm events (by 1.51 and -0.79 degrees C, respectively). The observed limited differences between the 2 methods can be explained by the particular hydro dynamics of the area and by methodological constraints. Overall, MODIS SST data proved to be a reliable proxy for near-shore ST in the western Mediterranean Sea, and are thus considered suitable for studies requiring temperature reconstruction in shallow near-shore environments.

ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Maps that depict the distribution of substrate, habitat or biotope types on the seabed are in increasing demand by marine ecologists and spatial planners, underpinning decision making in relation to marine spatial planning and marine protected area network design. Yet, the science discipline of image-based seabed mapping has not fully matured and rapid progress is needed to improve the reliability and accuracy of maps. To speed up the process we have conducted a literature review of common practices in terrestrial image classification based on remote sensing data, a related discipline, albeit with a larger scientific community and longer history. We identified the following key elements of a mapping workflow: (i) Data pre-processing, (ii) Feature extraction, (iii) Feature selection, (iv) Classification, (v) Post-classification enhancements, and (vi) Evaluation of classification performance. Insights gained from the review served as a baseline against which recent seabed mapping studies were compared. In this way we identified knowledge gaps and propose modifications to the mapping workflow. A main concern in current seabed mapping practice is that a large amount of often correlated predictor features is extracted, creating a multidimensional feature space. To effectively fill this space with an appropriate amount of training samples is likely to be impossible. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space via data transformation [e.g. principal component analysis (PCA)] or feature selection and remove correlated features. We propose to make dimensionality reduction an integral part of any mapping workflow. We also suggest to adopt recommendations for accuracy assessment originally drawn up for terrestrial land cover mapping. These include the publication of two or more measures of accuracy including overall and class-specific metrics, publication of associated confidence limits and the provision of the error matrix.

Remote-Sensed Mapping of Sargassum spp. Distribution around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, Using High-Spatial Resolution WorldView-2 Satellite Data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Satellite remote sensing is one of the most efficient techniques for marine habitat studies in shallow coastal waters, especially in clear waters where field observations can be easily carried out. However, such in situ observations have certain limitations: they are time consuming, have a limited ability to capture spatial variability, and require an interdisciplinary approach between marine biologists and remote-sensing specialists. The main objective of this study was to survey and map Sargassum beds around Rottnest Island, Western Australia, through a combination of high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery, using a validated depth invariant index model for water-column correction, and in-field observations. The combination of field survey data and four classification methods resulted in highly accurate classification outcomes that showed the distribution patterns of Sargassum spp. around Rottnest Island during the austral spring season (October 2013). Overall, the minimum distance and Mahalanobis classifiers yielded the highest overall accuracy rates of 98.32% (kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 98.30% (kappa = 0.96), respectively. The K-means classification method gave the lowest accuracy percentage of 42.50% (kappa = 0.22). Thus, the primary results of this study provide useful baseline information that is necessary for marine-conservation strategic planning and the sustainable utilization of brown macroalgae resources around the Western Australian coast.

The area of the island almost doubled after a mass coral bleaching event in 1998. Coral branches generated by the mass mortality and broken by waves were delivered and stocked on a reef flat and accumulated to expand the area of the island. In 2012 high waves generated by typhoons also changed the island's topography. Overall, the island moved in the downdrift direction of the higher waves. Waves impacting both sides of the island piled up a large volume of coral gravels above the high-tide level. Ecor-geomorphic processes, including a supply of calcareous materials from the corals on the same reef especially during stormy wave conditions, were key factors in maintaining the dynamic topographic features of this small coral reef island.

In this study, a total of 50 Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images were used to analyze the geological features and spectral characteristics of the Nansha reefs. The exposed islands/sandbanks, reef flats and sub-tidal reefs were identified with the near-infrared band, the red and green bands, and the blue band, respectively. Based on the relationships among various characteristics and bands illustrated in the OLI images, the maximum between-cluster variance threshold algorithm (OTSU method) and the mathematical morphology were employed to extract characteristic parameters of the spatial geometry of the reefs from top to bottom, which were subsequently operated by a series of post-processing methods such as vectorization, simplification and topological analysis. Among the 132 standalone reefs and 16 atolls that are identified in the study, four reefs have yet to be named in the Standard Names of Various Islands in the South China Sea and the website Nansha Islands Online (http://www.nansha.org/). Another 24 ones are exposed to the atmosphere even during high tides. Taiping Island with an area of 0.57 km(2) represents the largest exposed geological feature. This study demonstrated the applicability of medium-resolution satellite images to derive the coral reef information effectively and thus provided information for the related departments that are responsible to manage the coast. An improved resolution of multispectral bands with the panchromatic band in higher spatial resolution (15 m for OLI image) is expected to provide an optimum satellite based approach to map marine habitats.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				OCT	2016	35	10					11	19		10.1007/s13131-016-0898-6								WOS:000385152000002

Geomorphic changes of a coral shingle cay measured using Kite Aerial Photography	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Measurements of geomorphic change in the intertidal zones of coral reefs are made using a variety of remote sensing and in-situ techniques, where variations in the coverage and spatial-temporal precision achieved are directly related to the cost of data acquisition. We present a novel, low-cost technique for measuring high resolution changes in reef environments based on Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) and photogrammetry/structure-from-motion post-processing. KAP images are used to measure fine-scale changes in intertidal topography and sediment texture characteristics, including rubble particle size, of a coral shingle cay at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef in the context of storm activity. Validation using Real Time Kinematic DGPS demonstrates the ability to measure topographic elevation with an error of 5.53 cm (RMSE) and a spatial resolution of 5 cm per point, an accuracy/resolution that is superior to airborne LiDAR and equivalent to terrestrial LiDAR, but at a fraction of the equipment cost.

Drones that see through waves - preliminary results from airborne fluid lensing for centimetre-scale aquatic conservation	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS					6th IUCN World Parks Congress	NOV, 2014	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	IUCN				1. The use of fluid lensing technology on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) is presented as a novel means for 3D imaging of aquatic ecosystems from above the water's surface at the centimetre scale. Preliminary results are presented from airborne fluid lensing campaigns conducted over the coral reefs of Ofu Island, American Samoa (2013) and the stromatolite reefs of Shark Bay, Western Australia (2014), covering a combined area of 15 km(2). These reef ecosystems were revealed with centimetre-scale 2D resolution, and an accompanying 3D bathymetry model was derived using fluid lensing, Structure from Motion and UAV position data. Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry. 2. Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to similar to 10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters. 3. The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or 'reef scale' relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.

Synthesis and Crosscutting Topics	OCEANOGRAPHY												In recent years, there have been significant advances in fluid dynamics/physical oceanography, microbiology, weathering, remote sensing, and analytical chemistry as they pertain to the fate and effects of oil spills. Effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on water column organisms and ecosystems have been difficult to ascertain. Laboratory experiments have expanded understanding of oil effects on phytoplankton and zooplankton. "Marine oil snow" has been identified as a significant factor in the fate of oil chemicals and their deposition with sediments. Oil chemicals and their effects on 24 km(2) of mud-benthic communities surrounding the well site, and in a few other areas, have lasted several years. Some deep-sea corals have also been affected for several years, and oil chemicals and their effects in heavily oiled marsh areas are projected to last a decade or longer. Lightly oiled marsh areas have recovered or are recovering. Research about use of dispersants highlights the need to update the 2005 National Research Council study of dispersant use on oil spills. Ongoing research should provide some closure for the issues of long-term effects on fisheries and marine mammals, and impacts on human health. Practical uses of this new knowledge are discussed briefly.																	1042-8275					SEP	2016	29	3			SI		204	213		10.5670/oceanog.2016.84								WOS:000382334500026						
J	Kordi, MN; O'Leary, M				Kordi, Moataz N.; O'Leary, Michael			Geomorphic classification of coral reefs in the north western Australian shelf	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Coral reefs occur extensively along the northwest Australian continental shelf in the Kimberley Bioregion (KIM), forming major geomorphic features along and just off the coast. These reefs have not been studied in as much detail as the offshore reefs and are poorly known due to the coastal conditions, including extremely high tide regimes, high turbidity and complex coastline morphology. This study aims to establish a regional-scale distribution map of exposed and intertidal reefs of the KIM and to classify the Kimberley reefs into types, adopting widely recognised reef classification and typology schemes. Remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used in this study to process and produce digital maps as well as to provide some of the first detailed spatial analysis of reef distribution. Outcomes of this study showed that the Kimberley reefs possess strong morphological complexity and clear regional patterns. The study revealed that the number of Kimberley reefs and their area are considerably (60%) greater than previously thought; the total combined reefal area is approximately 1,950 km(2). Fringing reefs have been identified as the dominant reef type and are widely distributed throughout the KIM. It was also found that tidal range affected the distribution of reef geomorphologies. The outcomes of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the Kimberley reefs, and provide marine park managers with essential and quality scientific information so that better management decisions can be made in this area.

As marine ecosystems degrade, so do the well-being and livelihoods of humans that depend directly on the ecosystem goods and services they provide. Marine protected areas have been proposed to protect biodiversity, restore damaged ecosystems, sustain fisheries, and rebuild overexploited stocks. The effectiveness of marine protected areas depends in part on their effectiveness as connected networks, linked over large areas by ecological processes such as larval dispersal. Here, we applied a biophysical model driven by ocean currents derived from satellite altimetry to evaluate connectivity between Western Indian Ocean reefs. We applied graph-theoretic analysis, including clustering and a betweenness centrality metric. Our results show high interconnectivity within several regions (Mozambique Channel, Mascarene archipelago) and lower connectivity across the WIO region. We compared the results with the current MPA network, and proposed sites/reefs that should be considered priority sites for MPA implementation: Pebane, Cosmoledo, Majunga, Masoarivo, Platte Island, Farquhar, Agalega and Geyser bank. Our results are timely, considering the oil and gas exploration that is ongoing in the region. We discuss implications for transboundary marine policies and regional cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean, and advocate the creation of a regional-scale organization to structure interactions among the different actors.

A review of marine geomorphometry, the quantitative study of the seafloor	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Geomorphometry, the science of quantitative terrain characterization, has traditionally focused on the investigation of terrestrial landscapes. However, the dramatic increase in the availability of digital bathymetric data and the increasing ease by which geomorphometry can be investigated using geographic information systems (GISs) and spatial analysis software has prompted interest in employing geomorphometric techniques to investigate the marine environment. Over the last decade or so, a multitude of geomorphometric techniques (e.g. terrain attributes, feature extraction, automated classification) have been applied to characterize seabed terrain from the coastal zone to the deep sea. Geomorphometric techniques are, however, not as varied, nor as extensively applied, in marine as they are in terrestrial environments. This is at least partly due to difficulties associated with capturing, classifying, and validating terrain characteristics underwater. There is, nevertheless, much common ground between terrestrial and marine geomorphometry applications and it is important that, in developing marine geomorphometry, we learn from experiences in terrestrial studies. However, not all terrestrial solutions can be adopted by marine geomorphometric studies since the dynamic, four-dimensional (4-D) nature of the marine environment causes its own issues throughout the geomorphometry workflow. For instance, issues with underwater positioning, variations in sound velocity in the water column affecting acoustic-based mapping, and our inability to directly observe and measure depth and morphological features on the seafloor are all issues specific to the application of geomorphometry in the marine environment. Such issues fuel the need for a dedicated scientific effort in marine geomorphometry. This review aims to highlight the relatively recent growth of marine geomorphometry as a distinct discipline, and offers the first comprehensive overview of marine geomorphometry to date. We address all the five main steps of geomorphometry, from data collection to the application of terrain attributes and features. We focus on how these steps are relevant to marine geomorphometry and also highlight differences and similarities from terrestrial geomorphometry. We conclude with recommendations and reflections on the future of marine geomorphometry. To ensure that geomorphometry is used and developed to its full potential, there is a need to increase awareness of (1) marine geomorphometry amongst scientists already engaged in terrestrial geomorphometry, and of (2) geomorphometry as a science amongst marine scientists with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.

The present study aims to evaluate the potential of DubaiSat-2 imagery in mapping corals and benthic habitat in the vicinity of Dalma Island, United Arab Emirates (UAE). To do so, this study proposes a spectral-spatial method that uses a combination of different remote sensing techniques in order to discern benthic communities with reference to their spatial distribution. This method involves multi-level segmentation, non-linear feature analysis and ensemble learning methods for the characterization of corals, benthic classes and underlying seabeds. Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest, pixel-based methods, were also used for comparison of classification performances. Comparative data are derived from published marine habitat maps. The spectral-spatial method achieves 96.60% overall accuracy. Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest classification methods are assessed to be 92.59% and 94.52% accurate, respectively. The application of the proposed method and the use of DubaiSat-2 imagery can help in achieving well-designed coastal management plans in the region.

A morphometric assessment and classification of coral reef spur and groove morphology	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Spurs and grooves (SaGs) are a common and important feature of coral reef fore slopes worldwide. However, they are difficult to access and hence their morphodynamics and formation are poorly understood. We use remote sensing, with extensive ground truthing, to measure SaG morphometrics and environmental factors at 11,430 grooves across 17 reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We revealed strong positive correlations between groove length, orientation and wave exposure with longer, more closely-spaced grooves oriented easterly reflecting the dominant swell regime. Wave exposure was found to be the most important factor controlling SaG distribution and morphology. Gradient of the upper reef slope was also an important limiting factor, with SaGs less likely to develop in steeply sloping (>5 degrees) areas. We used a subset of the morphometric data (11 reefs) to statistically define four classes of SaG. This classification scheme was tested on the remaining six reefs. SaGs in the four classes differ in morphology, groove substrate and coral cover. These differences provide insights into SaG formation mechanisms with implications to reef platform growth and evolution. We hypothesize SaG formation is dominated by coral growth processes at two classes and erosion processes at one class. A fourth class may represent relic features formed earlier in the Holocene transgression. The classes are comparable with SaGs elsewhere, suggesting the classification could be applied globally with the addition of new classes if necessary. While further research is required, we show remotely sensed SaG morphometrics can provide useful insights into reef platform evolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Affine invariant features matching (AIFM) method, combining maximally stable extremal region (MSER) detector and scale invariant feature transformation (SIFT) descriptor, followed by optimizing using RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC), still cannot lead to satisfactory results of image registration. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical filtering strategy for image registration, which is composed of two stages. Filter 1, constructed based on a geometric transformation model determined by the corresponding contours of coral reefs, is employed to remove the wrong matching pairs which obviously dissatisfy spatial distributions of matching features. Based on the filtering results of Filters 1 and 2, with an appropriate threshold value determined by overlapping ratio of the corresponding coral reefs, can lead to further optimized results for image registration. This threshold is used to filter all erroneous matching pairs, while retaining as many correct matching pairs as possible. To test the effect of these filters, we design two experiments to compare the four approaches: AIFM without filtering, AIFM with Filter 1, AIFM with Filter 2, and AIFM with hierarchical filtering (Filter 1 + Filter 2). The experimental results demonstrate that the approach with hierarchical filtering performs much better than the other approaches.

J	Legleiter, CJ; Stegman, TK; Overstreet, BT				Legleiter, Carl J.; Stegman, Tobin K.; Overstreet, Brandon T.			Spectrally based mapping of riverbed composition	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Remote sensing methods provide an efficient means of characterizing fluvial systems. This study evaluated the potential to map riverbed composition based on in situ and/or remote measurements of reflectance. Field spectra and substrate photos from the Snake River, Wyoming, USA, were used to identify different sediment facies and degrees of algal development and to quantify their optical characteristics. We hypothesized that accounting for the effects of depth and water column attenuation to isolate the reflectance of the streambed would enhance distinctions among bottom types and facilitate substrate classification. A bottom reflectance retrieval algorithm adapted from coastal research yielded realistic spectra for the 450 to 700 nm range; but bottom reflectance based substrate classifications, generated using a random forest technique, were no more accurate than classifications derived from above-water field spectra. Additional hypothesis testing indicated that a combination of reflectance magnitude (brightness) and indices of spectral shape provided the most accurate riverbed classifications. Convolving field spectra to the response functions of a multispectral satellite and a hyperspectral imaging system did not reduce classification accuracies, implying that high spectral resolution was not essential. Supervised classifications of algal density produced from hyperspectral data and an inferred bottom reflectance image were not highly accurate, but unsupervised classification of the bottom reflectance image revealed distinct spectrally based clusters, suggesting that such an image could provide additional river information. We attribute the failure of bottom reflectance retrieval to yield more reliable substrate maps to a latent correlation between depth and bottom type. Accounting for the effects of depth might have eliminated a key distinction among substrates and thus reduced discriminatory power. Although further, more systematic study across a broader range of fluvial environments is needed to substantiate our initial results, this case study suggests that bed composition in shallow, clear-flowing rivers potentially could be mapped remotely.

Previous studies have been conducted on a broad scale, but no geomorphological, surface substrate and habitat maps of the reefs have been produced. Such maps would provide researchers and coastal zone managers with significant information and estimations of reef growth and productivity. The primary aim of this study was to obtain detailed information on reefs in the Kimberley bioregion. This study used remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as multiple other data sources, to map reef geomorphic zones and the associated key habitats and substrate types of shallow nearshore reefs. Despite the macrotidal regimes and the turbid waters of the study area, remote sensing was effectively used to identify the dominant habitats and substrate types of eight reef platforms. This study provides long-term quantitative assessments of the main habitats and substrates of these reefs and offers a better understanding of reefs in the Kimberly bioregion. It is also a source of valuable information for the marine park and coastal managers investigating the coral reefs that have been targeted for conservation, but have not yet been the subject of regional analysis.

Agardh is one of the most diverse genera of marine macroalgae, and commonly inhabits shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters. This study aimed at investigating the effect of seasonality and the associated water-quality changes on the distribution, canopy cover, mean thallus length and biomass of Sargassum beds around Point Peron, Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, southwest Australia. Samples of Sargassum and seawater were collected every 3 mo from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2014, from 4 different reef zones. A combination of in situ observations and WorldView-2 satellite remote-sensing images were used to map the spatial distribution of Sargassum beds and other associated benthic habitats. The results demonstrated strong seasonal variation in the physicochemical water parameters, canopy cover, mean thallus length, and biomass of Sargassum, which were significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by nutrient concentrations (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and rainfall. However, no significant variation in any studied parameter was observed among the 4 reef zones. The highest Sargassum biomass peaks occurred between late spring and early summer (from September to January). The results provide essential information to guide effective conservation and management, as well as sustainable utilisation of this renewable coastal marine resource.

J	Abualhin, K				Abualhin, Khaldoun			Mapping of Underwater Seabed Morphology of the Gaza Strip Coastal Zone Using Remote sensing technique	Earth Sciences Research Journal												The study investigated the feasibility of applying the depth-invariant index algorithm to delineate the shallow underwater geomorphological features using QuickBird imagery. Although the technical procedures of the depthinvariant index are already demonstrated in the professional literature, the algorithm needs to be applied and tested in several coastal regions with different seawater conditions and properties. Some of the geomorphological features in the coastal zone of the Gaza Strip are seasonal features such as underwater sand bars. However, since these features are non-permanent and dynamic, it would be useful to utilize satellite data to detect changes in both locations and depth, and also to monitor this feature in shallow coastal water. The importance of identifying the underwater sand bars in the coastal zone can be significant in the case of rip currents, and swimming conditions. Additionally, using satellite imagery for detecting dynamic underwater coastal morphologies may enable local authorities to adopt such an algorithm with a combination of satellite imagery for fast, efficient and extensive coverage mapping. While information about seafloor features can be obtained using active satellite data such as RADAR or LiDAR imagery, active satellite data are not available and require advanced processing and logistical resources, which are difficult to obtain in the case of the Gaza Strip. The study instead used passive QuickBird satellite imagery to map and delineate the seabed morphologies through the calculating the depth-invariant index for the spectral bands. By using the depth-invariant index, it was possible to distinguish and delineate the major underwater sand bars within the entire coastal zone of the Gaza Strip. Also, the spectral and spatial resolution of QuickBird imagery exhibited a substantial capability in mapping and delineating the underwater seabed morphologies.																	1794-6190					JUN	2016	20	2								10.15446/esrj.v20n2.50256								WOS:000392804600004

Effects of Per-Pixel Variability on Uncertainties in Bathymetric Retrievals from High-Resolution Satellite Images	REMOTE SENSING												Increased sophistication of high spatial resolution multispectral satellite sensors provides enhanced bathymetric mapping capability. However, the enhancements are counter-acted by per-pixel variability in sunglint, atmospheric path length and directional effects. This case-study highlights retrieval errors from images acquired at non-optimal geometrical combinations. The effects of variations in the environmental noise on water surface reflectance and the accuracy of environmental variable retrievals were quantified. Two WorldView-2 satellite images were acquired, within one minute of each other, with Image 1 placed in a near-optimal sun-sensor geometric configuration and Image 2 placed close to the specular point of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Image 2 had higher total environmental noise due to increased surface glint and higher atmospheric path-scattering. Generally, depths were under-estimated from Image 2, compared to Image 1. A partial improvement in retrieval error after glint correction of Image 2 resulted in an increase of the maximum depth to which accurate depth estimations were returned. This case-study indicates that critical analysis of individual images, accounting for the entire sun elevation and azimuth and satellite sensor pointing and geometry as well as anticipated wave height and direction, is required to ensure an image is fit for purpose for aquatic data analysis.

J	Uhl, F; Bartsch, I; Oppelt, N				Uhl, Florian; Bartsch, Inka; Oppelt, Natascha			Submerged Kelp Detection with Hyperspectral Data	REMOTE SENSING												Submerged marine forests of macroalgae known as kelp are one of the key structures for coastal ecosystems worldwide. These communities are responding to climate driven habitat changes and are therefore appropriate indicators of ecosystem status and health. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a tool for a spatial kelp habitat mapping. The difficulty in optical kelp mapping is the retrieval of a significant kelp signal through the water column. Detecting submerged kelp habitats is challenging, in particular in turbid coastal waters. We developed a fully automated simple feature detection processor to detect the presence of kelp in submerged habitats. We compared the performance of this new approach to a common maximum likelihood classification using hyperspectral AisaEAGLE data from the subtidal zones of Helgoland, Germany. The classification results of 13 flight stripes were validated with transect diving mappings. The feature detection showed a higher accuracy till a depth of 6 m (overall accuracy = 80.18%) than the accuracy of a maximum likelihood classification (overall accuracy = 57.66%). The feature detection processor turned out as a time-effective approach to assess and monitor submerged kelp at the limit of water visibility depth.																	2072-4292					JUN	2016	8	6							487	10.3390/rs8060487								WOS:000379985300046

Incorporating benthic community changes into hydrochemical-based projections of coral reef calcium carbonate production under ocean acidification	CORAL REEFS												The existence of coral reefs is dependent on the production and maintenance of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) framework that is produced through calcification. The net production of CaCO3 will likely decline in the future, from both declining net calcification rates (decreasing calcification and increasing dissolution) and shifts in benthic community composition from calcifying organisms to non-calcifying organisms. Here, we present a framework for hydrochemical studies that allows both declining net calcification rates and changes in benthic community composition to be incorporated into projections of coral reef CaCO3 production. The framework involves upscaling net calcification rates for each benthic community type using mapped proportional cover of the benthic communities. This upscaling process was applied to the reef flats at One Tree and Lady Elliot reefs (Great Barrier Reef) and Shiraho Reef (Okinawa), and compared to existing data. Future CaCO3 budgets were projected for Lady Elliot Reef, predicting a decline of 53 % from the present value by end-century (800 ppm CO2) without any changes to benthic community composition. A further 5.7 % decline in net CaCO3 production is expected for each 10 % decline in calcifier cover, and net dissolution is predicted by end-century if calcifier cover drops below 18 % of the present extent. These results show the combined negative effect of both declining net calcification rates and changing benthic community composition on reefs and the importance of considering both processes for determining future reef CaCO3 production.

Changes in water clarity in response to river discharges on the Great Barrier Reef continental shelf: 2002-2013	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Water clarity is a key factor for the health of marine ecosystems. The Australian Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is located on a continental shelf, with >35 major seasonal rivers discharging into this 344,000 km(2) tropical to subtropical ecosystem. This work investigates how river discharges affect water clarity in different zones along and across the GBR. For each day over 11 years (2002-2013) we calculated 'photic depth' as a proxy measure of water clarity (calibrated to be equivalent to Secchi depth), for each 1 km2 pixel from MODIS-Aqua remote sensing data. Long-term and seasonal changes in photic depth were related to the daily discharge volumes of the nearest rivers, after statistically removing the effects of waves and tides on photic depth. The relationships between photic depths and rivers differed across and along the GBR. They typically declined from the coastal to offshore zones, and were strongest in proximity to rivers in agriculturally modified catchments. In most southern inner zones, photic depth declined consistently throughout the 11-year observation period; such long-term trend was not observed offshore nor in the northern regions. Averaged across the GBR, photic depths declined to 47% of local maximum values soon after the onset of river floods, and recovery to 95% of maximum values took on average 6 months (range: 150-260 days). The river effects were strongest at latitude 14.5 degrees-19.0 degrees S, where river loads are high and the continental shelf is narrow. Here, even offshore zones showed a >40% seasonal decline in photic depth, and 17-24% reductions in annual mean photic depth in years with large river nutrients and sediment loads. Our methodology is based on freely available data and tools and may be applied to other shelf systems, providing valuable insights in support of ecosystem management. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Mapping for coral reef conservation: comparing the value of participatory and remote sensing approaches	ECOSPHERE												Detailed habitat maps are critical for conservation planning, yet for many coastal habitats only coarse-resolution maps are available. As the logistic and technological constraints of habitat mapping become increasingly tractable, habitat map comparisons are warranted. Here we compare two mapping approaches: local environmental knowledge (LEK) obtained from interviews; and remote sensing analysis (RS) of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (2.0 m pixel) using object-based image analysis. For a coral reef ecosystem, we compare the accuracy of these two approaches for mapping shallow seafloor habitats and contrast their characterization of habitat area and seascape connectivity. We also explore several implications for conservation planning. When evaluated using independent ground verification data, LEK-derived maps achieved a lower overall accuracy than RS-derived maps (LEK: 66%; RS: 76%). A comparison of mapped habitats found low overall agreement between LEK and RS maps. The RS map identified 5.4 times more habitat edges (the border between adjacent habitat classes) and 3.7-6.4 times greater seascape connectivity. Since the spatial arrangement of habitats affects many species (e.g., movement, predation risk), such discrepancies in landscape metrics are important to consider in conservation planning. Our results help identify strengths and weakness of both mapping approaches for conservation planning. Because RS provided a more accurate estimate of habitat distributions, it would be better for conservation planning for species sensitive to fine-spatial scale seascape patterns (e.g., habitat edges), whereas LEK is more cost effective and appropriate for mapping coarse habitat patterns. Goals for maps used in conservation should be identified early in their development.																	2150-8925					MAY	2016	7	5							e01325	10.1002/ecs2.1325								WOS:000377215200030						
J	Mann, T; Bayliss-Smith, T; Westphal, H				Mann, Thomas; Bayliss-Smith, Tim; Westphal, Hildegard			A Geomorphic Interpretation of Shoreline Change Rates on Reef Islands	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Recent-past shoreline changes on reef islands are now subject to intensified monitoring via remote sensing data. Based on these data, rates of shoreline change calculated from long-term measurements (decadal) are often markedly lower than recent short-term rates (over a number of years). This observation has raised speculations about the growing influence of sea-level rise on reef island stability. This observation, however, can also be explained if we consider two basic principles of geomorphology and sedimentology. For Takil Atoll, Papua New Guinea, we show that natural shoreline fluctuations of dynamic reef islands have a crucial influence on the calculation of short-term rates of change. We analyze an extensive dataset of multitemporal shoreline change rates from 1943 to 2012 and find that differing rates between long- and short-term measurements consistently reflect the length of the observation interval. This relationship appears independent from the study era and indicates that reef islands were equally dynamic during the early periods of analysis, i.e. before the recent acceleration of sea-level rise. Consequently, we suggest that high rates of shoreline change calculated from recent short-term observations may simply result from a change in temporal scale and a shift from geomorphic equilibrium achieved over cyclic time toward an apparent disequilibrium during shorter periods of graded time. This new interpretation of short- and long-term shoreline change rates has important implications for the ongoing discussion about reef island vulnerability, showing that an observed jump from low to high rates of change may be independent from external influences, including but not limited to sea-level rise.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAY	2016	32	3					500	507		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00093.1								WOS:000375824100004

Addressing the information gap of coral reef resilience, we produce a map-based Remote Sensed Resilience Index (RSRI) from data describing the spatial distribution of stressors, and properties of reef habitats on the Farasan Banks, Saudi Arabia. We contrast the distribution of this index among fourteen reef types, categorized on a scale of maturity that includes juvenile (poorly aggraded), mature (partially aggraded), and senile (fully aggraded) reefs. Sites with high reef resilience can be found in most detached reef types; however they are most common in mature reefs. We aim to stimulate debate on the coupling that exists between geomorphology and conservation biology, and consider how such information can be used to inform management decisions.

Ideally the methodology can be applied to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of mapping the nearshore environment to identify sensitive habitats, monitor for change, and assist in management decisions. The framework is applied to a case study for northeastern Qatar with a key focus on identifying high sensitivity coral habitat. The study helps confirm the presence of known coral and provides detail on a region in the area of interest where corals have not been previously mapped. Challenges for the remote sensing methodology associated with natural heterogeneity of the physical and biological environment are addressed.

In Saadiyat and Ras Ghanada reefs similar to 40% of the corals showed signs of bleaching. In contrast, only 15% of the corals were affected on Delma reef. Bleaching threshold temperatures for these sites were established using remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data recorded by MODIS-Aqua. The calculated threshold temperatures varied between locations (34.48 degrees C, 34.55 degrees C, 35.05 degrees C), resulting in site-specific deviations in the numbers of days during which these thresholds were exceeded. Hence, the less severe bleaching of Delma reef might be explained by the lower relative heat stress experienced by this coral community. However, the dominance of Porites spp. that is associated with the long-term exposure of Delma reef to elevated temperatures, as well as the more pristine setting may have additionally contributed to the higher coral bleaching threshold for this site.

M.; van Gils, Jan A.; van der Heide, Tjisse			Drought, Mutualism Breakdown, and Landscape-Scale Degradation of Seagrass Beds	CURRENT BIOLOGY												In many marine ecosystems, biodiversity critically depends on foundation species such as corals and seagrasses that engage in mutualistic interactions [1-3]. Concerns grow that environmental disruption of marine mutualisms exacerbates ecosystem degradation, with breakdown of the obligate coral mutualism ("coral bleaching") being an iconic example [2, 4, 5]. However, as these mutualisms are mostly facultative rather than obligate, it remains unclear whether mutualism breakdown is a common risk in marine ecosystems, and thus a potential accelerator of ecosystem degradation. Here, we provide evidence that. drought triggered landscape-scale seagrass degradation and show the consequent failure of a facultative mutualistic feedback between seagrass and sulfide-consuming lucinid bivalves that in turn appeared to exacerbate the observed collapse. Local climate and remote sensing analyses revealed seagrass collapse after a summer with intense low-tide drought stress. Potential analysis a novel approach to detect feedback-mediated state shifts-revealed two attractors (healthy and degraded states) during the collapse, suggesting that the drought disrupted internal feedbacks to cause abrupt, patch-wise degradation. Field measurements comparing degraded patches that were healthy before the collapse with patches that remained healthy demonstrated that bivalves declined dramatically in degrading patches with associated high sediment sulfide concentrations, confirming the breakdown of the mutualistic seagrass-lucinid feedback. Our findings indicate that drought triggered mutualism breakdown, resulting in toxic sulfide concentrations that aggravated seagrass degradation. We conclude that external disturbances can cause sudden breakdown of facultative marine mutualistic feedbacks. As this may amplify ecosystem degradation, we suggest including mutualisms in marine conservation and restoration approaches.				van der Geest, Matthijs/A-4744-2013; Olff, Han/A-8516-2008; Smolders, Alfons/H-2583-2012; Lamers, Leon/A-8718-2012; van der Heide, Tjisse/M-3000-2013; van Gils, Jan/B-5544-2008; Christianen, Marjolijn/B-8847-2011	van der Geest, Matthijs/0000-0002-9837-3803; Olff, Han/0000-0003-2154-3576; Lamers, Leon/0000-0003-3769-2154; van Gils, Jan/0000-0002-4132-8243; Christianen, Marjolijn/0000-0001-5839-2981; van Belzen, Jim/0000-0003-2099-1545												0960-9822	1879-0445				APR 25	2016	26	8					1051	1056		10.1016/j.cub.2016.02.023								WOS:000375339700023	26972316					
J	Uhrin, AV; Townsend, PA				Uhrin, Amy V.; Townsend, Philip A.			Improved seagrass mapping using linear spectral unmixing of aerial photographs	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Mapping of seagrass is challenging, particularly in areas where seagrass cover ranges from extensive, continuous meadows to aggregations of patchy mounds often no more than a meter across. Manual delineation of seagrass habitat polygons through visual photointerpretation of high resolution aerial imagery remains the most widely adopted approach for mapping seagrass extent but polygons often include unvegetated gaps. Although mapped polygon data exist for many estuaries, these are likely insufficient to accurately characterize spatial pattern or estimate area actually occupied by seagrass. We evaluated whether a linear spectral unmixing (LSU) classifier applied to manually-delineated seagrass polygons clipped from digital aerial images could improve mapping of seagrass in North Carolina. Representative seagrass endmembers were chosen directly from images and used to unmix image-clipped polygons, resulting in fraction planes (maps) of the proportion of seagrass present in each image pixel. Thresholding was used to generate seagrass maps for each pixel proportion from 0 (no thresholding, all pixel proportions included) to 1 (only pixels having 100% seagrass) in 0.1 increments. The optimal pixel proportion for identifying seagrass was assessed using Euclidean distance calculated from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and overall thematic accuracy calculated from confusion matrices. We assessed overall classifier performance using Kappa statistics and Area Under the (ROC) Curve (AUC). We compared seagrass area calculated from each threshold map to the total area of the corresponding manually-delineated polygon. LSU effectively classified seagrass and performed better than a random classification as indicated by high values for both Kappa statistics (0.72-98) and AUC (0.80-0.99). The LSU classifier effectively distinguished between seagrass and bare substrate resulting in fine-scale sea grass maps with overall thematic accuracies that exceeded our expected accuracy target of 85% (range: 86.3-99.0%) and were comparable to those reported from previous seagrass mapping studies utilizing aerial image spectral data. The pixel proportion producing seagrass maps with highest accuracy varied among sites (range: 0 to 0.5). The optimal pixel proportion determined from Euclidean distance varied among sites (range: 0.2 to 0.6) and differed from those having highest accuracy. Importantly, the classifier identified small patches of seagrass, resulting in seagrass area estimates that were 2-94% lower than the area of the corresponding habitat polygon. We conclude that where seagrass polygon data exist, LSU can be used together with photointerpretation to generate spatially resolved maps suitable for analysis of seagrass spatial configuration and provide improved estimates of actual seagrass acreage.

J	Mann, T; Westphal, H				Mann, Thomas; Westphal, Hildegard			Multi-decadal shoreline changes on Taku Atoll, Papua New Guinea: Observational evidence of early reef island recovery after the impact of storm waves	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Hurricanes, tropical cyclones and other high-magnitude events are important steering mechanisms in the geomorphic development of coral reef islands. Sandy reef islands located outside the storm belts are strongly sensitive to the impact of occasional high-magnitude events and show abrupt, commonly erosive geomorphic change in response to such events. Based on the interpretation of remote sensing data, it is well known that the process of landform recovery might take several decades or even longer. However, despite the increasing amount of scientific attention towards short- and long-term island dynamics, the lack of data and models often prevent a robust analysis of the timing and nature of recovery initiation. Here we show how natural island recovery starts immediately after the impact of a high-magnitude event. We analyze multi-temporal shoreline changes on Taku Atoll, Papua New Guinea and combine our findings with a unique set of published field observations (Smithers and Hoeke, 2014). Trends of shoreline change since 1943 and changes in planform island area indicate a long-term accretionary mode for most islands. Apparent shoreline instability is detected for the last decade of analysis, however this can be explained by the impact of storm waves in December 2008 that (temporarily?) masked the long-term trend. The transition from negative to positive rates of change in the aftermath of this storm event is indicative of inherent negative feedback processes that counteract short-term changes in energy input and represent the initiation of island recovery. Collectively, our results support the concept of dynamic rather than static reef islands and clearly demonstrate how short-term processes can influence interpretations of medium-term change.

Remote sensing monitoring products have been developed to map the spatial extent, composition and frequency of occurrence of river plumes in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. There is, however, a need to incorporate these monitoring products into Risk Assessment Frameworks as management decision tools. A simple Satellite Risk Framework has been recently proposed to generate maps of potential risk to seagrass and coral reef ecosystems in the GBR focusing on the Austral tropical wet season. This framework was based on a "magnitude x likelihood" risk management approach and GBR plume water types mapped from satellite imagery. The GBR plume water types (so called "Primary" for the inshore plume waters, "Secondary" for the midshelf-plume waters and "Tertiary" for the offshore plume waters) represent distinct concentrations and combinations of land-sourced and marine contaminants. The current study aimed to test and refine the methods of the Satellite Risk Framework. It compared predicted pollutant concentrations in plume water types (multi-annual average from 2005-2014) to published ecological thresholds, and combined this information with similarly long-term measures of seagrass and coral ecosystem health. The Satellite Risk Framework and newly-introduced multi-annual risk scores were successful in demonstrating where water conditions were, on average, correlated to adverse biological responses. Seagrass meadow abundance (multi-annual change in % cover) was negatively correlated to the multi-annual risk score at the site level (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.05). Relationships between multi-annual risk scores and multi-annual changes in proportional macroalgae cover (as an index for coral reef health) were more complex (R-2 = 0.04, p > 0.05), though reefs incurring higher risk scores showed relatively higher proportional macroalgae cover. Multi-annual risk score thresholds associated with loss of seagrass cover were defined, with lower risk scores (<= 0.2) associated with a gain or little loss in seagrass cover (gain/-12%), medium risk scores (0.2-0.4) associated with moderate loss (-12/-30%) and higher risk scores (>0.4) with the greatest loss in cover (>-30%). These thresholds were used to generate an intermediate river plume risk map specifically for seagrass meadows of the GBR. An intermediate river plume risk map for coral reefs was also developed by considering a multi-annual risk score threshold of 0.2-above which a higher proportion of macroalgae within the algal communities can be expected. These findings contribute to a long-term and adaptive approach to set relevant risk framework and thresholds for adverse biological responses in the GBR. The ecological thresholds and risk scores used in this study will be refined and validated through ongoing monitoring and assessment. As uncertainties are reduced, these risk metrics will provide important information for the development of strategies to manage water quality and ecosystem health.

Spectral Reflectance of Palauan Reef-Building Coral with Different Symbionts in Response to Elevated Temperature	REMOTE SENSING												Spectral reflectance patterns of corals are driven largely by the pigments of photosynthetic symbionts within the host cnidarian. The warm inshore bays and cooler offshore reefs of Palau share a variety of coral species with differing endosymbiotic dinoflagellates (genus: Symbiodinium), with the thermally tolerant Symbiodinium trenchii (S. trenchii) (= type D1a or D1-4) predominating under the elevated temperature regimes inshore, and primarily Clade C types in the cooler reefs offshore. Spectral reflectance of two species of stony coral, Cyphastrea serailia (C. serailia) and Pachyseris rugosa (P. rugosa), from both inshore and offshore locations shared multiple features both between sites and to similar global data from other studies. No clear reflectance features were evident which might serve as markers of thermally tolerant S. trenchii symbionts compared to the same species of coral with different symbionts. Reflectance from C. serailia colonies from inshore had a fluorescence peak at approximately 500 nm which was absent from offshore animals. Integrated reflectance across visible wavelengths had an inverse correlation to symbiont cell density and could be used as a relative indicator of the symbiont abundance for each type of coral. As hypothesized, coral colonies from offshore with Clade C symbionts showed a greater response to experimental heating, manifested as decreased symbiont density and increased reflectance or "bleaching" than their inshore counterparts with S. trenchii. Although no unique spectral features were found to distinguish species of symbiont, spectral differences related to the abundance of symbionts could prove useful in field and remote sensing studies.																	2072-4292					MAR	2016	8	3								10.3390/rs8030164								WOS:000373627400020						
J	Collin, A; Etienne, S; Jeanson, M				Collin, Antoine; Etienne, Samuel; Jeanson, Matthieu			Three-dimensional structure of coral reef boulders transported by stormy waves using the very high resolution WorldView-2 satellite	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					14th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)	MAR 06-11, 2016	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Sydney, Geocoastal Res Grp, Coastal Educ & Res Fdn, JCR				Coral reef boulders have been showed to reliably characterize the amount of wave energy related to cyclone, storm or tsunami events. The wave height and current velocity have been successfully explained by the variability in the boulder individual (morphology) and population (distribution) spatial patterns. Even if a single boulder may include a substantial amount of information, it may be highly challenging to characterize it given the access difficulty at the local and regional scales. Moreover, a boulder population is meaningful to robustly and continuously depict the energetic event that drove the sediment transportation. Recently the very high resolution satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated to help classify and measure the horizontal patterns (A- and B-axes) of the boulders at the submeter scale. Here we focus on the vertical dimension (C-axis) of the boulders. Based on boulder fieldwork measurements of the three axes and geographic locations, we constrain various spectral parameters of the remotely sensed datasets (WorldView-2) to retrieve the three axes of the boulders, reaching a very satisfactory agreements (R-2) of 0.95, 0.88 and 0.75, respectively. The innovative C extraction combined with the A and B information will allow geomorphologists to rapidly and extensively collect boulder data so that the underlying energy can be computed in a more expanded and accurate way, at the population scale.

During the growing season, MSAV develops to form dense canopy seaweed beds that play a vital role in coastal marine ecosystems and offer great potential to chemical, pharmaceutical, and bio-energy industries. At present, the total biomass and the distribution of the MSAV beds along the coast of Western Australia (WA) are not fully identified and quantified. Therefore, the application of satellite remote sensing data with high spatial resolution for examining the MSAV beds is required. The main objective of the present study was to assess and map the distribution of MSAV at two sites; Rottnest Island and Point Peron, Rockingham, WA, using WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite data. These study sites are important marine protected areas in WA waters with extraordinary documented biodiversity. By means of quantitative quadrat techniques, the MSAV canopy covers and fresh biomass data from the ground truth observations were assessed from September 2012 to December 2014. At Point Peron, the fresh biomass of Sargassum in the inter-tidal zone reached 5651.7 +/- 754.5, 5218.9 +/- 192.6, 1136.6 +/- 526.4, and 3472.2 +/- 434.2 g m(-2) for spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively. The overall accuracy of the minimum distance method was employed and yielded the highest accuracy rates of 90.93% (Kappa coefficient, kappa = 0.96) and 97.13% (kappa = 0.96) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The Mahalanobis classification with overall accuracy yielded 90.66% (kappa = 0.88) and 94.16% (kappa = 0.85) for Rottnest Island and Point Peron, respectively. The study results revealed that WV2 satellite data provided evidence of the high accuracy of MSAV classification.

Shoreline change rate and erosion risk assessment along the Trou Aux Biches-Mont Choisy beach on the northwest coast of Mauritius using GIS-DSAS technique	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study investigates the rate of shoreline change and erosion risk along the Trou aux Biches-Mont Choisy beach in the northwest coast of Mauritius using digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS). In this analysis, the long-term shoreline change rate and coastal erosion and accretion pattern are estimated along the coastal stretch using multi-temporal aerial photographs and high resolution satellite images for the past 45 years (1967-2012). The shoreline change rate and erosion/accretion pattern at each transects are estimated by five statistical parameters functionalized in DSAS 4.5 software such as end point rate (EPR), shoreline change envelop (SCE), net shoreline movement (NSM), linear regression rate (LRR), and least median of squares (LMS). The measurement of shoreline change rate and coastal erosion and accretion pattern has been described for three segments namely (1) North-North-West (NNW) to South-South-East (SSE); (2) North-East (NE) to South-West (SW); (3) North-North-East (NNE) to South-South-West (SSW) based on the coastal configuration. The analysis reveals that the severe erosion risk (-1.75 to -0.03 m/year) was noticed between transects 41 and 61 in NE-SW segments and moderate erosion risk (-1.09 to -0.18 m/year) between transects 62 and 95 of the NNE-SSW segments. The NNW-SSE segment shows low erosion risk with an EPR value of -0.55 to -0.05 m/year. The values of shoreline change rate of these transects indicate the occurrence of severe erosion along the coastal area over the periods of 1967-2012. However, the coastal segment in NNW-SSE configuration faces least erosion rate and the protective coral reefs reduce the wave energy action which leads to the formation of sustainable coast in the area. Moreover, poor set back and management activities with reference to high energetic waves, storm surge and cyclonic conditions produce direct impacts on the coastal morphology and degradation of coral reef ecosystem. The shoreline change studies through integrated remote sensing and GIS technology is considered of paramount importance for accurately focusing on planning, management and coastal intervention in long-term purpose.

Some sand cays play an important role in ocean strategy and economy, but surprisingly we know little about them, especially those recently formed sand cays. In this research, we monitor migration of a new sand cay in Nanxun Jiao (Gaven Reef) using a series of QuickBird and WorldView-2 satellite images between June 2006 and August 2013. We conduct a regression between migration distance and wind observational data to examine the migration patterns of the new sand cay. The migration distance is calculated based on the sand cay locations extracted based on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The wind observational data downloaded from NOAA are reformed into four wind direction vectors. Based on the results of regression, we concluded that the migration of the new sand cay on Nanxun Jiao was significantly associated with the east, west and north wind. East wind was the main influence factor of the migration; its impact strength was almost twice as the west and north wind. The south wind has little effect on the migration of the sand cay, which is partly blocked by the artificial structure in the south.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				MAR	2016	35	3					102	107		10.1007/s13131-016-0827-8								WOS:000371883000013

Environmental sensitivity mapping of the coast of Karnataka, west coast of India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental sensitivity maps have been prepared to identify the sensitive coastal resources, oil spill contingency planning and its results. The present study attempts to identify the environmental sensitivity to the oil spill of Karnataka coast by using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Nearly 300 km long coastline of Karnataka is endowed with a vast variety of natural resources and aesthetics. Several of the rivers that originate in the Western Ghats form wide extensive estuaries, backwaters and mangrove forests before debouching into the Arabian Sea. Besides, several non-vegetal wetlands like beaches, spits, shoals, mudflats, rocky cliffs and a few islands are found scattered all along the coast. A major port (New Mangalore Port), ten minor ports and a naval base (near Karwar) are also situated in the study area. As a result, various ESI types namely: 1A, 1B, 3A, 4, 6B, 8B, 9B, 10A, 10B and 10D were noticed in the study area. Bio-resources such as birds, marine mammals, reptiles (sea turtle), shellfish; and habitats like corals etc.; and human-use resources such as factories, ferry, boat ramp, access to vehicles, beach etc. are mapped in this study.

J	Hedley, J; Russell, B; Randolph, K; Dierssen, H				Hedley, John; Russell, Brandon; Randolph, Kaylan; Dierssen, Heidi			A physics-based method for the remote sensing of seagrasses	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows are important environments for the blue carbon budget and are potential early indicators for environmental change. Remote sensing is a viable monitoring tool for spatially extensive meadows but most current approaches are limited by the requirement for in situ calibration data or provide categorical level maps rather than quantitative estimates of direct physiological significance. In this paper we present a method for mapping water depth and the leaf area index (LAI, ratio of leaf area to substrate area) of Thalassia testudinum meadows, based on radiative transfer model inversion using an embedded three-dimensional aquatic canopy model. Variations in reflectance due to leaf length, leaf position, sediment coverage on leaves, water depth and solar zenith angle were included in the model to parameterise uncertainty propagation. The model revealed canopy reflectance as a function of LAI decreases exponentially at all wavelengths up to an LAI around four, beyond which increasing canopy density cannot be determined from reflectance. In addition, sediment coverage on leaves has surprisingly little effect on the reflectance of sparse canopies because shading is also a contributor to darkening. The capability of the method for image based mapping was assessed through sensitivity analyses and by application to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Florida Bay collected by the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM), with the uncertainty propagation providing per-pixel confidence intervals on all the estimated parameters. Results were consistent across the sensitivity and image analyses and the agreement with field data was good, given the challenges in validation of submerged pixels at metre scale. Uncertainties were high for LAIs greater than two in water of depth 8 m, but lower for sparse canopies and shallower water. For water depths approaching 10 in the pixel-to-pixel variation arising from processes at the water surface upwards was greater than the uncertainties arising from the canopy or water column. The physics-based model inversion approach is readily adaptable to any sensor configuration and to different seagrass species and canopy morphologies. No site-specific in situ data is required and the uncertainty estimates can provide an objective basis for interpreting apparent changes in the distribution of seagrasses over time and space, as revealed by remote sensing techniques.

Measuring structural complexity underwater is not trivial and researchers have been searching for accurate and cost-effective methods that can be applied across spatial extents for over 50 years. This study integrated a set of existing multi-view, image-processing algorithms, to accurately compute metrics of structural complexity (e.g., ratio of surface to planar area) underwater solely from images. This framework resulted in accurate, high-speed 3D habitat reconstructions at scales ranging from small corals to reef-scapes (10s km(2)). Structural complexity was accurately quantified from both contemporary and historical image datasets across three spatial scales: (i) branching coral colony (Acropora spp.); (ii) reef area (400 m(2)); and (iii) reef transect (2 km). At small scales, our method delivered models with <1 mm error over 90% of the surface area, while the accuracy at transect scale was 85.3% +/- 6% (CI). Advantages are: no need for an a priori requirement for image size or resolution, no invasive techniques, cost-effectiveness, and utilization of existing imagery taken from off-the-shelf cameras (both monocular or stereo). This remote sensing method can be integrated to reef monitoring and improve our knowledge of key aspects of coral reef dynamics, from reef accretion to habitat provisioning and productivity, by measuring and up-scaling estimates of structural complexity.

Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs for Monitoring and Management: A Review	REMOTE SENSING												Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.				Harborne, Alastair/F-6155-2013; Bejarano, Sonia/S-7784-2016; Skirving, William/E-7927-2011; Strong, Alan/E-7924-2011; Heron, Scott/E-7928-2011; Eakin, C.

Characterization of Available Light for Seagrass and Patch Reef Productivity in Sugarloaf Key, Lower Florida Keys	REMOTE SENSING												Light availability is an important factor driving primary productivity in benthic ecosystems, but in situ and remote sensing measurements of light quality are limited for coral reefs and seagrass beds. We evaluated the productivity responses of a patch reef and a seagrass site in the Lower Florida Keys to ambient light availability and spectral quality. In situ optical properties were characterized utilizing moored and water column bio-optical and hydrographic measurements. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was also estimated for these study sites using benthic productivity chambers. Our results show higher spectral light attenuation and absorption, and lower irradiance during low tide in the patch reef, tracking the influx of materials from shallower coastal areas. In contrast, the intrusion of clearer surface Atlantic Ocean water caused lower values of spectral attenuation and absorption, and higher irradiance in the patch reef during high tide. Storms during the studied period, with winds >10 ms(-1), caused higher spectral attenuation values. A spatial gradient of NEP was observed, from high productivity in the shallow seagrass area, to lower productivity in deeper patch reefs. The highest daytime NEP was observed in the seagrass, with values of almost 0.4 gO(2)m(-2)h(-1). Productivity at the patch reef area was lower in May than during October 2012 (mean = 0.137 and 0.177 gO(2)m(-2)h(-1), respectively). Higher photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) levels measured above water and lower light attenuation in the red region of the visible spectrum (similar to 666 to similar to 699 nm) had a positive correlation with NEP. Our results indicate that changes in light availability and quality by suspended or resuspended particles limit benthic productivity in the Florida Keys.

Geomorphological evolution of marine heads on the eastern coast of Red Sea at Saudi Arabian region, using remote sensing techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The eastern coast of the Red Sea is characterized by the presence of numerous marine heads that differ in terms of shape, size, geological setting, structures, and composition. This difference directly affects geomorphological evolution. In the present study, Ras Al-Shabaan was chosen as a most important area in this coast. Field investigations supported with photo-interpretation techniques were performed for studying of geomorphological features of Ras Al-Shabaan. On the other hand, the remotely sensed imagery data has been used extensively in the identification of geological and geomorphological details of Ras Al-Shabaan. The geomorphological studies showed that depositional processes of wadis and channels are predominant at the Ras Al-Shabaan coast. The changes in geomorphological and geological data of Ras Al-Shabaan were identified by remote sensing image software. Two Landsat ETM+ images from 1990 and 2010 have been processed. The analysis of remote sensing data combined with field investigations and reference data were used to monitor, delineate, and describe the geomorphological changes of Ras Al-Shabaan coast during proceedings of supervised classification of ground units. Hence, the change detection statistics have been used in ground units. Geological and geomorphological maps were digitized by using ArcGIS software. Remote sensing techniques and geographic information system (GIS) were employed in order to monitor the results of changes occurred in the line of the coast. The satellite image processing and water index data were transferred to the ArcGIS program to draw the coast lines and to stand on the changes occurred. Thereby, it was possible to identify the most prominent landforms and geomorphic units of this area. Results showed that platforms, barriers, rocky heads, islands, coral reefs, submerged reefs, tidal channels, dissolution grooves, sabkhas, inlet system, waves work, and shoreline processes were included in coastal prominent landforms. The circumstances that formed this coast are not permanent, as it is changing rapidly and continuously due to erosion and uplift processes.

Effects of reduced water quality on coral reefs in and out of no-take marine reserves	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Near-shore marine environments are increasingly subjected to reduced water quality, and their ability to withstand it is critical to their persistence. The potential role marine reserves may play in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality has received little attention. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in live coral and macro-algal cover and water quality during moderate and major flooding events of the Fitzroy River within the Keppel Bay region of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 2007 to 2013. We used 7 years of remote sensing data on water quality and data from long-term monitoring of coral reefs to quantify exposure of coral reefs to flood plumes. We used a distance linear model to partition the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors, including zoning, as drivers of the observed changes in coral and macro-algae cover. Moderate flood plumes from 2007 to 2009 did not affect coral cover on reefs in the Keppel Islands, suggesting the reef has intrinsic resistance against short-term exposure to reduced water quality. However, from 2009 to 2013, live coral cover declined by approximate to 50% following several weeks of exposure to turbid, low salinity water from major flood plume events in 2011 and subsequent moderate events in 2012 and 2013. Although the flooding events in 2012 and 2013 were smaller than the flooding events between 2007 to 2009, the ability of the reefs to withstand these moderate floods was lost, as evidenced by a approximate to 20% decline in coral cover between 2011 to 2013. Although zoning (no-take reserve or fished) was identified a significant driver of coral cover, we recorded consistently lower coral cover on reserve reefs than on fished reefs throughout the study period and significantly lower cover in 2011. Our findings suggest that even reefs with an inherent resistance to reduced water quality are not able to withstand repeated disturbance events. The limitations of reserves in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality on near-shore coral reefs underscores the importance of integrated management approaches that combine effective land-based management with networks of no-take reserves.

Well-designed conservation plans involve efficient mapping and monitoring systems. Satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective tool for seafloor mapping at large scales. Multispectral remote sensing of coastal habitats, like those of the Arabian Gulf, presents a special challenge due to their complexity and heterogeneity. The present study evaluates the potential of multispectral sensor DubaiSat-2 in mapping benthic communities of United Arab Emirates. We propose to use a spectral-spatial method that includes multilevel segmentation, nonlinear feature analysis and ensemble learning methods. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for comparison of classification performances. Comparative data were derived from the habitat maps published by the Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi. The spectral-spatial method produced 96.41% mapping accuracy. SVM classification is assessed to be 94.17% accurate. The adaptation of these methods can help achieving well-designed coastal management plans in the region.

The study area is composed of four datasets, namely: (a) B1k66L005, (b) B1k66L021, (c) B1k66L024, and (d) B1k66L0114. SVM optimization was performed in Matlab software with the help of Parallel Computing Toolbox to hasten the SVM computing speed. The image used for collecting samples for SVM procedure was B1k66L0114 in which a total of 134,516 sample objects of mangrove, possible coral existence with rocks, sand, sea, fish pens and sea grasses were collected and processed. The collected samples were then used as training sets for the supervised learning algorithm and for the creation of class definitions. The learned hyper-planes separating one class from another in the multi-dimensional feature space can be thought of as a super feature which will then be used in developing the C (classifier) rule set in eCognition (R) software. The classification results of the sampling site yielded an accuracy of 98.85% which confirms the reliability of remote sensing techniques and analysis employed to orthophotos like the CIELAB, Color Intensity and One dimensional scalar constancy and the use of SVM classification algorithm in classifying benthic habitats.					japitana, michelle/0000-0001-7921-1270												2194-9034						2016	41	B7					189	194		10.5194/isprsarchives-XLI-B7-189-2016								WOS:000393155900029

Comparisons between predicted and measured bottom reflectance signatures are obtained using measured hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance signatures, water depth and water column constituent concentrations. Analytical solutions and algorithms are used to generate synthetic signatures of different bottom types. The analytical methodology used to simulated bottom reflectance contains offset and bias that can be corrected using spectral window based corrections. Example results are demonstrated for application to coral species, submerged aquatic vegetation and a sand bottom type. Spectral windows are identified for predicting the above bottom types. Sensitivity analysis of predicted bottom reflectance signatures is conducted by varying water depth, chlorophyll, dissolved organic matter and total suspended mater concentrations. The protocol can be applied to shallow subsurface geospatial mapping using sensor based water surface reflectance based upon an analytical model solution derived from primitive radiative transfer theory.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0402-5; 978-1-5106-0403-2				2016	9999								UNSP 99990N	10.1117/12.2241547								WOS:000391353700017

This data consisting of 242 spectral bands, provide a unique ability to identify Coral substrate based on their spectral properties. We applied atmospheric correction with the help of Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH) module of ENVI software. This atmospherically corrected was used to extract Coral Reef Zones (CRZ) based on specific threshold limits after subtracting data of 782.95nm band from 579.45nm band of Hyperion imagery. Both of these bands were chosen due to their property of exhibiting maximum spectral contrast that determines threshold limits to distinguish a coral area from its non-coral counterpart. These CRZs were compared with the coral reef zones base map developed using LISS-III data by INCOIS, Hyderabad and SAC, Ahmadabad under CZS project. We observed that extracted CRZ area was 85.25 m(2) and 110.1 m(2) using LISS-III and Hyperion Data respectively. Despite the overestimation of CRZ by Hyperion data as compared to LISS-III, the spatial distribution of CRZ showed reasonable similarity in both.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0121-5				2016	9880								98801B	10.1117/12.2227991								WOS:000389776100033

An algorithm for assessing reef biodiversity in benthic habitats is presented. The method consists of capturing spectral heterogeneity from hyperspectral images using vector quantization (VQ) method and use the result for prediction of benthic species richness. The results are compared with that of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) method. The validation of the process index is done by comparing the Shannon entropy from actual field data and the Shannon entropy computed from the image. The hyperspectral image corresponds to the marine coastal area of Enrique Reef in La Parguera, Puerto Rico which includes all biological communities associated with the sea floor, from the top of the intertidal zone and inner reaches of estuaries down to the deep sea.

J	Wicaksono, P				Wicaksono, Pramaditya			Improving the accuracy of Multispectral-based benthic habitats mapping using image rotations: the application of Principle Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The low number of water penetration bands in multispectral images limits the maximum descriptive resolution and the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitats maps, especially at higher levels of benthic habitats scheme complexities. This research aimed at improving the accuracy of benthic habitats mapping by exploiting the spectral performance of multispectral images using image rotation techniques, which is very beneficial for fast, accurate, and repeatable mapping. Kemujan Island as part of the Karimunjawa archipelago in Indonesia is selected as the study area. Principle Component Analysis ( PCA) and Independent Component Analysis ( ICA) were applied on Worldview-2 prior to image classification. The inputs for PCA and ICA are deglint bands and water column-corrected bands. Field benthic data collected from photo-transect technique were used to train the rotated datasets in the classification process and to assess the accuracy of the resulting benthic habitat maps. Three levels of benthic habitats classification schemes were constructed based on the variation of benthic habitats insitu, which covers the variations of coral reefs, seagrass, macro algae, and bare substratum. The results show that the application of image rotations on Worldview-2 improves the overall accuracy of benthic habitats mapping and become more effective as the classification scheme complexities increase. In the absence of water column correction, PCA and ICA become the best option to assist benthic habitats mapping.

For centuries, the Rufiji resources have been utilized sustainably by coastal people for food, firewood and building materials. However, in recent decades, the Estuary has been severely affected by a complexity of both climate change factors and anthropogenic pressures. A WWF/GEF Coastal Resilience to Climate Change Project was conducted between 2007 and 2009, involving repeated quantitative ecological plot assessment, rapid assessment, remote sensing (based on satellite images taken in 1991 and 2000) and recording indigenous knowledge through social science methods. Change analysis showed several definite trends. Along exposed seaward edges (not sheltered by reefs or islands), there was drastic erosion and mangrove loss attributed to increased wave activity and sea level rise, with over 25 m of coastline being lost along sections of the estuary over a two-year period. Along other seaward edges, some accretion and mangrove growth occurred due to being sheltered from wave action and having adequate sediment load from Bumba channel, which has received the main flow of Rufiji since the shift of the river in 1978. The 1998 El-Nino flooding event caused drastic mangrove loss in riverine areas. On several landward edges of the delta, migration of mangroves inland was detected. Overall, however, losses of mangroves in the Rufiji were clearly greater than gains. Anthropogenic pressures include deforestation in the watershed area and large scale cutting of mangroves for timber and conversion to rice farms. Recommended mitigation and adaptive management strategies include the establishment of buffer zones, mangrove planting, awareness raising and enforcement.																	2214-1553		978-3-319-25370-1; 978-3-319-25368-8				2016							183	207		10.1007/978-3-319-25370-1_12	10.1007/978-3-319-25370-1							WOS:000382769000016

Accurate bathymetric information is fundamental to safe maritime navigation and infrastructure development in the coastal zone, but it is expensive to acquire with traditional methods. Satellite-derived bathymetry has the potential to produce bathymetric maps at dramatically reduced cost per unit area. In this study, we investigate the depths to which Landsat 8 data can be used with a radiative transfer model inversion scheme to produce bathymetric maps for shallow waters in Canada. Simulation results indicate that in relatively clear waters the technique could be effective for mapping of depths up to approximate to 4.5m with approximate to 1m error at a 95% confidence level, although depths of up to only approximate to 3m can be similarly mapped in more turbid waters. A case study from turbid Boundary Bay, BC, indicates that imperfect derivation of above-surface remote sensing reflectance leads to greater errors in practice. Radiative transfer model inversion of Landsat 8 data allows coarse identification and preliminary bathymetric mapping of the shallowest waters in Canada, which are, at present, largely unknown outside main traffic corridors.																	0703-8992	1712-7971					2016	42	4					367	378		10.1080/07038992.2016.1177452								WOS:000379846700006

History of Modern Seafloor Mapping	SEAFLOOR MAPPING ALONG CONTINENTAL SHELVES: RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUALIZING BENTHIC ENVIRONMENTS	Coastal Research Library											Over the last century, remotely sensed mapping of continental shelf seafloor topography has had a rich history of applied research with varying techniques, all of which strive to accurately visualize the submarine benthos. Many early techniques (e. g., three-dimensional hachure maps) relied solely on the researcher's knowledge and cartographic skills in absence of technological advances yet to be made. Acoustic mapping practices were then derived from war-time sonar sweeps that painted a surprisingly vivid picture of the seafloor through the use of sound. Through time, more sophisticated acoustic remote sensing techniques were developed and used as either sidescan sonar, single beam echo sounders, or multibeam reflection sounders. More powerful ground-penetrating seismic techniques have also been used to not only map the surface layer of the seafloor, but to also visualize what lies below the benthic interface. However, aircraft and satellite-assisted techniques enabled researchers to recently make considerable advancements in the visualization of benthic environments. Once mainly used as military reconnaissance procedures for strategic planning, the advent of high-resolution aerial photography and orthoimagery has proven to be among the most effective techniques for visualizing shallow, low turbid waters along continental shelves. Equally as effective for clear waters within the nearshore of the continental margin are airborne laser bathymetry (ALB) methods, which use pulses of light to acquire bathymetric and topographic configurations based on airborne laser reflectance. Lastly, hyperspectral and multispectral sensors onboard orbiting satellites (e. g., IKONOS, Landsat, MODIS, SPOT) provide a continuous stream of benthic environment visualization without the logistical inconveniences of deploying a vessel or aircraft every time images are to be acquired. A historical review of advances in seafloor mapping methods shows that remote sensing techniques led to new ways of visualizing dynamic benthic environments that ranged from broadly generalized geomorphological features to specific biological coverages.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						3	49		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_1	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800002

Satellite based sensors provide a repetitive and synoptic coverage of inaccessible/larger areas which generated a time series database useful in identification and mapping of environment and resources. These databases form a scientific tool for various stakeholders to device suitable strategies for management of coastal and marine resources. This chapter analyses the various applications of satellite remote sensing and numerical modelling on identification and mapping of mangroves, coral reefs, fishing and molluscan grounds in the coastal marine ecosystems with relevant case studies and illustrations. The mapping methods for mangroves explains the classification protocols, advantages in using different remote sensing techniques and the comparison of different mapping techniques. In case of reef mapping, the vulnerability mapping of reefs due to extreme events is also discussed. Fish movement in a dynamic environment and the mapping of these movements with the help of proxy indicators are also detailed. Molluscan mapping is done based on the biomass differences during different seasons and their physical attributes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						105	123		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_4	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800005

Remote Sensing of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation	SEAFLOOR MAPPING ALONG CONTINENTAL SHELVES: RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUALIZING BENTHIC ENVIRONMENTS	Coastal Research Library											Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV), such as eelgrass, provides important ecological functions including food and habitat for ducks, geese, crabs, fish, clams, and other species. SAV also filters out excess nutrients from storm water that runs off into coastal waters, thus improving water quality. Eelgrass meadows can decrease the damaging effects of waves and reduce shoreline erosion. To protect these vital ecosystems, scientists need to monitor coastal vegetation changes as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. New satellites, sensors and data analysis techniques are providing remotely sensed data that are effective for monitoring coastal features and processes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, LiDAR and radar systems are available for mapping coastal marshes, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), coral reefs, beach profiles, water turbidity, chlorophyll concentration and eutrophication. Since coastal ecosystems, such as SAV beds, have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they must be observed with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. New satellites, carrying sensors with fine spatial (0.4-4 m) or spectral (200 narrow bands) resolution are now more accurately detecting changes in salt marsh and SAV extent, health, productivity and habitat quality. Using time-series of images enables scientists to study the health of SAV and other coastal ecosystems and to determine long-term trends and short-term changes.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						125	140		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_5	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800006

Landscape-Level Imaging of Benthic Environments in Optically-Deep Waters	SEAFLOOR MAPPING ALONG CONTINENTAL SHELVES: RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES FOR VISUALIZING BENTHIC ENVIRONMENTS	Coastal Research Library											Optical imaging of coral reefs and other benthic communities present below one attenuation depth, the limit of effective airborne and satellite remote sensing, requires the use of in situ platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs), towed platforms and drop cameras. High-resolution optical data from AUV and ROV sensors has provided unprecedented information on the community structure and condition of the deeper zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate coral reefs of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. The high-resolution optical images and video also provide useful data for inventories of the fish species present as well as macro invertebrates associated with these habitats. The digital photo transects obtained by the Seabed AUV provided quantitative data on living coral, sponge, gorgonian, and macroalgal cover as well as coral species richness and diversity. AUV and ROV benthic assessments could provide the required information for selecting unique areas of high coral cover, biodiversity and structural complexity for habitat protection and ecosystem-based management.																	2211-0577		978-3-319-25121-9; 978-3-319-25119-6				2016	13						261	272		10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9_10	10.1007/978-3-319-25121-9							WOS:000376129800011

Vulnerability assessment of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Climate changes in terms of sea level rise and global warming impose different ramifications upon the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia, which extends to 1840 km and witnesses accelerated urban development. The shoreline is mostly resistant to erosion and inundation by seawater due to the inherent hard nature and the relatively higher relief. Digital elevation models reveal that only about 890 km(2) of the coast occurs below 1 m. Global warming has a more conceivable impact upon the coast as numerous coral reef ecosystems exist, and the harm is inevitable. The coastal vulnerability index indicates that about 16 % of the coast is under high vulnerability, whereas 44 % of the coast is intimately low vulnerable to climate change. Higher vulnerable coastal segments include: relatively flat and lowlands; inhabited; and/or coral-mangrove-rich shorelines. Coastal zone management and rescue plans are essential to protect coastal resources for a long-term sustainable development.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	1							30	10.1007/s12665-015-4835-3								WOS:000370239800030

While advances in remote sensing, integrative modelling and meta-analysis enable generalisations from field observations, there is an underlying need for high-resolution, standardised and geo-referenced field data. Here, we evaluate a new approach aimed at optimising data collection and analysis to assess broad-scale patterns of coral reef community composition using automatically annotated underwater imagery, captured along 2 km transects. We validate this approach by investigating its ability to detect spatial (e.g., across regions) and temporal (e.g., over years) change, and by comparing automated annotation errors to those of multiple human annotators. Our results indicate that change of coral reef benthos can be captured at high resolution both spatially and temporally, with an average error below 5%, among key benthic groups. Cover estimation errors using automated annotation varied between 2% and 12%, slightly larger than human errors (which varied between 1% and 7%), but small enough to detect significant changes among dominant groups. Overall, this approach allows a rapid collection of in-situ observations at larger spatial scales (km) than previously possible, and provides a pathway to link, calibrate, and validate broader analyses across even larger spatial scales (10-10,000 km(2)).

Performance Evaluation of CRW Reef-Scale and Broad-Scale SST-Based Coral Monitoring Products in Fringing Reef Systems of Tobago	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) is used to monitor coral bleaching through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch (CRW) Decision Support System (DSS). Since 2000, a broad-scale 50 km SST was used to monitor thermal stress for coral reefs globally. However, some discrepancies were noted when applied to small-scale fringing coral reefs. To address this, CRW created a new DSS, specifically targeted at or near reef scales. Here, we evaluated the new reef-scale (5 km resolution) products using in situ temperature data and coral bleaching surveys which were also compared with the heritage broad-scale (50 km) for three reefs (Buccoo Reef, Culloden and Speyside) of the southern Caribbean island of Tobago. Seasonal and annual biases indicated the new 5 km SST generally represents the conditions at these reefs more accurately and more consistently than the 50 km SST. Consistency between satellite and in situ temperature data influences the performance of anomaly-based predictions of bleaching: the 5 km DHW product showed better consistency with bleaching observations than the 50 km product. These results are the first to demonstrate the improvement of the 5 km products over the 50 km predecessors and support their use in monitoring thermal stress of reefs in the southern Caribbean.

A statistical algorithm is proposed to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration ([chl-a]) in optically complex waters of the New Caledonian lagoon from MODIS-derived remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). The algorithm is developed via supervised learning on match-ups gathered from 2002 to 2010. The best performance is obtained by combining two models, selected according to the ratio of R-rs in spectral bands centered on 488 and 555 nm: a log-linear model for low [chl-a] (AFLC) and a support vector machine (SVM) model or a classic model (OC3) for high [chl-a]. The log-linear model is developed based on SVM regression analysis. This approach outperforms the classical OC3 approach, especially in shallow waters, with a root mean squared error 30% lower. The proposed algorithm enables more accurate assessments of [chl-a] and its variability in this typical oligo- to meso-trophic tropical lagoon, from shallow coastal waters and nearby reefs to deeper waters and in the open ocean.

Projected SST trends across the Caribbean Sea based on PRECIS downscaling of ECHAM4, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The Caribbean Sea and adjacent land areas are highly sensitive to the projected impacts of global climate change. The countries bordering the Caribbean Sea depend heavily on coastal and marine assets as a major source of livelihood support. Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are known to be associated with coral bleaching, ocean acidification, and other phenomena that threaten livelihoods in the region. The paucity of SST systematic observations in both the Caribbean Sea and adjoining Western Atlantic waters is a limiting factor in the projection of future climate change impacts on the region's marine resources. Remote sensing of SST by satellites began only within the last three decades and although the data collected so far might be insufficient to provide conclusive definitions of long-term SST variations in the Caribbean waters, these data along with the output from climate model simulations provide a useful basis for gaining further insights into plausible SST futures under IPCC SRES scenarios. In this paper, we examine the recent SST records from the NESDIS AVHRR satellite data and NOAA Optimum Interpolation (OI) sea surface temperature V2 and provide a comparative analysis of projected SST changes for the Caribbean Sea up to the end of the twenty-first century, under the SRES A2 and B2 scenarios' simulations of the sea surface skin temperatures (SSsT) using the Hadley Centre's regional model, PRECIS. The implications of these projected SST changes for bleaching of coral reefs, one of the region's most valuable marine resource, and for rainfall are also discussed.																	0177-798X	1434-4483				JAN	2016	123	1-2					199	215		10.1007/s00704-014-1346-1								WOS:000368715000016

Classification of Continental Shelves in Terms of Geospatially Integrated Physiographic Realms and Morphodynamic Zones	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The continental shelf off southeast Florida contains a range of benthic environments that are discernible via remote sensing platforms because of low turbidity in the water column. Using the Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS), physiographic realms and associated morphodynamic zones were cognitively interpreted and classified at a nominal scale of 1:6000 across four remote sensing platforms (i.e. GeoEye IKONOS-2, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper UK, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper [ETM], and National Agriculture Imagery Program [NAIP] high-resolution aerial orthoimagery). Attribute tables were created in conjunction with interpretations to quantify and compare spatial relationships between classificatory units and the different remote sensing platforms. Resultant maps exported from ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software showed that while IKONOS-2 satellite imagery and NAIP aerial orthoimagery provided the greatest detail, classification of physiographic realms and morphodynamic zones was still possible using TM and ETM satellite images. Overall, it was determined that IKONOS-2 provided the most beneficial imagery when applying such a classification of coastal and seafloor features. It is postulated that accurate delineation of physiographic realms and morphodynamic zones can provide a foundation for more in-depth biogeomorpholocial classification (e.g., further subdivision into benthic geoforms, coastal landforms, biological cover) along continental shelves.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2016	32	1					1	34		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15A-00003.1								WOS:000368221800001

Our goal was to assess to what extent variation in composition could be explained by habitat and water quality variables. The habitat variables consisted of depth, substrate type and scleractinian coral cover while water quality variables were derived from ocean color satellite imagery, including the colored dissolved organic matter index (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chlor-a) and remote sensing reflectance at 645 nm (Rrs_645). Together, habitat and water quality variables explained from 31% (sediment bacteria) to 80% (forams) of the variation in composition. The variation in composition of corals, sponges, forams and sediment archaea was primarily related to habitat variables, while the variation in composition of sediment bacteria was primarily related to water quality variables. Habitat and water quality variables explained similar amounts of variation in the composition of corals and sediment bacteria. CDOM (sponges, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea), Chlor-a (corals and forams) and Rrs_645 (sponges and forams) proved significant predictors of variation in composition for the studied taxa. In addition to water quality variables, all taxa responded to a range of habitat variables including depth and the percentage cover of various benthic life forms including coral cover variables, rubble and sand. Sand cover was the most important habitat variable for corals, sponges, sediment bacteria and sediment archaea. Coral life forms including the cover of branching and tabular corals were important habitat variables for sponges and forams. These results show marked differences in how various taxa respond to variation in habitat and water quality in the Spermonde Archipelago. Moreover, our results indicate that variables estimated from ocean color satellite imagery proved to be better predictors of variation in marine community composition than commonly-used proxies such as the distance offshore or distance to the nearest river.

J	Saul, S; Purkis, S				Saul, Steven; Purkis, Sam			Semi-Automated Object-Based Classification of Coral Reef Habitat using Discrete Choice Models	REMOTE SENSING												As for terrestrial remote sensing, pixel-based classifiers have traditionally been used to map coral reef habitats. For pixel-based classifiers, habitat assignment is based on the spectral or textural properties of each individual pixel in the scene. More recently, however, object-based classifications, those based on information from a set of contiguous pixels with similar properties, have found favor with the reef mapping community and are starting to be extensively deployed. Object-based classifiers have an advantage over pixel-based in that they are less compromised by the inevitable inhomogeneity in per-pixel spectral response caused, primarily, by variations in water depth. One aspect of the object-based classification workflow is the assignment of each image object to a habitat class on the basis of its spectral, textural, or geometric properties. While a skilled image interpreter can achieve this task accurately through manual editing, full or partial automation is desirable for large-scale reef mapping projects of the magnitude which are useful for marine spatial planning. To this end, this paper trials the use of multinomial logistic discrete choice models to classify coral reef habitats identified through object-based segmentation of satellite imagery. Our results suggest that these models can attain assignment accuracies of about 85%, while also reducing the time needed to produce the map, as compared to manual methods. Limitations of this approach include misclassification of image objects at the interface between some habitat types due to the soft gradation in nature between habitats, the robustness of the segmentation algorithm used, and the selection of a strong training dataset. Finally, due to the probabilistic nature of multinomial logistic models, the analyst can estimate a map of uncertainty associated with the habitat classifications. Quantifying uncertainty is important to the end-user when developing marine spatial planning scenarios and populating spatial models from reef habitat maps.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					15894	15916		10.3390/rs71215810								WOS:000367534000005

Derivation of High-Resolution Bathymetry from Multispectral Satellite Imagery: A Comparison of Empirical and Optimisation Methods through Geographical Error Analysis	REMOTE SENSING												The high importance of bathymetric character for many processes on reefs means that high-resolution bathymetric models are commonly needed by marine scientists and coastal managers. Empirical and optimisation methods provide two approaches for deriving bathymetry from multispectral satellite imagery, which have been refined and widely applied to coral reefs over the last decade. This paper compares these two approaches by means of a geographical error analysis for two sites on the Great Barrier Reef: Lizard Island (a continental island fringing reef) and Sykes Reef (a planar platform reef). The geographical distributions of model residuals (i.e., the difference between modelled and measured water depths) are mapped, and their spatial autocorrelation is calculated as a basis for comparing the performance of the bathymetric models. Comparisons reveal consistent geographical properties of errors arising from both models, including the tendency for positive residuals (i.e., an under-prediction of depth) in shallower areas and negative residuals in deeper areas (i.e., an over-prediction of depth) and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in model errors. A spatial error model is used to generate more reliable estimates of bathymetry by quantifying the spatial structure (autocorrelation) of model error and incorporating this into an improved regression model. Spatial error models improve bathymetric estimates derived from both methods.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16257	16273		10.3390/rs71215829								WOS:000367534000024

Despite the existence of very high-resolution remote sensing technology for nearly two decades, comprehensive assessment of coral reef habitats at national to regional spatial scales and at very high spatial resolution is still scarce. Here, we develop benthic habitat maps at a sub-national scale by analyzing large multispectral QuickBird imagery dataset covering similar to 686 km(2) of the main shallow coral fringing reef along the southern border with Tanzania (4.68 degrees S, 39.18 degrees E) to the reef end at Malindi, Kenya (3.2 degrees S, 40.1 degrees E). Mapping was conducted with a user approach constrained by ground-truth data, with detailed transect lines from the shore to the fore reef. First, maps were used to evaluate the present management system's effectiveness at representing habitat diversity. Then, we developed three spatial prioritization scenarios based on differing objectives: (i) minimize lost fishing opportunity; (ii) redistribute fisheries away from currently overfished reefs; and (iii) minimize resource use conflicts. We further constrained the priority area in each prioritization selection scenario based on optionally protecting the least or the most climate exposed locations using a model of exposure to climate stress. We discovered that spatial priorities were very different based on the different objectives and on whether the aim was to protect the least or most climate-exposed habitats. Our analyses provide a spatially explicit foundation for large-scale conservation and management strategies that can account for ecosystem service benefits.

This can lead to inaccurate retrievals of inherent optical properties (IOPs) in optically shallow water environments. Here, we investigate in situ hyperspectral bottom reflectance signatures and their separability for coral reef waters, when observed at the spectral resolutions of MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors. We use radiative transfer modeling to calculate the effects of bottom reflectance on the remote sensing reflectance signal, and assess detectability and discrimination of common coral reef bottom classes by clustering modeled remote sensing reflectance signals. We assess 8280 scenarios, including four IOPs, 23 depths and 45 bottom classes at MODIS and SeaWiFS bands. Our results show: (i) no significant contamination (R-rscorr < 0.0005) of bottom reflectance on the spectrally-averaged remote sensing reflectance signal at depths >17 m for MODIS and >19 m for SeaWiFS for the brightest spectral reflectance substrate (light sand) in clear reef waters; and (ii) bottom cover classes can be combined into two distinct groups, light and dark, based on the modeled surface reflectance signals. This study establishes that it is possible to efficiently improve parameterization of bottom reflectance and water-column IOP retrievals in shallow water ocean color models for coral reef environments.																	2072-4292					DEC	2015	7	12					16756	16777		10.3390/rs71215852								WOS:000367534000048

Remote sensing applications have progressed significantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantified. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1-6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1% coefficient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10% CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1-3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8% and 37%. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.

These pigments usually vary in presence and concentration and influence the spectral characteristics of corals. We studied the variations in pigment composition among seven Caribbean shallow-water Scleractinian corals by means of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to further resolve the discrimination of corals. We found a total of 27 different pigments among the coral species, including some alteration products of the main pigments. Additionally, pigments typically found in endolithic algae were also identified. A Principal Components Analysis and a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed the separation of coral species based on pigment composition. All the corals were collected under the same physical environmental conditions. This suggests that pigment in the coral's symbionts might be more genetically-determined than influenced by prevailing physical conditions of the reef. We further investigated the use of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) as a tool for estimating the total pigment concentration of reef corals. Depending on the coral species, the Rrs and the total symbiont pigment concentration per coral tissue area correlation showed 79.5-98.5% confidence levels demonstrating its use as a non-invasive robust technique to estimate pigment concentration in studies of coral reef biodiversity and health.																	1932-6203					NOV 30	2015	10	11							e0143709	10.1371/journal.pone.0143709								WOS:000365889800059	26619210

While remote sensing and open water sampling already described the physical nature of this upwelling, the spatial and temporal effects on key parameters and processes in the water column have not been investigated yet, although being highly relevant for coral reef functioning. The present study investigated a range of water parameters on two coral reefs with different exposure to upwelling (Matapalo and Bajo Rojo) in a weekly to monthly resolution over one year (May 2013 to April 2014). Based on air temperature, wind speed and water temperature, three time clusters were defined: a) May to November 2013 without upwelling, b) December 2013 to April 2014 with moderate upwelling, punctuated by c) extreme upwelling events in February, March and April 2014. During upwelling peaks, water temperatures decreased by 7 degrees C (Matapalo) and 9 degrees C (Bajo Rojo) to minima of 20.1 and 15.3 degrees C respectively, while phosphate, ammonia and nitrate concentrations increased 3 to 15-fold to maxima of 1.3 mu mol PO43- L-1, 3.0 mu mol NH4+ L-1 and 9.7 mu mol NO3- L-1. This increased availability of nutrients triggered several successive phytoplankton blooms as indicated by 3-(Matapalo) and 6-fold (Bajo Rojo) increases in chlorophyll a concentrations. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON) increased by 40 and 70% respectively from February to April 2014. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 70% in December and stayed elevated for at least 4 months, indicating high organic matter release by primary producers.

Mapping and monitoring of land use/land cover changes in Neil Island (South Andaman) using geospatial approaches	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Present study examines the dynamics of land use/land cover changes to Neil Island, South Andaman using Remote Sensing and GIS for a period of 13 years. Geocoded satellite imageries of Landsat TM (2000) and Landsat ETM 8 (2013) were used to identify the changes between 2000 and 2013. Visual interpretation technique was carried out to identify the features from the satellite imagery along with ground truth verifications. Land use categories such as forest area, mangroves, coral reefs, sandy beach, water body and built-up land have been identified and mapped. The present status (2013) of these resources is as follows: forest area 735.17 ha (40.17%), built-up land covers 601.15 ha (32.85%), coral reef covers an area of 441.00 ha (24.10%), mangroves covers 34.03 ha (1.86%) and sandy beach covers 16.15 ha (0.88%). Forest area was the largest component of land use feature which shows a significant change from 2000 to 2013. Aerial extent of coral reef and mangroves was decreased to 9.21 ha and 2.32 ha respectively.

The challenges of designing a metadata standard that meets the unique requirements of specific user communities are examined, including in situ measurement of reflectance underwater, using coral as a case in point. Metadata schema mappings from seven existing metadata standards demonstrate that they consistently fail to meet the needs of field spectroscopy scientists for general and specific applications ( = 22%, sigma = 32% conformance with the core metadata requirements and = 19%, sigma = 18% for the special case of a benthic (e.g., coral) reflectance metadataset). Issues such as field measurement methods, instrument calibration, and data representativeness for marine field spectroscopy campaigns are investigated within the context of submerged benthic measurements. The implication of semantics and syntax for a robust and flexible metadata standard are also considered. A hybrid standard that serves as a best of breed incorporating useful modules and parameters within the standards is proposed. This paper is Part 3 in a series of papers in this journal, examining the issues central to a metadata standard for field spectroscopy datasets. The results presented in this paper are an important step towards field spectroscopy metadata standards that address the specific needs of field spectroscopy data stakeholders while facilitating dataset documentation, quality assurance, discoverability and data exchange within large-scale information sharing platforms.

Towards an integration of scale and complexity in marine ecology	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Manipulative field experiments provide a window into the complexity of nature. Yet there is concern that we lack resolution by conducting experiments on a scale that is too small and short to include the relevant complexity of the study system. We addressed this issue by asking how and why the scale (local and global spatial extent, spatial grain, duration) and complexity (number of species, factors, treatment combinations) of experiments performed on marine hard substrata (rocky intertidal, RI; coral reef, CR; rocky subtidal, RS; mangrove root, MR) has changed by assessing 311 total experiments published since 1961 in Ecology and Ecological Monographs and since 1967 in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We show that the local spatial extent and all metrics of complexity increased as a positive, log-linear function of time. In contrast, the size of experimental units (spatial grain) decreased with time. Quantile regression analysis revealed that these trends are largely driven by changes in the upper bounds of experimental scale and complexity; most studies are still relatively simple in design and conducted over small areas. A structural equation model (SEM) incorporated the direct and indirect effects of six metrics indicating that the complexity of field experiments has increased both as a direct effect of time and because experiments have become smaller in spatial grain. The SEM also showed longer experiments tended to be more complex. We show striking habitat differences, as subtidal experiments (CR, RS) involved more species and were carried out on the largest global spatial scales. RI experiments were the longest. Future prospects to incorporate more of the complexity of nature into field experiments include site replication, as only 34.7% of all experiments were conducted at more than one site, open experimental designs monitored by technology, and integrating experimental manipulations with long-term monitoring to achieve mechanistic insight across scales relevant to human alteration of the biosphere. The increasing resolution of remote sensing also creates opportunities to track experiment-driven changes in community structure across large scales. We suggest applying these methods to a wider class of problems to enhance our understanding of marine communities and ecosystems.

Assessment of South Sinai Coastal Vulnerability to Climate Change	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Coastal vulnerability assessment is important to help achieve the sustainable use of coastal resources and to incorporate coastal hazards into coastal planning and decision making for integrated management. This study applied the coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to delineate susceptibility of the South Sinai coastline to climate change. The following variables pertaining to inherent shoreline characteristics were used in the assessment of the CVI: coastal slope, coastal geomorphology, fauna/flora, and socioeconomic factors. GIS and remote sensing analysis were employed to extract intrinsic attributes of the coast in this study area. Results showed that about one half of the 635-km-long coastline is exposed to high and very high coastal vulnerability to climate change, and global warming could exacerbate biologic suffering in the region. The Gulf of Suez is likely to be more vulnerable than the Gulf of Aqaba. Most areas susceptible to climate change include gentle, unconsolidated, coral assemblages and inhabited coastal segments. Coastal zone managers should implement remediation plans for any anticipated ecosystem disruption episodes.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2015	31	6					1469	1477		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14-00018.1								WOS:000364260600016

Cumulative pressures from extreme weather with a high frequency of large scale flooding in recent years has been linked to the large scale reported decline in the health of inshore seagrass systems and coral reefs in the central areas of the GBR, with concerns for the recovery potential of these impacted ecosystems. Management authorities currently rely on remotely-sensed (RS) and in situ data for water quality monitoring to guide their assessment of water quality conditions in the GBR. The use of remotely-sensed satellite products provides a quantitative and accessible tool for scientists and managers. These products, coupled with in situ data, and more recently modelled data, are valuable for quantifying the influence of river plumes on seagrass and coral reef habitat in the GBR. This article reviews recent remote sensing techniques developed to monitor river plumes and water quality in the GBR. We also discuss emerging research that integrates hydrodynamic models with remote sensing and in situ data, enabling us to explore impacts of different catchment management strategies on GBR water quality.

A Method to Analyze the Potential of Optical Remote Sensing for Benthic Habitat Mapping	Remote Sensing												Quantifying the number and type of benthic classes that are able to be spectrally identified in shallow water remote sensing is important in understanding its potential for habitat mapping. Factors that impact the effectiveness of shallow water habitat mapping include water column turbidity, depth, sensor and environmental noise, spectral resolution of the sensor and spectral variability of the benthic classes. In this paper, we present a simple hierarchical clustering method coupled with a shallow water forward model to generate water-column specific spectral libraries. This technique requires no prior decision on the number of classes to output: the resultant classes are optically separable above the spectral noise introduced by the sensor, image based radiometric corrections, the benthos' natural spectral variability and the attenuating properties of a variable water column at depth. The modeling reveals the effect reducing the spectral resolution has on the number and type of classes that are optically distinct. We illustrate the potential of this clustering algorithm in an analysis of the conditions, including clustering accuracy, sensor spectral resolution and water column optical properties and depth that enabled the spectral distinction of the seagrass Amphibolis antartica from benthic algae.

Submerged fossil reefs discovered beyond the limit of modern reef growth in the Pacific Ocean	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Balls Pyramid is the southernmost island in a linear island chain in the southwest Pacific Ocean, 24 km south of the limit of known coral reef formation at Lord Howe Island. This paper describes the geomorphometric structure of the shelf surrounding Balls Pyramid through the application of remote sensing data to create a high-resolution digital elevation model of the shelf (5 m cell size) and seafloor feature classification. Seafloor features were delineated using the bathymetry model together with slope, backscatter and sub-bottom profile data. The average depth of the 260.6 km(2) shelf was 55 m (+/- 21 m), with the majority of shelf area (77%) within 30-60 m water depth. Dominating the shelf is an extensive, mid-shelf reef at 30-50 m depth, dissected by basin and channel features. Outer-shelf reef and platform features surround the mid shelf, with terrace sequences marking the seaward outer-shelf rim in 65-100 m depth. Sub-bottom profiles and badacatter data demonstrate substantial accumulation (up to 16.5 m) of unconsolidated sediments within basin and channel features. The submerged mid-shelf reefs of Balls Pyramid are similar to the fossil coral reef system discovered on the Lord Howe Island shelf, implying origins as a drowned coral reef system. This paper reveals complex shelf topography with extensive submerged reefs on what was previously considered to be a planated volcanic shelf outside of reef-forming seas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial scale and geographic context in benthic habitat mapping: review and future directions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding the effects of scale is essential to the understanding of natural ecosystems, particularly in marine environments where sampling is more limited and sporadic than in terrestrial environments. Despite its recognized importance, scale is rarely considered in benthic habitat mapping studies. Lack of explicit statement of scale in the literature is an impediment to better characterization of seafloor pattern and process. This review paper highlights the importance of incorporating ecological scaling and geographical theories in benthic habitat mapping. It reviews notions of ecological scale and benthic habitat mapping, in addition to the way spatial scale influences patterns and processes in benthic habitats. We address how scale is represented in geographic data, how it influences their analysis, and consequently how it influences our understanding of seafloor ecosystems. We conclude that quantification of ecological processes at multiple scales using spatial statistics is needed to gain a better characterization of species-habitat relationships. We offer recommendations on more effective practices in benthic habitat mapping, including sampling that covers multiple spatial scales and that includes as many environmental variables as possible, adopting continuum-based habitat characterization approaches, using statistical analyses that consider the spatial nature of data, and explicit statement of the scale at which the research was conducted. We recommend a set of improved standards for defining benthic habitat. With these standards benthic habitats can be defined as 'areas of seabed that are (geo)statistically significantly different from their surroundings in terms of physical, chemical and biological characteristics, when observed at particular spatial and temporal scales'.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015						
J	Hereher, ME				Hereher, Mohamed E.			Assessment of Egypt's Red Sea coastal sensitivity to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A coastal sensitivity index (CSI) was developed to assess the response of the Red Sea coast in Egypt to climate change in terms of sea level rise and global warming. Six different variables pertaining to the intrinsic characteristics of the coast that extends to 1200 km were utilized, notably: coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, width of the coastal plain, shoreline exposure, fauna/flora and land use. Data have been extracted, manipulated and presented using remote sensing and GIS analysis. The resulting coastal sensitivity map depicts the susceptibility levels of the Red Sea coastal plain to climate change. The most severely sensitive segments (very high CSI) account for 31 % (365 km) of the coast. They occur across unconsolidated, flat, wide, exposed, ecologically effective and/or inhabited coasts. On the other hand, the least sensitive (low CSI) coastal segments total 245 km (20 %) and are mainly rocky, steep, narrow, barren and/or inaccessible shores. Eustatic sea level rise by 1 m should inundate a coastal area of 106 km(2), whereas a sudden tsunami of 5 m height should overwhelm 724 km(2), particularly at the southern section near Shalateen. Global warming of seawater should impact the coastal zone between Hurghada and Marsa Alam (270 km long) due to the occurrence of fringing coral reef systems. The coastal sensitivity index provides a synoptic overview that could help prioritize emergency plans and protection strategies to reduce the ramifications of climate change.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2015	74	4					2831	2843		10.1007/s12665-015-4304-z								WOS:000358320700004

Measuring coral reef terrain roughness using 'Structure-from-Motion' close-range photogrammetry	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Our understanding of Earth surface processes is rapidly advancing as new remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR and close-range digital photogrammetry become more accessible and affordable. A very-high spatial resolution digital terrain model (DTM) and orthophoto mosaic (mm scale) were produced using close-range digital photogrammetry based on 'Structure-from-Motion' (SfM) algorithms for a 250 m transect along a shallow coral reef flat on Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef. The precise terrain data were used to characterise surface roughness, a critical factor affecting ecological and physical processes on the reef. Three roughness parameters, namely the root mean square height, tortuosity (or rugosity) and fractal dimension, were derived and compared in order to asses which one better characterises reef flat roughness. The typical relief across the shallow reef flat was 0.1 m with a maximum value of 0.42 m. Coral reef terrain roughness, as characterised by the three chosen parameters, generally increased towards the middle of the transect where live coral covers most of the reef flat and decreases towards the edges of the transect. The fractal dimension (values ranging from 2.2 to 2.59) best characterised reef roughness, as evidenced by a closer agreement with the distribution of known coral benthic substrates. This is the first study quantifying scale-independent roughness of a coral reef at benthic and biotope/patch levels (cm-m). The readily available and cost-effective methods presented are highly appropriate for data collection, processing and analysis to generate very-high spatial resolution DTMs and orthophoto mosaics of shallow and energetic coral reefs.

J	Hamylton, SM; Puotinen, M				Hamylton, Sarah M.; Puotinen, Marji			A meta-analysis of reef island response to environmental change on the Great Barrier Reef	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Reef islands on the Great Barrier Reef are influenced by a range of environmental factors. A meta-analysis of 103 islands is presented to express variation in island size (area and volume) as a function of latitudinal and cross shelf gradients in regional oceanographic factors (exposure to incident waves, tidal range and tropical cyclone frequency) and local physical factors (position on the shelf, area, length and depth of supporting reef platform, vegetative cover). Models performed well for unvegetated sandcays (R-2=0.89), vegetated sandcays (R-2=072) and low wooded islands (R-2=0.78), with a moderate level of variation explained when all islands were simultaneously regressed (R-2=0.58). Future island dynamics were simulated for anticipated changes in cyclone regime, wave activity and sea level. For 38 islands mapped on the 1973 Royal Society and Universities of Queensland Expedition to the Northern Great Barrier Reef, change over the same 22year period (1973-1995) was determined and the relative magnitude of observed and modelled changes was compared and found to be consistent through rank correlation analysis (=0.84 for unvegetated sandcays, =0.81 for vegetated sandcays). Simulations of island area or volume change from 2000 to 2100 indicated that under a 30% decrease in tropical cyclone activity, unvegetated sandcays continue to accrete at a lower rate, whereas all island types erode under a 38% increase in tropical cyclone activity. Vegetated sandcays initially accrete at higher levels of cyclone activity, entering an erosive state with a 60% increase in activity. Low wooded islands are unresponsive to environmental changes modelled. A sensitivity analysis of vegetated and unvegetated sandcays indicated that the presence of vegetation increases the tropical cyclone activity threshold at which islands begin to erode. Greatest sedimentary losses occur within the central band of high cyclone activity between Cooktown and Mackay. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Using the co-seismic displacement field and AK135 spherical layered Earth model, we invert co-seismic slip distribution along the seismic fault. We also search the best fault geometry model to fit the observed data. Assuming that the dip angle linearly increases in downward direction, the postfit residual variation of the inversed geometry model with dip angles linearly changing along fault strike are plotted. The geometry model with local minimum misfits is the one with dip angle linearly increasing along strike from 4.3 degrees in top southernmost patch to 4.5 degrees in top northernmost path and dip angle linearly increased. By using the fault shape and geodetic co-seismic data, we estimate the slip distribution on the curved fault. Our result shows that the earthquake ruptured similar to 200-km width down to a depth of about 60 km. 0.5-12.5 m of thrust slip is resolved with the largest slip centered around the central section of the rupture zone 7 degrees N-10 degrees N in latitude. The estimated seismic moment is 8.2 x 10(22) N m, which is larger than estimation from the centroid moment magnitude (4.0 x 10(22) N m), and smaller than estimation from normal-mode oscillation data modeling (1.0 x 10(23) N m).																	1674-4519	1867-8777				JUN	2015	28	3					187	195		10.1007/s11589-015-0119-y								WOS:000363676500003

On the Detection and Monitoring of the Transport of an Asian Dust Storm Using Multi-Sensor Satellite Remote Sensing	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Dynamical and physical features of a long range transported dust event originating in China affecting Korea early March 2008 are examined using an integrative multi-sensor and multi-algorithm approach. Aerosol loadings and their size mode were analyzed over both ocean and land surfaces using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD), employing standard dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithms, and the Angstrom exponent (AE). Anthropogenic absorbing aerosols and smoke were found to be significant over the Indochina Peninsula, the Philippines and southern China, while a mixture of dust and pollution were predominant over central to northern China, as identified by the AE analysis and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) spherecitiy and plume height. Remarkable aerosol absorptions in both the near ultraviolet (UV) and the visible were spread over central, central western and northern China, probably due to aerosol mixtures including desert dust and industrial pollution as well as smoke from biomass burning as evidenced from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Long range transport is validated as dust storm reached up to 4-5 km vertically and a mixed cloud layer was identified over the Yellow Sea as disclosed by the vertical structure of dust aerosols as well as observed aerosols subtypes from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). The real time detection and monitoring of the dust outbreak and its subsequent evolution are available through the infrared optical depth index (IODI), developed from the MTSAT-1R geostationary satellite imager.

Because conventional research methods were not practical for this purpose due to the lack of a geospatial perspective, we attempted to develop a research method integrating visual fish observation with a seabed habitat map and to expand knowledge to a two-dimensional scale. WorldView-2 satellite imagery of Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia obtained in September 2012 was analyzed and classified into four typical substrates: live coral, dead coral, seagrass and sand. Overall classification accuracy of this map was 81.3% and considered precise enough for subsequent analyses. Three sub-areas (CC: continuous coral reef, BC: boundary of coral reef and FC: few live coral zone) around reef slopes were extracted from the map. Visual transect surveys for several fish species were conducted within each sub-area in June 2013. As a result, Mean density (Ind. / 300 m(2)) of Chaetodon octofasciatus, known as an obligate feeder of corals, was significantly higher at BC than at the others (p < 0.05), implying that this species' density is strongly influenced by spatial configuration of its habitat, like the "edge effect." This indicates that future conservation procedures for coral reef fishes should consider not only coral cover but also its spatial configuration. The present study also indicates that the introduction of a geospatial perspective derived from remote sensing has great potential to progress conventional ecological studies on coral reef fishes.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					343	352		10.1007/s12601-015-0032-2								WOS:000357691000023						
J	Caras, T; Karnieli, A				Caras, Tamir; Karnieli, Arnon			Ground-Level Classification of a Coral Reef Using a Hyperspectral Camera	REMOTE SENSING												Especially in the remote sensing context, thematic classification is a desired product for coral reef surveys. This study presents a novel statistical-based image classification approach, namely Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), capable of doing so. Three classification models were built and implemented for the images while the fourth was a combination of spectra from all three images together. The classification was optimised by using pre-processing transformations (PPTs) and post-classification low-pass filtering. Despite the fact that the images were acquired under different conditions and quality, the best classification model was achieved by combining spectral training samples from three images (accuracy 0.63 for all classes). PPTs improved the classification accuracy by 5%-15% and post-classification treatments further increased the final accuracy by 10%-20%. The fourth classification model was the most accurate one, suggesting that combining spectra from differ conditions improves thematic classification. Despite some limitations, available aerial sensors already provide an opportunity to implement the described classification and mark the next investigation step. Nonetheless, the findings of this study are relevant both to the field of remote sensing in general and to the niche of coral reef spectroscopy.																	2072-4292					JUN	2015	7	6					7521	7544		10.3390/rs70607521								WOS:000357590300001						
J	Zhang, CY				Zhang, Caiyun			Applying data fusion techniques for benthic habitat mapping and monitoring in a coral reef ecosystem	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Accurate mapping and effective monitoring of benthic habitat in the Florida Keys are critical in developing management strategies for this valuable coral reef ecosystem. For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetiy data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5% and 83.5% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.

Of particular concern have been temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and photosynthetically available radiation. Satellite observation systems allow synoptic-scale monitoring of coral environments that can be used to investigate the effects of such environmental parameters. Recent advancements in algorithm development for new satellite data products have made it possible to include light availability in such monitoring. Long-term satellite data (2000-2013), in combination with in situ bleaching surveys (N = 3,334; spanning 2003-2012), were used to identify the environmental factors contributing to bleaching of Florida reef tract corals. Stepwise multiple linear regression supports the conclusion that elevated sea surface temperature (SST; partial R (adj) (2) = 0.13; p < 0.001) and high visible light levels reaching the benthos (partial R (adj) (2) = 0.06; p < 0.001) each independently contributed to coral bleaching. The effect of SST was modulated by significant interactions with wind speed (partial R (adj) (2) = 0.03; p < 0.001) and ultraviolet benthic available light (partial R (adj) (2) = 0.01; p = 0.022). These relationships were combined via canonical analysis of principal coordinates to create a predictive model of coral reef bleaching for the region. This model predicted 'severe bleaching' and 'no bleaching' conditions with 69 and 57 % classification success, respectively. This was approximately 2.5 times greater than that predicted by chance and shows improvement over similar models created using only temperature data. The results enhance the understanding of the factors contributing to coral bleaching and allow for weekly assessment of historical and current bleaching stress.

High swells frequently remove algae from their substratum, floating algae concentrate due to local currents in specific lagoon locations, and large compact rafts eventually form. A study of the prospective industrial use of drifting algae was conducted, including estimates of biomass, biomass renewal and agronomical trials. Harvesting rafts could efficiently limit the geographic expansion of proliferating populations and their associated nuisance. The drifting biomass in rafts around Moorea Island was estimated at 13,062 +/- 1,998 kg dry mass based on aerial photographs acquired on 31 August 1997. To measure the renewal rate and temporal variation of the raft biomass, we completely harvested one of the larger rafts in February 2002, which was quickly renewed within 10 days. In situ and airborne assessments of biomass show a range of variation between 178 kg and 8.5 t of dry algae. Steady resource availability is required for industrial exploitation, and we demonstrate that drifting algae represent a valuable and significant renewable resource for French Polynesia. Moreover, agronomical enrichment trials using drifting algae as organic additives gave promising perspectives for agriculture uses, with an increase in size, dry mass and root development for maize plants.

The main objective of this study is to provide an environmental (coastal vegetation and coral reef condition) and socioeconomic (human population condition) baseline data of a poorly documented and weakly managed zone by the use of a set of rapid assessment methodologies, looking to assist the regional efforts to manage these coastal resources. To achieve this goal we used a series of surveying methods including remote sensing, geographic information systems and in situ land/underwater surveys, to allow a broad characterization of the resources' condition in the study zone. Results showed that reef habitat was dominated by macro-algae (61.2 +/- 7.6%), followed by soft coral (gorgonians, 12.4 +/- 4.1%), hard coral (8.2 +/- 5.1%) and sponges (2.5 +/- 1.3%). Zooanthids and tunicates represented less than 1% of the total; coral and macro algae estimates suggest a decline from records of 15 years ago. Highest fish densities were (144 +/- 124 individuals/100 m(2)), while lowest were (83 +/- 25 individuals/100 m(2)). The total average fish density recorded could also be reflecting a decrease trend in the reef community structure. The main economic activities in the area are fishing and land clearing. From December 2003, 22% (corresponding to 44 ha) of the total original vegetation cover in the studied area was deforested. By February 2007, the deforested area increased 4.4 ha more. Should this tendency continue, by 2025 it would only maintain 24% of its total coastal vegetation cover representing a huge habitat loss. The future of economic activities in these areas lie directly on the establishment of appropriate management strategies for the protection and conservation of the renowned biodiversity that this area comprises.

Using remote sensing to monitor the influence of river discharge on watershed outlets and adjacent coral Reefs: Magdalena River and Rosario Islands, Colombia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Worldwide, coral reef ecosystems are being increasingly threatened by sediments loads from river discharges, which in turn are influenced by changing rainfall patterns due to climate change and by growing human activity in their watersheds. In this case study, we explored the applicability of using remote sensing (RS) technology to estimate and monitor the relationship between water quality at the coral reefs around the Rosario Islands, in the Caribbean Sea, and the rainfall patterns in the Magdalena River watershed. From the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), this study used the water surface reflectance product (MOD09GQ) to estimate water surface reflectance as a proxy for sediment concentration and the land cover product (MCD12Q1 V51) to characterize land cover of the watershed. Rainfall was estimated by using the 3B43 V7 product from the Tropical Rainforest Measuring Mission (TRMM). For the first trimester of each year, we investigated the inter-annual temporal variation in water surface reflectance at the Rosario Islands and at the three main mouths of the Magdalena River watershed. No increasing or decreasing trends of water surface reflectance were detected for any of the sites for the study period 2001-2014 (p > 0.05) but significant correlations were detected among the trends of each site at the watershed mouths (r = 0.57-0.90, p < 0.05) and between them and the inter-annual variation in rainfall on the watershed (r = 0.63-0.67,p < 0.05). Those trimesters with above-normal water surface reflectance at the mouths and above-normal rainfall at the watershed coincided with La Nina conditions while the opposite was the case during El Nino conditions. Although, a preliminary analysis of inter-annual land cover trends found only cropland cover in the watershed to be significantly correlated with water surface reflectance at two of the watershed mouths (r = 0.58 and 0.63, p < 0.05), the validation analysis draw only a 40.7% of accuracy in this land cover classification. This requires further analysis to confirm the impact of the cropland on the water quality at the watershed outlets. Spatial analysis with MOD09GQ imagery detected the overpass of river plumes from Barbacoas Bay over the Rosario Islands waters. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The timing (phenology) and magnitude of the phytoplankton biomass are major determinants of trophic interactions. The Red Sea is one of the warmest and most saline basins in the world, characterized by an arid tropical climate regulated by the monsoon. These extreme conditions are particularly challenging for marine life. Phytoplankton phenological indices provide objective and quantitative metrics to characterize phytoplankton seasonality. The indices i.e. timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration are estimated here using 15 years (1997-2012) of remote sensing ocean-color data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative project (OC-CCI) in the entire Red Sea basin. The OC-CCI product, comprising merged and bias-corrected observations from three independent ocean-color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS), and processed using the POLYMER algorithm (MERIS period), shows a significant increase in chlorophyll data coverage, especially in the southern Red Sea during the months of summer NW monsoon. In open and reef-bound coastal waters, the performance of OC-CCI chlorophyll data is shown to be comparable with the performance of other standard chlorophyll products for the global oceans. These features have permitted us to investigate phytoplankton phenology in the entire Red Sea basin, and during both winter SE monsoon and summer NW monsoon periods. The phenological indices are estimated in the four open water provinces of the basin, and further examined at six coral reef complexes of particular socio-economic importance in the Red Sea, including Siyal Islands, Shams El Sheikh, Al Wajh bank, Thuwal reefs, Al Lith reefs and Farasan Islands. Most of the open and deeper waters of the basin show an apparent higher chlorophyll concentration and longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the winter period (relative to the summer phytoplankton growth period). In contrast, most of the reef-bound coastal waters display equal or higher peak chlorophyll concentrations and equal or longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the summer period (relative to the winter phytoplankton growth period). The ecological and biological significance of the phytoplankton seasonal characteristics are discussed in context of ecosystem state assessment, and particularly to support further understanding of the structure and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in the Red Sea.

J	Yang, CY; Yang, DT				Yang, Chaoyu; Yang, Dingtian			An Improved Empirical Model for Retrieving Bottom Reflectance in Optically Shallow Water	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote sensing has become an essential observing system to obtain comprehensive information on the status of coastal habitats. However, a significant challenge in remote sensing of optically shallow water is to correct the effects of the water column. This challenge becomes particularly difficult due to the spatial and temporal variability of water optical properties. In order to model the light distribution for optically shallow water and retrieve the bottom reflectance, a parameterized model was proposed by introducing an important adjusted factor g. The synthetic data sets generated by HYDROLIGHT were utilized to train a neural network (NN) and then to derive the adjustable parameter values. The parameter g was found to vary with water depth, water optical properties, and bottom reflectance. Specifically, it revealed two obvious patterns among the different benthic habitat types. In coral reef, seagrass, and macrophyte habitats, g exhibited a remarkable peak at about 550 nm. The peak has a value of about 2.47-2.49. In white sand or hardpan habitats, g spectra are relatively flat. The semi-empirical model was applied to calculate the bottom reflectance from the new weighting factor, the downward diffuse attenuation coefficient, and the irradiance reflectance just below the sea surface collected in Sanya Bay in 2008 and 2009. Good agreement between the predicted and measured values demonstrated that the weighting factor g is an effective tool to modify the model for interpreting and predicting bottom reflectance without the need for any localized input (R-2 > 0.79).																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAR	2015	8	3					1266	1273		10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2398898								WOS:000352279200030

Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS): A New Method for Cognitively Interpreting Benthic Biogeomorphological Features	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Because benthic environments show ecotonal successions that biophysically fuse geomorphological units with biological coverages, there is a need for cognitive biogeomorphological classification methods. This study introduces a new geospatially integrated seafloor classification scheme (G-ISCS) methodology for cognitively interpreting geomorphological components and dominant biological covers from a variety of remotely sensed imagery within a geographic information system interface. An ordered, hierarchical classification scheme was thus developed to discriminate various categories such as physiographic realm, morphodynamic zone, geoform, landform, dominant surface sediment, dominant biological cover, and density of dominant biological cover. When applying the G-ISCS method to multispectral satellite imagery (e. g., GeoEye IKONOS-2), individual raw scenes were imported into IDRISI (c) Taiga to enhance frequency distributions of spectral reflectance through contrast stretching. Image enhancement was applied to blue, green, and red wavelength bands and combined to create 24-bit color composite images that were suitable for interpretation. Using ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software, raster catalogs were created for enhanced imagery data sets and projected on an interactive SmartBoard (R) overlay system for real-time, on-screen digitizing of seafloor feature boundaries at a nominal scale of 1:6000. Differentiation of marine environments was based on spectral reflectance characteristics of color, tone, saturation, pattern, and texture of the seafloor topology. Individual thematic subset maps were then created by hierarchical category and amalgamated in ArcMap to create interactive benthic environment maps. Attribute tables were compiled in conjugation with thematic map products to quantify relationships between mapping units, as well as to generate accurate biogeomorphological spatial statistics. Overall, the new G-ISCS method can be applied across multiple remote sensing platforms to cognitively delineate and interpret benthic biogeomorphological features along shelf environments.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					488	504		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14A-00007.1								WOS:000350575300026

We proposed the first biophysical environmental delineation of the SBS using globally available satellite remote sensing and model-assimilated data to categorize this area into unique and meaningful biophysical classes. Specifically, the SBS was partitioned into eight biophysical classes characterized by similar sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, currents, and salinity patterns. Areas within each class were expected to have similar habitat types and ecosystem functions. Our work supplemented prevailing global marine management schemes by focusing in on a regional scale with finer spatial resolution. It also provided a baseline for academic research, ecological assessments and will facilitate marine spatial planning and conservation activities in the area. In addition, the framework and methods of delineating biophysical environments we presented can be expanded throughout the whole Coral Triangle to support research and conservation activities in this important region.

Spatial and temporal variability of seagrass at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef	BOTANICA MARINA												Increasing threats to natural ecosystems from local and global stressors are reinforcing the need for baseline data on the distribution and abundance of organisms. We quantified spatial and/or temporal patterns of seagrass distribution, shoot density, leaf area index, biomass, productivity, and sediment carbon content in shallow water (0-5 m) at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in field surveys conducted in December 2011 and October 2012. Seagrass meadows were mapped using satellite imagery and field validation. A total of 18.3 ha of seagrass, composed primarily of Thalassia hemprichii and Halodule uninervis, was mapped in shallow water. This was 46% less than the area of seagrass in the same region reported in 1995, although variations in mapping methods may have influenced the magnitude of change detected. There was inter-annual variability in shoot density and length, with values for both higher in 2011 than in 2012. Seagrass properties and sediment carbon content were representative of shallow-water seagrass meadows on a mid-shelf Great Barrier Reef island. The data can be used to evaluate change, to parameterize models of the impact of anthropogenic or environmental variability on seagrass distribution and abundance, and to assess the success of management actions.

Unravelling the influence of water depth and wave energy on the facies diversity of shelf carbonates	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Carbonate sequence stratigraphy is founded on the principle that changes in relative sea-level are recorded in the rock record by the accumulation of sediment with relative water depth-dependent attributes. While at the scale of a shelf to basin transect, facies clearly arrange by water depth, the relation blurs for depths<40m, the most vigorous zone of carbonate production. The reason for this change in behaviour is two-fold. Firstly, in shallow water, the intrinsic processes of storm and wave reworking influence the seabed through submarine erosion and sediment redistribution. Secondly, facies diversity tends to be greater in shallow water than deep water because of a greater diversity in grain producers. Remote sensing imagery, field observations and hydrodynamic models for two reef-rimmed shore-attached carbonate platforms in the Red Sea show neither water depth nor energy regime to be reliable indicators of facies type when considered in isolation. Considered together, however, the predictive power of the two variables rises significantly. The results demonstrate it to be an oversimplification to assume a direct link between palaeo-water depth and depositional diversity of subtidal lithofacies, while highlighting the importance of hydrodynamics in directing the accumulation of carbonate sediments in the shallow photic zone. While the size distributions of facies extents in the two focus areas follow power laws, no direct relation between the lateral continuity of the facies belts and water depth or wave height is reported. The work is relevant for the interpretation of metre-scale subtidal carbonate cycles throughout the geological record by demonstrating how caution must be applied when inferring palaeo-water depths from depositional facies.																	0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2015	62	2			SI		541	565		10.1111/sed.12110								WOS:000348925300006

Airborne hyperspectral data to assess suspended particulate matter and aquatic vegetation in a shallow and turbid lake	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												This paper presents an application of a physic-based method that relies on spectral inversion procedures to simultaneously estimate concentrations of water constituents, water column heights (cH) and benthic substrate types in Lake Trasimeno (Italy) from airborne imaging spectrometry. Complex waters of this lake are challenging due to the coexistence of optically-deep turbid waters and of optically-shallow waters, mostly characterised by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds. Airborne data acquired on 12 May 2009 by Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) were converted into remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) with the atmospheric correction code ATCOR. A spectral inversion procedure implementing a bio-optical model (namely BOMBER), parameterised with in-situ-data; was-firstly run-to-retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (i.e. a(CDOM)(440)) in the optically-deep waters. The areas where the retrieved optimisation error was higher than 10% were instead assumed as optically-shallow. In these areas two maps depicting the linear unmixing of three substrate types (i.e., siltyclay, Chara ssp. and other hydrophyte) and the water column heights were produced. The MIVIS-derived products were validated with field data providing a reliable estimation of SPM, chl-a, a(CDOM)(440) and cH (determination coefficients always R-2 > 0.7). SPM concentrations were also similar to a 5.4-km long transect of flow-through turbidity data, and the SAV map was comparable to in situ observations. Generally, the colonisation patterns of SAV were reflecting the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. In particular, the positive role of Chara on keeping SPM concentrations low was observed. Future research should extend this application to remote sensing data acquired in other seasons to trace the dynamics of SAV and its effect on spatial water clarity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

BENTHIC HABITAT MAPPING AND BIODIVERSITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRIMEIRAS AND SEGUNDAS ARCHIPELAGO RESERVE	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago Reserve is a recently established marine protected area, the largest in Africa, located in the waters of Northern Mozambique. This protected area is of significant local economic importance and global ecological relevance, containing the southernmost coral reefs in Eastern Africa. However, information related to the marine ecosystem, notably benthic habitat is very scarce. Twelve atolls were mapped in the region using object-based image classification of very-high resolution satellite imagery (IKONOS, Quickbird, and WorldView-2). Geographically referenced data on benthic cover and depth were gathered in the course of three fieldwork expeditions covering a total of four atolls and two shallow reef structures in the Segundas Archipelago. The resulting map allows the estimation of three distinct types of coral cover (field, patches, spurs and grooves); the differentiation of sand, rubble and rock substrate; and the detection of seagrass and brown macroalgae, identifying up to 24 benthic habitats. Average overall accuracy was above 50%. The high variability of the optical properties on the reef systems, in large due to the connectivity with the mainland via plumes, while interesting from an ecological perspective increases the challenges for remote sensing of bottom cover. New information indicates the presence of deep benthic cover extending from the atolls, suggesting the need for further research on Coastal Eastern African corals, namely on their resilience and connectivity, and supporting current knowledge of the existence of an almost continuous coral reef from Kenya to Mozambique. Coral and fish biodiversity data have been analysed together with the satellite-derived maps. Results support the local perception that ecosystems are in decline and uncover new information about biodiversity's spatial patterns. Our work provides a detailed depiction of marine habitats that may aid the management of the protected area, namely in the definition of fishing zones and coral cover monitoring.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					1009	1016		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1009-2015								WOS:000380531900150

There are a few studies that have been published validating a methodology for mapping SAV on brown macroalgae (Sargassum spp., Ecklonia spp.), seagrasses, and/or other macroalgae groups by spectral response from remote sensing. Hence, we studied the in-situ optical properties of living macroalgae, seagrasses, and rubble. The spectral characteristics of varied SAV groups were measured using the high resolution FieldSpec (R) 4 Hi-Res portable spectroradiometer. The study site selected was the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Rockingham, Western Australia as it is one of the fifteen biodiversity hotspots in Australia. Correlation and Principle Component Analysis were employed to evaluate the differences between SAV groups. The results have documented the spectral features of SAV and their associated habitats in Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Western Australia, and developed a spectral library to distinguish among seagrass species and algae groups (green, red, and brown benthic macroalgae). The implications of this study will contribute to estimate and detect the distribution and seasonal variation of SAV on a broader scale.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000227						
J	Yoshimura, K				Yoshimura, Kei			Stable Water Isotopes in Climatology, Meteorology, and Hydrology: A Review	JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN												Recent advancements in the measurement and modeling of heavy stable water isotopes (i.e., (H2O)-O-18 and HDO), especially in situ and remote sensing spectroscopic vapor isotope measurements and isotope-incorporated general circulation and regional models, have rapidly improved our understanding of the behavior of water isotopes on Earth. These advancements have significantly increased the recognition of the usefulness of information on stable water isotopes in the geoscience community. This study reviews these recent advancements and their applications in climatological, meteorological, and hydrological sciences. It also explores two emerging directions. The first is the direct validation of climate models using independent isotopic proxy data. I particularly discuss comparisons of the 20th Century Isotope Reanalysis dataset, which covers 1871-2008, to ice core delta O-18, tree cellulose delta O-18, and coral delta O-18. The second is the use of isotopic data as constraints in various climatological, meteorological, and hydrological models. Ideally, vapor isotope data could be used to improve weather forecasting.

The application of remote sensing to seagrass ecosystems: an overview and future research prospects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This review evaluates various methods employed to produce seagrass habitat maps using optical and acoustic remote-sensing (RS) techniques coupled with in situ sampling to highlight recent advances and to define areas where potential future research should be focused in the application of RS technologies. A critical review of 195 studies revealed that, in the past four decades, advances in the application of RS methods, notably using Landsat imagery, are identified for seagrass detection, assessment of areal coverage, distribution and abundance mapping, and the detection of extent and biomass changes, as illustrated in peer-reviewed literature. Rapid technological and methodological advances have occurred in the acquisition and interpretation of optical and acoustic data for the mapping of seagrass habitats. The methods have been tested to segment, classify, and combine RS data with biological field or ground truth sample data. There is no single technology or approach that is suitable for and capable of measuring all seagrass parameters (presence/absence, cover, species, and biomass) and assessing change. Integration of field, imagery, and mapping approaches is therefore required. Further research is required for continued improvements in understanding of theoretical and methodological aspects of seagrass RS.

Spatio-temporal Variability of Chlorophyll-A in the Coastal Zone of Northeastern Brazil	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Coastal areas are important regions for global primary productivity. However, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of coastal phytoplankton dynamics is challenging due to the multiple environmental factors involved. Here, we use remote sensing and geostatistical techniques to demonstrate the influence of key environmental variables (i.e. sea surface temperature; current intensity; wind speed; photosynthetically active radiation and flow of larger rivers) on spatio-temporal variability of chlorophyll-a in the coastal region of Alagoas State, northeastern Brazil. Chlorophyll-a had high spatial variation (0.03-18.23 mg m(-3)), with highest mean values observed on the continental shelf up to 50 m depth and towards the southern part of the study area. Seasonally, the highest average values were found between April and June (0.721 mg m(-3)) and the lowest values between October and December (0.376 mg m(-3)). Multivariate analysis indicated that the spatio-temporal variability of chlorophyll-a in shallow zones is mainly influenced by seasonal variation in the hydrological regime of rivers and wind-induced coastal currents. This contrasts with deeper zones, where chlorophyll-a variability is strongly linked to water temperature and light availability. Moreover, areas with inshore coral reefs typically had reduced chlorophyll-a levels, possibly due to the blocking of nutrients at river mouths.

Airborne acquisition of digital bathymetric data provides a wealth of information that can be interpreted in different ways. This paper considers the pros and cons of computerized autoclassifications versus cognitive interpretations of seafloor features. The continental shelf off the southeast Florida coast contains LADS (laser airborne depth sounding) surveys that are here used to compare and contrast automated classifications of bathymetry with cognitive differentiation of marine geomorphological features. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each approach, and the choice of methods depends on the purpose or goals of the project. Once seafloor features have been cognitively discerned from enhanced, color ramped, and vertically exaggerated bathymetry, machine classifications can be compared with known units. Using ArcGIs (R) ArcMap software, five- and seven-class unsupervised isocluster autoclassifications were found to moderately represent known bottom topography, whereas the interactive supervised autoclassification closely approximated cognitively discerned bathymetric patterns. Hand-drawn or digitized cognitively derived maps were more generalized than supervised computerized classifications based on training fields. Overall, both methods were found to be beneficial approaches, as they complement each other.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2015	31	1					1	16		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14A-00006.1								WOS:000347868900001						
J	Parthasarathy, A; Natesan, U				Parthasarathy, Anitha; Natesan, Usha			Coastal vulnerability assessment: a case study on erosion and coastal change along Tuticorin, Gulf of Mannar	NATURAL HAZARDS												Assessment of vulnerability is essential for identifying and recognizing the coastal livelihood, socio-economic and ecological security status. However, coastal vulnerability assessments require a complex dataset including human and socio-economic factors. In this study, we investigated coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to map the vulnerability of Tuticorin coast toward coastal erosion using remote sensing data and geographical information techniques based on a multi-indicator approach. Gulf of Mannar located along the southeast coast of India and declared as a marine national park with high ecological diversity faces threat due to anthropogenic interventions as a result of industrialization, sand and coral mining, etc. CVI highlights the vicinity where the physical effects may be the greatest. Beach width was considered as an additional parameter, since a large number of coastal habitations were present adjacent to the beach along the study area. Coastal erosion, slope and relative sea level rise are the major factors affecting the coastal vulnerability in Tuticorin. CVI scores were categorized into four classes, viz., low, moderate, high and very high risk. Out of 84-km coastal stretch, 15 % falls under high risk, 12 % moderate vulnerability and 73 % the low vulnerable category. This approach provides an insight to assess the vulnerability and the degree of potential threat to the coastal system in order to prioritize actions and to develop adaptation measures.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				JAN	2015	75	2					1713	1729		10.1007/s11069-014-1394-y								WOS:000346407100033

Low-cost Bathymetric Survey for Marine Protected Areas: coral reefs and coastal islands	2015 IEEE/OES ACOUSTICS IN UNDERWATER GEOSCIENCES SYMPOSIUM					IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)	JUL 29-31, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE OES				Bathymetry surveys are the first step for every conservation effort on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Maps depicting depth and bottom geomorphology are used to generate hillshades, that later become basemaps for other themes, such as fish distribution, bottom types, and water quality. Bathymetry map availability is limited or non-existent at the scales that are necessary for MPA management plans. Survey costs by traditional sounding methods or new technologies, such as LIDAR, are prohibitive for most MPA budgets. Remote Sensing bathymetry is yet unreliable, except for crystal clear waters. A low-cost technique, based on commercially available GPS-echosounder units was applied to obtain detailed bathymetry of two MPAs in coastal Brazil: at the Parque Municipal Marinho da Coroa Alta ((PMMCA), located in the coastal reefs of Santa Cruz de Cabralia, State of Bahia, and Monumento Natural das Ilhas Cagarras ((MNIC), off Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro. Equipment consisted of a Simrad NSS-7 chartplotter mounted permanently on Iamany, a 7 m-long, fiberglass-hull, twin-engine boat for PMMCA, and a Garmin GPSMap 521 chartplotter mounted on Cacao, an inflatable, 6 m-long, single-engine boat hired for MNIC. Survey frequencies for the echosounders were set at 50 kHz. Cross-shelf, East-West lines spaced 100m apart with readings every second ((1-3 m, depending on boat speed) were obtained for PMMCA over 30 days of 4-6 hours of navigation around the highest tide ((ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 m above mean sea-level). At MNIC, radial lines surrounding each of the islands were placed 50 m apart at their outer limits, and readings were obtained every 10 seconds (similar to 10 m) in 7 days of 3-4 hours of navigation around the highest tides ((ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 m above mean sea-level). In the shallow coral reefs of Bahia, 62 km(2) were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 20m, while at the sandy bottom around the granite-gneiss islands of Rio de Janeiro, 6 km2 were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 40m. Data in the echosounders proprietary format, were saved on Micro-SD or SD memory cards, converted to XYZ format (.csv) and migrated to GIS, where a linear tide correction was applied. Interpolation methods such as Radial Basis Functions and ANUDEM generated maps with 10 m pixels for PMMCA ((presented at 1: 10.000 and 1: 25.000) and 5 m pixels for MNIC ((presented at 1: 3.000 and 1: 10.000). Average survey costs are estimated at R$500-650/day or R$1.000/km(2) (similar to US$ 250/day or similar to US$ 400/km(2)), depending on boat ownership vs. rental cost. This represents less than 1/10 of the official traditional survey costs, and even less when compared to LIDAR bathymetry. Precision obtained is an order of magnitude higher than previously available, and enough for environmental assessment for conservation management of the MPAs involved. Surveys were conducted at PMMCA under the auspices of Projeto Coral Vivo and at MNIC under Projeto Ilhas do Rio, both Petrobras Ambiental programmes.																			978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																		WOS:000412164600027

Evaluation of Multi-Resolution Satellite Sensors for Assessing Water Quality and Bottom Depth of Lake Garda	SENSORS												In this study we evaluate the capabilities of three satellite sensors for assessing water composition and bottom depth in Lake Garda, Italy. A consistent physics-based processing chain was applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RapidEye. Images gathered on 10 June 2014 were corrected for the atmospheric effects with the 6SV code. The computed remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from MODIS and OLI were converted into water quality parameters by adopting a spectral inversion procedure based on a bio-optical model calibrated with optical properties of the lake. The same spectral inversion procedure was applied to RapidEye and to OLI data to map bottom depth. In situ measurements of R-rs and of concentrations of water quality parameters collected in five locations were used to evaluate the models. The bottom depth maps from OLI and RapidEye showed similar gradients up to 7 m (r = 0.72). The results indicate that: (1) the spatial and radiometric resolutions of OLI enabled mapping water constituents and bottom properties; (2) MODIS was appropriate for assessing water quality in the pelagic areas at a coarser spatial resolution; and (3) RapidEye had the capability to retrieve bottom depth at high spatial resolution. Future work should evaluate the performance of the three sensors in different bio-optical conditions.

A total number of 11 overall and 96 overlapped aerial photos were taken (6 overall and 67 overlapped were selected to use) and then were mosaicked and geo-corrected using ENVIA (R) 5.1 image processing software by considering 8 pre-located diving buoys as ground control points. Afterwards, the corrected overall photos were stitched and used to produce a schematic map while the mosaic was digitized by applying a manual on-screen digitizing method in AutoCADA (R) raster design software, and a GIS-based topological thematic map was generated as output. The final results revealed that the method is applicable to map the coral reefs, while the ability to distinguish coral types by visual interpretation is the most advantageous factor for the proposed technique. Particularly in the studied area, an area similar to 4,500 m(2) comprising Porites and Acropora spp. as dominant coral genus could be mapped. Additionally, the low cost, quick and easy to manage and implementation, as well as producing precise thematic maps are considered as advantages of applying the proposed technique, in comparison with other alternative methods such as satellite imagery and field observations. In contrast, the limitation of this method is to use it in remote regions or areas with high turbid waters where it is not possible to interpret the coral types visually on the photos.

J	Thompson, A; Schroeder, T; Brando, VE; Schaffelke, B				Thompson, Angus; Schroeder, Thomas; Brando, Vittorio E.; Schaffelke, Britta			Coral community responses to declining water quality: Whitsunday Islands, Great Barrier Reef, Australia	CORAL REEFS												A five-year period (2002-2006) of below-median rainfall followed by a six-year period (2007-2012) of above-median rainfall and seasonal flooding allowed a natural experiment into the effects of runoff on the water quality and subsequent coral community responses in the Whitsunday Islands, Great Barrier Reef (Australia). Satellite-derived water quality estimates of total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration showed marked seasonal variability that was exaggerated during years with high river discharge. During above-median rainfall years, Chl was aseasonally high for a period of 3 months during the wet season (February-April), while TSS was elevated for four months, extending into the dry season (March-June). Coinciding with these extremes in water quality was a reduction in the abundance and shift in the community composition, of juvenile corals. The incidence of coral disease was at a maximum during the transition from years of below-median to years of above-median river discharge. In contrast to juvenile corals, the cover of larger corals remained stable, although the composition of communities varied along environmental gradients. In combination, these results suggest opportunistic recruitment of corals during periods of relatively low environmental stress with selection for more tolerant species occurring during periods of environmental extremes.

Noise characteristics of remote sensing imagery directly influence the accuracy of estimated environmental variables and provide a framework for a range of sensitivity, sensor specification, and algorithm design studies. The proposed method enables estimation of the noise equivalent reflectance covariance of remote sensing imagery through homogeneity characterization using image segmentation. The method is first tested on a synthetic data set with known noise characteristics and is successful in estimating the noise equivalent reflectance under a range of segmentation structures. Testing on a Portable Hyperspectral Imager for Low-Light Spectroscopy (PHILLS) hyperspectral image in a coral reef environment shows the method to produce comparable noise equivalent reflectance estimates in an optically shallow water environment to those previously derived in optically deep water. This method is of benefit in aquatic studies where homogenous regions of optically deep water were previously required for image noise estimation. The ability of the method to characterize the covariance of an image is of significant benefit when developing probabilistic inversion techniques for remote sensing.

CARBONATE SEDIMENT PRODUCTION, TRANSPORT, AND SUPPLY TO A CORAL CAY AT RAINE REEF, NORTHERN GREAT BARRIER REEF, AUSTRALIA: A FACIES APPROACH	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Coral cays are low-lying (typically < 5 m above mean sea level) accumulations of calcareous sediment derived from biota on the adjacent reef. They provide areas of societal refuge and support significant ecosystems and economic services. Although environmental controls on cay development are relatively well understood, the precise links between reef ecology, sediment production, and supply to reef islands are less well constrained. Here we identify the major controls on development of sediment facies on a wave-dominated Holocene reef platform on the northern Great Barrier Reef. Remote-sensing data, field observations, and sedimentological analysis (grain size, composition, and taphonomy) reveal sediment transport pathways critical for the development of a coral cay. Collectively, our data reveal six distinct facies types that are chiefly distinguished by the percentage of gravels (> 2 mm grain size) and the relative abundances of foraminifera and coral grains. Gravelly coral-dominated sediment is concentrated at the reef margins, whereas facies on and around the leeward cay are dominated by the sand-size tests of benthic foraminifera. Mud is absent in reef sediments and reflects the prevailing high-energy wave-dominated setting as well as a paucity of mud producers. Benthic foraminifera tests are the major sediment component, constituting an average proportion of 39% (range: 2-77%). Sediment derived from the skeletal remains of corals (24%, 1-65%), mollusks (15%, 3-30%), Halimeda (14%, 4-36%), and coralline algae (6%, 0-20%) are present in lesser volumes. Foraminifera content is highest (> 40%) on tidally emergent algal pavement, where they live in greatest abundance, and on the cay shorelines, where their tests are deposited and comprise the bulk of beach sand (36-63%). A comparison of the Raine Island data with other exposed modern reefs and platforms of the central and western Pacific shows that occurrence and distribution of facies types is broadly consistent. Beyond these sedimentological data, the taphonomy of foraminifera at Raine Island indicates that tests are vulnerable to destruction due to abrasion when transport and reworking is prolonged. Therefore the foraminifera-rich facies adjacent to and on the cay, disjunct from the source zones, as well as taphonomic evidence, imply that transport from the outer reef flat to the cay must be relatively quick. These short temporal links between ecological source zones and depositional landforms are likely to have important ramifications for the contemporary management of reef-associated landforms (e.g., cays) in the future.

These products fulfill requests from coral reef managers and researchers for higher resolution products by taking advantage of new satellites, sensors and algorithms. Improvements of the 5-km products over CRW's heritage global 50-km products are derived from: (1) the higher resolution and greater data density of NOAA's next-generation operational daily global 5-km geo-polar blended sea surface temperature (SST) analysis; and (2) implementation of a new SST climatology derived from the Pathfinder SST climate data record. The new products increase near-shore coverage and now allow direct monitoring of 95% of coral reefs and significantly reduce data gaps caused by cloud cover. The 5-km product suite includes SST Anomaly, Coral Bleaching HotSpots, Degree Heating Weeks and Bleaching Alert Area, matching existing CRW products. When compared with the 50-km products and in situ bleaching observations for 2013-2014, the 5-km products identified known thermal stress events and matched bleaching observations. These near reef-scale products significantly advance the ability of coral reef researchers and managers to monitor coral thermal stress in near-real-time.

Predicting the distribution of deep-sea vulnerable marine ecosystems using high-resolution data: Considerations and novel approaches	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Little is known about species distribution patterns in deep-sea environments, primarily because sampling surveys in the high seas are expensive and time consuming. The increasing need to manage and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems, such as cold-water corals, has motivated the use of predictive modelling tools, which produce continuous maps of potential species or habitat distribution from limited point observations and full coverage environmental data. Rapid advances in acoustic remote sensing, oceanographic modelling and sampling technology now provide high quality datasets, facilitating model development with high spatial detail. This paper provides a short overview of existing methodologies for predicting deep-sea benthic species distribution, and illustrates emerging issues related to spatial and thematic data resolution, and the use of transect-derived species distribution data. In order to enhance the ecological relevance and reliability of deep-sea species distribution models, novel techniques are presented based on a case study predicting the distribution of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa in three carbonate mound provinces in Irish waters. Specifically, the study evaluates (1) the capacity of newly developed high-resolution (250 m grid cell size) hydrodynamic variables to explain local scale cold-water coral distribution patterns, (2) the potential value of species occurrence proportion data to maintain semi-quantitative information of coral prevalence (i.e. coverage) and sampling effort per grid cell within the response variable, and (3) mixed effect modelling to deal with spatially grouped transect data. The study shows that predictive models using vertical and horizontal flow parameters perform significantly better than models based on terrain parameters only. Semiquantitative proportion data may decrease model uncertainty and increase model reliability, and provide a fruitful avenue of research for analysing large quantities of video data in a detailed yet time-efficient manner. The study concludes with an outlook of how species distribution models could improve our understanding of vulnerable marine ecosystem functioning and processes in the deep sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sargassum beds play a range of ecological roles in coastal waters, but their sustainability is threatened by pollution and reclamation within ASEAN countries with rapid economic growth. Before conservation initiatives can be implemented, it is necessary to establish their present distribution. These beds can be mapped using the noncommercial satellite, ALOS, which can provide multiband images using high spatial resolution optical sensors (sensitive to 10 m(-2) plots), AVNIR-2. These images are of sufficient quality for examining coastal ecosystems and, in this study, for mapping the Sargassum beds in the waters off the coast of Sattahip, Chon Buri Province, Thailand. This coastal zone is a natural marine park reserve and protected from human activities such as fishery and reclamation. Biomass data were obtained in January, February, March, and December 2009 from quadrat sampling. The biomass of Sargassum aquifolium (Turner) C. Agardh at a bottom depth of 1 m and 1.5-2 m was determined to be 7.73 and 92.75 g dw m(-2), while that of Sargassum oligocystum Montagne was found to be 44.05 and 87.97 g dw m(-2), respectively. Ground truth data were obtained in February and October 2012 from serial images taken by manta tow. Supervised classification is a procedure for identifying spectrally similar areas on an image by identifying "training" sites of known targets and then extrapolating those spectral signatures to other areas of unknown targets. By applying this methodology, the Sargassum beds off Sattahip can be detected with an accuracy of about 70%. It is estimated that the error is caused by mixel effects of the bottom substrates in individual pixels, each of which covers an area of 10 x 10 m. Our results indicate that the images captured by ALOS AVNIR-2 are informative and useful for mapping the -Sargassum beds in Southeast Asia.																	0006-8055	1437-4323				OCT	2014	57	5					367	377		10.1515/bot-2014-0015								WOS:000343111500004						
J	Rowlands, G; Purkis, S; Bruckner, A				Rowlands, Gwilym; Purkis, Sam; Bruckner, Andrew			Diversity in the geomorphology of shallow-water carbonate depositional systems in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Coral reefs and their associated accumulations of carbonate sediment adopt particularly complex planform geometries atop the coastal shelf of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea. By assembling 95,000 km(2) of remote sensing data into a GIS, this study aims to relate the morphology of these shallow-water depositional environments to processes that sculpt the coastal zone. A typology that sorts carbonate systems into end-members on the basis of their morphology and relationship to the coastline is developed. The resulting GIS was interrogated for spatial patterns in the distribution and abundance of the end-members. While several depositional morphologies are present throughout the length of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea, the occurrence of others is restricted to narrow regions of latitude. Such differences in distribution can be explained in process-terms by the rift tectonics of the Red Sea basin, spatial variability in the presence of sub-seafloor evaporites, and the input of siliciclastic detritus onto the coastal shelf via wadis. This paper provides a foundation for understanding the morphological diversity of shallow-water carbonate systems in both the modern ocean and rock records. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Average water depths on the platform-tops, such as the Great Bahama Bank (GBB), are typically 10 m or less, with coral reef-rimmed margins, thick sediment accumulations, and the frequent occurrence of islands. There are, however, exceptions. For example, Cay Sal Bank (CSB), a little studied detached Bahamian carbonate platform with depths ranging from 30 to 7 m, is only slightly deeper than the GBB, but devoid of islands, lacks platform-margin coral reefs and holds little sediment on the platform-top; the platform is incipiently drowned. CSB is interesting as it is conspicuously larger (6000 sq. km) than other incipiently drowned platforms in the region, such as Serranilla Bank (1100 sq. km) and the Cat Island platform (1500 sq. km). Field and remote sensing data are assembled to provide insight into the sedimentology and geomorphology of the CSB. The influence of ocean climate, regional hydrodynamics, and Holocene flooding history are investigated to understand why platform-margin coral reef growth on CSB has been unable to keep pace with Holocene sea-level rise. A decade of regional sea-surface temperature data for the Bahamas report CSB to be situated in the same ocean climate regime as GBB. Temperature cannot explain the platform's different morphologies. The Florida Current has been evoked as a possible reason for the immature development of platform-top processes on the CSB, but numeric modeling suggests its influence to be restricted to the deep flanks of the bank. Further, sediment distribution on CSB, including infill patterns of karst depressions, suggest trade winds (easterlies) to drive platform-top hydrodynamics. By assembling a satellite-derived bathymetry map, it can be shown that CSB flooded earlier and at relatively higher rates of Holocene sea-level rise than its neighboring platforms. Flooding history is identified as the most feasible explanation for the atypical morphology of the CSB. By contrasting the present-day morphology of the CSB and the GBB, the work emphasizes how subtle differences in relative sea-level history can influence the growth of platform-margin coral reefs, features that in turn can conspire to set even closely neighboring carbonate platforms on divergent paths with regard to the development of marine landforms. This insight is relevant to interpreting the morphological diversity of carbonate platforms in the modem ocean and in the rock record. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zoffoli, ML; Frouin, R; Kampel, M				Zoffoli, Maria Laura; Frouin, Robert; Kampel, Milton			Water Column Correction for Coral Reef Studies by Remote Sensing	SENSORS												Human activity and natural climate trends constitute a major threat to coral reefs worldwide. Models predict a significant reduction in reef spatial extension together with a decline in biodiversity in the relatively near future. In this context, monitoring programs to detect changes in reef ecosystems are essential. In recent years, coral reef mapping using remote sensing data has benefited from instruments with better resolution and computational advances in storage and processing capabilities. However, the water column represents an additional complexity when extracting information from submerged substrates by remote sensing that demands a correction of its effect. In this article, the basic concepts of bottom substrate remote sensing and water column interference are presented. A compendium of methodologies developed to reduce water column effects in coral ecosystems studied by remote sensing that include their salient features, advantages and drawbacks is provided. Finally, algorithms to retrieve the bottom reflectance are applied to simulated data and actual remote sensing imagery and their performance is compared. The available methods are not able to completely eliminate the water column effect, but they can minimize its influence. Choosing the best method depends on the marine environment, available input data and desired outcome or scientific application.																	1424-8220					SEP	2014	14	9					16881	16931		10.3390/s140916881								WOS:000343106600070	25215941

Improvements to and continuity of operational global thermal stress monitoring for coral bleaching	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY												Mass coral bleaching results from periods of elevated sea temperature. Satellite monitoring of thermal stress has enhanced the capacity for the management of coral bleaching events worldwide. Satellite-based monitoring tools provide reef managers with cost-effective observations of temperature conditions to monitor the risk of bleaching and to target in situ observations in areas under stress. This paper describes improvements to satellite remote sensing products from NOAA's Coral Reef Watch to enhance product coverage and to correct identified errors in the production of coral reef-specific metrics for thermal stress. In addition, threats to the operational production of the thermal stress metrics are considered and a contingency plan is described to ensure continuity of operations.

Dinesh			Environmental characteristics of tropical coral reef-seagrass dominated lagoons (Lakshadweep, India) and implications to resilience to climate change	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Environmental characteristics of the coral reef-seagrass ecosystem of selected Lakshadweep Islands (India) were assessed with a view to understanding the future climate change scenario in the region. Images obtained from the Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS P6) were used to identify the different zones such as the corals, the seagrass and the sandy region. The pH (7.6-8.6) of sediment was relatively high in the coral reef compared to the seagrass area, possibly indicating a climate shift-induced coral bleaching. The water quality and sediment texture generally showed marked intra-and inter-island variations illustrating that these coral reef ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change brought about by increased human interventions. Future research should therefore explore the habitat and resource connections, to predict their restoring capabilities for a sustainable exploitation. With an alarming increase in the population and associated developmental activities, the island ecosystems are expected to respond severely to the climate change, which may eventually lead to mass mortality of corals due to bleaching.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2014	72	4					1025	1037		10.1007/s12665-013-3020-9								WOS:000341084400006

However, limitations exist when using data derived from satellite remote sensing as virtual stations are usually distant from areas of interest for management. Modelled sea surface temperature will, in most cases, provide a general over a large spatial scale rather than a specific prediction. Understanding the relationship between remotely sensed sea temperature and in situ temperature enables real-time management responses to sea temperature, in relation to both long-term changes and short-term anomalies, and their biological implications. Historically, the effects of most thermal stress events on marine communities have been observed opportunistically or realised well after the event, due to the use of in situ loggers and the associated time-lag between the event, logger retrieval and data interpretation. Understanding the susceptibility of marine communities to, and recovery from, thermal stress events requires reliable estimation of the events in real time at local spatial scales. To further understand the relationship between in situ and satellite derived sea temperatures, and develop a real-time monitoring tool, a simple linear interpolation was undertaken to estimate local in situ temperature, at depth, using near real-time satellite derived sea surface temperatures. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch 50 km sea surface temperature (SST) data was selected because of its readily available and continual near real-time update of sea surface temperatures worldwide. In situ temperature logger data from four Western Australian marine protected areas (MPAs) were used to develop and test the linear interpolation. Utilising the model, we were able to successfully estimate the in situ temperature to within +/- 1 degrees C, at least 78% of the time, including temperature anomalies experienced in February 2011, at sites of interest across the four MPAs. This simple linear interpolation model will be used to improve near real-time estimates of temperature for broadscale monitoring of MPAs throughout Western Australia, allowing greater understanding and informed management response to long-term changes and short-term temperature anomalies. Future expansion of the sites monitored, improved satellites resolution and an annual review of data sources will ensure that the data used for management of this threat to water quality remains at the highest level of accuracy possible with the available data.

Mapping Coral Reef Benthos, Substrates, and Bathymetry, Using Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) Data	REMOTE SENSING												This study used a reef-up approach to map coral reef benthos, substrates and bathymetry, with high spatial resolution hyperspectral image data. It investigated a physics-based inversion method for mapping coral reef benthos and substrates using readily available software: Hydrolight and ENVI. Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data were acquired over Heron Reef in July 2002. The spectral reflectance of coral reef benthos and substrate types were measured in-situ, and using the HydroLight 4.2 radiative transfer model a spectral reflectance library of subsurface reflectance was simulated using water column depths from 0.5-10.0 m at 0.5 m intervals. Using the Spectral Angle Mapper algorithm, sediment, benthic micro-algae, algal turf, crustose coralline algae, macro-algae, and live coral were mapped with an overall accuracy of 65% to a depth of around 8.0 m; in waters deeper than 8.0 m the match between the classified image and field validation data was poor. Qualitative validation of the maps showed accurate mapping of areas dominated by sediment, benthic micro-algae, algal turf, live coral, and macro-algae. A bathymetric map was produced for water column depths 0.5-10.0 m, at 0.5 m intervals, and showed high correspondence with in-situ sonar data (R-2 value of 0.93).

The nonlinear effect of water column light attenuation can then be corrected to obtain the absolute reflectance of the seabed. Light attenuation by the water column and bathymetry are both determined from the satellite image. The water column attenuation is then removed in order to apply an automated supervised classification, whatever the depth is. We have compared the results obtained with and without the correction of water column attenuation, for two different statistical measures: Euclidean (ED) and spectral angle mapper (SAM) distances. We have applied this methodology to MERIS images acquired on the lagoon of New Caledonia. The best overall accuracy (79%), as compared to in situ data, is obtained with the corrected image and the SAM distance.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				JUN	2014	7	6			SI		2619	2629		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2307956								WOS:000340621200066

Murray			Ecohydrodynamics of Cold-Water Coral Reefs: A Case Study of the Mingulay Reef Complex (Western Scotland)	PLOS ONE												Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications.

J	Lee, ZP; Shang, SL; Hu, CM; Zibordi, G				Lee, Zhongping; Shang, Shaoling; Hu, Chuanmin; Zibordi, Giuseppe			Spectral interdependence of remote-sensing reflectance and its implications on the design of ocean color satellite sensors	APPLIED OPTICS												Using 901 remote-sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs (lambda),sr(-1),. from 400 to 700 nm with a 5 nm resolution), we evaluated the correlations of (rs) (lambda) between neighboring spectral bands in order to characterize (1) the spectral interdependence of R-rs (lambda) at different bands and (2) to what extent hyperspectral R-rs (lambda) can be reconstructed from multiband measurements. The 901 R-rs spectra were measured over a wide variety of aquatic environments in which water color varied from oceanic blue to coastal green or brown, with chlorophyll-a concentrations ranging from similar to 0.02 to > 100 mg m(-3), bottom depths from similar to 1 m to > 1000 m, and bottom substrates including sand, coral reef, and seagrass. The correlation coefficient of R-rs (lambda) between neighboring bands at center wavelengths lambda(k) and lambda(I), r(Delta lambda)(lambda(k,)lambda(I)), was evaluated systematically, with the spectral gap (Delta lambda = lambda(i) - lambda(k)) changing between 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 nm, respectively. It was found that r(Delta lambda) decreased with increasing Delta(lambda) but remained > 0.97 for Delta(lambda)<= 20 nm for all spectral bands. Further, using 15 spectral bands between 400 and 710 nm, we reconstructed, via multivariant linear regression, hyperspectral R-rs (lambda) (from 400 to 700 nm with a 5 nm resolution). The percentage difference between measured and reconstructed R-rs for each band in the 400-700 nm range was generally less than 1%, with a correlation coefficient close to 1.0. The mean absolute error between measured and reconstructed R-rs was about 0.00002 sr(-1) for each band, which is significantly smaller than the R-rs uncertainties from all past and current ocean color satellite radiometric products. These results echo findings of earlier studies that Rrs measurements at similar to 15 spectral bands in the visible domain can provide nearly identical spectral information as with hyperspectral (contiguous bands at 5 nm spectral resolution) measurements. Such results provide insights for data storage and handling of large volume hyperspectral data as well as for the design of future ocean color satellite sensors.

Here, we quantify the ecological resilience of the largest reef in the Caribbean and map potential benefits of marine reserves under two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. Resilience is calculated using spatial ecological models and defined as the probability of a reef remaining in its coral-dominated basin of attraction such that it does not flip into an alternate, algal-dominated attractor. In practice, resilience is the probability that coral populations will maintain the ability to exhibit a recovery trend after acute disturbances such as hurricanes. The inputs required to estimate resilience are a reef's initial state, physical environment, and disturbance regime. One major driver of reef resilience is herbivory by parrotfish and recent action to protect parrotfish in Belize was found to have increased resilience 6-fold. However, the expected benefits of parrotfish protection to future coral cover were relatively modest with only a 2- to 2.6-fold improvement over a business-as-usual scenario, demonstrating how resilience and ecosystem states are decoupled. Global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had little impact on average coral state unless it was accompanied by local controls of fishing. However, combined global and local action reduced the rate of reef degradation threefold. Operationalizing resilience explicitly integrates available biophysical data and accommodates the complex interactions among ecological processes and multiple types of disturbance.

Using 1309 field observations and 20 cloud- and error-affected Landsat scenes covering Zanzibar Island, this study demonstrates that the use of multiple scenes can both allow complete coverage of the study area in the absence of cloud-free scenes and obtain substantially improved classification accuracy. Automated processing of individual scenes includes derivation of spectral features for use in classification, identification of clouds, shadows and the land/water boundary, and random forest-based land cover classification. An ensemble classifier is then created from the single-scene classifications by voting. The accuracy achieved by the ensemble classifier is 70.4%, compared to an average of 62.9% for the individual scenes, and the ensemble classifier achieves complete coverage of the study area while the maximum coverage for a single scene is 1209 of the 1309 field sites. Given the free availability of Landsat data, these results should encourage increased use of multiple scenes in land cover classification and reduced reliance on the traditional single-scene methodology.

Tropical islands quick data gap analysis guided by coral reef geomorphological maps	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A gap analysis is the initial step towards the identification of areas where data are needed. However, often, data coverage cannot be assessed against a reference that objectively guides the identification of both gaps and priority areas for data acquisition. Here, we describe a quick, effective and reproducible spatial data gap analysis approach based on the relationship between location of available metadata and coral reef geomorphological richness. In Solomon Islands, we identified gaps defined by high richness and low biological data coverage. We collected metadata only, to avoid dealing with data ownership, availability, and formats, and to be able to identify gaps in less than two months. This fast method does not replace quantitative and comprehensive gap analysis, but provides effective identification of areas of high natural value and limited knowledge. The method is widely applicable and particularly invaluable for large and complex domains such as the Coral Triangle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Srinivas			Evaluation of various image classification techniques on Landsat to identify coral reefs	GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK												Coral reefs are one of the prominent marine ecosystems in the world. Coral reefs are facing threats from both natural and anthropogenic factors. Monitoring, protecting and studying these ecosystems are considered as a complex process because they are underwater features. Remote sensing can be quite useful in this by providing huge amount of database of satellite images. Landsat series have been providing satellite data for last 50years and now it is one of the large databases providing satellite imageries. Accurate processing of these images can increase the accuracy of coral reef information extraction from these images. Classification is one of the important processes that can give adequate and precise information about coral reefs. This study is intended to compare various supervised classification techniques available for extraction of information from the image and to suggest best of them. Maximum Likelihood and Support Vector Machine have proven to be good classification module that can be used to classify Landsat Images to coral reef detection and monitoring.																	1947-5705	1947-5713				APR 3	2014	5	2					173	184		10.1080/19475705.2013.802748								WOS:000335002900006						
J	Shih, PTY; Chen, YH; Chen, JC				Shih, Peter Tian-Yuan; Chen, Ya-Hsing; Chen, Jie-Chung			Historic Shipwreck Study in Dongsha Atoll with Bathymetric LiDAR	ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION												Dongsha Atoll is a coral reef located in the South China Sea. The surrounding area is characterized by dangerous shoals. Historic shipwrecks mark past human activities. Due to the shallow water and risky navigational conditions in the area, a sonar survey with platforms on the water surface was not feasible. Airborne bathymetric LiDAR, which utilizes green laser for measurement, however, is a proven convenient method for studying shipwrecks around the atoll, particularly in shallow-water areas. At a point density of about 3.5m by 3.5m, four shipwrecks were identified. The bathymetric measurements allow not only the length of the shipwreck to be estimated, but also its height above the sea floor. The full waveform record of the laser reflection also provided information to separate the wreckage from its surroundings. This provides an excellent working environment for marine archaeological analysis, as not only the location, but also the depth and geomorphological information can be assessed in an integrated setting.

Circulation in the southern Great Barrier Reef studied through an integration of multiple remote sensing and in situ measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												New mechanisms for stratification and upwelling in the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are identified, and dynamic details of Capricorn Eddy, a transient feature located off the shelf at the southern extremity of the GBR, are revealed using the newly available surface current from High Frequency (HF) radar combined with other remote sensing and mooring data. The HF radar surface currents were used for tidal harmonic analysis and current-wind correlation analysis. These analyses, combined with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data, mooring data, and altimetry-based geostrophic currents, enabled the effects of forcing from the large-scale oceanic currents (including the East Australian Current (EAC)), wind, and tides in a topographically complex flow regime to be separately identified. Within the indentation region where the width of the shelf abruptly narrows, current is strongly coupled with the EAC. Here strong residual flows, identified on current maps and SST images, fall into three patterns: southward flow, northwestward flow, and an eddy. Multiple data sets shed light on the prerequisite for the formation of the eddy, the reasons for its geometric variation, and its evolution with time. Intrusions of the eddy onto the shelf result in stratification characterized by a significant increase of surface temperature. Upwelling driven by wind or oceanic inflow is shown to cause stratification of previously well-mixed shelf water. The upwelling appears to be associated with equatorward-traveling coastal-trapped waves. The integrative method of analysis embodied here is applicable to other coastal regions with complex circulation.

Based on the Zsd(Secchi depth) inversion theory, a simple semi-analysis spectra model was established for offshore seawater clarity by analyzing the relationship between vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d (490) and the beam attenuation coefficient c(490) with remote sensing reflectance. This semi-analysis spectra model needed two band reflectance ratios only, while tidal correction was produced for this model to improve the precision of the retrieving results. The semi-analysis spectra model was applied to ASD hyperspectral reflectance data measured in the Pearl River Estuary Ecological Zone (October 21, 23, 2012, November 2, 2012; N=20) and the Xuwen Coral Reef Protection Zone (January 13, 14, 2013, N=25) which covered different water body of tidal times and different pollution sources. The results indicated that the changing tendency of predicted values was consistent with the synchronous measurement values after comparing them. However, water clarity calculated by the ASD hyperspectral reflectance measured in spring tidal time, generated 0.4 m deviation compared with in-situ water clarity, while water clarity calculated by the ASD hyperspectral reflectance measured in neap tidal time is close to the in-situ water clarity. So the tidal correction coefficient of 0.4 was further applied for the model. After modification, the coefficient of determination between the inversed and measured water clarity was 0.663, the average absolute error was 0.14 m and the average relative error was 19.5%. Research demonstrated that this semi-analysis inversion algorithm just needs two band reflectance ratio to complete the inversion of water clarity, which is simple and works relatively well for lower clarity (less than 2 meters) waters compared to He' (2004) and Doron' (2011) algorithms.																	1000-0593					FEB	2014	34	2					477	482		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)02-0477-06								WOS:000331427400038

This GA-SSA approach is designed based on the assumption that each pixel is homogeneous with regard to the bottom type when viewed at small (centimeter) scales, and it is validated against a synthetic data set (N = 11, 250) that consists of five types of bottom, three levels of bottom depth, 15 concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and a wide range of modeled IOP variations in clear and optically complex waters representing the coral reef environment. The results indicate that the GA-SSA approach is accurate and robust in the retrieval of IOPs and its success rate in identifying the real bottom type is limited by the level of Chl-a and bottom depth. When a pixel is homogeneous at a small scale, the maximum allowable concentrations for GA-SSA to perfectly identify all the five bottom types are 0.7 mg/m(3) at 5 m bottom depth, 0.2 mg/m(3) at 10 m, and 0.07 mg/m(3) at 15 m. A promising 80% recognition rate of the benthic community is possible with GA-SSA when an underwater hyperspectral imager is deployed to examine the health status of coral reefs in a clean (Chl-a < 1 mg/m(3)) and shallow (bottom depth < 10 m) environment. Further study that collects field data for direct validation is required to ensure that the GA-SSA approach is also applicable in real coral reef regions.

Since the 1960s, remote sensing has played an important role in characterizing the marine environment, with particular emphasis on sea surface features, temperature, and salinity; mapping of shorelines, wetlands, and coral reefs; local fisheries and species movements; tracking hurricanes, earthquakes, and coastal flooding; and changes in coastal upwelling and marine productivity. This chapter reviews marine applications of remote sensing worldwide, exploring contemporary satellite systems, research themes, and analytical methods. In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, marine remote sensing has been limited to the use of large-scale daily image-gathering systems, such as CZCS, MODIS, SeaWiFS, and AVHRR, due to persistent cloud cover and constrained research budgets. Recent advances in satellite technology and availability, however, offer new opportunities for remote sensing in the Galapagos archipelago and beyond. Moderate-resolution sensors like SPOT and Landsat continue to be relevant for regional-scale evaluations of marine and coastal environments, identifying hotspots or focal areas for the use of more fine-grained imagery like QuickBird, WorldView-2, and aerial photographs. Radar systems like Aquarius and SAR show promise in new lines of oceanographic research, including sea surface salinity and the differentiation of mangrove subspecies. The use of ancillary or in situ data for calibration and validation of remotely-sensed image analysis can overcome the limitations of sensors used in bathymetric applications, while advances in cellular and GPS technology facilitate real-time reporting from citizen scientists for integrated monitoring of environmental and social change.																	2195-1055		978-3-319-02769-2; 978-3-319-02768-5				2014							109	136		10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2_6	10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2							WOS:000364124700008						
B	Andrefouet, S		Barale, V; Gade, M		Andrefouet, Serge			Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs and Their Environments in the Red Sea and Western Indian Ocean: Research and Management	REMOTE SENSING OF THE AFRICAN SEAS												The Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean regions offer a wide variety of coastal configurations, including large areas of coral reefs. In regions that include both developed and developing countries, coral reefs and the services they provide are critical for the livelihoods, economies and well being of local communities, while they are at risk due to both anthropogenic and natural threats. Coral reefs also offer to scientific research a unique array of ecological and geological processes specific to these regions. Both applied and fundamental aspects motivate conservation and management projects. Satellite and airborne remote sensing has contributed to scientific and management projects with a variety of sensors and products, including some of the earliest coral reef applications worldwide 30 years ago. High spatial resolution geomorphology, bathymetry and habitat maps provide a biophysical description of the reefs themselves. Oceanic fields, such as sea surface temperature regime and their anomalies, quantify how coral reefs are exposed to weather and climate forcing. The combined local and large scale spatial information help understand how coral reefs status and processes vary across space and time. In particular, data products are increasingly combined to map the resilience of coral reef and associated habitats, and to design conservation plans at different spatial scales. However, both high-tech state-of-the-art and user-friendly remote sensing are still not used as systematically as it could be, while most countries still need basic spatial information consistent at national and international scales, such as habitat maps. Future applied developments will need to address these gaps in priority products. At the same time, on-going research will continue to refine local and regional products relevant for the science and the management of the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean coral reefs and their environments.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							317	335		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_16	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100017

Nowadays, although types of high and moderate resolution remote sensing data become various, the existing feature extraction methods are mainly confined in data-driven classification field. To maintain spatial-continuity of features, this paper applies a model-driven, multi-phase level set method (MPLSM) for specific circle-structured coral island segmentation based on CBERS-02B CCD multi-spectral image. The fundament of multi-phase level set method is to establish local cluster criterions to control level set evolution. Experiment shows that: (1) MPLSM segmentation avoids topology error and contour omission problems compared to classic Chan-Vese piece constant model; (2) MPLSM is robust to contour initialization so as to improve level set automation; (3) MPLSM cannot handle with the diffusive boundary and areas seriously influenced by mixed-pixel effect, but can ensure level set convergence.																	2161-024X		978-1-4799-5714-9				2014																		WOS:000358415900022

The New Caledonia lagoon lies in the Southwestern Tropical Pacific around 21 degrees 30' S and 166 degrees 30' E, with a great marine biodiversity in UNESCO Heritage coral reefs, benthic sea grass, and benthic communities. They are largely connected to the open ocean in the southern and eastern parts, but only by narrow passes in the southwest part. The trophic state is linked to spatial variations in flushing times. High run offs due to rain carrying abundant chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and particle loads may greatly impact the functioning of ecosystems while rivers and sewage effluents may induce localized impacts. Two oceanographic cruises (CALIOPE 1 in 2011 and CALIOPE 2 in 2014) were carried out off the Eastern Coast of New Caledonia during a calm dry period and during high winds, respectively. Multi-and hyper-spectral marine reflectance was measured with a SIMBADA instrument and a TRIOS radiometer system, together with inherent optical properties (total and CDOM absorption coefficients with a PSICAM, in situ absorption and scattering with an AC9, backscattering with a Hydroscat-6). Fluorescence of CDOM (EEM/PARAFAC) was measured on collected 0.2 mu m filtered samples. In 2014, Satlantic and FieldSpec hyper-spectral radiometers were available for in-water profiling of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance and above-water reflectance measurements, respectively. Inherent and apparent optical data from the two cruises are compared and used to estimate ocean color algorithms performance and evaluate a Linear Matrix Inversion method, providing tools for remote sensing on this highly under-sampled coastal region of New Caledonia.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610M	10.1117/12.2073309								WOS:000348837900014

There are lots of coral islands in the south sea of China. Remote sensing survey for the coastline not only can reassert the necessity and importance of coral protection, but also can provide basic data and scientific basis for island ecologic protection, reasonable utilization of land resources. The study area named Zhao Shu Island lies in Jintong Islands of Xisha. It is a coral island which has people inhabited. Using WorldView-2 satellite remote sensing images as data sources we carry out three phases of coastline investigation and monitoring. The satellite data phases are 2002, 2010 and 2013. Firstly, affirm the bands valuable for color composition on the basis of spectral and correlation analysis. Then extract the coastline by a series of image process, such as image correction, fusion, waterline extraction and coastline revision. Finally determine the coastline types and length by artificial interpretation. The results show that the island length is gradually smaller, which means the island area is reducing. The beach bedrock coast in northern island was eroded seriously especially during the period between 2010 and 2013. In addition, the shoal head shape in the western island changed a lot.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-385-4				2014	9299								UNSP 929904	10.1117/12.2069483								WOS:000349376400004

R.; Nayak, Shailesh			Coupled correction and classification of hyperspectral imagery for mapping coral reefs of Agatti and Flat Islands, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Among the various remote-sensing options available today to map ecomorphological classes of corals, hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the best options by virtue of its spectral capabilities, while high spatial resolution is a necessary condition to resolve finer morphological features spatially. Given high-spatial resolution data of equal to or better than 30 m, the discrimination capability of end-members of multi-/hyperspectral satellite data is dependent on the efficacy of the correction for atmospheric effects and the intervening water column. In this study, a coupled approach to account for oceanic and atmospheric radiative contributions, called the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Radiative Transfer (COART), was applied to Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) mission Hyperion image data acquired over the coral reefs of Agatti Island in the Lakshadweep Islands, Arabian Sea and Flat Island in the Andaman Islands, Bay of Bengal, India. The paper presents an open-source approach to correct and perform unsupervised classification of Hyperion imagery using a custom-built software toolkit called HyperCorals. The study finds that Hyperion has sufficient capabilities for discrimination of a few ecomorphological classes and can be improved further by using coupled radiative transfer models. Correcting for the intervening water column helps in classifying submerged features. The k-means classification offers a simpler classification method to classify an image of a subset with 42 selected spectral channels of Hyperion in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region than the traditional Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). The classification results using the cosine distance metric over 42 selected spectral channels of Hyperion in the VNIR region offer the potential to differentiate between various ecomorphological zones. The study also presents results from sensitivity analysis experiments and discusses the relative importance of three parameters: water column depth, bottom albedo, and chlorophyll concentration on the overall correction and classification of the imagery.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	14			SI		5544	5561		10.1080/01431161.2014.926410								WOS:000340477400019

A Case Study in Coral Reefs	MARINE GEODESY												Although visible bands of high-resolution multispectral imagery are used for bathymetry, the relative utility of different bands is poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated the relative utility of the six visible bands of WorldView-2. We statistically selected the visible bands that gave the best accuracy under different situations, tallying how often each band was included in the best combination. The average frequency was greater than 50% for every band and differed between bands by only 17%. We conclude that all visible bands are useful for remote sensing of water depth, although the utility depends on the image and number of training pixels available.																	0149-0419	1521-060X					2014	37	3					283	292		10.1080/01490419.2014.908794								WOS:000340123600001

Drawing on principles of the ecosystem resilience highlighted in the literature, we built on the theory of dissipative structures to develop a conceptual model of the ecosystem resilience of forests. A hierarchical indicator system was designed with the influencing factors of the forest ecosystem resilience, including the stand conditions and the ecological memory, which were further disaggregated into specific indicators. Furthermore, indicator weights were determined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the coefficient of variation method. Based on the remote sensing data and forest inventory data and so forth, the resilience index of forests was calculated. The result suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem resilience of forests, indicating it is feasible to generate large-scale ecosystem resilience maps with this assessment model, and the results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of forests, which is of great significance to the climate change mitigation.

J	Neves, BM; Du Preez, C; Edinger, E				Neves, Barbara M.; Du Preez, Cherisse; Edinger, Evan			Mapping coral and sponge habitats on a shelf-depth environment using multibeam sonar and ROV video observations: Learmonth Bank, northern British Columbia, Canada	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					5th International Symposium on Deep-Sea Corals (ISDSC5)	APR 01-06, 2012	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS					Efforts to locate and map deep-water coral and sponge habitats are essential for the effective management and conservation of these vulnerable marine ecosystems. Here we test the applicability of a simple multibeam sonar classification method developed for fjord environments to map the distribution of shelf-depth substrates and gorgonian coral- and sponge-dominated biotopes. The studied area is a shelf-depth feature Learmonth Bank, northern British Columbia, Canada and the method was applied aiming to map primarily non-reef forming coral and sponge biotopes. Aside from producing high-resolution maps (5 m(2) raster grid), biotope-substrate associations were also investigated. A multibeam sonar survey yielded bathymetry, acoustic backscatter strength and slope. From benthic video transects recorded by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) six primary substrate types and twelve biotope categories were identified, defined by the primary sediment and dominant biological structure, respectively. Substrate and biotope maps were produced using a supervised classification mostly based on the inter-quartile range of the acoustic variables for each substrate type and biotope. Twenty-five percent of the video observations were randomly reserved for testing the classification accuracy. The dominant biotope-defining corals were red tree coral Primnoa pacifica and small styasterids, of which Stylaster parageus was common. Demosponges and hexactinellid sponges were frequently observed but no sponge reefs were observed. The substrate classification readily distinguished fine sediment, Sand and Bedrock from the other substrate types, but had greater difficulty distinguishing Bedrock from Boulders and Cobble. The biotope classification accurately identified Gardens (dense aggregations of sponges and corals) and Primnoa-dominated biotopes (67% accuracy), but most other biotopes had lower accuracies. There was a significant correspondence between Learmonth's biotopes and substrate types, with many biotopes strongly associated with only a single substrate type. This strong correspondence allowed substrate types to function as a surrogate for helping to map biotope distributions. Our results add new information on the distribution of corals and sponges at Learmonth Bank, which can be used to guide management at this location. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (Res) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS Res anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002-2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed Res anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM Res anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, K-d can be used as an index of water quality for coastal ecosystems that are dependent on photosynthesis, such as the coral reef environments of the Florida Reef Tract. Ultraviolet (UV) light reaching corals can lead to reductions in photosynthetic capacity as well as DNA damage. Unfortunately, field measurements of K-d(UV) lack sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to derive statistically meaningful patterns, and it has been notoriously difficult to derive K-d in optically shallow waters from remote sensing due to bottom contamination. Here we describe an approach to derive K-d(UV) in optically shallow waters of the Florida Keys using variations in the spectral shape of MODIS-derived surface reflectance. The approach used a principal component analysis and stepwise multiple regression to parsimoniously select modes of variance in MODIS-derived reflectance data that best explained variance in concurrent in situ K-d(UV) measurements. The resulting models for K-d(UV) retrievals in waters 1-30 m deep showed strong positive relationships between derived and measured parameters [e.g., for K-d(305) ranging from 0.28 to 3.27 m(-1); N = 29; R-2 = 0.94]. The predictive capabilities of these models were further tested, also showing acceptable performance [for K-d(305), R2 = 0.92; bias = -0.02 m(-1); URMS = 23%]. The same approach worked reasonably well in deriving the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in UV wavelengths [a(g)(UV), m(-1)], as K-d(UV) is dominated by ag(UV). Application of the approach to MODIS data showed different spatial and temporal K-d(305) patterns than the K-d(488) patterns derived from a recently validated semi-analytical approach, suggesting that different mechanisms are controlling K-d in the UV and in the visible. Given the importance of water clarity and light availability to shallow-water flora and fauna, the new K-d(UV) and ag(UV) data products provide unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring of coral reef health, and could further assist ongoing regional protection efforts.

Geographically Adaptive Inversion Model for Improving Bathymetric Retrieval From Satellite Multispectral Imagery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Optical remote sensing imagery offers a cost-effective alternative to echo sounding and bathymetric light detection and ranging surveys for deriving high density bottom depth estimates for coastal and inland water bodies. The common practice of previous studies has been to calibrate a single global bathymetric inversion model for an entire image scene. The performance of conventional global models is limited when the bottom type and water quality vary spatially within the scene. To address the inadequacy of the conventional global models, this paper presents a geographically adaptive inversion model to better estimate bottom depth. Although the general mathematical form of the geographically adaptive model is the same, model parameters are optimally determined within a geographical region or a local area, in contrast to the entire scene in the global inversion model. By using high-resolution IKONOS and moderate-resolution Landsat satellite images, we demonstrated that regionally and locally calibrated inversion models can effectively address the problems introduced by spatial heterogeneity in water quality and bottom type, and provide significantly improved bathymetric estimates for more complex coastal waters.

We aim to show that remote sensing (RS), as demonstrated for terrestrial protected areas, has the potential to provide key information to support MPA management. We review existing literature on the use of RS to monitor biodiversity surrogates, e.g. ecological (e.g., primary productivity) and oceanographic (e.g., Sea Surface Temperature) parameters that have been shown to structure marine biodiversity. We then highlight the potential for RS to inform marine habitat mapping and monitoring, and discuss how RS can be used to track anthropogenic activities and its impacts on biodiversity in MPAs. Reasons for low integration of RS in MPA management and current limitations are also presented. This work concludes that RS shows great promise to support wildlife managers in their efforts to protect marine biodiversity around the world, in particular when such information is used in conjunction with data from field surveys.

However, the investigation is not conducive to the traditional surveys, but just very suitable for satellite images of large area investigation. This study used multispectral optical satellite images cooperated with in situ ground truth data, to investigate bottom and habitat's distribution of the atoll crest. By classification by satellite images, the crest could be classified into 4 habitats: sea grass, live coral, sand and rock, beside the habitats distribution and the area also been estimated. Overall, the sea grass habitat distributed inside of the crest, the rock habitat mostly distributed outside of the crest and the live coral habitat located in between the two. The accuracy evaluation of the habitats survey also has been completed by ground truth and the correct rate could obtain around 85%. In addition, this study also used the satellite images in different seasons, the sea grass in the summer there is a more bushy growth trend, while the growth of algae in the autumn there are relatively strong trend.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-3646-5				2014																		WOS:000412588000315

A thorough understanding of these processes is essential to determining whether distant populations are connected and how to adapt management plans to patterns in connectivity. Managers may erroneously assume that local populations are isolated when they are actually replenished by distant reefs beyond their jurisdiction. Researchers increasingly rely on numerical hydrodynamic models that simulate the spatio-temporal dispersal of larvae by ocean currents to elucidate these connections and guide marine spatial planners, yet relatively little work has been done to validate these models with empirical data. In this study, we tested a dispersal simulation model against in situ observations of young post-larval fish to investigate a whether larvae settling at La Reunion (in the western Indian Ocean) might have originated at Mauritius, 200 km distant. First, we collected post larval specimens of honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra) shortly after an episodic mass settlement that occurred in 2002 at La Reunion. Using sclerochronology, we established the age of the fish from their otoliths. Finally, we simulated dispersal of larvae from La Reunion, Mauritius, and other reefs in the region by ocean currents using a 20 Eulerian advection-diffusion model driven by current velocities derived from satellite remote sensing. The simulation suggested that larvae spawned at la Reunion were carried away from the island while larvae spawned at Mauritius were carried to La Reunion. The otolith-derived ages of the fish were compatible with this hypothesis, when we accounted for the time required for larvae to drift from Mauritius to La Reunion. The combined results suggest a dispersal connection from Mauritius to la Reunion. To best maintain populations of adult reef fish at La Reunion, managers should protect stocks spawning at Mauritius. Although more study is needed to characterize patterns of regional connectivity and account for seasonal and inter-annual variations in these patterns, the example presented here demonstrates the possibility of distant connections in the western Indian Ocean. We urge managers in the region to look beyond their own jurisdictions, view their jurisdictions as part of a connected network, and undertake a collaborative approach to protecting the network as a whole.

J	Cunningham, S; Guzman, HM; Bates, R				Cunningham, Sarah; Guzman, Hector M.; Bates, Richard			The morphology and structure of the Hannibal Bank fisheries management zone, Pacific Panama using acoustic seabed mapping	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The Hannibal Bank sits within the Coiba UNESCO World Heritage Site in Pacific Panama and is also a fisheries management zone. Despite the protected status of the area and the importance of the Bank for commercial fish species such as snapper and tuna, the seamount has received no detailed survey except some collection of organisms. This study mapped the major topographic features and complexity of the Hannibal Bank seamount using acoustic remote sensing. A survey area of around 125km(2) was defined using existing charts and side-scan sonar data were collected during July 2008. A bathymetric output was imported to ArcGIS where a digital bathymetric model and slope map were created. The Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) extension for ArcGIS was used to calculate bathymetric position index and rugosity, and used to create a map of zones representing the various seabed morphology zones. The Hannibal bank is an elongated, triangular guyot (flat topped seamount), which ranges in depth from 53m to 416m, covers an area of 76km(2) and is 14.4km long and 7.1km wide. Hannibal bank is composed of steep slopes, more gentle slopes, top of the seamount, crests (elevated ridges at the top of the pinnacles), rugose areas (on crests, top of seamount and slope), gullies and pinnacles. The bank is asymmetric in nature with the Northerly side having a relatively gentle slope with gullies across the surface compared to the SouthWest side which is far steeper and more rugose. There are two pinnacles to the North and South East of the bank that range in depth from 180 to 333m. Rocky substrate makes up 22.6km(2) of the bank and sediment 37.8km(2). The bank and its steeply sided, rugose areas and pinnacles provide upright structures which can disrupt and topographically enhance currents, increasing productivity. The rugose areas of Hannibal Bank should be primary targets for further research efforts as they may contain corals and their rugosity indicates that these should be some of the highest faunal diversity areas of the bank. Hannibal Bank is likely to come increasing pressure in the future through climate change and fishing and this study has produced valuable information to assist in the future mapping and management of habitats, associated species and fisheries.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2013	61	4					1967	1979										WOS:000329534400031	24432547

In this study, we evaluated the applicability of hyperspectral imagery collected from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) for benthic habitat mapping in the Florida Keys. An overall accuracy of 84.3% and 86.7% was achieved respectively for a group-level (3-class) and code-level (12-class) classification by integrating object-based image analysis (OBIA), hyperspectral image processing methods, and machine learning algorithms. Accurate and informative object-based benthic habitat maps were produced. Three commonly used image correction procedures (atmospheric, sun-glint, and water-column corrections) were proved unnecessary for small area mapping in the Florida Keys. Inclusion of bathymetry data in the mapping procedure did not increase the classification accuracy. This study indicates that hyperspectral systems are promising in accurate benthic habitat mapping at a fine detail level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A geospatial assessment of the relationship between reef flat community calcium carbonate production and wave energy	CORAL REEFS												The ability of benthic communities inhabiting coral reefs to produce calcium carbonate underpins the development of reef platforms and associated sedimentary landforms, as well as the fixation of inorganic carbon and buffering of diurnal pH fluctuations in ocean surface waters. Quantification of the relationship between reef flat community calcium carbonate production and wave energy provides an empirical basis for understanding and managing this functionally important process. This study employs geospatial techniques across the reef platform at Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, to (1) map the distribution and estimate the total magnitude of reef community carbonate production and (2) empirically ascertain the influence of wave energy on community carbonate production. A World-View-2 satellite image and a field data set of 364 ground referencing points are employed, along with data on physical reef characteristics (e.g. bathymetry, rugosity) to map and validate the spatial distribution of the four major community carbonate producers (live coral, carbonate sand, green calcareous macroalgae and encrusting calcified algae) across the reef platform. Carbonate production is estimated for the complete reef platform from the composition of these community components. A synoptic model of wave energy is developed using the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) two-dimensional model for the entire reef platform. The relationship between locally derived measures of carbonate production and wave energy is evaluated at both the global scale and local scale along spatial gradients of wave energy traversing the reef platform. A wave energy threshold is identified, below which carbonate production levels appear to increase with wave energy and above which mechanical forcing reduces community production. This implies an optimal set of hydrodynamic conditions characterized by wave energy levels of approximately 300 J m(-2), providing an empirical basis for management of potential changes in community carbonate production associated with climate change-driven increases in wave energy.

This research attempted to develop a new approach to estimate k (d) in blue and green bands of QuickBird satellite image based on the integration of Lyzenga's method and updated NASA-k (d) (490) algorithm. To do this, the Lyzenga's method was utilized to determine the ratio of k (d) in different bands of QuickBird satellite image. Additionally, NASA-k (d) (490) algorithm was applied to determine k (d) (490) by using remotely sensed reflectance values of blue (R (rs) (Blue) ) and green (R (rs) (Green) ) bands in each pixel of QuickBird satellite image. Since the aforementioned algorithm has been developed for other types of sensors, an approach using weighted mean value of parameters for SeaWiFS, MERIS, VIIRS, and OCTS sensors were employed to estimate parameter values for QuickBird image. After determining the k (d) (490) values as k (d) for blue band, the k (d) values for green and red bands were subsequently obtained by using Lyzenga's method. Then, Mumby and Edwards' method was employed as evidence to evaluate the accuracy of the results achieved from newly developed approach. Eventually, the maximum likelihood classifier was implemented during pre and post correction steps to examine the capability of the proposed approach. The final results proved to be consistent in the areas deeper than 2 m between estimated k (d) values using the proposed approach and the results obtained from Mumby and Edwards' method. On the other hand, the values estimated for extremely shallow areas seem to be overestimated. Furthermore, results demonstrated an increment of similar to 16 % in the overall accuracy of the classification.

Live Coral Cover Index Testing and Application with Hyperspectral Airborne Image Data	REMOTE SENSING												Coral reefs are complex, heterogeneous environments where it is common for the features of interest to be smaller than the spatial dimensions of imaging sensors. While the coverage of live coral at any point in time is a critical environmental management issue, image pixels may represent mixed proportions of coverage. In order to address this, we describe the development, application, and testing of a spectral index for mapping live coral cover using CASI-2 airborne hyperspectral high spatial resolution imagery of Heron Reef, Australia. Field surveys were conducted in areas of varying depth to quantify live coral cover. Image statistics were extracted from co-registered imagery in the form of reflectance, derivatives, and band ratios. Each of the spectral transforms was assessed for their correlation with live coral cover, determining that the second derivative around 564 nm was the most sensitive to live coral cover variations(r(2) = 0.63). Extensive field survey was used to transform relative to absolute coral cover, which was then applied to produce a live coral cover map of Heron Reef. We present the live coral cover index as a simple and viable means to estimate the amount of live coral over potentially thousands of km(2) and in clear-water reefs.

Bucket structure in carbonate accumulations of the Maldive, Chagos and Laccadive archipelagos	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Peritidal platforms rimmed by reefs, and raised reefs rimming deep lagoons, are characteristic morphologies of the tropical carbonate factory; their geometry contrasts sharply with the seaward-sloping shelves of siliciclastic margins. The structure has been compared to a bucket-stiff reef rims holding a pile of loose sediment. Remote-sensing data from the Maldive, Chagos and Laccadive archipelagos of the Indian Ocean show that ring reefs with bucket structure are the dominant depositional pattern from patch reefs of tens of meters to archipelagos of hundreds of kilometers in diameter, that is, over more than 4 orders of magnitude in linear size. Over 2.5 orders of magnitude, the bucket structures qualify as statistical fractals, exhibiting self-similar patterns and size distributions following power laws. However, most regional or genetic subsets of the data follow lognormal distributions and small subsets of lagoon reefs exhibit exponential distributions. Seismic data and boreholes in the Maldives indicate that the bucket has been a dominant depositional motif since the Oligocene. Ecological and hydrodynamic studies on modern reefs suggest that the bucket structure is a form of biotic self-organization: the edge position in a reef is favored over the center position because bottom shear is higher and the diffusive boundary layer between reef and water thinner. Thus, the reef edge has easier access to nutrients and is less likely to be buried by sediment. The bucket structure reflects these conditions. Karst processes have accentuated the surface relief of the buckets, particularly in the late Quaternary.																	1437-3254	1437-3262				NOV	2013	102	8					2225	2238		10.1007/s00531-013-0913-5								WOS:000325804900009						
J	Klemas, V				Klemas, V.			Remote sensing of emergent and submerged wetlands: an overview	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												To plan for wetland protection and responsible coastal development, scientists and managers need to monitor changes in the coastal zone, as the sea level continues to rise and the coastal population keeps expanding. Advances in sensor design and data analysis techniques are now making remote-sensing systems practical and cost-effective for monitoring natural and human-induced coastal changes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers, light detection and ranging (lidar), and radar systems are available for mapping coastal marshes, submerged aquatic vegetation, coral reefs, beach profiles, algal blooms, and concentrations of suspended particles and dissolved substances in coastal waters. Since coastal ecosystems have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they should be observed with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. New satellites, carrying sensors with fine spatial (0.4-4 m) or spectral (200 narrow bands) resolution, are now more accurately detecting changes in coastal wetland extent, ecosystem health, biological productivity, and habitat quality. Using airborne lidars, one can produce topographic and bathymetric maps, even in moderately turbid coastal waters. Imaging radars are sensitive to soil moisture and inundation and can detect hydrologic features beneath the vegetation canopy. Combining these techniques and using time-series of images enables scientists to study the health of coastal ecosystems and accurately determine long-term trends and short-term changes.				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013													0143-1161	1366-5901				SEP 20	2013	34	18			SI		6286	6320		10.1080/01431161.2013.800656								WOS:000321170600002

Filling the "white ribbon' - a multisource seamless digital elevation model for Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Hydrographers have traditionally referred to the nearshore area as the white ribbon' area due to the challenges associated with the collection of elevation data (elevation hereafter refers to both topography and bathymetry) in this highly dynamic transitional zone between terrestrial and marine environments. Accordingly, available information in this zone is typically characterized by a range of data sets from disparate sources. In this article, we propose a framework to fill the white ribbon area of a coral reef system by integrating multiple elevation data sets acquired by a suite of remote-sensing technologies into a seamless digital elevation model (DEM). A range of data sets are integrated, including field-collected global positioning system (GPS) elevation points, topographic and bathymetric light detecting and ranging (lidar), single and multibeam echosoundings, nautical charts, and bathymetry derived from optical remote-sensing imagery. The proposed framework ranks data reliability internally, thereby avoiding the requirements to quantify absolute error and results in a high-resolution, seamless product. Nested within this approach is an effective spatially explicit technique for improving the accuracy of bathymetry estimates derived empirically from optical satellite imagery through modelling the spatial structure of residuals. The approach was applied to data collected on and around Lizard Island in northern Australia. Collectively, the framework holds promise for filling the white ribbon zone in coastal areas characterized by similar data availability scenarios.

The semi-automated classification of acoustic imagery for characterizing coral reef ecosystems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Coral reef habitat maps describe the spatial distribution and abundance of tropical marine resources, making them essential for ecosystem-based approaches to planning and management. Typically, these habitat maps have been created from optical and acoustic remotely sensed imagery using manual, pixel- and object-based classification methods. However, past studies have shown that none of these classification methods alone are optimal for characterizing coral reef habitats for multiple management applications because the maps they produce (1) are not synoptic, (2) are time consuming to develop, (3) have low thematic resolutions (i.e. number of classes), or (4) have low overall thematic accuracies. To address these deficiencies, a novel, semi-automated object- and pixel-based technique was applied to multibeam echo sounder imagery to determine its utility for characterizing coral reef ecosystems. This study is not a direct comparison of these different methods but rather, a first attempt at applying a new classification technique to acoustic imagery. This technique used a combination of principal components analysis, edge-based segmentation, and Quick, Unbiased, and Efficient Statistical Trees (QUEST) to successfully partition the acoustic imagery into 35 distinct combinations of (1) major and (2) detailed geomorphological structure, (3) major and (4) detailed biological cover, and (5) live coral cover types. Thematic accuracies for these classes (corrected for proportional bias) were as follows: (1) 95.7%, (2) 88.7%, (3) 95.0%, (4) 74.0%, and (5) 88.3%, respectively. Approximately half of the habitat polygons were manually edited (hence the name semi-automated') due to a combination of mis-classifications by QUEST and noise in the acoustic data. While this method did not generate a map that was entirely reproducible, it does show promise for increasing the amount of automation with which thematically accurate benthic habitat maps can be generated from acoustic imagery.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				SEP 20	2013	34	18			SI		6389	6422		10.1080/01431161.2013.800661								WOS:000321170600007						
J	Pe'eri, S; Shwaery, G				Pe'eri, Shachak; Shwaery, Glenn			Radiometric and photometric determinations of simulated shallow-water environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Optical remote sensing is increasingly becoming a preferred economic alternative to the traditional in situ observations and physical sampling for mapping and monitoring habitats. Submersed habitats, such as eelgrass and corals, are especially challenging for field work. Even for remote-sensing work, a priori knowledge of environmental factors is required for highly accurate analysis. Background illumination and water clarity are two key factors that affect the optical remote-sensing imagery, which may vary widely with season, time of year, geographic location, or water depth. This article presents efforts to simulate natural oceanic conditions in a laboratory setting. Solar radiation predicted at different latitudes under varying water clarity conditions and depth were replicated using a 2.5m deep wave tank at the University of New Hampshire. The goals of the study were: (1) to simulate illumination and water clarity conditions that approximate coastal and oceanic waters, and (2) to quantify the impact of the simulated illumination and water clarity conditions at different depths on the apparent colours that can be observed from an aerial platform. The empirical radiometric measurements included irradiance, radiance, and remote-sensing reflectance from an underwater array of light sources. The results of the study show good correlation (r(2)=0.89-0.93) between the natural daylight spectrum at the water surface and the irradiance measurements between 350 nm and 590 nm, at 3.5m from the light array. The colours of the clear and murky water types were photometrically calculated from the radiometric measurements and validated using underwater video imagery. Using this methodology, illumination and water clarity can be replicated under controlled laboratory conditions and used to assist in studying the physical, chemical, and biological processes in habitats, at varied geographic locations and differing environments.																	0143-1161					SEP 20	2013	34	18			SI		6437	6450		10.1080/01431161.2013.800657								WOS:000321170600009						
J	Hamylton, S; Silverman, J; Shaw, E				Hamylton, Sarah; Silverman, Jacob; Shaw, Emily			The use of remote sensing to scale up measures of carbonate production on reef systems: a comparison of hydrochemical and census-based estimation methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The present study uses remote-sensing imagery to estimate carbonate production of the complete One Tree Island reef system, Great Barrier Reef, using hydrochemical (alkalinity reduction) and census-based (budgetary) methods. For five sites representing different benthic cover types across the reef system, carbonate production is determined using hydrochemical techniques that incubate substrates in a local aquarium and measure total alkalinity, total ammonia nitrogen, and total oxidized nitrogen. Local estimates are scaled up to the reef-system scale using a WorldView-2 satellite image, which is ground truthed against a field data set of 350 spatially referenced records of benthic assemblage. Annual total reef system carbonate production based on hydrochemical and census-based methods is estimated at 40,335 and 38,998 tonnes of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), respectively. The minimal difference (0.3%) between these estimates is attributed to under representation of small carbonate producers, such as benthic foraminifera, which are difficult to incorporate in the underwater video methodology employed to populate census budgets. This finding demonstrates the utility of remote sensing for upscaling local measures of carbonate production across reef systems accurately and consistently in spite of the use of different initial estimation methods.

J	Pu, RL; Bell, S				Pu, Ruiliang; Bell, Susan			A protocol for improving mapping and assessing of seagrass abundance along the West Central Coast of Florida using Landsat TM and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion images	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Seagrass habitats are characteristic features of shallow waters worldwide and provide a variety of ecosystem functions. Remote sensing techniques can help collect spatial and temporal information about seagrass resources. In this study, we evaluate a protocol that utilizes image optimization algorithms followed by atmospheric and sunglint corrections to the three satellite sensors [Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP)] and a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique to map and assess seagrass abundance in Pinellas County, FL, USA. After image preprocessed with image optimization algorithms and atmospheric and sunglint correction approaches, the three sensors' data were used to classify the submerged aquatic vegetation cover (%SAV cover) into 5 classes with a maximum likelihood classifier. Based on three biological metrics [%SAV, leaf area index (LA!), and Biomass] measured from the field, nine multiple regression models were developed for estimating the three biometrics with spectral variables derived from the three sensors' data. Then, five membership maps were created with the three biometrics along with two environmental factors (water depth and distance-to-shoreline). Finally, seagrass abundance maps were produced by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique and five membership maps. The experimental results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best results of the 5-class classification of %SAV cover (overall accuracy = 87% and Kappa = 0.83 vs. 82% and 0.77 by ALI and 79% and 0.73 by TM) and better multiple regression models for estimating the three biometrics (R-2 = 0.66, 0.62 and 0.61 for %SAV, LAI and Biomass vs. 0.62, 0.61 and 0.55 by ALI and 0.58, 0.56 and 0.52 by TM) for creating seagrass abundance maps along with two environmental factors. Combined our results demonstrate that the image optimization algorithms and the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique were effective in mapping detailed seagrass habitats and assessing seagrass abundance with the 30-m resolution data collected by the three sensors.

Fifty years of changes in reef flat habitats of the Grand R,cif of Toliara (SW Madagascar) and the impact of gleaning	CORAL REEFS												The Grand R,cif of Toliara (GRT) in Madagascar is a large (33 km(2)) barrier reef system of the SW Indian Ocean that had been well investigated in the 1960s and early 1970s. A massive degradation of the reef has been reported since at least the early 1980s, just a few years after research activities ceased in the area. Examination of historical aerial photographs and modern high-resolution remote sensing images confirms a continuous loss of coral habitat on GRT outer reef flats between 1962 and 2011, with an average loss of 65 % and a range of 37-79 % loss during this 50-year period. The usual suspects of coral community declines (cyclones, bleaching and sedimentation) may have contributed to the demise of the GRT. However, an independent study (Salimo 1997) suggests that the chronic pressure of fisherman gleaning on reef flats with destructive tools is the main driver of the observed changes. Salimo's reported level of frequentation (6.8 fishermen per day and per km(-2)) and rates of destruction per fisherman (7.7 m(2) of coral habitat h(-1)) yield a cumulated overall loss in agreement with the image-based rates of habitat loss. The GRT is unlikely to recover because this chronic stress is unlikely to decrease in the near future. Indeed, the GRT daily provides subsistence fishery resources for local Vezo people and to agriculturalist or pastoralist ethnic groups who have turned to exploiting coastal resources due to increasing aridity and dwindling agricultural and livestock production.

J	Caras, T; Karnieli, A				Caras, T.; Karnieli, A.			Ground-level spectroscopy analyses and classification of coral reefs using a hyperspectral camera	CORAL REEFS												With the general aim of classification and mapping of coral reefs, remote sensing has traditionally been more difficult to implement in comparison with terrestrial equivalents. Images used for the marine environment suffer from environmental limitation (water absorption, scattering, and glint); sensor-related limitations (spectral and spatial resolution); and habitat limitation (substrate spectral similarity). Presented here is an advanced approach for ground-level surveying of a coral reef using a hyperspectral camera (400-1,000 nm) that is able to address all of these limitations. Used from the surface, the image includes a white reference plate that offers a solution for correcting the water column effect. The imaging system produces millimeter size pixels and 80 relevant bands. The data collected have the advantages of both a field point spectrometer (hyperspectral resolution) and a digital camera (spatial resolution). Finally, the availability of pure pixel imagery significantly improves the potential for substrate recognition in comparison with traditionally used remote sensing mixed pixels. In this study, an image of a coral reef table in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, was classified, demonstrating the benefits of this technology for the first time. Preprocessing includes testing of two normalization approaches, three spectral resolutions, and two spectral ranges. Trained classification was performed using support vector machine that was manually trained and tested against a digital image that provided empirical verification. For the classification of 5 core classes, the best results were achieved using a combination of a 450-660 nm spectral range, 5 nm wide bands, and the employment of red-band normalization. Overall classification accuracy was improved from 86 % for the original image to 99 % for the normalized image. Spectral resolution and spectral ranges seemed to have a limited effect on the classification accuracy. The proposed methodology and the use of automatic classification procedures can be successfully applied for reef survey and monitoring and even upscaled for a large survey.																	0722-4028	1432-0975				SEP	2013	32	3					825	834		10.1007/s00338-013-1033-1								WOS:000322874500024						
J	Visser, F; Wallis, C; Sinnott, AM				Visser, Fleur; Wallis, Caroline; Sinnott, Anne M.			Optical remote sensing of submerged aquatic vegetation: Opportunities for shallow clearwater streams	LIMNOLOGICA												Remote sensing has rarely been used as a tool to map and monitor submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in rivers, due to a combination of insufficient spatial resolution of available image data and strong attenuation of light in water through absorption and scattering. The latter process reduces the possibility to use spectral reflectance information to accurately classify submerged species. However, increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) image data may enable the use of shape and texture features to help discriminate between species by taking an object based image analysis (OBIA) approach, and overcome some of the present limitations. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of using optical remote sensing for the detection and mapping of SAV. It firstly looked at the possibilities to discriminate submerged macrophyte species based on spectral information only. Reflectance spectra of three macrophyte species were measured in situ across a range of submergence depths. The results showed that water depth will be a limiting factor for the classification of species from remote sensing images. Only Spiked Water Milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) was indicated as spectrally distinct through ANOVA analysis, but subsequent Jeffries-Matusita distance analysis did not confirm this. In particular Water Crowfoot (Ranunculus fluitans) and Pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) could not be discriminated at 95% significance level. Spectral separability of these two species was also not possible without the effect of an overlying water column. Secondly, the possibility to improve species discrimination, using spatial and textural information was investigated for the same SAV species. VHR image data was acquired with a Near Infrared (NIR) sensitive DSLR camera from four different heights including a telescopic pole and a Helikite UAS. The results show that shape and texture information can improve the detection of the spectrally similar Pondweed and Water Crowfoot from VHR image data. The best performing feature 'length/width ratio of sub-objects' was obtained through expert knowledge. All of the shape and texture based features performed better at species differentiation than the spectrally based features. In conclusion this study has shown that there is considerable potential for the combination of VHR data and OBIA to map SAV in shallow stream environments, which can benefit species monitoring and management.

Environmental controls at multiple scales for the western Pacific: An Okinawan case study	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In this study, the principal controls on the coastal environment around the Pacific island of Okinawa, typical of the many mountainous islands of the sub-tropical and tropical northwest Pacific in the arc from Melanesia to the Ryukyu Islands, are investigated. Two principal satellite remote sensing data products were used to observe properties at regional-scale and in the Okinawan coastal zone: (1) AVHRR sea surface temperature (SST) for 1985-2006 and (2) a SeaWiFS ocean colour variable to estimate combined sediment and chlorophyll-a loadings for 1998-2006, along with direct observations (e.g. climatological data, river discharge, suspended sediment and typhoon tracks). Analysis suggested that coastal SST is strongly influenced by the outer ocean SST, indicating a regional control. However, the local winds, with associated summer rainfall and copious sediment-laden run-off, had a significant secondary impact. Typhoons are also an important factor leading to ocean colour variation. Along the western coastal zone of Okinawa, the winter East Asian Monsoon causes significant upwelling and seafloor sediment removal, while terrestrial impact is a significant secondary control in summer on ocean colour variability via sediment-laden river run-off. Previously noted changes in the magnitude of extreme rainfall events in the area suggest that sediment delivery to the coastal zones of islands in the region has been increasing in recent decades, providing a combined climate and terrestrial impact on the coastal environment. Although typhoons and heavy rainfall are episodic events, appropriate land management on the many hilly and mountainous islands of the sub-tropical northwestern Pacific is needed if such events are not to lead to deterioration, and decrease of resilience, of coastal ecosystems.

Tectonically, Ras Banas peninsula is considered as a part of Pre-Miocene continental slope. Their sedimentary successions account the sedimentation history from Middle Miocene up to Holocene which in part documents the deformational impacts that accompanied the Red Sea rifling. The Ras Banas sedimentary succession exhibits frequent unconformities and conspicuous lithologic variations comprising mixed siliciclastics/carbonate facies, evaporites, open marine and organic build up limestone as well as coral reefs, continental sandy gravels and beach sands. The carbonate succession at the area documents the highstand status of the Red Sea water from Middle Miocene to Pleistocene in accord to the global sea-level fluctuations. The chemical data of the studied rock units substantiates the field and petrographical results. On silica- lime- magnesia diagram, the syn-rifting mixed siliciclastics/carbonates are scattered between the quartz and dolomite reference points. The post-rifting carbonates are mainly pure dolostone, limestone and sandy limestone. Norm calculations indicate that the evaporites are mainly gypsum and anhydrite with substantial normative dolomite. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of Ras Banas sedimentary sequence in relation to Red Sea rifling phases and sea level fluctuations is discussed. New mapping was undertaken for the Ras Banas Peninsula using remote sensing and GIS techniques including band ratioing, principle component analysis and false color composition. Based on mineralogical data, special interest has been paid to the diagnostic spectral features that discriminate between evaporites and carbonates on one hand and between dolomite and calcite on the other.

J	Bilham, R; Fielding, E				Bilham, Roger; Fielding, Eric			Remote sensing and the search for surface rupture, Haiti 2010	NATURAL HAZARDS												Minutes after the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake, most geologists and seismologists assumed that from its shallow teleseismic location and its largely strike-slip mechanism that a significant rupture must have occurred on the transform plate boundary south and west of Port au Prince. Within hours, plans were being made by geologists to map the anticipated rupture and, if possible, to trench it to obtain a record of paleoseismic slip. However, remote sensing images available a few days after the earthquake revealed raised corals and no significant plate boundary slip, and we now know that shallow slip was transpressive and that no surface rupture occurred. A week after the earthquake, it was clear that scientific visits to the region would be much delayed by the continuing needs of emergency response teams and military support who had commandeered access to the airport at Port au Prince. Serendipitously on 20 January, one of the authors accompanied a film crew on a chartered flight from nearby Santo Domingo with the quest to record the tectonic reasons for the disaster and to document the details of structural damage. At the time, there was still no clear idea of whether the transform boundary had a surface rupture, but there was abundant evidence for surface deformation from Google Earth images showing raised corals and collapsed coastlines along the Leogane coast. This article briefly describes communications between remote geologists and the ground-based crew who were guided to critical areas in the search for surface deformation using remote sensing data.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kobryn, HT; Wouters, K; Beckley, LE; Heege, T				Kobryn, Halina T.; Wouters, Kristin; Beckley, Lynnath E.; Heege, Thomas			Ningaloo Reef: Shallow Marine Habitats Mapped Using a Hyperspectral Sensor	PLOS ONE												Research, monitoring and management of large marine protected areas require detailed and up-to-date habitat maps. Ningaloo Marine Park (including the Muiron Islands) in north-western Australia (stretching across three degrees of latitude) was mapped to 20 m depth using HyMap airborne hyperspectral imagery (125 bands) at 3.5 m resolution across the 762 km(2) of reef environment between the shoreline and reef slope. The imagery was corrected for atmospheric, air-water interface and water column influences to retrieve bottom reflectance and bathymetry using the physics-based Modular Inversion and Processing System. Using field-validated, image-derived spectra from a representative range of cover types, the classification combined a semi-automated, pixel-based approach with fuzzy logic and derivative techniques. Five thematic classification levels for benthic cover (with probability maps) were generated with varying degrees of detail, ranging from a basic one with three classes (biotic, abiotic and mixed) to the most detailed with 46 classes. The latter consisted of all abiotic and biotic seabed components and hard coral growth forms in dominant or mixed states. The overall accuracy of mapping for the most detailed maps was 70% for the highest classification level. Macro-algal communities formed most of the benthic cover, while hard and soft corals represented only about 7% of the mapped area (58.6 km(2)). Dense tabulate coral was the largest coral mosaic type (37% of all corals) and the rest of the corals were a mix of tabulate, digitate, massive and soft corals. Our results show that for this shallow, fringing reef environment situated in the arid tropics, hyperspectral remote sensing techniques can offer an efficient and cost-effective approach to mapping and monitoring reef habitats over large, remote and inaccessible areas.

J	Leahy, SM; Kingsford, MJ; Steinberg, CR				Leahy, Susannah M.; Kingsford, Michael J.; Steinberg, Craig R.			Do Clouds Save the Great Barrier Reef? Satellite Imagery Elucidates the Cloud-SST Relationship at the Local Scale	PLOS ONE												Evidence of global climate change and rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is now well documented in the scientific literature. With corals already living close to their thermal maxima, increases in SSTs are of great concern for the survival of coral reefs. Cloud feedback processes may have the potential to constrain SSTs, serving to enforce an "ocean thermostat" and promoting the survival of coral reefs. In this study, it was hypothesized that cloud cover can affect summer SSTs in the tropics. Detailed direct and lagged relationships between cloud cover and SST across the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) shelf were investigated using data from satellite imagery and in situ temperature and light loggers during two relatively hot summers (2005 and 2006) and two relatively cool summers (2007 and 2008). Across all study summers and shelf positions, SSTs exhibited distinct drops during periods of high cloud cover, and conversely, SST increases during periods of low cloud cover, with a three-day temporal lag between a change in cloud cover and a subsequent change in SST. Cloud cover alone was responsible for up to 32.1% of the variation in SSTs three days later. The relationship was strongest in both El Nino (2005) and La Nina (2008) study summers and at the inner-shelf position in those summers. SST effects on subsequent cloud cover were weaker and more variable among study summers, with rising SSTs explaining up to 21.6% of the increase in cloud cover three days later. This work quantifies the often observed cloud cooling effect on coral reefs. It highlights the importance of incorporating local-scale processes into bleaching forecasting models, and encourages the use of remote sensing imagery to value-add to coral bleaching field studies and to more accurately predict risks to coral reefs.

J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Planes, S				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Philippe; Planes, Serge			Bridging Ridge-to-Reef Patches: Seamless Classification of the Coast Using Very High Resolution Satellite	REMOTE SENSING												The structure and functioning of coral reef coastal zones are currently coping with an increasing variety of threats, thereby altering the coastal spatial patterns at an accelerated pace. Understanding and predicting the evolution of these highly valuable coastal ecosystems require reliable and frequent mapping and monitoring of both inhabited terrestrial and marine areas at the individual tree and coral colony spatial scale. The very high spatial resolution (VHR) mapping that was recently spearheaded by WorldView-2 (WV2) sensor with 2 m and 0.5 m multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) bands has the potential to address this burning issue. The objective of this study was to classify nine terrestrial and twelve marine patch classes with respect to spatial resolution enhancement and coast integrity using eight bands of the WV2 sensor on a coastal zone of Moorea Island, French Polynesia. The contribution of the novel WV2 spectral bands towards classification accuracy at 2 m and 0.5 m were tested using traditional and innovative Pan-sharpening techniques. The land and water classes were examined both separately and combinedly. All spectral combinations that were built only with the novel WV2 bands systematically increased the overall classification accuracy of the standard four band classification. The overall best contribution was attributed to the coastal-red edge-near infrared (NIR) 2 combination (Kappa(gain) = 0.0287), which significantly increased the fleshy and encrusting algae (User's Accuracy(gain) = 18.18%) class. However, the addition of the yellow-NIR2 combination dramatically impacted the hard coral/algae patches class (Producer's Accuracy(loss) = -20.88%). Enhancement of the spatial resolution reduced the standard classification accuracy, depending on the Pan-sharpening technique. The proposed composite method (local maximum) provided better overall results than the commonly used sensor method (systematic). However, the sensor technique produced the highest contribution to the hard coral thicket (PA(gain) = 30.36%) class with the coastal-red edge-NIR2 combination. Partitioning the coast into its terrestrial and aquatic components lowered the overall standard classification accuracy, while strongly enhancing the hard coral bommie class with the coastal-NIR2 combination (UA(gain) = 40%) and the green-coastal Normalized Difference Ratio (UA(gain) = 11.06%). VHR spaceborne remote sensing has the potential to gain substantial innovative insights into the evolution of tropical coastal ecosystems from local to regional scales, to predict the influence of anthropogenic and climate changes and to help design optimized management and conservation frameworks.

J	O'Neill, JD; Costa, M				O'Neill, Jennifer D.; Costa, Maycira			Mapping eelgrass (Zostera marina) in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada using high spatial resolution satellite and airborne imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Eelgrass is a sentinel species that can indicate the overall health of a coastal ecosystem. An effective coastal management strategy should therefore map and actively monitor the distribution of this sentinel for any significant changes. While manual transect methods are commonly employed to map eelgrass, the analysis of remote imagery has been proposed as an efficient alternative; a remote sensor can capture large and inaccessible areas cost- and time-effectively, nearly instantly, and with high frequency. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the efficacy of high spatial resolution airborne (AISA) and satellite (IKONOS) imagery for mapping eelgrass distribution at Sidney Spit, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada (GINPRC). The primary objective was to determine the optimal spectral resolution, spatial resolution and image processing effort for resolving bed location. A two-meter resolution hyperspectral AISA image and a four-meter resolution multispectral IKONOS image were acquired over Sidney Spit in August 2008. Concurrently collected were in situ above-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, underwater videography, and water samples for optical constituent analysis. The images were subjected to varying combinations of 1) image processing steps: atmospheric correction, surface glint correction, deep water masking, and water column removal; 2) image classifiers: with differing user effort and data input requirements; and 3) spectral resolution: >200-band AISA versus a reduced resolution AISA image (AISA(r)) of only four key bands unique to eelgrass - slope 500-530 nm, first derivatives of 556 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm (O'Neill et al. (2011)) - versus four-band IKONOS. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with atmospheric correction, glint correction, deep water masking, and maximum likelihood (ML) classification of the AISA(r) image and IKONOS full resolution image. AISA(r) achieved eelgrass producer and user accuracies of 85% in water less than 3 m deep, and 93% in deeper areas. IKONOS achieved 79% for water less than 3 m deep and 91% in deeper areas. Most confusion occurred between eelgrass and green algae, and between exposed eelgrass and other exposed vegetation. The most automated combination of methods yielded poor accuracies but could be greatly improved by refining atmospheric correction input parameters and building on the endmember spectral library. This study resulted in recommendations for remote eelgrass mapping and monitoring within the GINPRC. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

W.; Stenchikov, Georgiy; Hoteit, Ibrahim			Remote Sensing the Phytoplankton Seasonal Succession of the Red Sea	PLOS ONE												The Red Sea holds one of the most diverse marine ecosystems, primarily due to coral reefs. However, knowledge on large-scale phytoplankton dynamics is limited. Analysis of a 10-year high resolution Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) dataset, along with remotely-sensed sea surface temperature and wind, provided a detailed description of the spatiotemporal seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass in the Red Sea. Based on MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, four distinct Red Sea provinces and seasons are suggested, covering the major patterns of surface phytoplankton production. The Red Sea Chl-a depicts a distinct seasonality with maximum concentrations seen during the winter time (attributed to vertical mixing in the north and wind-induced horizontal intrusion of nutrient-rich water in the south), and minimum concentrations during the summer (associated with strong seasonal stratification). The initiation of the seasonal succession occurs in autumn and lasts until early spring. However, weekly Chl-a seasonal succession data revealed that during the month of June, consistent anti-cyclonic eddies transfer nutrients and/or Chl-a to the open waters of the central Red Sea. This phenomenon occurs during the stratified nutrient depleted season, and thus could provide an important source of nutrients to the open waters. Remotely-sensed synoptic observations highlight that Chl-a does not increase regularly from north to south as previously thought. The Northern part of the Central Red Sea province appears to be the most oligotrophic area (opposed to southern and northern domains). This is likely due to the absence of strong mixing, which is apparent at the northern end of the Red Sea, and low nutrient intrusion in comparison with the southern end. Although the Red Sea is considered an oligotrophic sea, sporadic blooms occur that reach mesotrophic levels. The water temperature and the prevailing winds control the nutrient concentrations within the euphotic zone and enable the horizontal transportation of nutrients.

Incorporating uncertainty associated with habitat data in marine reserve design	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10-90%) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitat-mapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of sea surface temperature anomalies on oceanic coral reef systems in the southwestern tropical Atlantic	CORAL REEFS												In 2010, high sea surface temperatures that were recorded in several parts of the world and caused coral bleaching and coral mortality were also recorded in the southwest Atlantic Ocean, between latitudes 0A degrees S and 8A degrees S. This paper reports on coral bleaching and diseases in Rocas Atoll and Fernando de Noronha archipelago and examines their relationship with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies recorded by PIRATA buoys located at 8A degrees S30A degrees W, 0A degrees S35A degrees W, and 0A degrees S23A degrees W. Adjusted satellite data were used to derive SST climatological means at buoy sites and to derive anomalies at reef sites. The whole region was affected by the elevated temperature anomaly that persisted through 2010, reaching 1.67 A degrees C above average at reef sites and 1.83 A degrees C above average at buoys sites. A significant positive relationship was found between the percentage of coral bleaching that was observed on reef formations and the corresponding HotSpot SST anomaly recorded by both satellite and buoys. These results indicate that the warming observed in the ocean waters was followed by a warming at the reefs. The percentage of bleached corals persisting after the subsidence of the thermal stress, and disease prevalence increased through 2010, after two periods of thermal stress. The in situ temperature anomaly observed during the 2009-2010 El Nio event was equivalent to the anomaly observed during the 1997-1998 El Nio event, explaining similar bleaching intensity. Continued monitoring efforts are necessary to further assess the relationship between bleaching severity and PIRATA SST anomalies and improve the use of this new dataset in future regional bleaching predictions.

Accuracy of IKONOS for mapping benthic coral-reef habitats: a case study from the Puerto Morelos Reef National Park, Mexico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Reefs are being threatened by global warming, natural disasters, and the increased pressure of the global population. These habitats are in urgent need of mapping at high resolution so that these threats can be quantified. Remote sensing can potentially provide such quantitative data. In this article, we attempt to map benthic coral-reef habitats at the Puerto Morelos Reef National Park in Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) and to assess the accuracy of the technique in providing a baseline data for future monitoring of changes and evolution of the reef system. An IKONOS image was used in combination with checkpoint ground sampling and classified using a supervised maximum likelihood classifier (ENVI 4.5). We show that it is possible to map the reef with acceptable accuracy for the lagoon and discriminate the main habitat types, including vegetation, corals, and bare substrate. But, in areas close to the shore and in the front-reef zone, there were significant misclassifications as well as a failure to delineate spatial structures evident on the ground and in aerial imagery. These difficulties and failures occurred either in the areas deeper than 58 m where depth limits light transmission (particularly in the red channel) or when the spectral response of habitats were too close to be discriminated. This highlights the need to combine these data with other methods, such as acoustic mapping, in order to provide more accurate representations of the benthic habitats of entire reef systems.

Based on the analysis of more than 2 500 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite images, the internal wave propagation in the whole South China Sea was investigated systematically. The results show that (1) in the northeastern South China Sea, most internal waves propagate westward from the Luzon Strait and are diffracted by coral reefs near the Dongsha Islands. Some impinge onto the shelf and a few are reflected; (2) in the northwestern South China Sea, most internal waves are generated at the shelf and propagate northwestward or westward to the coast; (3) in the western South China Sea, most internal waves propagate westward to the Vietnamese coast, except a few propagate southward to the deep sea; and (4) in the southern South China Sea, most internal waves propagate southwestward to the coast. Some propagate southeastward to the coast of Kalimantan Island, and a few propagate southeastward because of the influence of the Mekong River.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				MAY	2013	32	5					42	50		10.1007/s13131-013-0312-6								WOS:000318750700006						
J	Lee, ZP; Weidemann, A; Arnone, R				Lee, Zhongping; Weidemann, Alan; Arnone, Robert			Combined Effect of Reduced Band Number and Increased Bandwidth on Shallow Water Remote Sensing: The Case of WorldView 2	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												WorldView 2 (WV2), launched in September 2009, is a satellite with hyperspatial resolution (similar to 0.5-2 m) capability for Earth surface observation. It has eight spectral bands with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio to cover the visible-to-near-infrared (V-NIR) domain, thus providing a great potential for remote sensing of coastal ecosystem, in particular, the aquatic environments with shallow bottoms (e. g., coral reefs and seagrass beds). Traditionally, it requires similar to 15 spectral bands in the V-NIR domain for reliable analytical retrieval of bottom properties (e. g., bathymetry) from remotely observed radiance spectrum. Data from WV2, however, have eight bands, and the width of each band is quite wide (similar to 50 nm or more). Thus, the spectral configuration of WV2 is far from optimal for spectral remote sensing of various complex shallow environments, and it is important and necessary to know how such a band setting affects the reliability of remote-sensing retrievals. Here, we applied a hyperspectral optimization scheme [hyperspectral optimization processing exemplar (HOPE)] to a simulated shallow-bottom data set (sandy bottom) and compared retrievals from both hyperspectral and WV2 spectral settings. Retrieved results suggest that, for bottom contribution making up 40% or more of the measured signal, the depths derived from both hyperspectral and WV2 settings are generally consistent for waters shallower than 5 m. However, depths derived with WV2 setting have greater uncertainty and, in general, are shallower than those derived from the hyperspectral setting, particularly for waters deeper than 10 m. Options to produce higher confident properties from such band settings are discussed.																	0196-2892					MAY	2013	51	5	1				2577	2586		10.1109/TGRS.2012.2218818								WOS:000318428700008

Identifying the affected marine areas and the scale of influence on ecosystems is critical to assess the impacts of degraded water quality and to inform planning for catchment management and marine conservation. Studies using remotely-sensed data have contributed to our understanding of the occurrence and influence of river plumes, and to our ability to assess exposure of marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. However, refinement of plume modeling techniques is required to improve risk assessments. We developed a novel, complementary, approach to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. We used supervised classification of MODIS-Aqua true-color satellite imagery to map the extent of plumes and to qualitatively assess the dispersal of pollutants in plumes. We used the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest coral reef system, to test our approach. We combined frequency of plume occurrence with spatially distributed loads (based on a cost-distance function) to create maps of exposure to suspended sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We then compared annual exposure maps (2007-2011) to assess inter-annual variability in the exposure of coral reefs and seagrass beds to these pollutants. We found this method useful to map plumes and qualitatively assess exposure to land-based pollutants. We observed inter-annual variation in exposure of ecosystems to pollutants in the GBR, stressing the need to incorporate a temporal component into plume exposure/risk models. Our study contributes to our understanding of plume spatial-temporal dynamics of the GBR and offers a method that can also be applied to monitor exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to plumes and explore their ecological influences.

J	Botha, EJ; Brando, VE; Anstee, JM; Dekker, AG; Sagar, S				Botha, Elizabeth J.; Brando, Vittorio E.; Anstee, Janet M.; Dekker, Arnold G.; Sagar, Stephen			Increased spectral resolution enhances coral detection under varying water conditions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Earth observation offers effective spatial and temporal coverage to monitor coral reefs in addition to in situ monitoring. Effective monitoring requires that significant substratum features are detectable by a sensor. This detectability is a function of the sensor spectral resolution, the depth and composition of the water column and the spectral characteristics of the substratum. Most broadband multispectral satellite sensors are ineffective in resolving reef substrata at depth due to a lack of spectral specificity. The aim of this simulation study was to quantify the level to which substrata can be classified by sensors with variable spectral resolutions over a range of depths and water qualities and also to improve and quantify the definition of substratum detectability (the measure to which a substratum can be resolved from the water column) and substratum separability (the measure to which a substratum pair can be resolved from each other and from the water column). Three sensors were selected, representing hyperspectral data (CASI with 30 spectral bands) and multispectral data (WorldView-2 with 8 bands, and QuickBird with 4 bands). Spectral separability of substratum reflectance spectra (convolved to the spectral resolution of the three sensors) were compared within two contrasting water columns (reef-oceanic and coastal) over a range of water column depths. Metrics for substratum detectability and substratum separability were determined. As spectral resolution increases from QB to WV2 to CASI, end-members can be resolved to greater depths (e.g. from two to six meters in a coastal water column). The additional three spectral bands in the visible part of the spectrum of the WV2 sensor, as compared to QB, increase the applicability of multispectral sensors to systematic coral reef remote sensing. Increase in water column attenuation, due to higher concentrations of water column constituents, causes loss of substratum detectability and substratum separability. This effect can be partly compensated for by increased spectral resolution. For example, although the CASI and WV2 sensor performed comparably in a very shallow coastal water column (e.g. at 2 m depth), the higher spectral resolution of the CASI sensor enhanced spectral separability, resulting in higher substratum separability in deeper water than WV2. With more spectral bands, more substratum end-member reflectances are distinct from the water column signal to greater depth. This implies that higher spectral resolution will enhance bathymetry retrieval, especially within coastal waters. The quantitative framework of this study extends findings of previous contextual coral reef substratum mapping studies. It confirms that higher spectral resolution (i.e. WV2 and CASI) earth observation data significantly enhances coral reef classification capability to increased depths or to the same depth in a more turbid water column. The conclusions of this study can also be extended to coastal ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The spectra of coral species and coral habitats (sand and rock) were collected in the field and the laboratory. The pure spectra of the local coral species and habitats had distinctive characteristics in the visible range of 470-650 nm, with distinctive spectral shoulders restricted to 580-650 nm. The pure target spectra were tested statistically and were discriminative, although the coral species were similar to rock. A semi-analytical model was used to simulate the target spectra under the water column effect. The simulated spectra failed to distinguish between the distinctive spectral features due to the acute water attenuation at 580-600 nm and the continued attenuation from 600 nm onwards. They were less separable as the water depth increased at 3-5 m. The hyper-spectral, simulated spectra were then applied to multi-spectral Landsat 7 and SPOT 5 for mapping. The obtained results were poor. The spectral properties of the satellite imagery were the important factors, and needed more visible bands prior to the wavelength range of water attenuation. Thus, at present, the feasibility of using remote sensing to map local corals is not high. It is hoped that this feasibility can be raised by enhancing the target spectral signals and selecting the appropriate satellite imagery.																	1939-1404					APR	2013	6	2	2		SI		746	753		10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2245405								WOS:000319278000029						
J	Riegl, B; Berumen, M; Bruckner, A				Riegl, Bernhard; Berumen, Michael; Bruckner, Andrew			Coral population trajectories, increased disturbance and management intervention: a sensitivity analysis	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Coral reefs distant from human population were sampled in the Red Sea and one-third showed degradation by predator outbreaks (crown-of-thorns-starfish=COTS observed in all regions in all years) or bleaching (1998, 2010). Models were built to assess future trajectories. They assumed variable coral types (slow/fast growing), disturbance frequencies (5,10,20years), mortality (equal or not), and connectivity (un/connected to un/disturbed community). Known disturbances were used to parameterize models. Present and future disturbances were estimated from remote-sensing chlorophyll and temperature data. Simulations and sensitivity analysis suggest community resilience at >20-year disturbance frequency, but degradation at higher frequency. Trajectories move from fast-grower to slow-grower dominance at intermediate disturbance frequency, then again to fast-grower dominance. A similar succession was observed in the field: Acropora to Porites to Stylophora/Pocillopora dominance on shallow reefs, and a transition from large poritids to small faviids on deep reefs. Synthesis and application: Even distant reefs are impacted by global changes. COTS impacts and bleaching were key driver of coral degradation, coral population decline could be reduced if these outbreaks and bleaching susceptibility were managed by maintaining water quality and by other interventions. Just leaving reefs alone, seems no longer a satisfactory option.

Bleaching occurrences at Abrolhos have been observed since the 1990s but with a much lower frequency/extent than for other reef systems worldwide. We constructed a Bayesian Belief Network (BN) to back-predict the intensity of bleaching events and learn how local and regional scale forcing factors interact to enhance or alleviate coral bleaching specific to Abrolhos. Bleaching intensity data were collected for several reef sites across Bahia state coast (similar to 12 degrees-20 degrees S; 37 degrees-40 degrees W) during the austral summer 1994-2005 and compared to environmental data: sea surface temperature (SST), diffuse light attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-490), rain precipitation, wind velocities, and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) proxies. Conditional independence tests were calculated to produce four specialized BNs, each with specific factors that likely regulate bleaching intensity. All specialized BNs identified that a five-day accumulated SST proxy (SSTAc5d) was the exclusive parent node for coral bleaching producing a total predictive rate of 88% based on SSTAc5d state. When SSTAc5d was simulated as unknown, the Thermal-Eolic Resultant BN kept the total predictive rate of 88%. Our approach has produced initial means to predict beaching intensity at Abrolhos. However, the robustness of the model required for management purposes must be further (and regularly) operationally tested with new in situ and remote sensing data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Possible Return of Acropora cervicornis at Pulaski Shoal, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Lidz, B.H. and Zawada, D.G., 2013. Possible return of Acropora cervicornis at Pulaski Shoal, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida. Journal of Coastal Research, 29(2), 256-271. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Seabed classification is essential to assessing environmental associations and physical status in coral reef ecosystems. At Pulaski Shoal in Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida, nearly continuous underwater-image coverage was acquired in 15.5 hours in 2009 along 70.2 km of transect lines spanning similar to 0.2 km(2). The Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based, high-speed, digital imaging system, was used. ATRIS-derived benthic classes were merged with a QuickBird satellite image to create a habitat map that defines areas of senile coral reef, carbonate sand, seagrasses, and coral rubble. This atypical approach of starting with extensive, high-resolution in situ imagery and extrapolating between transect lines using satellite imagery leverages the strengths of each remote-sensing modality. The ATRIS images also captured the spatial distribution of two species once common on now-degraded Florida Caribbean coral reefs: the stony staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis, a designated threatened species, and the long-spined urchin Diadema antillarum. This article documents the utility of ATRIS imagery for quantifying number and estimating age of A. cervicornis colonies (n = 400, age range, 5-11 y) since the severe hypothermic die-off in the Dry Tortugas in 1976-77. This study is also the first to document the largest number of new colonies of A. cervicornis tabulated in an area of the park where coral-monitoring stations maintained by the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute have not been established. The elevated numbers provide an updated baseline for tracking revival of this species at Pulaski Shoal.																	0749-0208					MAR	2013	29	2					256	271		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00078.1								WOS:000316162400002

Quantification of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) camouflage: a study of color and luminance using in situ spectrometry	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY												Cephalopods are renowned for their ability to adaptively camouflage on diverse backgrounds. Sepia officinalis camouflage body patterns have been characterized spectrally in the laboratory but not in the field due to the challenges of dynamic natural light fields and the difficulty of using spectrophotometric instruments underwater. To assess cuttlefish color match in their natural habitats, we studied the spectral properties of S. officinalis and their backgrounds on the Aegean coast of Turkey using point-by-point in situ spectrometry. Fifteen spectrometry datasets were collected from seven cuttlefish; radiance spectra from animal body components and surrounding substrates were measured at depths shallower than 5 m. We quantified luminance and color contrast of cuttlefish components and background substrates in the eyes of hypothetical di- and trichromatic fish predators. Additionally, we converted radiance spectra to sRGB color space to simulate their in situ appearance to a human observer. Within the range of natural colors at our study site, cuttlefish closely matched the substrate spectra in a variety of body patterns. Theoretical calculations showed that this effect might be more pronounced at greater depths. We also showed that a non-biological method ("Spectral Angle Mapper"), commonly used for spectral shape similarity assessment in the field of remote sensing, shows moderate correlation to biological measures of color contrast. This performance is comparable to that of a traditional measure of spectral shape similarity, hue and chroma. This study is among the first to quantify color matching of camouflaged cuttlefish in the wild.

J	Dustan, P; Doherty, O; Pardede, S				Dustan, Phillip; Doherty, Orla; Pardede, Shinta			Digital Reef Rugosity Estimates Coral Reef Habitat Complexity	PLOS ONE												Ecological habitats with greater structural complexity contain more species due to increased niche diversity. This is especially apparent on coral reefs where individual coral colonies aggregate to give a reef its morphology, species zonation, and three dimensionality. Structural complexity is classically measured with a reef rugosity index, which is the ratio of a straight line transect to the distance a flexible chain of equal length travels when draped over the reef substrate; yet, other techniques from visual categories to remote sensing have been used to characterize structural complexity at scales from microhabitats to reefscapes. Reef-scale methods either lack quantitative precision or are too time consuming to be routinely practical, while remotely sensed indices are mismatched to the finer scale morphology of coral colonies and reef habitats. In this communication a new digital technique, Digital Reef Rugosity (DRR) is described which utilizes a self-contained water level gauge enabling a diver to quickly and accurately characterize rugosity with non-invasive millimeter scale measurements of coral reef surface height at decimeter intervals along meter scale transects. The precise measurements require very little post-processing and are easily imported into a spreadsheet for statistical analyses and modeling. To assess its applicability we investigated the relationship between DRR and fish community structure at four coral reef sites on Menjangan Island off the northwest corner of Bali, Indonesia and one on mainland Bali to the west of Menjangan Island; our findings show a positive relationship between DRR and fish diversity. Since structural complexity drives key ecological processes on coral reefs, we consider that DRR may become a useful quantitative community-level descriptor to characterize reef complexity.																	1932-6203					FEB 21	2013	8	2							e57386	10.1371/journal.pone.0057386								WOS:000315186000099	23437380					
J	Kabiri, K; Pradhan, B; Samimi-Namin, K; Moradi, M				Kabiri, Keivan; Pradhan, Biswajeet; Samimi-Namin, Kaveh; Moradi, Masoud			Detecting coral bleaching, using QuickBird multi-temporal data: A feasibility study at Kish Island, the Persian Gulf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coral bleaching events have become more frequent and intense worldwide and speculated to be a severe threat for coral survival in future. The Persian Gulf, as one of the warmest seas, has also experienced coral mortalities and bleaching events. Historically, bleaching events are known to occur south of the Persian Gulf, such information is scarce in the northern side. Perhaps remoteness and inaccessibility to Iran main coral communities which have developed on offshore islands can explain such lack of data. To address this issue, the feasibility of using multi-temporal satellite images for detecting past bleaching events were investigated. Two QuickBird images (2005, 2008) were selected to detect 2007 bleaching event at Kish Island, Iran, and the accuracy of results were compared to in situ observations. Current study might represent "algae-challenged" scenario in terms of having 7 months' time lapse between bleaching event and post-bleaching satellite image. As a result of this, we had algae-covered corals instead of white bleached corals. In the proposed procedure pre and post-bleaching images were classified, and changes in reflectance values within coral classes were interpreted as bleaching areas. By using this method we could eliminate the effect of miss-classification between bleached corals and sand; as well as algae-covered corals and live corals. Furthermore, it is not necessary to have a post-bleaching image acquired during bleaching events, although having such image will increase the accuracy. The proposed technique detected similar to 28% of bleached corals and the results support the idea that coral bleaching can be distinguished by detecting the changes in reflectance values in pre and post-bleaching images. Understanding the occurrence, severity, and extent of past bleaching events may help us understand the population dynamics of Iran corals and reveal coral connectivity patterns in the Persian Gulf.

Detection of Coral Distribution Change in Recent Decades with Satellite Remote Sensing	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (CISP), VOLS 1-3					6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)	DEC 16-18, 2013	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Hangzhou Normal Univ, EMB				Coral reef is a very important ecosystem in Sanya Bay and it has been studied for years only with in situ observations. However, these in situ observations generally have point information and lack the spatial resolution. Recently in order to make clear coral reef spatial distribution and variation in Sanya Bay, Hainan, satellite data of Landsat, QuickBird, CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program) and historical in situ observation data are used to retrieve and validate the information of coral reef. Based on the retrieved information, coral reef coverage and variation were studied in the paper. Satellite remote sensing results showed that area of coral reef distribution along coast of Dongmao (east) Islands and Ximao (west) islands in Sanya Bay reduced greatly in recent years, which coincides with variation trends of in situ observation data in the whole Sanya Bay. While analyzing the reason for coral reduction it was found that coral distribution in Sanya Bay conversely correlated with anthropic activities, such as digging coral reef for making lime and land use change. These activities change the water quality and sediment type which lead to the change in coral distribution.																			978-1-4799-2763-0				2013							830	834										WOS:000341115000155

From their morphology and spatial distribution, authors are able to characterize a singular event in terms of intensity (wave height, flow velocity). Recent post-catastroph studies (e.g. Indian Ocean 2004 and Japan 2011 tsunamis) have demonstrated also the interest of boulder deposits in reconstructing the event kinematics through a multi-proxy approach. But as boulder studies require a statistically robust dataset they are field-time consuming and sometimes fieldwork takes place in remote areas with low facilities. The use of very high resolution remote sensing could overcome some of these limits. In this paper, we evaluate the possibility to identify meter-size coral boulder thrown on a reef flat during the hit of a tropical cyclone. Image analysis allows for the discrimination of major geographical object encountered on coralline islands: submerged coral boulder, emerged coral boulder, perched reef, sand beach. Within emerged boulder population, specific bands available with WorldView-2 images (i.e. red and NIR2 band) allow the spectral discrimination and mapping of fresh and weathered elements.

The results showed that the maximum distance from the outside edge of the coral reefs to the shoreline is 1.1km, and the corresponding minimum distance is 200m. From 1973 to 2013, the locations of coral reef chain are relatively stable with maximum variation 50m. Generally, the natural tidal currents and waves can not destroy the coral reefs, and the human activities do not change the biological environment of the coastal area. Therefore, the Changjiang coral reefs could keep stable in the long term.																	1660-9336		978-3-03785-750-2				2013	333-335						1719	1723		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.333-335.1719								WOS:000329080300339

Mapping tsunami impacts on land cover and related ecosystem service supply in Phang Nga, Thailand	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused damages to coastal ecosystems and thus affected the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on services provided by these ecosystems. The paper presents a case study on evaluating and mapping the spatial and temporal impacts of the tsunami on land use and land cover (LULC) and related ecosystem service supply in the Phang Nga province, Thailand. The method includes local stakeholder interviews, field investigations, remote-sensing techniques, and GIS. Results provide an ecosystem services matrix with capacity scores for 18 LULC classes and 17 ecosystem functions and services as well as pre-/post-tsunami and recovery maps indicating changes in the ecosystem service supply capacities in the study area. Local stakeholder interviews revealed that mangroves, casuarina forest, mixed beach forest, coral reefs, tidal inlets, as well as wetlands (peat swamp forest) have the highest capacity to supply ecosystem services, while e.g. plantations have a lower capacity. The remote-sensing based damage and recovery analysis showed a loss of the ecosystem service supply capacities in almost all LULC classes for most of the services due to the tsunami. A fast recovery of LULC and related ecosystem service supply capacities within one year could be observed for e.g. beaches, while mangroves or casuarina forest needed several years to recover. Applying multi-temporal mapping the spatial variations of recovery could be visualised. While some patches of coastal forest were fully recovered after 3 yr, other patches were still affected and thus had a reduced capacity to supply ecosystem services. The ecosystem services maps can be used to quantify ecological values and their spatial distribution in the framework of a tsunami risk assessment. Beyond that they are considered to be a useful tool for spatial analysis in coastal risk management in Phang Nga.																	1561-8633						2013	13	12					3095	3111		10.5194/nhess-13-3095-2013								WOS:000329062900002

It collected in situ a total of 44 spectral reflectance of healthy coral, fine sand, dead coral, sand mixed with coral rubble, and sea grass in Leizhou peninsula, China. Analyses of spectral reflectance revealed that there exist three distinct spectral zones, the high reflectance zone (400-580nm), the attenuation zone (580-720nm) and low reflectance zone (720-850nm). The reflectance between 400 to 580nm band range can be used to discriminate coral reefs and other substances efficiently. Meanwhile, water depth and quality has great influence on coral reef spectrum. By using spectral response function, analyses of simulated reflectance spectra for several remote sensors (ETM+, SPOTS, IKONOS, Quick bird) indicate that narrowband multispectral sensors have the ability to discriminate different benthic substances. The research demonstrates that basic reef benthic classes are spectrally identifiable and differentiable; it establishes the basis of utilizing remote sensing technology for environmental protection of coral reef ecosystem.																	1022-6680		978-3-03785-550-8				2013	610-613		1-4				3646	3650		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.610-613.3646								WOS:000319792101334

J	Hamylton, S				Hamylton, S.			Five practical uses of spatial autocorrelation for studies of coral reef ecology	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The organisation of benthic communities across coral reefs is underpinned by spatially structured ecological processes and neighbourhood interactions such as larval dispersal, migration, competition and the spread of disease. These give rise to spatial autocorrelation in reef communities. This paper demonstrates how the measurement of spatial autocorrelation can profitably be incorporated into studies of coral reef ecology through a series of 5 simple statistical exercises: for the generation of maps depicting the strength of spatial relationships between ecological communities, as an indicator of optimal dimensions for sampling ecological communities on coral reefs, as a diagnostic tool for model misspecification, as an indicator of a spatial process underpinning the distribution of an observed community pattern and as a surrogate for missing variables in a model. The benefits of incorporating spatial autocorrelation include (1) quantifying the extent and pattern of autocorrelation across reefs, (2) signifying the presence of redundant information in field datasets, (3) indexing the nature and degree to which fundamental assumptions of classic (i.e. non-spatial) statistical techniques are violated, (4) indicating the nature (spatial versus non-spatial) of an observable pattern to be modelled, and (5) offering an opportunity to partition out and utilise the spatially structured component of model error as a surrogate for a missing variable. Collectively, the statistical exercises presented here provide a persuasive case for the measurement and interrogation of spatial autocorrelation in studies of coral reef ecology.

J	Shannon, AM; Power, HE; Webster, JM; Vila-Concejo, A				Shannon, Amelia M.; Power, Hannah E.; Webster, Jody M.; Vila-Concejo, Ana			Evolution of Coral Rubble Deposits on a Reef Platform as Detected by Remote Sensing	REMOTE SENSING												An investigation into the evolution of coral rubble deposits on a coral reef platform is assessed using high-resolution remote sensing data and geospatial analysis. Digital change detection analysis techniques are applied to One Tree Reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef by analysing aerial photographs and satellite images captured between 1964 and 2009. Two main types of rubble deposits were identified: (1) rubble flats that are featureless mass accumulations of coral rubble; and, (2) rubble spits that are shore-normal linear features. While both deposits prograde in a lagoon-ward direction, rubble spits move faster (similar to 2 m/yr) than rubble flats (similar to 0.5 m/yr). The volume of rubble, the underlying substrate, the energy regime, and storm frequency control the rate of progradation. Rubble flat occurrence is restricted to the high-energy (windward) margin of the coral reef platform, while rubble spits are distributed reef wide, both in modal high energy and modal low energy regions of the reef. Rubble spit deposition is considered to be a result of enlarged spur and groove morphology of the forereef, whereby wave energy is focused through the enlarged groove formations causing the preferential deposition of coral rubble in particular zones of the adjacent reef flat. One last control is thought to be the elevation of the reef crest whereby lower areas are more prone to rubble flat development. A vertical and ocean-ward accumulation of rubble is occurring on the windward margin of the reef leading to a build-up and build-out of the reef, governing the expansion of the reef footprint.

Worldview-2 offers an increased number of spectral bands for high-resolution image, from the traditional 4bands to 8 bands. It boasts of the ability to enhance mapping and monitoring of benthic habitats with the addition of the Coastal Band. This was investigated in this research using a Worldview-2 image of Bolinao, Pangasinan acquired on March 2010. The study site, Bolinao, has the highest single concentration of seagrass in the northern part of the Philippines. To achieve more accurate results, geometric, atmospheric and water column corrections were applied to the images. For geometric correction, a Differential Global Positioning System Topcon Hiper Ga model receiver was used to obtain highly accurate ground control points. Atmospheric correction was performed in ENVI using the Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis (FLAASH) model. Three water column correction models were applied and compared in this research, Lyzenga's Optical Model, Stumpf's Ratio Model and Simple Radiative Transfer Model. A spectral library was created using in situ reflected spectral radiances on both submerged and emerged vegetation to aid in image classification. Different benthic covers, seagrass, sand, corals and rocks are significantly separable spectrally based on spectral signatures obtained on field using a USB 4000 Fiber Optic Spectrometer. Maximum likelihood supervised classification in ENVI 4.8 is utilized for mapping. Using Worldview 2's coastal, green, yellow and red bands and applying the Simple Radiative Transfer Model produced the highest overall accuracy (88.3%) among the classification results. Using the same bands, Stumpf's Ratio Model produced 87.84% overall accuracy while Lyzenga's optical model achieved 75.54%. Moran's I spatial autocorrelation was implemented to increase the classification accuracy. Using lag 1 slightly increased Stumpf's Model's overall accuracy, from 87.84% to 88.08% while using lags 5 and 10 decreased the overall accuracy with 83.91% and 84.25% respectively.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							1579	1582		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723091								WOS:000345638901176

The objective of this study was to generate the coastal and marine habitat map for the Straits of Malacca using the SPOT and Landsat data acquired at low tide in 2010 similar to 2012. Images were first processed with atmospheric and geometric correction. The hierarchical unsupervised classification and contextual editing were then used to produce the final habitat map. The WorldView2 and GeoEye data were also used for evaluating purposes in some studied area. Our classification scheme included sandy beach, mangrove forest, mud /sand flat, seagrass /algae, coral reefs, water and others. The produced habitat map provides the most up to date habitat information in the Straits of Malacca and will aid for the regional coastal ecosystems assessment as well as for future comparative study.

A Quick and Easy Remote Sensing Method to Monitor the Daily Extent of Dredge Plumes	PLOS ONE												Technological advancements in remote sensing and GIS have improved natural resource managers' abilities to monitor large-scale disturbances. In a time where many processes are heading towards automation, this study has regressed to simple techniques to bridge a gap found in the advancement of technology. The near-daily monitoring of dredge plume extent is common practice using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and associated algorithms to predict the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration in the surface waters originating from floods and dredge plumes. Unfortunately, these methods cannot determine the difference between dredge plume and benthic features in shallow, clear water. This case study at Barrow Island, Western Australia, uses hand digitising to demonstrate the ability of human interpretation to determine this difference with a level of confidence and compares the method to contemporary TSS methods. Hand digitising was quick, cheap and required very little training of staff to complete. Results of ANOSIM R statistics show remote sensing derived TSS provided similar spatial results if they were thresholded to at least 3 mg L-1. However, remote sensing derived TSS consistently provided false-positive readings of shallow benthic features as Plume with a threshold up to TSS of 6 mg L-1, and began providing false-negatives (excluding actual plume) at a threshold as low as 4 mg L-1. Semi-automated processes that estimate plume concentration and distinguish between plumes and shallow benthic features without the arbitrary nature of human interpretation would be preferred as a plume monitoring method. However, at this stage, the hand digitising method is very useful and is more accurate at determining plume boundaries over shallow benthic features and is accessible to all levels of management with basic training.

Remote sensing techniques can provide spatial and temporal information about seagrass habitats. Given the availability and accessibility of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and the advanced nature of Earth Observing-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Hyperion (HYP), we compared the capability of the three 30 m resolution satellite sensors and tested regression models based on two seagrass metrics [percent cover of submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) and leaf area index (LAI)] for mapping and assessing seagrass habitats within a shallow coastal area along the central western coast of FL, USA. We also evaluated a water depth correction approach to create water depth-invariant bands calculated from the three sensors' data. Then a maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the %SAV cover into two classification schemes (3-class and 5-class). Based upon the two seagrass metrics measured in the field, six multiple regression models were developed and %SAV and LAI were estimated with spectral variables derived from the three sensors to assess the seagrass habitats in mapped units. Our results indicate that the HYP sensor produced the best seagrass cover maps in the two classification schemes: 3-class [overall accuracy (OA) = 95.9%] and 5-class (OA = 78.4%) and the best % SAV and LAI estimation models [R-2 = 0.78 and 0.59, and cross-validation (CV) = 18.1% and 1.40 for %SAV and LAI, respectively] for assessing seagrass habitats. These results are likely due to the many narrow bands in the visible spectral range and rich subtle spectral information available in the HYP hyperspectral data. ALI outperformed TM (OA = 94.6% vs. 92.5% for the 3-class scheme, and OA = 77.8% vs. 66.0% for the 5-class scheme) for mapping %SAV likely due to its higher radiometric resolution. Our findings also demonstrate that the water depth correction approach was effective in mapping the detailed seagrass habitats with the data from the three sensors. The protocol developed and utilized here represents a new contribution to the existing set of tools used by researchers for documenting the amount of seagrass and which can guide future studies.

Abiotic and biotic controls of cryptobenthic fish assemblages across a Caribbean seascape	CORAL REEFS												The majority of fish studies on coral reefs consider only non-cryptic species and, despite their functional importance, data on cryptic species are scarce. This study investigates inter-habitat variation in Caribbean cryptobenthic fishes by re-analysing a comprehensive data set from 58 rotenone stations around Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands. Boosted regression trees were used to associate the density and diversity of non-piscivorous cryptobenthic fishes, both in the entire data set and on reef habitats alone, with 14 abiotic and biotic variables. The study also models the habitat requirements of the three commonest species. Dead coral cover was the first or second most important variable in six of the eight models constructed. For example, within the entire data set, the number of species and total fish density increased approximately linearly with increasing dead coral cover. Dead coral was also important in multivariate analyses that discriminated 10 assemblages within the entire data set. On reef habitats, the number of species and total fish density increased dramatically when dead coral exceeded similar to 55 %. Live coral cover was typically less important for explaining variance in fish assemblages than dead coral, but live corals were important for maintaining high fish diversity. Coral species favoured by cryptobenthic species may be particularly susceptible to mortality, but dead coral may also provide abundant food and shelter for many fishes. Piscivore density was a key variable in the final models, but typically increased with increasing cryptobenthic fish diversity and abundance, suggesting both groups of fishes are responding to the same habitat variables. The density of territorial damselfishes reduced the number of cryptobenthic fish species on reef habitats. Finally, habitats delineated by standard remote sensing techniques supported distinct cryptobenthic fish assemblages, suggesting that such maps can be used as surrogates of general patterns of cryptic fish biodiversity in conservation planning.

This study documented the population density of living intertidal LBF populations at One Tree Reef (OTR), southern Great Barrier Reef, in a community dominated by Marginopora vertebralis and Baculogypsina sphaerulata. Densities of 7.7 x 10(3) M. vertebralis individuals (ind.)/m(2) and 4.5 x 10(5) B. sphaerulata ind./m(2) were estimated for these populations in May 2011. We applied remote-sensing technology to determine reef-scale estimates of suitable Foraminifera habitats and used these to estimate overall stocks of LBF populations on the intertidal algal flat at OTR of ca. 2800 metric tons. The growth rate of M. vertebralis was determined in a laboratory study, and the data were used to calculate the annual CaCO3 production of the reef flat by the LBF population. The response of M. vertebralis to ocean warming was investigated using 3-week incubations at temperatures ranging from ambient sea surface temperature to +6 degrees C. There were significant decreases in growth and concomitant CaCO3 production in 6 degrees C warmer water, which resulted in shell dissolution of M. vertebralis. These results indicate that climate-driven ocean warming projected for the region will result in significant decreases in CaCO3 production in overall foraminiferan populations, although species-specific effects should be further investigated.

J	Dirnwoeber, M; Machan, R; Herler, J				Dirnwoeber, Markus; Machan, Rudolf; Herler, Juergen			Coral Reef Surveillance: Infrared-Sensitive Video Surveillance Technology as a New Tool for Diurnal and Nocturnal Long-Term Field Observations	REMOTE SENSING												Direct field observations of fine-scaled biological processes and interactions of the benthic community of corals and associated reef organisms (e.g., feeding, reproduction, mutualistic or agonistic behavior, behavioral responses to changing abiotic factors) usually involve a disturbing intervention. Modern digital camcorders (without inflexible land-or ship-based cable connection) such as the GoPro camera enable undisturbed and unmanned, stationary close-up observations. Such observations, however, are also very time-limited (similar to 3 h) and full 24 h-recordings throughout day and night, including nocturnal observations without artificial daylight illumination, are not possible. Herein we introduce the application of modern standard video surveillance technology with the main objective of providing a tool for monitoring coral reef or other sessile and mobile organisms for periods of 24 h and longer. This system includes nocturnal close-up observations with miniature infrared (IR)-sensitive cameras and separate high-power IR-LEDs. Integrating this easy-to-set up and portable remote-sensing equipment into coral reef research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of fine-scaled biotic processes on coral reefs. Rare events and long-lasting processes can easily be recorded, in situ-experiments can be monitored live on land, and nocturnal IR-observations reveal undisturbed behavior. The options and equipment choices in IR-sensitive surveillance technology are numerous and subject to a steadily increasing technical supply and quality at decreasing prices. Accompanied by short video examples, this report introduces a radio-transmission system for simultaneous recordings and real-time monitoring of multiple cameras with synchronized timestamps, and a surface-independent underwater-recording system.																	2072-4292					NOV	2012	4	11					3346	3362		10.3390/rs4113346								WOS:000313914500004	24829763					
J	Hamylton, S; East, H				Hamylton, Sarah; East, Holly			A Geospatial Appraisal of Ecological and Geomorphic Change on Diego Garcia Atoll, Chagos Islands (British Indian Ocean Territory)	REMOTE SENSING												This study compiled a wide range of modern and historic geospatial datasets to examine ecological and geomorphic change at Diego Garcia Atoll across a 38-year period (1967-2005). This remarkable collection of spatially referenced information offered an opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and extent of environmental change that has taken place with the construction of the military airbase at Diego Garcia. Changes assessed included movements of the lagoon rim shorelines, changes in the terrestrial vegetation on the lagoon rim and amendments to the bathymetry of the lagoon basin through dredging activities. Data compiled included detailed shoreline and vegetation maps produced as part of the H. M. S. Vidal Indian Ocean Expedition (1967), three Ikonos satellite images acquired in 2005 that collectively covered the complete Atoll area, a ground truthing field dataset collected in the northern section of the lagoon for the purpose of seafloor mapping (2005), observational evidence of shoreline erosion including photographs and descriptions of seawater inundations and bathymetric soundings from five independent surveys of the lagoon floor (1967, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1997). Results indicated that much of the change along the lagoon rim is associated with the expansion of the inner lagoon shoreline as a result of the construction of the military airbase, with an estimated increase in land area of 3.01 km(2) in this portion of the atoll rim. Comparisons of 69 rim width transects measured from 1967 and 2005 indicated that shorelines are both eroding (26 transects) and accreting (43 transects). Within a total vegetated area of 24 km(2), there was a notable transition from Cocos Woodland to Broadleaf Woodland for a land area of 5.6 km(2). From the hydrographic surveys, it was estimated that approximately 0.55 km(3) of carbonate sediment material has been removed from the northwest quadrant of the lagoon, particularly in the vicinity of the Main Passage. As no previous record of benthic character exists, a complete benthic habitat map of the atoll was derived through classification of the three IKONOS satellite images. Management implications arising from this overall appraisal of geomorphic and ecological change at Diego Garcia included the need for ongoing monitoring of shoreline change at a representative set of sites around the atoll rim, monitoring of the water flow regime through the northern channels between the open ocean and the lagoon basin and an ongoing mapping campaign to record periodic changes in the character of the benthic surface ecology.

J	Collin, A; Planes, S				Collin, Antoine; Planes, Serge			Enhancing Coral Health Detection Using Spectral Diversity Indices from WorldView-2 Imagery and Machine Learners	REMOTE SENSING												The worldwide waning health of coral reefs implies an increasing need for monitoring them at colony scale over large areas. Relaying fieldwork considerably, the remote sensing approach can address this need in offering spectral information relevant for coral health detection with 0.5 m spatial accuracy. We investigated the potential of spectral diversity indices to achieve the discrimination of coral-dominated assemblages and health states from novel satellite imagery (WorldView-2, WV2). Both Equitability's (E) and Pielou's (P) operators were used to quantify the evenness of the corrected visible spectral bands (two times 26 combinations of five bands) corresponding to remotely sensed colonies. Three scleractinian corals (Porites lobata, P. rus and Acropora pulchra) that are primarily involved in Moorea's reef building (French Polynesia) were examined in respect to their health state (healthy or unhealthy, referring to both bleached and dead coral, hereinafter). Using four classifiers, we showed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) greatly discerned among the six coral classes based upon the five WV2 spectral bands (93%), thus surpassing the classification issued from the three traditionally used bands (80%). Coupling the WV2 dataset with Egreen-red, Eyellow-red or E"coastal"-blue-green allowed the SVM performance to attain 96%. On the other hand, adding the E"coastal"-blue to the WV2-dataset contributed to a substantially increase of the classification accuracy derived from the Random Forest classifier, stepping from 64% to 77%. Significant contributions of spectral diversity indices to surveying coral health were further discussed in the light of spectral properties of coral-related pigments. These findings may play a major role for the extensive monitoring of coral health states at a fine scale, and for the management and restoration of damaged coral reefs.

Comparing the information content of coral reef geomorphological and biological habitat maps, Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Increasing the use of geomorphological map products in marine spatial planning has the potential to greatly enhance return on mapping investment as they are commonly two orders of magnitude cheaper to produce than biologically-focussed maps of benthic communities and shallow substrates. The efficacy of geomorphological maps derived from remotely sensed imagery as surrogates for habitat diversity is explored by comparing two map sets of the platform reefs and atolls of the Amirantes Archipelago (Seychelles), Western Indian Ocean. One mapping campaign utilised Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (19 wavebands, 1 m spatial resolution) to classify 11 islands and associated reefs into 25 biological habitat classes while the other campaign used Landsat 7 + ETM imagery (7 bands, 30 m spatial resolution) to generate maps of 14 geomorphic classes. The maps were compared across a range of characteristics, including habitat richness (number of classes mapped), diversity (Shannon-Weiner statistic) and thematic content (Cramer's V statistic). Between maps, a strong relationship was revealed for habitat richness (R-2 = 0.76), a moderate relationship for class diversity and evenness (R-2 = 0.63) and a variable relationship for thematic content, dependent on site complexity (V range 0.43 -0.93). Geomorphic maps emerged as robust predictors of the habitat richness in the Amirantes. Such maps therefore demonstrate high potential value for informing coastal management activities and conservation planning by drawing on information beyond their own thematic content and thus maximizing the return on mapping investment.

J	Dadhich, AP; Nadaoka, K				Dadhich, Ankita P.; Nadaoka, Kazuo			Analysis of Terrestrial Discharge from Agricultural Watersheds and Its Impact on Nearshore and Offshore Reefs in Fiji	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The coral reef ecosystems are rapidly deteriorating due to intense anthropogenic perturbations in the river basins in northwest Viti Levu Island, Fiji. This study aimed to assess the change in benthic cover as influenced by terrestrial loadings from the 14 adjoining agriculturally dominated (especially sugarcane) coastal watersheds using remote sensing, a geographic information system (GIS), and a physically based, distributed hydrological model. An integrated modeling framework with land-use change was constructed to simulate the runoff, sediment yield, and nutrient discharge using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The impact of terrestrial discharge on the coastal ecosystem was investigated by spatio-temporal analysis (1992-2007) of the benthic cover using Landsat TM/ETM+ data. Due to the cropland expansion, a significant amount of surface runoff and sediment and nutrient discharge was generated during 1992-2007 from the steeply sloping watersheds. The hydrological response results from areas with different land-use conditions (1992-2007) revealed that the conversion of forestland (7.88%) and shrubland (7.59%) into agricultural (10.04%) and barren land (3.06%) had the greatest impact on the potential risk of surface runoff. To understand the discharge behavior of the watersheds and its impact on coastal ecosystems, we examined three hydrological response assessment indices, namely, the annual average, wet season average, and monthly maximum index. A change in the benthic community composition was observed as an increase in algae (139.3%), sea grass (70.6%), and degraded reef area (59.39%) around these coastal watersheds due to the increased sediments and nutrients, mainly from the sugarcane fields.																	0749-0208					SEP	2012	28	5					1225	1235		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-11-00149.1								WOS:000308774400023

Assessment of AHS (Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner) sensor to map macroalgal communities on the Ria de vigo and Ria de Aldan coast (NW Spain)	MARINE BIOLOGY												Ria de Vigo and Ria de Aldan have high biological richness that is reflected in the number of environmental protection areas like the Atlantic Islands National Park and five places of community interest. Benthic algal communities play an important role in these ecosystems due to their ecological functions and support a great part of this biological richness. We tested by means of bio-optical modelling and Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) images to what extent remote sensing could be used to map these communities in Ria de Vigo and Ria de Aldan (NW Spain). Reflectance spectra of dominating macroalgae groups were modelled for different water depths in order to estimate the separability of different bottom types based on their spectral signatures and the spectral characteristics of the AHS. Our results indicate that separation between three macroalgae groups (green, brown and red) as well as sand is possible when the bottoms are emerged during low tide. The spectra differences decrease rapidly with increasing water depth. Two types of classifications were carried out with the three AHS images: maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Maximum likelihood showed positive results reaching overall accuracy percentages higher than 95 % and kappa coefficients higher than 0.90 for the bottom classes: shallow sand, deep sand, emerged rock, emerged macroalgae and submerged macroalgae. Sand and algae substrates were then separately analysed with SAM. These classifications showed positive results for differentiation between green and brown macroalgae until 5 m depth and high differences between all macroalgae and sandy substrate. However, differences between red and brown macroalgae are only detectable when the algae are emerged.

J	Farhan, AR; Lim, S				Farhan, A. R.; Lim, S.			Vulnerability assessment of ecological conditions in Seribu Islands, Indonesia	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The sustainability in the marine and coastal environment was conceptualized significantly since the Earth Summit in 1992 where Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) was proposed as one of the solutions that can support the decision makers to work together and provide decisive actions for the better coastal management. A right balance between the socio-economic growth and the environmental protection is the most important goal in the coastal management. In order to achieve the goal, a framework-based strategy, financial planning and policy enforcement must be implemented in the coastal management. Indonesia as one of the archipelagic states has adopted this concept within two Indonesian cooperation laws which were intended to enable the Indonesian government to manage the coastal areas more responsibly and accountably in the aim for the improved environment for future generations. Since the endorsement of those laws, however, the implementation has been lagging and the Indonesia government's focus is rather on the land-based development despite the consequence of the negligence in the coastal management. This is evident in the impact on the coastal environment that is caused by rapid and ill-planned developments in Indonesian coastal regions. As a result, Indonesia already lost four islands associated with Seribu Islands by 1999. It proves that Seribu Islands lack in the policy enforcement and were unnoticed by both the central government and the local government. This paper aims to assess the ecological vulnerability with a focus on coral reefs in Seribu Islands using Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing technologies. From the study results, it can be summarized that the urban pressures and pollutants from four main rivers in Jakarta Bay and Banten Province played a significant role in the environmental degradation.

Estimation of the Aerial Cover of Seagrasses of Lakshadweep Islands (India) Using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS P6 LISS IV)	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Seagrasses ecosystems are fragile yet highly productive ecosystems of the world showing declining trend throughout the world due to natural and anthropogenic pressures. Effective conservation and management plan is thus required to protect these resources, to aid with conservation need mapping and monitoring of seagrasses using high resolution remote sensing data is very much required. Hence, the present study was made to record the seagrass aerial cover in the Lakshadweep islands using IRS P6 LISS IV satellite data. The suitability of LISS IV sensor for seagrass mapping was tested for the first time with an overall accuracy of 73.16%. The study found an area of 2590.2 ha of seagrasses in Lakshadweep islands with 1310.8 ha and 1279.4 ha dense and sparse seagrass cover respectively. The study recommends the use of LISS IV data for mapping the shallow water seagrasses, as mapping efficiency increases nearly 4 times more than the LISS III data, as the former (LISS IV) picks up the small patches of seagrasses and delineates the coral and reef vegetation patches from seagrass class.																	0255-660X					SEP	2012	40	3					467	481		10.1007/s12524-011-0179-y								WOS:000305983300012

Modelling the impact of a La Nina event on a South West Pacific Lagoon	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												In view of increasing environmental awareness and biodiversity conservation, understanding the main forcing mechanism driving biogeochemical cycles in coral reefs and lagoon coastal areas is a priority. La Nina events cause unbalanced situations in the Equatorial Pacific and result in enhanced precipitation in South West Pacific coastal areas. We investigated the impact of heavy rainfalls during the 2008 La Nina event on the New Caledonia lagoon using a 3D coupled on-line hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Simulations and data showed that the whole lagoon was impacted by river inputs and stronger hydrodynamics, enhancing chlorophyll-a concentration by a factor between 1.7 and 1.9. The coupled model provided new insights into plume transport, highlighting that eastern plumes can be advected northwards or can reach the South West Lagoon, depending on the balance between regional, tide-induced, and wind-induced surface currents. It also provided a synoptic view of lagoon biogeochemical-hydrodynamic response, when remote sensing data are not available due to cloud coverage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kanno, A; Tanaka, Y				Kanno, Ariyo; Tanaka, Yoji			Modified Lyzenga's Method for Estimating Generalized Coefficients of Satellite-Based Predictor of Shallow Water Depth	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												The multispectral method for the remote sensing of water depth proposed by Lyzenga et al. has been widely applied to shallow-water bathymetry by researchers. The predictor of water depth used in this method is a linear function of image-derived variables for each visible band. The coefficients of the predictor are estimated by using a number of pixels with known depth as training data; this depth information is usually obtained by performing in situ depth measurements. Theoretically, if an appropriate set of coefficients is chosen, the predictor can be insensitive to some variations in the optical properties of the bottom material and water. However, it is sensitive to variations in atmospheric and water surface transmittance and sun and satellite elevations. Consequently, a single set of coefficients cannot always be applied to multiple images. In this letter, we propose a simple method to estimate a general set of coefficients for Lyzenga's predictor that is relatively less affected by the aforementioned factors. We derive and utilize the theoretical fact that these factors affect only the intercept (constant term) of the predictor function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using WorldView-2 images of coral reefs. The proposed method will enable the application of a single set of coefficients (except for the intercept) to a broad range of images. This will significantly reduce the number of pixels with known depth required for the prediction of an image and thereby improve the feasibility of remote sensing of water depth.																	1545-598X					JUL	2012	9	4					715	719		10.1109/LGRS.2011.2179517								WOS:000310909800037

Multiplatform Ocean Exploration: Insights From the NEEMO Space Analog Mission	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Since the beginning of space exploration, methods and protocols of exploration have been developed using space analogs on Earth to reduce research costs, develop safe deployment/retrieval protocols, and ready astronauts for hostile environments in less threatening settings. Space analogs are required as much as ever today as astronauts and scientists develop new tools and techniques for exploration, while working to address evolving mission objectives from low-earth orbit to deep-space exploration. This study examines coordinated human and robotic exploration at the Aquarius Underwater Habitat off of the coast of Key Largo, Florida, in support of the NEEMO 15 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) program. The exploration scheme presented in this work fuses (1) robotic precursor missions as a means of remote sensing data collection; (2) crowdsourcing to process immense amounts of data to identify key targets of interest that might be missed in the tight cycle of mission operations; and (3) human exploration to examine locations directly up close and collect physical samples that require involved sampling techniques. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and single-person submersibles, called DeepWorkers (TM), were used as underwater analogs of robotic systems currently being used and human-operated vehicles (HOVs) proposed for use on a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), the Moon, or Mars. In addition to operational lessons learned for space exploration that are directly applicable to ocean exploration, ocean floor mapping provides new levels of detail of benthic habitat critical for coral reef monitoring and management. Opportunistic (onsite adaptive) data sampling also took place by placing self-recording instrumentation onto each of the DeepWorkers, increasing the collection of scientific information during the submersible missions and contributing to mission planning for optimal and efficient use of expensive assets.

OCEAN DYNAMICS												Observations of currents aimed to study the flow near a spawning aggregation reef, Gladden Spit off the coast of Belize, reveal unusually strong currents on 19-20 October 2009 (the current speed was over 1 m s(-1), when the mean and standard deviation are 0.2 +/- 0.12 m s(-1)). During this short time, the water level was raised by 60-70 cm above normal in one place, but lowered by 10-20 cm in another location just 2 km away. The temperature dropped by over 2A degrees C within a few hours. Analyses of local and remote sensing data suggest that a rare combination of an offshore Caribbean cyclonic eddy, a short-lived local tropical storm, and a Spring tide, all occurred at the same time and creating a "perfect storm" condition that resulted in the unusual event. High-resolution simulations and momentum balance analysis demonstrate how the unique shape of the coral reef amplified the coastal current through nonlinear flow-topography interactions. The suggested mechanism for the water level change is different than the classical wind-driven storm surge process. The study has implications for the influence of external forcing on mixing processes and physical-biological interactions near coral reefs.

A case-study from Saudi Arabia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We propose a framework for spatially estimating a proxy for coral reef resilience using remote sensing. Data spanning large areas of coral reef habitat were obtained using the commercial QuickBird satellite, and freely available imagery (NASA, Google Earth). Principles of coral reef ecology, field observation, and remote observations, were combined to devise mapped indices. These capture important and accessible components of coral reef resilience. Indices are divided between factors known to stress corals, and factors incorporating properties of the reef landscape that resist stress or promote coral growth. The first-basis for a remote sensed resilience index (RSRI), an estimate of expected reef resilience, is proposed. Developed for the Red Sea, the framework of our analysis is flexible and with minimal adaptation, could be extended to other reef regions. We aim to stimulate discussion as to use of remote sensing to do more than simply deliver habitat maps of coral reefs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detecting coral bleaching using high-resolution satellite data analysis and 2-dimensional thermal model simulation in the Ishigaki fringing reef, Japan	CORAL REEFS												In 2007, high-temperature-induced mass coral mortality was observed in a well-developed fringing reef area on the southeastern coast of Ishigaki Island, Japan. To analyze the response of the corals to thermal stress, the coral cover was examined using Quickbird data, taken across the reef flat just before and after the bleaching event and performing a reef scale horizontal 2-dimensional thermal model simulation. The Quickbird data consisted of multispectral (MSS) imagery, which had a spatial resolution of 2.4 m, and panchromatic (PAN)-fused multispectral imagery, which had a 0.6-m spatial resolution. The observed changes in coral cover implied that the delineation of partially bleached coral was more precise with PAN + MSS. The classification accuracy achieved using PAN + MSS (93%) was superior to that obtained using MSS (88%). The in situ water temperature observations and 2-dimensional thermal model simulation results indicated that the water temperature fluctuated greatly in the inner reef area in late July 2007. Different thermal stress indices, including daily average temperature, daily maximum excess temperature, and daily accumulated temperature, were examined to define a suitable index that represented the severity of the thermal stress on coral cover. The results suggested that the daily accumulated temperature that occurred during the maximum sea surface temperature period of the bleaching season provided the best predictor of bleaching. The changes in water temperature, bathymetry, and coral patch size affected the severity of bleaching; therefore, the spatial dependence of these variables was examined using Moran's I and Lagrange multiplier tests. An investigation of the effect of coral patch sizes on coral bleaching indicated that large coral patches were less affected than the small patches, which were more likely to suffer bleaching and coral mortality.

Predicting the distribution of Montastraea reefs using wave exposure	CORAL REEFS												In the Caribbean region, forereef habitats dominated by Montastraea spp. have the highest biodiversity and support the largest number of ecosystem processes and services. Here we show that the distribution of this species-rich habitat can be explained by one environmental predictor: wave exposure. The relationship between wave exposure and the occurrence of Montastraea reefs was modelled using logistic regression for reefs throughout the Belize Barrier Reef, one of the largest and most topographically complex systems in the region. The model was able to predict correctly the occurrence of Montastraea reefs with an accuracy of 81%. Consistent with historical qualitative patterns, the distribution of Montastraea reefs is constrained in environments of high exposure. This pattern is likely to be driven by high rates of chronic sediment scour that constrain recruitment. The wide range of wave exposure conditions used to parameterize the model in Belize suggest that it should be transferable throughout much of the Caribbean region, constituting a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional habitat mapping and complementing global efforts to map reef extent.

J	Hedley, J; Roelfsema, C; Koetz, B; Phinn, S				Hedley, John; Roelfsema, Chris; Koetz, Benjamin; Phinn, Stuart			Capability of the Sentinel 2 mission for tropical coral reef mapping and coral bleaching detection	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Sentinel 2 mission offers continuity of service for the moderate resolution multispectral SPOT XS and Landsat Thematic Mapper series sensors, but also offers several design improvements that may lead to enhanced capability in coral reef mapping applications. In this study modeling and simulated image analyses were conducted to evaluate the relative capability of the Sentinel 2 instrument design compared to SPOT-4 and Landsat ETM+, for mapping bathymetry and benthic composition, and for coral bleaching detection. The analyses involved propagating noise and environmental uncertainties through a radiative transfer model inversion to quantify uncertainty in retrievable parameters from each sensor. The experiment structure included factors for sensor-environmental noise, band choice, and complexity of benthic reflectance model. Results indicate that while variables related to reef 'health' such as coral mortality and algal cover cannot be mapped accurately by this class of instrument; Sentinel 2 does have improved ability for discrimination of reef benthic composition over SPOT-4 and Landsat ETM+. The key enabling design factors are the narrowness of bands, increased spatial resolution and additional band at 443 nm; instrument noise was a less significant factor. Rapid revisit times, global coverage, and freely available data suggest the potential for time series analyses. Sentinel 2 may also be capable of bleaching detection by change analysis given effective methods for precise cross-image image radiometric and spatial alignment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Vicarious calibrations of HICO data acquired from the International Space Station	APPLIED OPTICS												The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) presently onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is an imaging spectrometer designed for remote sensing of coastal waters. The instrument is not equipped with any onboard spectral and radiometric calibration devices. Here we describe vicarious calibration techniques that have been used in converting the HICO raw digital numbers to calibrated radiances. The spectral calibration is based on matching atmospheric water vapor and oxygen absorption bands and extraterrestrial solar lines. The radiometric calibration is based on comparisons between HICO and the EOS/MODIS data measured over homogeneous desert areas and on spectral reflectance properties of coral reefs and water clouds. Improvements to the present vicarious calibration techniques are possible as we gain more in-depth understanding of the HICO laboratory calibration data and the ISS HICO data in the future.

Seasonal and spatial heterogeneity of recent sea surface temperature trends in the Caribbean Sea and southeast Gulf of Mexico	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Recent changes in ocean temperature have impacted marine ecosystem function globally. Nevertheless, the responses have depended upon the rate of change of temperature and the season when the changes occur, which are spatially variable. A rigorous statistical analysis of sea surface temperature observations over 25 years was used to examine spatial variability in overall and seasonal temperature trends within the wider Caribbean. The basin has experienced high spatial variability in rates of change of temperature. Most of the warming has been due to increases in summer rather than winter temperatures. However, warming was faster in winter in the Loop Current area and the south-eastern Caribbean, where the annual temperature ranges have contracted. Waters off Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas had a tendency towards cooling in winter, increasing the amplitude of annual temperature ranges. These detailed patterns can be used to elucidate ecological responses to climatic change in the region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Julian			Multi-scale marine biodiversity patterns inferred efficiently from habitat image processing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Cost-effective proxies of biodiversity and species abundance, applicable across a range of spatial scales, are needed for setting conservation priorities and planning action. We outline a rapid, efficient, and low-cost measure of spectral signal from digital habitat images that, being an effective proxy for habitat complexity, correlates with species diversity and requires little image processing or interpretation. We validated this method for coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, across a range of spatial scales (1 m to 10 km), using digital photographs of benthic communities at the transect scale and high-resolution Landsat satellite images at the reef scale. We calculated an index of image-derived spatial heterogeneity, the mean information gain (MIG), for each scale and related it to univariate (species richness and total abundance summed across species) and multivariate (species abundance matrix) measures of fish community structure, using two techniques that account for the hierarchical structure of the data: hierarchical (mixed-effect) linear models and distance-based partial redundancy analysis. Over the length and breadth of the GBR, MIG alone explained up to 29% of deviance in fish species richness, 33% in total fish abundance, and 25% in fish community structure at multiple scales, thus demonstrating the possibility of easily and rapidly exploiting spatial information contained in digital images to complement existing methods for inferring diversity and abundance patterns among fish communities. Thus, the spectral signal of unprocessed remotely sensed images provides an efficient and low-cost way to optimize the design of surveys used in conservation planning. In data-sparse situations, this simple approach also offers a viable method for rapid assessment of potential local biodiversity, particularly where there is little local capacity in terms of skills or resources for mounting in-depth biodiversity surveys.

It covers the wavelength range between 0.4 and 0.9 mu m with a spectral resolution of 5.7 nm and a spatial resolution of approximately 90 m. The HICO sensor is not equipped with a second-order blocking filter in front of the focal plane array. As a result, the second-order light from the shorter visible spectral region falls onto the detectors covering the near-IR spectral region above 0.8 mu m. In order to have accurate radiometric calibration of the near-IR channels, the second-order light contribution needs to be removed. The water-leaving radiances of these near-IR channels over clear ocean waters are close to zero because of strong liquid water absorption above 0.8 mu m. Through analysis of HICO imaging data containing features of shallow underwater objects, such as coral reefs, we have developed an empirical technique to correct for the second-order light effects in near-IR channels. HICO data acquired over Midway Island in the Pacific Ocean and the Bahamas Banks in the Atlantic Ocean are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique.																	0196-2892					MAR	2012	50	3					824	830		10.1109/TGRS.2011.2163161								WOS:000300724300013

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Based Inversion of Benthic Substrate Bottom Type and Bathymetry in Optically Shallow Waters - Initial Model Results	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Ocean-colour remote sensing in optically shallow waters is influenced by contribution from the water column depth as well as by the substrate type. Therefore, it is required to include the contribution from the water column and substrate bottom type for bathymetry estimation. In this report we demonstrate the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach to spectrally distinguish various benthic bottom types and estimate depth of substrate bottom simultaneously in optically shallow waters. We have used in-water radiative transfer simulation modeling to generate simulated top-of-the-water column reflectance the four major benthic bottom types viz. sea grass, coral sand, green algae and red algae using Hydrolight simulation model. The simulated remote sensing reflectance, for the four benthic bottom types having benthic bottom depth up to 30 m were generated for moderately clear waters. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) type neural network was trained using the simulated data. ANN based approach was used for classification of the benthic bottom type and simultaneous inversion of bathymetry. Simulated data was inverted to yield benthic bottom type classification with an accuracy of similar to 98% for the four benthic substrate types and the substrate depth were estimated with an error of 0% for sea grass, 1% for coral sand and 1-3% for green and red algae up to 25 m, whereas for substrate bottom deeper than 25 m depth the classification errors increased by 2-5% for three substrate bottom types except sea grass bottom type. The initial results are promising which needs validation using the in-situ measured remote sensing reflectance spectra for implementing further on satellite data.					, Ali/0000-0002-3821-6099												0255-660X					MAR	2012	40	1					137	143		10.1007/s12524-011-0142-y								WOS:000300310300014

A comparison of spatially explicit and classic regression modelling of live coral cover using hyperspectral remote-sensing data in the Al Wajh lagoon, Red Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Live coral is a key component of the Al Wajh marine reserve in the Red Sea. The management of this reserve is dependent on a sound understanding of the existing spatial distribution of live coral cover and the environmental factors influencing live coral at the landscape scale. This study uses remote-sensing techniques to develop ordinary least squares and spatially lagged autoregressive explanatory models of the distribution of live coral cover inside the Al Wajh lagoon, Saudi Arabia. Live coral was modelled as a response to environmental controls such as water depth, the concentration of suspended sediment in the water column and exposure to incident waves. Airborne hyperspectral data were used to derive information on live coral cover as a response (dependent) variable at the landscape scale using linear spectral unmixing. Environmental controls (explanatory variables) were derived from a physics-based inversion of the remote-sensing dataset and validated against field-collected data. For spatial regression, cases referred to geographical locations that were explicitly drawn on in the modelling process to make use of the spatially dependent nature of coral cover controls. The transition from the ordinary least squares model to the spatially lagged model was accompanied by a marked growth in explanatory power (R-2 = 0.26 to 0.76). The theoretical implication that follows is that neighbourhood context interactions play an important role in determining live coral cover. This provides a persuasive case for building geographical considerations into studies of coral distribution.

Environmental and Sensor Limitations in Optical Remote Sensing of Coral Reefs: Implications for Monitoring and Sensor Design	REMOTE SENSING												A generic method was developed for analysing the capabilities of optical remote sensing of aquatic systems in terms of environmental components and imaging sensor configurations.

The model was applied to data from Pacific Ocean reefs in an airborne sensor context to estimate the primary environmental or sensor factors confounding discrimination of benthic mixtures of key reef types: live coral, bleached coral, dead coral and macroalgae.

Spatial modelling of benthic cover using remote sensing data in the Aldabra lagoon, western Indian Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Spatially explicit ecological modelling was used to predict the distribution of 4 benthic components (live coral, carbonate sand, macroalgae and dead coral) inside the Aldabra lagoon, southern Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. Both classic ordinary least-squares and spatial autoregression techniques were carried out on a field data set of 774 spatially referenced records and 3 satellite remote sensing images to define an empirical relationship between local environmental conditions (water depth and water level variation) and benthic cover. This relationship was then used to generate a synoptic model of the spatial cover and distribution of each benthic component at the landscape (i.e. whole lagoon) scale. Environmental conditions were estimated from satellite remote sensing data (water depth) and using GIS techniques (water level variation). By drawing on species-environment relationships applicable to many lagoons, continuous records of percentage benthic cover were derived for the extensive lagoon (174 km(2)) at a high measurement level (ratio) for use in conservation and resource management applications. The transition from the ordinary least-squares model to the spatially lagged model was accompanied by a marked growth in predictive power (R-2 = 0.25 to 0.79), indicating that neighbourhood context interactions play an important role in determining benthic cover of the Aldabra lagoon.

To measure and report on progress towards the targets set a program has been established that combines monitoring and modelling at paddock through to catchment and reef scales; the Paddock to Reef Integrated Monitoring, Modelling and Reporting Program (Paddock to Reef Program). This program aims to provide evidence of links between land management activities, water quality and reef health. Five lines of evidence are used: the effectiveness of management practices to improve water quality; the prevalence of management practice adoption and change in catchment indicators; long-term monitoring of catchment water quality; paddock & catchment modelling to provide a relative assessment of progress towards meeting targets; and finally marine monitoring of GBR water quality and reef ecosystem health. This paper outlines the first four lines of evidence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Andrefouet, S; Hamel, MA; Dalleau, M				Andrefouet, Serge; Hamel, Melanie A.; Dalleau, Mayeul			Distinction between effective pattern-based and selection-based biodiversity surrogates is essential: caveats for managers	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Ecological concepts and data may justify the selection of biodiversity conservation plans among different options, but can also lead to poor conservation guidelines if not properly used. The use and meaning of the 'surrogate' concept in ecology and conservation planning contexts is a typical example. Surrogates are entities such as species, environmental variables or habitats, which are used to represent a target entity such as genes, species, ecosystems or related metrics. 'Pattern-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates using statistical congruence, while 'selection-based surrogacy' identifies effective surrogates through a notional conservation plan or prioritization analysis where sites are added to a set of protected areas, often using a complementarity criterion between sites. With this clear framework in mind, an investigation of the coral reef literature revealed that most published studies on surrogates of reef biodiversity refer in fact to pattern-based surrogates. Fundamentally, there is nothing wrong with both approaches. However, efficient pattern-based surrogates are often recommended for conservation planning, implying that they could be efficient selection-based surrogates. In fact, efficient pattern-based surrogates are not necessarily efficient selection-based surrogates and vice versa. The reason is the complementarity rules used by selection algorithms. We call for more clarity from authors on the context in which effective surrogates have to be used, and more caution from managers when surrogates are to be used in conservation plans.

Multi-scale, object-based image analysis for mapping geomorphic and ecological zones on coral reefs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Providing accurate maps of coral reefs where the spatial scale and labels of the mapped features correspond to map units appropriate for examining biological and geomorphic structures and processes is a major challenge for remote sensing. The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy and relevance of the process used to derive geomorphic zone and benthic community zone maps for three western Pacific coral reefs produced from multi-scale, object-based image analysis (OBIA) of high-spatial-resolution multi-spectral images, guided by field survey data. Three Quickbird-2 multi-spectral data sets from reefs in Australia, Palau and Fiji and georeferenced field photographs were used in amulti-scale segmentation and object-based image classification to map geomorphic zones and benthic community zones. A per-pixel approach was also tested for mapping benthic community zones. Validation of the maps and comparison to past approaches indicated the multi-scale OBIA process enabled field data, operator field experience and a conceptual hierarchical model of the coral reef environment to be linked to provide output maps at geomorphic zone and benthic community scales on coral reefs. The OBIA mapping accuracies were comparable with previously published work using other methods; however, the classes mapped were matched to a predetermined set of features on the reef.

Spectral reflectance of coral reef benthos and substrate assemblages on Heron Reef, Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Studies investigating the spectral reflectance of coral reef benthos and substrates have focused on the measurement of pure endmembers, where the entire field of view (FOV) of a spectrometer is focused on a single benthos or substrate type. At the spatial scales of the current satellite sensors, the heterogeneity of coral reefs even at a sub-metre scale means that many individual image pixels will be made up of a mixture of benthos and substrate types. If pure endmember spectra are used as training data for image classification, there is a spatial discrepancy, because many pixels will have a mixed endmember spectral reflectance signature. This study investigated the spectral reflectance of coral reef benthos and substrates at a spatial scale directly linked to the pixel size of high spatial resolution imaging systems, by incorporating multiple benthos and substrate types into the spectrometer FOV in situ. A total of 334 spectral reflectance signatures were measured of 19 assemblages of the coral reef benthos and substrate types. The spectra were analysed for separability using first derivative values, and a discrimination decision tree was designed to identify the assemblages. Using the decision tree, it was possible to identify 15 assemblages with a mean overall classification accuracy of 62.6%.

The following 13-year time series were derived from the remote-sensing, analysis and reanalysis data: maximum summertime sea surface temperature (SST), maximum sea surface temperature (MaxSST) accumulated in 5 days (SSTAc5day), diffuse attenuation coefficient for downward irradiance at 490 nm (K-490), rainfall and magnitude of surface wind fields, including the zonal (U) and meridional components. Principal component analysis, non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster and similarity analyses indicate the complex nature of the bleaching patterns and the influence of the strong 1997-1998 El Nino. A significant (global R-value = 0.65; p < 0.01) compounding effect of the reef location and bleaching intensity on the differentiation of bleaching environments was detected. A combination of high SSTAc5day and low K-490 may cause coral bleaching in the northernmost reefs. Evidence clearly points to a scenario where the influence of reef location, bleaching year and intensity may produce a compounded effect that determines the bleaching environments in Bahia.

The goal of the GhostNet project is the detection of derelict nets at sea through the use of weather and ocean models, drifting buoys and satellite imagery to locate convergent areas where nets are likely to collect, followed by airborne surveys with trained observers and remote sensing instruments to spot individual derelict nets. These components of GhostNet were first tested together in the field during a 14-day marine debris survey of the Gulf of Alaska in July and August 2003. Model, buoy, and satellite data were used in flight planning. A manned aircraft survey with visible and IR cameras and a LIDAR instrument located debris in the targeted locations, including 102 individual pieces of debris of anthropogenic or terrestrial origin.

Here we present a spatially explicit prediction for coral reef fish diversity index, as well as habitat classification according to reef fish diversity index values in Chinchorro Bank Biosphere Reserve, one of the most important plain/atoll type reef systems in the Caribbean. We have used extensive ecological data on depth, fish and habitat characteristics to perform such prediction. Fish species assemblages and different biotic variables of benthic organisms were characterized using visual censuses and video-transects, respectively at 119 sampling stations. The information was integrated in a GIS, along with satellite imagery (LANSDAT 7 ETM+) and a digital bathymetric model. From the recorded data and a hierarchical classification procedure, we obtained nine different classes of habitats. We used a generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction methodology to create predictive maps (GIS layers) of the different reef benthic components, and a second modeling run produced predictive maps of coral reef fish diversity index. Predictive accuracy of the diversity index map presented a good correlation coefficient (r = 0.87), with maximum diversity index values en reefscapes composed of aggregation of coral colonies with seagrass beds. The implementation of our application was successful for the prediction of fish diversity hot spots and surrogate habitats.

The use of remote sensing and linear wave theory to model local wave energy around Alphonse Atoll, Seychelles	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This paper demonstrates a practical step-wise method for modelling wave energy at the landscape scale using GIS and remote sensing techniques at Alphonse Atoll, Seychelles. Inputs are a map of the benthic surface (seabed) cover, a detailed bathymetric model derived from remotely sensed Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) data and information on regional wave heights. Incident energy at the reef crest around the atoll perimeter is calculated as a function of its deepwater value with wave parameters (significant wave height and period) hindcast in the offshore zone using the WaveWatch III application developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Energy modifications are calculated at constant intervals as waves transform over the forereef platform along a series of reef profile transects running into the atoll centre. Factors for shoaling, refraction and frictional attenuation are calculated at each interval for given changes in bathymetry and benthic coverage type and a nominal reduction in absolute energy is incorporated at the reef crest to account for wave breaking. Overall energy estimates are derived for a period of 5 years and related to spatial patterning of reef flat surface cover (sand and seagrass patches). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One possible approach to such maps is passive remote sensing of water depth by using multispectral imagery in the popular method proposed by Lyzenga et al. [2006]; however, its application has been limited due to insufficient accuracy. To improve accuracy, we have developed 3 extensions of Lyzenga's method by addressing unrealistic optical and statistical assumptions in the method. The purpose of this paper is to compare the accuracy of Lyzenga's method, the 3 extensions, and the combination of the 3 extensions. The accuracy comparison test was performed for 2 coral reef sites by using cross validation. The results indicated that for both sites, the extended methods were more accurate than Lyzenga's method when sufficient training data were available. The most accurate extension was the one derived by modeling the spatial autocorrelation in the error term of the regression model used in Lyzenga's method. The combination of the 3 extensions was even more accurate than the extensions. The implementations of the extended methods are not difficult in terms of software availability and computational cost.																	0578-5634					DEC	2011	53	4					431	450		10.1142/S0578563411002410								WOS:000305157700006

Coral colonisation of a shallow reef flat in response to rising sea level: quantification from 35 years of remote sensing data at Heron Island, Australia	CORAL REEFS												Observations made on Heron Island reef flat during the 1970s-1990s highlighted the importance of rapid change in hydrodynamics and accommodation space for coral development. Between the 1940s and the 1990s, the minimum reef-flat top water level varied by some tens of centimetres, successively down then up, in rapid response to local engineering works. Coral growth followed sea-level variations and was quantified here for several coral communities using horizontal two-dimensional above water remotely sensed observations. This required seven high spatial resolution aerial photographs and Quickbird satellite images spanning 35 years: 1972, 1979, 1990, 1992, 2002, 2006 and 2007. The coral growth dynamics followed four regimes corresponding to artificially induced changes in sea levels: 1972-1979 (lowest growth rate): no detectable coral development, due to high tidal currents and minimum mean low-tide water level; 1979-1991 (higher growth rate): horizontal coral development promoted by calmer hydrodynamic conditions; 1991-2001(lower growth rate): vertical coral development, induced by increased local sea level by similar to 12 cm due to construction of new bund walls; 2001-2007 (highest growth rate): horizontal coral development after that vertical growth had become limited by sea level. This unique time-series displays a succession of ecological stage comprising a 'catch-up' dynamic in response to a rapid local sea-level rise in spite of the occurrences of the most severe bleaching events on record (1998, 2002) and the decreasing calcification rates reported in massive corals in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef.

In this study we assessed spatial variability and temporal dynamics of benthic habitat types in a relatively turbid northeastern Baltic Sea coastal environment using the space-borne multispectral sensor QuickBird. Seven broad habitat classes were defined for the study area representing the most typical habitats of the coastal environment. The studied classes were bare sand, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, hard bottom with ephemeral algae, higher-order plants and/or charophytes on soft bright bottom, dense higher-order plant habitats, and drifting algal mats and deep water (>3m). Two QuickBird images acquired over a 3 year interval (2005 to 2008) of Western-Estonian archipelago were processed and change detection analysis applied. Although there was a relatively large scatter in reflectance variability within each habitat type, the analyses allowed a clear differentiation of most habitat types. Exceptions were the lack of statistical differences among deep water, drifting algae, and dense higher-order plant communities, as well as among low density higher-order plant and algal communities. Major changes in the spatial patterns of benthic habitats occurred in hydrodynamically active areas. Differences in water properties caused some confusion in classification and therefore resulted in inaccuracies in maps of change. Thus, the used broad habitat classes represent the limit of the method and the multispectral sensors do not allow finer elements of habitats to be captured.

Although a variety of inversion algorithms are available, there has been limited assessment of performance and no work has been published comparing their accuracy and efficiency. This paper compares the absolute and relative accuracies and computational efficiencies of one empirical and five radiative-transfer-based published approaches applied to coastal sites at Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas and Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. These sites have published airborne hyperspectral data and field data. The assessment showed that (1) radiative-transfer-based methods were more accurate than the empirical approach for bathymetric retrieval, and the accuracies and processing times were inversely related to the complexity of the models used; (2) all inversion methods provided moderately accurate retrievals of bathymetry, water column inherent optical properties, and benthic reflectance in waters less than 13 m deep with homogeneous to heterogeneous benthic/substrate covers; (3) slightly higher accuracy retrievals were obtained from locally parameterized methods; and (4) no method compared here can be considered optimal for all situations. The results provide a guide to the conditions where each approach may be used (available image and field data and processing capability). A re-analysis of these same or additional sites with satellite hyperspectral data with lower spatial and radiometric resolution, but higher temporal resolution would be instructive to establish guidelines for repeatable regional to global scale shallow water mapping approaches.

Cross-shore gradients in sea surface temperature (SST) were observed, including cold fronts (colder inshore) during winter and warm fronts (warmer inshore) during summer. Fronts persisted over synoptic and seasonal time-scales and had a periodic annual cycle over a 10-year time-series. Measurements of cross-shore SST variability were conducted at the scale of tens of kilometres, which encompassed temperature over shallow tropical reef complexes and the continental slope. Two tropical reefs that had similar reef geomorphology and offshore continental slope topography had identical cold fronts, although they were separated by 100 km along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. Satellite SST gradients across contours of topography of tropical reefs can be used as an index to flag areas potentially exposed to temperature stress.				da Silva, Jose/B-9212-2008; Scientific output, CIIMAR/E-5122-2012	da Silva, Jose/0000-0002-5453-3916; Scientific output, CIIMAR/0000-0001-6270-2153												1054-3139					SEP	2011	68	9					1827	1832		10.1093/icesjms/fsr109								WOS:000294107800001

Experimentation of structured light and stereo vision for underwater 3D reconstruction	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Current research on underwater 3D imaging methods is mainly addressing long range applications like seafloor mapping or surveys of archeological sites and shipwrecks. Recently, there is an increasing need for more accessible and precise close-range 3D acquisition technologies in some application fields like, for example, monitoring the growth of coral reefs or reconstructing underwater archaeological pieces that in most cases cannot be recovered from the seabed. This paper presents the first results of a research project that aims to investigate the possibility of using active optical techniques for the whole-field 3D reconstructions in an underwater environment. In this work we have tested an optical technique, frequently used for in air acquisition, based on the projection of structured lighting patterns acquired by a stereo vision system. We describe the experimental setup used for the underwater tests, which were conducted in a water tank with different turbidity conditions. The tests have evidenced that the quality of 3D reconstruction is acceptable even with high turbidity values, despite the heavy presence of scattering and absorption effects.

The products are obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images received at the Direct Readout Ground Station (located at CONABIO) after each overpass of the Aqua and Terra satellites. In addition, at the end of each week and month the system provides composite images for several ocean products, as well as weekly and monthly anomaly composites for chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature. These anomaly data are reported for the first time for the study region and represent valuable information for analyzing time series of ocean color data for the study of coastal and marine ecosystems in Mexico, Central America, and the western Caribbean.

The effect of landscape composition and configuration on the spatial distribution of temperate demersal fish	ECOGRAPHY												In contrast to the terrestrial environment, where the use of landscape analyses has been clearly demonstrated, the influence of landscape composition and configuration on the abundance and spatial distribution of marine organisms remains poorly understood. Development of this area of marine research has been limited by the lack of accurate benthic habitat maps, particularly for marine environments deeper than can be penetrated by optical remote sensing (< 10 m). However, the recent availability of detailed (1:25 000) and accurate habitat maps derived from hydroacoustic surveys of deeper marine waters has redressed this situation. The aim of this research was to establish the strength and significance of derived landscape composition and configuration indices on the demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution. A combination of depth and 6 landscape measures were found to explain 34.8% of the variation in the fish assemblage. Depth contributed the highest percentage of the variance explained, accounting for 23.7%. Distance to reef was the most important landscape index explaining 7.1% of the variability, followed by total length of edge environment (the interface between different benthic substrates) explaining 1.5%. Species responsible for driving the structure of the fish assemblage were also examined and found to respond not only to the proximity of reef but also to the configuration of the reef. For example, Parika scaber and Pseudolabrus psittaculus characterised more heterogeneous landscapes offering clusters of small interconnected patches of reef with a lot of edge environment, whilst juvenile Trachyurus novaezelandiae and Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus preferred more homogeneous landscapes offering little reef or edge environment. This research demonstrated that a broad scale landscape analysis, employing indices of landscape composition and configuration, is important for understanding demersal fish assemblage structure and spatial distribution.

J	Pittman, SJ; Brown, KA				Pittman, Simon J.; Brown, Kerry A.			Multi-Scale Approach for Predicting Fish Species Distributions across Coral Reef Seascapes	PLOS ONE												Two of the major limitations to effective management of coral reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the interacting environmental variables that drive distributional patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to reliably model and map marine species distributions across many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important predictors were geographical location across the shelf, followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions (AUC = > 0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC = 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were markedly more accurate (92% map accuracy) than BRT (68% map accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling the interaction between the geographical location across the shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure. This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine protected area design, zoning in marine spatial planning, and ecosystem-based fisheries management.																	1932-6203					MAY 26	2011	6	5							e20583	10.1371/journal.pone.0020583								WOS:000291052200079	21637787					
J	O'Neill, JD; Costa, M; Sharma, T				O'Neill, Jennifer D.; Costa, Maycira; Sharma, Tara			Remote Sensing of Shallow Coastal Benthic Substrates: In situ Spectra and Mapping of Eelgrass (Zostera marina) in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada	REMOTE SENSING												Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is a keystone component of inter- and sub-tidal ecosystems. However, anthropogenic pressures have caused its populations to decline worldwide. Delineation and continuous monitoring of eelgrass distribution is an integral part of understanding these pressures and providing effective coastal ecosystem management. A proposed tool for such spatial monitoring is remote imagery, which can cost-and time-effectively cover large and inaccessible areas frequently. However, to effectively apply this technology, an understanding is required of the spectral behavior of eelgrass and its associated substrates. In this study, in situ hyperspectral measurements were used to define key spectral variables that provide the greatest spectral separation between Z. marina and associated submerged substrates. For eelgrass classification of an in situ above water reflectance dataset, the selected variables were: slope 500-530 nm, first derivatives (R') at 566 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm, yielding 98% overall accuracy. When the in situ reflectance dataset was water-corrected, the selected variables were: 566:600 and 566:710, yielding 97% overall accuracy. The depth constraint for eelgrass identification with the field spectrometer was 5.0 to 6.0 m on average, with a range of 3.0 to 15.0 m depending on the characteristics of the water column. A case study involving benthic classification of hyperspectral airborne imagery showed the major advantage of the variable selection was meeting the sample size requirements of the more statistically complex Maximum Likelihood classifier. Results of this classifier yielded eelgrass classification accuracy of over 85%. The depth limit of eelgrass spectral detection for the AISA sensor was 5.5 m.																	2072-4292					MAY	2011	3	5					975	1005		10.3390/rs3050975								WOS:000306749500008						
J	Narayana, AC				Narayana, A. C.			Tectonic geomorphology, tsunamis and environmental hazards: reference to Andaman-Nicobar Islands	NATURAL HAZARDS												Geomorphic features associated with earthquakes and tsunamis have received wide attention in estimating uplift and subsidence after the tectonic event. Although various techniques are in vogue in estimating the uplift and subsidence after the 2004 Andaman-Sumatra earthquake and subsequent tsunami, remote sensing techniques have been proved to be quite handy to study the geomorphic changes. In the present study, geomorphic changes associated with the destructive event of December 2004 have been analyzed. The emergent and subsident coasts around the smaller islands in the Andaman region have been identified. The coral reef area that has been subjected to uplift or subsidence in some of the islands of the Andaman and Nicobar region is delineated, and the net areal extents of these coral beds have been computed. Of the six islands studied in Andaman region, coral reef of four islands was subjected to uplift, and around two islands the area was subsided. The uplifted area varied from 0.10 to 11 km(2), and subsidence was about 0.50 km(2). In Nicobar region, the subsidence of coral reefs was recorded. This study helps to monitor the coastal environments and the destruction due to natural hazards.																	0921-030X					APR	2011	57	1					65	82		10.1007/s11069-010-9647-x								WOS:000290036100006

The characteristics, processes, and resistance of corals to bleaching varies significantly and is dependent on environmental conditions. We documented a mass coral bleaching event in June 2007 at the Meiji and Zhubi Reefs, Nansha Islands (NS), South China Sea using ecological surveys and measurement of coral zooxanthellae density and sea surface temperatures (SST). More than 35 species of corals (between 0-20 m in depth) were bleached. These bleached corals accounted for 15.6% of total corals in the investigated quadrats. The branching corals Pocillopora and Acropora were the most vulnerable species whereas the massive corals Porites and Favia were more tolerant of the high SSTs. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of bleaching in Agariciidae corals suggesting that this family is resistant to thermal stresses. The bleached corals had lost 72%-90% of their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Furthermore, corals that had no visual signs of bleaching had also lost 31%-53% of their zooxanthellae suggesting that most corals were experiencing the early stage of bleaching. The monthly mean SST during June 2007 was 30.8A degrees C, the highest since 1998. Based on measurements of SST and the Hotspots and DHW data (NOAA), we conclude that it the extremely high SSTs triggered this coral bleaching event. Our results suggest that the previously accepted temperature thresholds used to predict coral bleaching based on satellite data are likely to underestimate the extent and intensity of coral bleaching, at least in the NS.

El Nino events are associated with elevated water temperatures at large spatial (1000s of km) and temporal (annual) scales, providing environmental conditions that enable temperature effects on reef fishes to be tested directly. We compared remote sensing data of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, surface current flow and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration with monthly patterns in larval supply of coral reef fishes in nearshore waters around Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia) from January 1996 to March 2000. This time included an intense El Nino (April 1997-May 1998) event between two periods of La Nina (January-March 1996 and August 1998-March 2000) conditions. There was a strong relationship between the timing of the El Nino event, current flow, ocean productivity (as measured by Chl-a) and larval supply. In the warm conditions of the event, there was an increase in the SST anomaly index up to 3.5 degrees C above mean values and a decrease in the strength of the westward surface current toward the reef. These conditions coincided with low concentrations of Chl-a (mean: 0.06 mg m-3, SE +/- 0.004) and a 51% decline in larval supply from mean values. Conversely, during strong La Nina conditions when SST anomalies were almost 2 degrees C below mean values and there was a strong westward surface current, Chl-a concentration was 150% greater than mean values and larval supply was 249% greater. A lag in larval supply suggested that productivity maybe affecting both the production of larvae by adults and larval survival. Our results suggest that warming temperatures in the world's oceans will have negative effects on the reproduction of reef fishes and survival of their larvae within the plankton, ultimately impacting on the replenishment of benthic populations.				martinez, elodie/E-3237-2012; Biblio, LOV/K-9251-2017	martinez, elodie/0000-0001-6507-6119; Simpson, Stephen/0000-0002-4856-6164												1354-1013					APR	2011	17	4					1695	1702		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02355.x								WOS:000287853000016						
J	Bejarano, S; Mumby, PJ; Sotheran, I				Bejarano, Sonia; Mumby, Peter J.; Sotheran, Ian			Predicting structural complexity of reefs and fish abundance using acoustic remote sensing (RoxAnn)	MARINE BIOLOGY												This study determined whether the acoustic roughness of Caribbean reef habitats is an accurate proxy for their topographic complexity and a significant predictor of their fish abundance. Fish abundance was measured in 25 sites along the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize). At each site, in situ rugosity (ISR) was estimated using the "chain and tape" method, and acoustic roughness (E1) was acquired using RoxAnn. The relationships between E1 and ISR, and between both E1 and ISR and the abundance of 17 common species and the presence of 10 uncommon species were tested. E1 was a significant predictor of the topographic complexity (r (2) = 0.66), the abundance of 10 common species of surgeonfishes, pomacentrids, scarids, grunts and serranids and the presence of 4 uncommon species of pomacentrids and snappers. Small differences in E1 (i.e. a dagger 0.05-0.07) reflected in subtle but significant differences in fish abundance (similar to 1 individual 200 m(-2) and 116 g 200 m(-2)) among sites. Although we required the use of IKONOS data to obtain a large number of echoes per site, future studies will be able to utilise RoxAnn data alone to detect spatial patterns in substrate complexity and fish abundance, provided that a minimum of 50 RoxAnn echoes are collected per site.

Comprehensive maps of marine resources, including those important for local fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, provide a crucial foundation of information for the planning process. Using a combination of field and high spatial resolution satellite data, we use an empirical procedure to create a bathymetric map (RMSE 1.76 m) and object-based image analysis to produce accurate maps of geomorphic and benthic coral reef classes (Kappa values of 0.80 and 0.63; 9 and 33 classes, respectively) covering a large (>260 km(2)) traditional fisheries management area in Fiji. From these maps, we derive per-pixel information on habitat richness, structural complexity, coral cover and the distance from land, and use these variables as input in models to predict fish species richness, diversity and biomass. We show that random forest models outperform five other model types, and that all three fish community variables can be satisfactorily predicted from the high spatial resolution satellite data. We also show geomorphic zone to be the most important predictor on average, with secondary contributions from a range of other variables including benthic class, depth, distance from land, and live coral cover mapped at coarse spatial scales, suggesting that data with lower spatial resolution and lower cost may be sufficient for spatial predictions of the three fish community variables.

Geomorphological modelling of tropical marine landscapes: Optical remote sensing, patches and spatial statistics	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The relation of structural responses to underlying functional processes at the landscape scale helps develop our understanding of geomorphological phenomena at the coastline. This paper demonstrates how a habitat map derived from remotely sensed imagery was used as the basis for the development of an explanatory model to investigate factors influencing the linearity of alternating carbonate sand and seagrass patches on a reef flat in the Seychelles, western Indian Ocean. In combination with techniques established in landscape ecology for interrogating broad scale processes and spatial statistical procedures that bring geography explicitly into the analysis, an emergent framework for the quantification and investigation of geomorphological processes is illustrated. The combined influence of adjacent spur and groove amplitude and incident wave power accounted for 81% of the variation in sand and seagrass patch linearity across the habitat map. A series of steps in model development are examined, including observation, measurement, experimentation and interpretation. These steps both define and permit an empirical approach to geomorphology and the case study highlights how each can be achieved by adopting an interdisciplinary framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing with SPOT-4 for mapping kelp forests in turbid waters on the south European Atlantic shelf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Remote sensing has become an increasingly used technique for the thematic mapping of large marine areas. In recent years, many researchers have successfully applied these techniques in different places for benthic mapping in clear waters: however, areas with turbid waters present important limitations that are gradually being solved by recent technological advances. In this context, the main objective of the present study is to develop and validate a methodology for mapping intertidal and subtidal kelp forests in the Galician coast (NW Spain), based on images from SPOT-4 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre). Three analysis methods have been applied: visual analysis and interpretation, unsupervised classification (cluster) and supervised classification (angular classification and maximum likelihood classification). Classification percentages higher than 70% in all substrates were obtained both using visual analysis and interpretation and maximum likelihood classification. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The physical and biological composition and distribution of benthic habitats within these ecosystems determines their contribution to ecosystem services and biodiversity as well as their connections to neighbouring terrestrial and marine ecosystem processes. The capacity to accurately and consistently map and monitor these benthic habitats is critical to developing and implementing management applications. This paper presents a method for integrating field survey data and high spatial resolution, multi-spectral satellite image data to map bathymetry and seagrass in shallow coastal waters. Using Quickbird 2 satellite images from 2004 and 2007, acoustic field survey data were used to map bathymetry using a linear and ratio algorithm method; benthic survey field data were used to calibrate and validate classifications of seagrass percentage cover and seagrass species composition; and a change detection analysis of seagrass cover was performed. The bathymetry mapping showed that only the linear algorithm could effectively and accurately predict water depth; overall benthic map accuracies ranged from 57-95%; and the change detection produced a reliable change map and showed a net decrease in seagrass cover levels, but the majority of the study area showed no change in seagrass cover level. This study demonstrates that multiple spatial products (bathymetry, seagrass and change maps) can be produced from single satellite images and a concurrent field survey dataset. Moreover, the products were produced at higher spatial resolution and accuracy levels than previous studies in Moreton Bay. The methods are developed from previous work in the study area and are continuing to be implemented, as well as being developed to be repeatable in similar shallow coastal water environments.

Due to complexities in water clarity and attenuation of spectral reflection with water depth, this study focused on visual interpretation of IKONOS satellite images in an effort to ascertain the general nature of bottom types. Development of a seafloor topology for a portion of the Key West National Wildlife Refuge in Monroe County, Florida (between Key West, Florida, and the Dry Tortugas) resulted in 96 mapping units. The natural complexity of this environment required classification units that were defined by numeric codes that were keyed to a classification system developed for this area. These units, defined in a stepwise procedure, were predicated on the geomorphologic base, context of the geomorphological zone, biological cover, and percentage of that cover. The GIS attribute table, built with a multi-discipline interpretation in mind, was constructed to allow end user flexibility when extracting the information related to major biological cover, detailed geological cover, etc. Suffixes were added to further interpret areas with diverse biological cover. The IKONOS satellite images were found to be useful tools for mapping coastal marine environments at a nominal scale of 1:6000.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		731	735										WOS:000302824900149

Szczecin, Poland, ISSN 0749-0208 The shallow low-energy waters of the extensive coastal zone in sub-tropical south Florida permits the discrimination of seabed features and benthic covers acquired from remotely sensed data. A benthic environments classification system is devised from digital interpretations of multi-spectral IKONOS satellite imagery for 1,360 km(2) of the carbonate platform and presented in a comprehensive digitized map. The classification scheme is designed as a 7th order hierarchical structure that integrates 5 Physiographic Realms, 17 Morphodynamic Zones, 11 Geoforms, 38 Landforms, 6 dominant surface sediment types, 9 dominant biological covers and 3 densities of biological covers for the description of benthic environments. Digital analysis of the high-resolution (4 m) IKONOS imagery employed ESRI's ArcMap to manually digitize 412 mapping units at a scale of 1:6,000. Digital classification of environments is executed by the analyst contingent with the grouping of relative spectral reflectance, color tone variations, and the texture and pattern of the benthic unit. The mapping area incorporates a large diversity of geomorphic forms that range from coastal plains in the southern Florida Peninsula to coral reef formations along the Florida Reef Tract (FRT). The context of each Morphodynamic Zone is characterized by the content and areal distribution (in km(2)) of geomorphic forms and biological covers. Florida Bay is the most widely distributed Realm and is largely characterized by polygonal lattices of salient sediment banks and sediment flats. Over 58% of the mapping area is occupied by sediment flats, and seagrasses are colonized in almost 80% of the topologies.																	0749-0208						2011			1		64		825	830										WOS:000302824900169

Improving the synoptic mapping of coral reef geomorphology using object-based image analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Monitoring coral reefs is of great importance for environmental management of these ecosystems. The use of remote sensing and geographical information systems enables rapid and effective mapping of the geomorphology of reefs that can be used as a basis for biodiversity and habitat assessments. However, pixel-based approaches have not been appropriate for detailed mapping of such complex systems. An object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach was used in this study to map intra-reef geomorphology of coral reefs across the Torres Strait region using Landsat ETM+ imagery. By combining image analysis techniques and a non-parametric neural network classifier and incorporating additional spatial information such as context, shape and texture, the accuracy of the segmentation and classification was improved considerably. A large-scale synoptic map of 10 geomorphological classes was produced for Torres Strait with an overall accuracy of 75%. The OBIA approach employed in this research has enabled the geomorphology of reef platforms to be mapped for the first time at such accuracy and descriptive resolution.

J	Knudby, A; Nordlund, L				Knudby, Anders; Nordlund, Lina			Remote sensing of seagrasses in a patchy multi-species environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												We tested the utility of IKONOS satellite imagery to map seagrass distribution and biomass in a 4.1 km2 area around Chumbe Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania. Considered to be a challenging environment to map, this area is characterized by a diverse mix of inter- and subtidal habitat types. Our mapped distribution of seagrasses corresponded well to field data, although the total seagrass area was underestimated due to spectral confusion and misclassification of areas with sparse seagrass patches as sparse coral and algae-covered limestone rock. Seagrass biomass was also accurately estimated (r2 = 0.83), except in areas with Thalassodendron ciliatum (r2 = 0.57), as the stems of T. ciliatum change the relationship between light interception and biomass from that of other species in the area. We recommend the use of remote sensing over field-based methods for seagrass mapping because of the comprehensive coverage, high accuracy and ability to estimate biomass. The results obtained with IKONOS imagery in our complex study area are encouraging, and support the use of this data source for seagrass mapping in similar areas.

Identification and quantification of aquatic vegetation with hyperspectral remote sensing in western Nevada rivers, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This study used a portable spectrometer to assess the feasibility of using airborne hyperspectral imagery to map the dominant types and amounts of aquatic vegetation in the Carson and Truckee Rivers of western Nevada. Spectral reflectance data were acquired for a number of periphyton and macrophyte types, and corresponding vegetation samples were processed in the laboratory to quantify chlorophyll a (chla) and ash-free dry mass. The dominant periphyton and macrophyte communities encountered in the field could be identified with an overall accuracy of greater than 95%. The lowest individual class accuracy was 82% for one community type, primarily green filamentous algae (GF), which was brown in colour and mixed with diatoms and sediments. Separate stepwise regression models were developed for chla and biomass of each type of vegetation. Regression models had r(2)s greater than 0.92, except for the aforementioned brown-coloured community of mixed algae that had r(2)s of just over 0.5 for both laboratory measurements. This study suggests good prospects for airborne hyperspectral surveys of aquatic vegetation for water quality studies, assuming a sensor with a high signal-to-noise ratio, high spatial resolution and good environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition.																	0143-1161						2011	32	24					9093	9117		10.1080/01431161.2010.549850								WOS:000298376000011						
J	Hamylton, S				Hamylton, Sarah			Estimating the coverage of coral reef benthic communities from airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data: multiple discriminant function analysis and linear spectral unmixing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A staged approach for the application of linear spectral unmixing techniques to airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data of reef communities of the Al Wajh Barrier, Red Sea, is presented. Quantification of the percentage composition of four different reef components (live coral, dead coral, macroalgae and carbonate sand) contained within the ground sampling distance associated with an individual pixel is demonstrated. In the first stage, multiple discriminant function analysis is applied to spectra collected in situ to define an optimal subset combination of derivative and raw image wavebands for discriminating reef benthos. In the second phase, unmixing is applied to a similarly reduced subset of pre-processed image data to accurately determine the relative abundance of the reef benthos (R-2 > 0.7 for all four components). The result of a phased approach is an increased signal-to-noise ratio for solution of the linear functions and reduction of processing burdens associated with image unmixing.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Remote Sensing Techniques for Studying Coastal Ecosystems: An Overview	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Advances in sensor design and data analysis techniques are making remote sensing systems practical and attractive for use in research and management of coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands, estuaries, and coral reefs. Multispectral and hyperspectral imagers are available for mapping coastal land cover, concentrations of organic/inorganic suspended particles, and dissolved substances in coastal waters. Thermal infrared scanners can map sea surface temperatures accurately and chart coastal currents, while microwave radiometers can measure ocean salinity, soil moisture, and other hydrologic parameters. Radar imagers, scatterometers, and altimeters provide information on ocean waves, ocean winds, sea surface height, and coastal currents, which strongly influence coastal ecosystems. Using airborne light detecting and ranging systems, one can produce bathymetric maps, even in moderately turbid coastal waters. Since coastal ecosystems have high spatial complexity and temporal variability, they frequently have to be observed from both satellite and aircraft in order to obtain the required spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. A reliable field data collection approach using ships, buoys, and field instruments with a valid sampling scheme is required to calibrate and validate the remotely sensed information. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of practical remote sensing techniques that can be used in studies of coastal ecosystems.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2011	27	1					2	17		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00103.1								WOS:000286952900001

J.; Hedley, John D.; Sotheran, Ian			Combining optical and acoustic data to enhance the detection of Caribbean forereef habitats	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

These deficiencies were addressed in a multidisciplinary study of cyclone impacts on Abore Reef, New-Caledonia. Local knowledge, high thematic-resolution maps, and time-series satellite imagery complemented classical in situ monitoring methods. Field survey stations were selected from examination of pre- and post-cyclone images and their post-cyclone coral communities documented in terms of substrata, coral morphologies, live coral cover, and taxonomy. Time-series maps of hierarchically defined coral communities created at spatial scales documenting the variability among communities (29-45 classes) and suggesting the processes that affected them. The increased spatial coverage and repeatability of this approach significantly improved the recognition and interpretation of coral communities' spatio-temporal variability. It identified precise locations of impacted areas and those exhibiting coral recovery and resilience. The approach provides a comprehensive suite of information on which to base reef-scale conservation actions. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hamel, MA; Andrefouet, S				Hamel, Melanie A.; Andrefouet, Serge			Using very high resolution remote sensing for the management of coral reef fisheries: Review and perspectives	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Coral reef fisheries are critical for food security and as a source of income in developing and developed countries, but they are collapsing in many areas. Following the emergence and routine availability of commercial very high spatial resolution (0.6-10 m) multispectral satellite images, we reviewed the use of these new high-quality remote sensing data and products for coral reef fisheries management. The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements.

J	Knudby, A; LeDrew, E; Brenning, A				Knudby, Anders; LeDrew, Ellsworth; Brenning, Alexander			Predictive mapping of reef fish species richness, diversity and biomass in Zanzibar using IKONOS imagery and machine-learning techniques	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During the last three decades, the large spatial coverage of remote sensing data has been used in coral reef research to map dominant substrate types, geomorphologic zones, and bathymetry. During the same period, field studies have documented statistical relationships between variables quantifying aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Although the results of these studies are ambiguous, some habitat variables have frequently been found to correlate with one or more aspects of the fish community. Several of these habitat variables, including depth, the structural complexity of the substrate, and live coral cover, are possible to estimate with remote sensing data. In this study, we combine a set of statistical and machine-learning models with habitat variables derived from IKONOS data to produce spatially explicit predictions of the species richness, biomass, and diversity of the fish community around two reefs in Zanzibar. In the process, we assess the ability of IKONOS imagery to estimate live coral cover, structural complexity and habitat diversity, and we explore the importance of habitat variables, at a range of spatial scales, in the predictive models using a permutation-based technique. Our findings indicate that structural complexity at a fine spatial scale (similar to 5 to 10 m) is the most important habitat variable in predictive models of fish species richness and diversity, whereas other variables such as depth, habitat diversity, and structural complexity at coarser spatial scales contribute to predictions of biomass. In addition, our results demonstrate that complex model types such as tree-based ensemble techniques provide superior predictive performance compared to the more frequently used linear models, achieving a reduction of the cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error of 3-11%. Although aerial photographs and airborne lidar instruments have recently been used to produce spatially explicit predictions of reef fish community variables, our study illustrates the possibility of doing so with satellite data. The ability to use satellite data may bring the cost of creating such maps within the reach of both spatial ecology researchers and the wide range of organizations involved in marine spatial planning.

J	Henry, LA; Davies, AJ; Roberts, JM				Henry, Lea-Anne; Davies, Andrew J.; Roberts, J. Murray			Beta diversity of cold-water coral reef communities off western Scotland	CORAL REEFS												Spatial heterogeneity in coral reef communities is well documented. This "species turnover" (beta diversity) on shallow warm-water reefs strongly conforms to spatial gradients in the environment as well as spatially autocorrelated biotic processes such as dispersal and competition. But the extent to which the environment and spatial autocorrelation create beta diversity on deep cold-water coral reefs such as those formed by Lophelia pertusa (Scleractinia) is unknown. The effects of remotely sensed and ground-truthed data were tested on the community composition of sessile suspension-feeding communities from the Mingulay Reef Complex, a landscape of inshore Lophelia reefs off the Scottish west coast. Canonical correspondence analysis determined that a statistically significant proportion (68%) of the variance in community composition could be explained by remotely sensed environmental variables (northerly and easterly aspect, seabed rugosity, depth), ground-truthed environmental variables (species richness and reef macrohabitat) and geospatial location. This variation was further partitioned into fractions explained by pure effects of the environment (51%), spatially structured environmental variables (12%) and spatial autocorrelation (5%). Beta diversity in these communities reflected the effects of both measured and unmeasured and spatially dependent environmental variables that vary across the reef complex, i.e., hydrography. Future work will quantify the significance and relative contributions of these variables in creating beta diversity in these rich communities.

This article assesses these abilities among artisanal fishers in Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands. In a comparison of two villages, it documents local resource users' abilities to monitor long-term ecological change occurring to seagrass meadows near their communities, their understandings of the drivers of change, and their conceptualizations of seagrass ecology. Local observations of ecological change are compared with historical aerial photography and IKONOS satellite images that show 56 years of actual changes in seagrass meadows from 1947 to 2003. Results suggest that villagers detect long-term changes in the spatial cover of rapidly expanding seagrass meadows. However, for seagrass meadows that showed no long-term expansion or contraction in spatial cover over one-third of respondents incorrectly assumed changes had occurred. Examples from a community-based management initiative designed around indigenous ecological knowledge and customary sea tenure governance show how local observations of ecological change shape marine resource use and practices which, in turn, can increase the management adaptability of indigenous or hybrid governance systems.																	0364-152X					MAY	2010	45	5					985	997		10.1007/s00267-010-9471-9								WOS:000277771400009	20336296

J	Webster, IT; Ford, PW				Webster, Ian T.; Ford, Phillip W.			Delivery, deposition and redistribution of fine sediments within macrotidal Fitzroy Estuary/Keppel Bay: Southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The Fitzroy catchment in central Queensland, Australia is the largest catchment discharging to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Lagoon. Sediments and nutrients (both particulate and dissolved) originating in the catchment, are discharged from the Fitzroy River, into the Fitzroy Estuary (FE) and ultimately into Keppel Bay (KB). The flow in the river is characterised by summertime high-flow events typically of several weeks duration followed by virtually no flow for the remainder of the year. In this manuscript, we describe the hydrodynamics and fine-sediment dynamics in the coupled FE-KB system. Particular emphasis is placed on describing the temporal and spatial variability of these dynamics and on how the interactions between the temporal scales have important implications for system function. The greater bulk of the fresh water, sediments and nutrients are discharged into the FE in a relatively short time, but these materials are then redistributed throughout the FE-KB system and beyond by vigorous macrotidal currents during the rest of the year. Pronounced temporal variability in concentrations of suspended sediments also occurs at semi-diurnal and fortnightly timescales arising from the variation in the strength of tidal currents. The fluxes of fine sediments from the system to the lagoon of the Great Barrier Reef demonstrate pronounced variability at interannual, seasonal, fortnightly, and semi-diurnal timescales. Suspended sediments in the river discharge have very small sinking rates, but flocculation that occurs when they encounter salty water greatly increases their sinking rate and is an important agent for trapping these sediments near the estuary mouth. The large temporal variability of the hydrodynamics and fine-sediment dynamics of the FE-KB system also has important consequences for the biogeochemical function of the system and poses major challenges for the interpretation of moored, shipboard, and remote sensing measurements.

J	Roelfsema, C; Phinn, S				Roelfsema, Chris; Phinn, Stuart			Integrating field data with high spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery for calibration and validation of coral reef benthic community maps	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Our ability to map coral reef environments using remote sensing has increased through improved access to: satellite images and field survey data at suitable spatial scales, and software enabling the integration of data sources. These data sets can be used to provide validated maps to support science and management decisions. The objective of this paper was to compare two methods for calibrating and validating maps of coral reef benthic communities derived from satellite images captured over a variety of Coral Reefs The two methods for collecting georeferenced benthic field data were: 1), georeferenced photo transects and 2), spot checks. Quickbird imagery was acquired for three Fijian coral reef environments in: Suva, Navakavu and Solo. These environments had variable water clarity and spatial complexity of benthic cover composition. The two field data sets at each reef were each split, and half were used for training data sets for supervised classifications, and the other half for accuracy assessment. This resulted in two maps of benthic communities with associated mapping accuracies, production times and costs for each study-site. Analyses of the spatial patterns in benthic community maps and their Overall and Tau accuracies revealed that for spatially complex habitats, the maps produced from photo transect data were twice as accurate as spot check based maps. In the context of the reefs examined, our results showed that the photo- transect method was a robust procedure which could be used in a range of coral reef environments to map the benthic communities accurately. In contrast, the spot check method is a fast and low cost approach, suitable for mapping benthic communities which have lower spatial complexity. Our findings will enable scientists, technicians and managers to select appropriate methods for collecting field data to integrate with high spatial resolution multi-spectral imagery to create validated coral reef benthic community maps.

Christopher; Lee, Rosalynn; Vahatalo, Anssi; Zepp, Richard G.; Bartels, Erich			Production of chromophoric dissolved organic matter from mangrove leaf litter and floating Sargassum colonies	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) strongly absorbs solar radiation in the blue-green and serves as the primary attenuator of water column ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). CDOM interferes with remote sensing of ocean chlorophyll and can control UV-R-induced damage to light-sensitive organisms including corals. We used laboratory incubations to evaluate CDOM production from senescing Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) leaf litter (yellow, orange, and brown) and floating Sargassum colonies. Mangroves exist at the land-ocean interface near coral reefs in sub-tropical and tropical regions while floating Sargassum colonies tend to congregate in sub-tropical ocean gyres. CDOM production (similar to 48 h) from mangrove leaves collected during a dry period in June 2004 (0.17 +/- 0.11 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) was lower than production from leaves collected during a wet period in September 2003 (0.57 +/- 0.42 m(-1) g(-1) l h(-1)) suggesting that CDOM production from leaf litter fluctuates in response to environmental factors. CDOM production was greatest for the mid-senescence orange leaves and lowest for the severely senesced brown leaves in both experiments. Along the sub-tropical Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem, the primary source of CDOM is discharge from the shallow seagrass-dominated Florida Bay as evidenced by a strong correlation between field CDOM measurements and previously reported Florida Bay discharge volumes. However, field observations provide evidence that large expanses of red mangroves throughout the Keys could be important CDOM sources to the region's coral reefs during periods of reduced Florida Bay discharge. Floating Sargassum colonies also readily produced CDOM in laboratory incubations, but at much more variable rates than mangrove leaves. However, our calculations indicate that large mats of floating Sargassum could provide important CDOM quantities to oligotrophic oceanic waters including the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic.

New strategies are required to more effectively select MPA locations and increase the pace of their implementation. Many criteria exist to design MPA networks, but generally, it is recommended that networks conserve a diversity of species selected for, among other attributes, their representativeness, rarity, or endemicity. Because knowledge of species' spatial distribution remains scarce, efficient surrogates are urgently needed. We used five different levels of habitat maps and six spatial scales of analysis to identify under which circumstances habitat data used to design MPA networks for Wallis Island provided better representation of species than random choice alone. Protected-area site selections were derived from a rarity-complementarity algorithm. Habitat surrogacy was tested for commercial fish species, all fish species, commercially harvested invertebrates, corals, and algae species. Efficiency of habitat surrogacy varied by species group, type of habitat map, and spatial scale of analysis. Maps with the highest habitat thematic complexity provided better surrogates than simpler maps and were more robust to changes in spatial scales. Surrogates were most efficient for commercial fishes, corals, and algae but not for commercial invertebrates. Conversely, other measurements of species-habitat associations, such as richness congruence and composition similarities provided weak results. We provide, in part, a habitat-mapping methodology for designation of MPAs for Pacific Ocean islands that are characterized by habitat zonations similar to Wallis. Given the increasing availability and affordability of space-borne imagery to map habitats, our approach could appreciably facilitate and improve current approaches to coral reef conservation and enhance MPA implementation.

In 2001, seasonal effects of these inputs on water-column nutrients and phytoplankton (Chl a), macroalgal C:N:P and delta N-15 values, and biocover at FR and BRC sites were examined. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, particularly ammonium) increased and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) decreased from the dry to wet season. Wet season satellite and Chl a data showed that Orinoco runoff reaching Tobago contained chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) but little Chl a, suggesting minimal riverine nutrient transport to Tobago. C:N ratios were lower (16 vs. 21) and macroalgal delta N-15 values higher (6.6 parts per thousand vs. 5.5 parts per thousand) in the BRC vs. FR, indicating relatively more wastewater N in the BRC. High macroalgae and low coral cover in the BRC further indicated that better wastewater treatment could improve the health of Tobago's coral reefs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Classification of multispectral images in coral environments using a hybrid of classifier ensembles	NEUROCOMPUTING												The accuracy attained in the mapping of underwater areas is limited by the effect of variations in the water column, which degrade the signal received by the orbital sensor, creating interclasses confusion that introduce errors into the final result of the classification process. In this article we will describe a hybrid classifier ensembles; the classification is done by progressive refining in three stages. At the end of this process, a combining unit links the various partial classifications generated and achieve the accuracy level desired.

Predicting coral bleaching in response to environmental stressors using 8 years of global-scale data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Coral reefs have experienced extensive mortality over the past few decades as a result of temperature-induced mass bleaching events. There is an increasing realization that other environmental factors, including water mixing, solar radiation, water depth, and water clarity, interact with temperature to either exacerbate bleaching or protect coral from mass bleaching. The relative contribution of these factors to variability in mass bleaching at a global scale has not been quantified, but can provide insights when making large-scale predictions of mass bleaching events. Using data from 708 bleaching surveys across the globe, a framework was developed to predict the probability of moderate or severe bleaching as a function of key environmental variables derived from global-scale remote-sensing data. The ability of models to explain spatial and temporal variability in mass bleaching events was quantified. Results indicated approximately 20% improved accuracy of predictions of bleaching when solar radiation and water mixing, in addition to elevated temperature, were incorporated into models, but predictive accuracy was variable among regions. Results provide insights into the effects of environmental parameters on bleaching at a global scale.																	0167-6369					FEB	2010	161	1-4					423	438		10.1007/s10661-009-0758-3								WOS:000273399900035	19267212

Warming Seas in the Coral Triangle: Coral Reef Vulnerability and Management Implications	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The highest diversity coral reefs in the world, located in the Coral Triangle, are threatened by a variety of local stresses including pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing in addition to climate change impacts, such as increasing sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and ocean acidification. As climate change impacts increase, coral reef vulnerability at the ecoregional scale will have an increasingly important influence on conservation management decisions. This project provides the first detailed assessment of past and future climatic stress, thermal variability, and anthropogenic impacts in the Coral Triangle at the ecoregional level, thus incorporating both local (e.g., pollution, development, and overfishing) and global threats (increasing SSTs). The development of marine protected area (MPA) networks across the Coral Triangle is critical for the region to address these threats. Specific management recommendations are defined for MPA networks based on the levels of vulnerability to thermal and local stress. For example, coral reef regions with potentially low vulnerability to thermal stress may be priorities for establishment of MPA networks, whereas high vulnerability regions may require selection and design principles aimed at building resilience to climate change. The identification of climate and other human threats to coral reef systems and ecoregions can help conservation practitioners prioritize management responses to address these threats and identify gaps in MPA networks or other management mechanisms (e. g., integrated coastal management).

Observational methods used in marine spatial monitoring of fishes and associated habitats: a review	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Management areas are used in marine spatial planning to conserve biodiversity of marine ecosystems and to protect fish from fishing pressure. To evaluate the effectiveness of these protected areas, observational techniques are used to determine densities, sizes, biomass, habitat types and distribution of fish species in and around management areas. Two types of observational techniques are used in spatial monitoring: (1) fishery-independent techniques, which include underwater visual census (UVC), underwater video, remote sensing, acoustics, and experimental catch and effort data; and (2) fishery-dependent techniques, which include catch, effort and catch per unit effort data from commercial and recreational fisheries. This review summarises the applications, advantages, disadvantages and biases of each of these observational categories and highlights emerging technologies. The main finding from this review was that a combination of observational techniques, rather than a single method, was the most effective approach to marine spatial monitoring. For example, a combination of hydroacoustics for habitat mapping and UVC or video for fish surveys was one of the most cost-effective and efficient means of obtaining fish-habitat linkages and fish assemblage data. There are also emerging technologies that could increase the precision and efficiency of monitoring surveys. There is a need for continued development of non-intrusive technology for marine monitoring studies.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2010	61	2					236	252		10.1071/MF09068								WOS:000274913200012

The regional land use is dominated by sugarcane cultivation, beef grazing and urban uses. The high nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) fluxes from these land uses via river runoff produced a massive phytoplankton bloom in the GBR lagoon, which, after 9 days, had spread 150 km offshore. The plume and algal bloom surrounded inner-shelf reefs of the GBR such as Brampton Island Reef and its spread was tracked with a variety of satellite sensors including MODIS, SeaWiFS and Landsat over the 9-day period. The ability to be able to access imagery from a large number of satellite sensors allowed almost daily estimates of the extent of plume to be made, despite periods of cloud. Analysis of water samples from the plume revealed elevated (2-50 times higher) concentrations of Chlorophyll a (and hence phytoplankton biomass), up to 50 times higher than in non-flood conditions, nutrients (2-100 times higher) and herbicide residues (10-100 times higher) compared with GBR lagoon waters in non-discharge conditions. The concentration data from the samples and estimated exposure periods from the satellite images allowed estimates of the exposure of GBR marine ecosystems (coral reefs, the pelagic community, seagrass beds and mangrove forests) to the terrestrial contaminants to be made.

Circulation and suspended sediment transport in a coral reef lagoon: The south-west lagoon of New Caledonia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The south-west lagoon of New Caledonia is a wide semi-open coral reef lagoon bounded by an intertidal barrier reef and bisected by numerous deep inlets. This paper synthesizes findings from the 2000-2008 French National Program EC2CO-PNEC relative to the circulation and the transport of suspended particles in this lagoon. Numerical model development (hydrodynamic, fine suspended sediment transport, wind-wave, small-scale atmospheric circulation) allowed the determination of circulation patterns in the lagoon and the charting of residence time, the later of which has been recently used in a series of ecological studies. Topical studies based on field measurements permitted the parameterisation of wave set-up induced by the swell breaking on the reef barrier and the validation of a wind-wave model in a fetch-limited environment. The analysis of spatial and temporal variability of suspended matter concentration over short and long time-scales, the measurement of grain size distribution and the density of suspended matter (1.27 kg 1(-1)), and the estimation of erodibility of heterogeneous (sand/mud, terrigenous/biogenic) soft bottoms was also conducted. Aggregates were shown to be more abundant near or around reefs and a possible biological influence on this aggregation is discussed. Optical measurements enabled the quantification of suspended matter either in situ (monochromatic measurements) or remotely (surface spectral measurements and satellite observations) and provided indirect calibration and validation of a suspended sediment transport model. The processes that warrant further investigation in order to improve our knowledge of circulation and suspended sediment transport in the New Caledonia lagoon as well as in other coral reef areas are discussed, as are the relevance and reliability of the numerical models for this endeavour.

The input to 0C4v4 was Rrs measured in situ or modeled from water's inherent optical properties (2001-2007). At open ocean stations, backscattering and absorption coefficients were correlated with chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.31-0.51, respectively), in agreement with models for Case 1 waters. Taking spectrofluorometric measurement as reference, the 0C4v4 model leads to an average underestimation of 33% of the chlorophyll concentration. For the lagoon waters, 0C4v4 performed inadequately because the backscattering coefficient, highly correlated with turbidity and suspended matter (R2 = 0.98), was poorly correlated to chlorophyll (R-2 = 0.42). The 0C4v4 performance was better in deep lagoon waters for stations with a TOT index (Tchla x depth/turbidity) higher than 19 mg M-2 NTU-1 (R-2 = 0.974, bias = 10.2%). Global Imager Rrs provided a good estimate of Tchla (R-2 = 0.79, N = 28) in the deeper part of the lagoon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Characterizing the diversity of coral reef habitats and fish communities found in a UNESCO World Heritage Site: The strategy developed for Lagoons of New Caledonia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Since 1972, the UNESCO "World Heritage Convention" offers an international canvas for conservation and management that targets areas of high cultural and environmental significance. To support the designation of areas within the 36.000 km(2) of New Caledonia coral reefs and lagoons as a World Heritage Site, the natural value and diversity of the proposed zones needed to be demonstrated. To exhaustively identify each configuration of shallow habitats, high resolution remote sensing images were used to select the sampling sites. This optimal scheme resulted in the selection of nearly 1300 sampling sites, and was then simplified to render its application realistic. In the final sampling plan, only the most common or the most remarkable coral zones were selected. Following this selection, in situ habitat and fish surveys were conducted in 2006-2008 in five large areas spanning a 600 km-long latitudinal gradient. Habitats were described using line-intercept transects in parallel with underwater visual census of indicator and commercial coral reef fish species. We report here on the results achieved in terms of: (i) the actual diversity of coral habitats captured by the remote sensing based sampling strategy, (ii) the different reef fish communities captured from the different sites, and (iii) how well they represent New Caledonia diversity. We discuss the possible generalization of this scheme to other sites, in the context of World Heritage Site selection and for other large-scale conservation planning activities.

Remote sensing of sand distribution patterns across an insular shelf: Oahu, Hawaii	MARINE GEOLOGY												Sandy substrate is important as a resource, habitat, and dynamic region of the bathymetry. We find that sand storage across the insular shelf of Oahu, Hawaii is controlled most strongly by general insular shelf morphology and to a lesser degree by hydrodynamic energy. Shelf sand is predominantly found in water depths less than or crossing the 10 m contour. We use remote sensing to identify and classify 14,037 individual sand deposits in nine study regions. A supervised classification algorithm aggregates these into five classes with 14 subclasses. Almost 63% of all sandy surface area falls into two subclasses of the Channels and Connected Fields class, 1) Major Channels and 2) Unchannelized Drainage. These subclasses connect regions of sediment production to regions of sediment storage on the insular shelf surface. This study is the first to quantitatively analyze and classify shelf sand deposits, in a high volcanic island coral reef setting. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The reason is assuming of zero water leaving signal at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This assumption is not valid in very shallow waters, but also in areas where aquatic vegetation reaches water surface and in case of phytoplankton blooms that reach very high biomass or form surface scum. We propose an alternative method that can be used for successful glint removal even if the sensor does not have spectral bands beyond 800 nm. The proposed method utilises the presence and depth of the oxygen absorption feature near 760 nm as an indicator of glint contamination. This method allows removing sun glint from hyperspectral imagery preserving shape and magnitude of reflectance spectra in the cases where the negligible water leaving NIR signal is not valid.

Changes of coral communities over 35 years: Integrating in situ and remote-sensing data on Saint-Leu Reef (la Reunion, Indian Ocean)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE					5th Western-Indian-Ocean-Marine-Science-Association Symposium (WIOMSA)	OCT 22-26, 2007	Durban, SOUTH AFRICA	Western Indian Ocean Marine Sci Assoc, Oceanog Res Inst				Monitoring coral reef communities at a decadal scale is necessary to understand and project their dynamics to provide a basis for reef management in light of disturbances and climate change. Complementing infrequent and localised in situ observations, time-series of aerial photographs and remotely sensed satellite images provide a means of monitoring the position and extent of reef-top coral communities, vegetation and abiotic substrata at the whole reef scale. The aim of the present study was to map such changes on Saint-Leu Reef (La Reunion) between 1973 and 2007. The period included two cyclones (1989, 2002) and one severe bleaching event (2002). Vertical images of the reef were recorded in five aerial photographs (1973,1978,1989,1997, and 2003) and two Quickbird satellite images (2002, 2006) during that time. Quantitative in situ observations of parts of the reef-top were also available both to document ecological and substratum characteristics that produce the color and texture observable in the photos and satellite images. Coral communities were mapped on all images using manual delineation of polygons identified according to color and texture contrast. The 2006 Quickbird image was used as the mapping base and 15 types of coral communities were identified from a reef survey conducted in 2007. This hierarchical typology used coral growth forms, live and dead coral cover, macro-algae, substratum (sand, rubble and platform) and, to a lesser extent, coral taxonomy. The polygons at date t were over-laid onto image t - 1 across the whole series and their boundaries were manually edited to match the pattern on the earlier image. Labelling of polygons was guided by field-survey data and maps. For coral-dominated patches, six successive pairs of maps from 1973 to 2006 were compared to produce 'coral community change maps' for that period. Despite the multiple disturbance events, the coral community distribution and composition in 2006 on Saint-Leu Reef did not display major differences compared to 1973. This suggests a high degree of coral resilience at the site, led by rapid recovery of compact branching corals. The mapping techniques overcame challenges due to different image quality and the sparsity of in situ observations in time and space. Our results demonstrate the potential for further application of reef monitoring protocols based on complementary in situ and remote-sensing data to help understand the dynamics of reef-top coral reef communities and geomorphology over years to decades.

We describe how approaches to knowledge in Roviana differ from prevailing models of knowledge that distinguish between cognitive aspects and other modalities of knowing. For many Roviana fishers, ecological knowledge is not analytically separated from the changing contexts of everyday activities such as navigating and fishing. Inspired by Roviana epistemologies, we argue that a practice-oriented approach provides a more sympathetic and informative theoretical framework for understanding knowledge and its role in contemporary marine-resource conservation efforts. The theoretical and methodological implications of the perspective are illustrated with examples from an ongoing marine conservation project in the western Solomon Islands that integrates indigenous knowledge, remote-sensing techniques, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies.																	0002-7294	1548-1433				SEP	2009	111	3					317	329		10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01135.x								WOS:000269490800005

A reappraisal of the diversity of geomorphological and genetic processes of New Caledonian coral reefs: a synthesis from optical remote sensing, coring and acoustic multibeam observations	CORAL REEFS												The diversity of oceanic and continental reef structures of New Caledonia is reviewed, taking into account their geological history and in particular, that since the last interglacial period. To guide this review, a new path is provided by following the diversity of units that have been mapped and characterized using high spatial resolution optical remote sensing data for the main New Caledonian coral reef complexes (banks, atolls, uplifted reefs, drowned reefs, fringing reefs, barrier reefs, patch reefs) and their individual reef-forming units. This interpretation, based on geomorphology, depth, and exposure has provided 161 unit types distributed across 4,537 km(2) of reef area and 31,336 km(2) of non-reef area. In addition to shallow reefs (0-30 m) described by optical remote sensing, the bathymetry of deep slopes between -20 to -1,000 m were recently mapped using multibeam acoustic data providing additional data to explain the morphological diversity. With the detailed three-dimensional topographic information acquired, hitherto unrecognized marine terraces and faulting became visible, indicating different episodes of formation of the barrier reef and of sea level variations. Finally, dating and coring corals provided a more accurate understanding of the genesis of the present reef structures. In contrast with the synoptic remote sensing data, cores provided only point data, but allowed the addition of a precise temporal dimension to the description of New Caledonian reefs. Cores provided a significant body of the information necessary for the establishment of models of reef settlement and development during the last interglacial ages in the New Caledonian region. The combined examination of the different sources of data, and the exhaustive description of remotely sensed reef units, allow a qualitative synoptic parallel to be drawn between the morphology of modern reefs and the contrasting patterns of reef growth, subsidence, and uplift rates occurring around New Caledonia.

We have developed a practical approach to remove these errors using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) 1-km resolution data. The objective was to improve the accuracy of SST anomaly estimates in the Florida Keys and to provide the best quality (in particular, high temporal and spatial resolutions) SST data products for this region. After manual navigation of over 47000 AVHRR images (1993-2005), we implemented a cloud-filtering technique that differs from previously published image processing methods. The filter used a 12-year climatology and 3-day running SST statistics to flag cloud-contaminated pixels. Comparison with concurrent (+/- 0.5 h) data from the SEAKEYS in situ stations in the Florida Keys showed near-zero bias errors (<0.05 degrees C) in the weekly anomaly for SST anomalies between -3 degrees C and 3 degrees C, with standard deviations <0.5 degrees C. The cloud filter was implemented using Interactive Data Language for near-real-time processing of AVHRR and MODIS data. The improved SST products were used to detect SST anomalies and to estimate degree-heating weeks (DHWs) to assess the potential for coral reef stress. The mean and anomaly products are updated weekly, with periodic updates of the DHW products, on a Web site.

Coral health monitoring: linking coral colour and remote sensing techniques	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Percent of living coral cover is an indicator commonly used to assess reef status. This study tested whether Coral Health Chart scores could be used as a proxy for spectral reflectance, which would provide a basis for mapping living coral cover at a finer scale (colour) using remote sensing techniques. A total of 1264 spectral reflectance measurements were taken in situ from corals representing the colour scores on the Coral Health Chart at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Spectral analyses of reflectance magnitude showed that living coral could be classified with 72.41% overall accuracy into three colour categories: bleached, medium, and dark coral. First- and second-order derivative analyses did not improve the accuracy of classifying coral spectra into colour categories. Spectral analyses using only coral spectra from the genus Acropora also failed to improve classification results significantly, consistent with suggestions that coral reflectance is independent of taxonomy at the genus level. The results of this study provide a foundation for using the Coral Health Chart as a proxy to map and monitor living coral condition using remote sensing techniques.

Physical connectivity in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System inferred from 9 years of ocean color observations	CORAL REEFS												Ocean color images acquired from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1998 to 2006 were used to examine the patterns of physical connectivity between land and reefs, and among reefs in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Connectivity was inferred by tracking surface water features in weekly climatologies and a time series of weekly mean chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from satellite imagery. Frequency of spatial connections between 17 pre-defined, geomorphological domains that include the major reefs in the MBRS and river deltas in Honduras and Nicaragua were recorded and tabulated as percentage of connections. The 9-year time series of 466 weekly mean images portrays clearly the seasonal patterns of connectivity, including river plumes and transitions in the aftermath of perturbations such as hurricanes. River plumes extended offshore from the Honduras coast to the Bay Islands (Utila, Cayo Cochinos, Guanaja, and Roatan) in 70% of the weekly mean images. Belizean reefs, especially those in the southern section of the barrier reef and Glovers Atoll, were also affected by riverine discharges in every one of the 9 years. Glovers Atoll was exposed to river plumes originating in Honduras 104/466 times (22%) during this period. Plumes from eastern Honduras went as far as Banco Chinchorro and Cozumel in Mexico. Chinchorro appeared to be more frequently connected to Turneffe Atoll and Honduran rivers than with Glovers and Lighthouse Atolls, despite their geographic proximity. This new satellite data analysis provides long-term, quantitative assessments of the main pathways of connectivity in the region. The percentage of connections can be used to validate predictions made using other approaches such as numerical modeling, and provides valuable information to ecosystem-based management in coral reef provinces.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0722-4028					JUN	2009	28	2					415	425		10.1007/s00338-009-0465-0								WOS:000265832100011

We have developed a practical approach to remove these errors using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) I-km resolution data. The objective was to improve the accuracy of SST anomaly estimates in the Florida Keys and to provide the best quality (in particular, high temporal and spatial resolutions) SST data products for this region. After manual navigation of over 47 000 AVHRR images (1993-2005), we implemented a cloud-filtering technique that differs from previously published image processing methods. The filter used a 12-year climatology and +/-3-day running SST statistics to flag cloud-contaminated pixels. Comparison with concurrent (+/-0.5 h) data from the SEAKEYS in situ stations in the Florida Keys showed near-zero bias errors (< 0.05 degrees C) in the weekly anomaly for SST anomalies between -3 degrees C and 3 degrees C, with standard deviations < 0.5 degrees C. The cloud filter was implemented using Interactive Data Language for near-real-time processing of AVHRR and MODIS data. The improved SST products were used to detect SST anomalies and to estimate degree-heating weeks (DHWs) to assess the potential for coral reef stress. The mean and anomaly products are updated weekly, with periodic updates of the DHW products, on a Web site. The SST data at specific geographical locations were also automatically ingested in near real time into National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Integrated Coral Observing Network Web-based application to assist in management and decision making through a novel expert system tool (G2) implemented at NOAA.

An Integrated Field and Remote Sensing Approach for Mapping Seagrass Cover, Moreton Bay, Australia	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Creating accurate maps of seagrass cover is a challenging procedure in coastal waters with variable water clarity and depths. This paper presents an approach for mapping seagrass cover from data sources commonly collected by natural resource management agencies responsible for coastal environments. The aim of the study was to develop an approach for mapping classes of seagrass cover from field and/or image data for an area with variable water clarity and depths. The study was carried out in Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. A Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite image was acquired for the same area in August 2004. The image data were used to map seagrass cover in the exposed inter-tidal and clear shallow water areas to depths of 3 in. Field Survey data were collected, in July - August 2004, to map deep (> 3 m) and turbid sub-tidal areas, using: real time video, snorkeller observations and transect Surveys. The resulting maps were combined into a single layer of polygons, with the same seagrass cover classes used as existing mapping programs and with each polygon assigned to one of five cover classes (0 %, 1-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 %, 75-100 %). As independent field data were not available for accuracy assessment, a reliability assessment indicated that > 75 percent of the Bay was mapped with high categorical reliability. Most previously published seagrass mapping projects covered areas < 400 km(2), were based on single data sets, and lacked assessment of accuracy or reliability. Our approach and methods address this gap and present guidelines for a generally applicable method to integrate image and field data sets over large areas (> 1000 km(2)) commonly used for monitoring and management.

J	Godet, L; Fournier, J; Toupoint, N; Olivier, F				Godet, Laurent; Fournier, Jerome; Toupoint, Nicolas; Olivier, Frederic			Mapping and monitoring intertidal benthic habitats: a review of techniques and a proposal for a new visual methodology for the European coasts	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Mapping seafloors is a fundamental step for managing and preserving coastal zones. Moreover, in a context of current global environmental changes, new methods allowing long-term monitoring are increasingly required. Various methods have been used to map seafloors, primarily benthic macrofauna and sediment sampling along regular grids or transects, and remote sensing methods. These methods map very different things, do not have the same accuracy levels, and have different costs in time and money. Furthermore, such methods often require the competencies of highly skilled scientists and exclude non-specialists otherwise best placed to perform them. In this paper, we test a method based on Direct Field Observations ('DFO method'), which can be used by non-specialists, and assess if it is sufficient for mapping and monitoring intertidal habitats. We further compare this method with other conventional ones. The results show that such a simple method is relatively rapid and inexpensive given the results obtained. Moreover, it is particularly suitable for highly fragmented intertidal landscapes where other methods are often very limited. In consequence, in areas such as the European coasts, it can be used by non-specialists, such as protected-area managers, and because it is an inexpensive and quick method long-term monitoring is also possible.

J	Lim, A; Hedley, JD; LeDrew, E; Mumby, PJ; Roelfsema, C				Lim, Alan; Hedley, John D.; LeDrew, Ellsworth; Mumby, Peter J.; Roelfsema, Chris			The effects of ecologically determined spatial complexity on the classification accuracy of simulated coral reef images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Numerous studies have been conducted to compare the classification accuracy of coral reef maps produced from satellite and aerial imagery with different sensor characteristics such as spatial or spectral resolution, or under different environmental conditions. However, in additional to these physical environment and sensor design factors, the ecologically determined spatial complexity of the reef itself presents significant challenges for remote sensing objectives. While previous studies have considered the spatial resolution of the sensors, none have directly drawn the link from sensor spatial resolution to the scale and patterns in the heterogeneity of reef benthos. In this paper, we will study how the accuracy of a commonly used maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm is affected by spatial elements typical of a Caribbean atoll system present in high spectral and spatial resolution imagery. The results indicate that the degree to which ecologically determined spatial factors influence accuracy is dependent on both the amount of coral cover on the reef and the spatial resolution of the images being classified, and may be a contributing factor to the differences in the accuracies obtained for mapping reefs in different geographical locations. Differences in accuracy are also obtained due to the methods of pixel selection for training the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. With respect to estimation of live coral cover, a method which randomly selects training samples from all samples in each class provides better estimates for lower resolution images while a method biased to select the pixels with the highest substrate purity gave better estimations for higher resolution images.

Comparative evaluation of airborne LiDAR and ship-based multibeam SoNAR bathymetry and intensity for mapping coral reef ecosystems	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Large areas of the world's coastal marine environments remain poorly characterized because they have not been mapped with sufficient accuracy and at spatial resolutions high enough to support a wide range of societal needs. Expediting the rate of seafloor mapping requires the collection of multi-use datasets that concurrently address hydrographic charting needs and support decision-making in ecosystem-based management. While active optical and acoustic sensors have previously been compared for the purpose of hydrographic charting, few studies have evaluated the performance and cost effectiveness of these systems for providing benthic habitat maps. Bathymetric and intensity data were collected in shallow water (<50 m depth) coral reef ecosystems using two conventional remote sensing technologies: (1) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and (2) ship-based multibeam (MBES) Sound Navigation and Ranging (SoNAR). A comparative assessment using a suite of twelve metrics demonstrated that LiDAR and MBES were equally capable of discriminating seafloor topography (r = >0.9), although LiDAR depths were found to be consistently shallower than MBES depths. The intensity datasets were not significantly correlated at a broad 4 x 5 km spatial scale (r = -0.11), but were moderately correlated in flat areas at a fine 4 x 500 m spatial scale (r = 0.51), indicating that the LiDAR intensity algorithm needs to be improved before LiDAR intensity surfaces can be used for habitat mapping. LiDAR cost 6.6% less than MBES and required 40 fewer hours to map the same study area. MBES provided more detail about the seafloor by fully ensonifying high-relief features, by differentiating between fine and coarse sediments and by collecting data with higher spatial resolutions. Surface fractal dimensions and fast Fourier transformations emerged as useful methods for detecting artifacts in the datasets. Overall, LiDAR provided a more cost effective alternative to MBES for mapping and monitoring shallow water coral reef ecosystems (<50 m depth), although the unique advantages of MBES may make it a more appropriate choice for answering certain ecological or geological questions requiring very high resolution data.

Ecological niche modelling of the distribution of cold-water coral habitat using underwater remote sensing data	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Despite a growing appreciation of the need to protect sensitive deep sea ecosystems such as cold-water corals, efforts to map the extent of their distribution are limited by their remoteness. Here we develop ecological niche models to predict the likely distributions of cold-water corals based on occurrence records and data describing environmental parameters (e.g. seafloor terrain attributes and oceanographic conditions). This study has used bathymetric data derived from ship-borne multibeam swath systems, species occurrence data from remotely operated vehicle video surveys and oceanographic parameters from hydrodynamic models to predict coral locations in regions where there is a paucity of direct observations. Predictions of the locations of the scleractinian coral, Lophelia pertusa are based primarily upon ecological niche modelling using a genetic algorithm. Its accuracy has been quantified at local (similar to 25 km(2)) and regional scales (similar to 4000 km(2)) along the Irish continental slope using a variety of error assessment techniques and a comparison with another ecological niche modelling technique. With appropriate choices of parameters and scales of analyses, ecological niche modelling has been effective in predicting the distributions of species at local and regional scales. Refinements of this approach have the potential to be particularly useful for ocean management given the need to manage areas of sensitive habitat where survey data are often limited.

In this study, insights from petrographic data, granulometric measurements, bottom observations, and remote sensing and subbottom profiler data from the northwestern part of Caicos Platform make this one of the more intensely studied shallow-marine carbonate systems in the Caribbean. Collectively, analyses of the thicknesses and heterogeneity of shallow-water Holocene carbonates and the platform margin reveal details of the considerable geomorphic variability present on this part of the margin, on which the orientation changes markedly. In this area, the shelf margin arcs from northwest- to north- to northeast-facing, accompanied by changes in morphology as well as the distribution, thickness and type of sediments. The NW-facing margin has discontinuous reefs near the margin, flanked platformward by coarse sands in poorly developed aprons that transition to a deeper rocky bottom (interpreted as Pleistocene) with patches of sand to fine gravel sized sediment. Locally, lobate-to-arcuate shoals with medium sands (< 500 mu m mean size; peloids and skeletal grains) form discontinuous nearshore sediment wedges. Above the gently seaward-dipping surface of the interpreted top-Pleistocene surface on this part of the margin, the most pronounced bathymetric changes (greatest relief similar to 3 m) occur around reefs and tidal deltas. In contrast, the NE-facing margin includes a continuous aggraded reef with just two passages to the open ocean (Sellar's Cut and Wheeland Cut). Just behind the reef, landward-fining coarse skeletal-peloidal sands (> 500 mu m mean size) form a reef apron that is continuous along strike and over 1000 In wide. Because the interpreted top-Pleistocene surface is gently dipping seaward, Holocene sediment thicknesses vary with changes in bathymetry and generally thin away from the reefs. Sediments in most areas are between 1.5 and 3 m thick but can reach over 6 m locally. Although the interpretation of the base of the Holocene can be ambiguous under shelf-margin reefs, subbottom profiles illustrate that backreef shelf patch reefs do not necessarily nucleate on Pleistocene bedrock highs. Facies trends are interpreted to reflect a combination of physical oceanographic, sedimentologic, and biologic processes acting within the framework of Pleistocene bedrock configuration. The NE-facing margin, with the continuous reef and expansive sand apron, is interpreted to be more wave-dominated, influenced by swells from the open Atlantic, and by locally derived wind waves. Comparison with Bahamian platforms suggests that this trend is not unique; margins facing open Atlantic swells from the north-northeast have the best-developed reefs, not east-facing (windward) margins. In contrast, the beaches and tidal deltas on the NW-facing margin suggest tidal currents and longshore transport are more pronounced here, consistent with the nature of geomorphic changes through time. The enhanced tidal influence reflects the inlets open to the open bank interior, a factor which also may discourage growth of reefs on this part of the margin. Nonetheless, other Bahamian platforms with fewer tidal passes have comparable discontinuous reefs, suggesting that island continuity is not the most influential parameter on leeward reef development. Collectively, these results illustrate the nature, scale, and causes of along-strike heterogeneity and provide a conceptual model for ancient carbonate platform margins, some of which may be equally complex in their facies architecture.

However, before remote sensing can be viewed as a practical monitoring and diagnostic tool for entire coral communities, there is a need to understand the spectral responses from individual coral species. Toward that end, it seems important to not only establish the range of natural variability in spectral reflectance but also to develop procedures to enhance understanding of the spectra. This paper describes our data collection approach as well as a procedure for examining the spectral features associated with one species of coral (Siderastrea siderea). The paper also examines the spectral variability in reflectance within samples of the same species and suggests a procedure for highlighting the spectral positions of absorbers/pigments, thus yielding useful information about pigment composition in one coral species.

The availability of spectral information is a key determinant of the detail discernable in the mapping process and consequent detail presented in output maps. Testament to this is the increasing utility of hyperspectral sensors, which typically yield datasets of higher resolution, spectrally continuous wavebands. Image classification algorithms distinguish between the different and unique reflectance characteristics of target features. While the availability of more wavebands provides the opportunity to apply analysis techniques that treat the data as spectrally continuous, such a large number of data dimensions also present a considerable computing burden. Through multiple discriminant function analysis, this paper identifies an optimal subset of wavelengths for resolving the reflectance of key terrestrial and marine coverages at the Al Wajh Barrier reef system, Saudi Arabia, Red Sea. The goal of such analysis is to facilitate the processing of high resolution, spectrally continuous remote sensing data of coastal landscapes.

Developmental strategy for effective sampling to detect possible nutrient fluxes in oligotrophic coastal reef waters in the Caribbean	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY												The stress contributed by nutrients to the coral reef ecosystem is among many problems that may be resolved using the coastal ocean observing system (COOS) being developed by various institutions. Traditional nutrient sampling has been inadequate to resolve issues on episodic nutrient fluxes in reef regions due to temporal and spatial variability. This paper illustrates sampling strategy using COOS information to identify areas that need critical investigation. The area investigated is within the Puerto Rico subdomain. Nutrient profile results from the region indicate nitrate is undetectable in the upper 50m due to high biological consumption. The strong vertical fluctuation in the upper 50m demonstrates a high anomaly in temperature and salinity and a strong cross correlation signal. High chlorophyll a concentration corresponding to seasonal high nutrient influx coincides with higher precipitation accumulation rates and apparent riverine input from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, Non-detectability of nutrients in the upper 50m is a reflection of poor sampling frequency or the absence of a highly sensitive nutrient analysis method to capture episodic events. Thus, this paper explores the range of depths and concentrations that need to be critically investigated to determine nutrient fluxes, nutrient sources, and climatological factors that can affect nutrient delivery. It also provides insight into needed sampling rates and temporal and spatial domain choices, Finally, it demonstrates a scientific reconnaissance for a field study that is now possible with online in-situ and remote sensing observations and numerical simulations, as a consequence of IOOS in general and COOS in particular.																	1755-876X					FEB	2009	2	1					35	47		10.1080/1755876X.2009.11020107								WOS:000271014300005						
J	Guo, W; Li, SH; Zhu, DK				Guo Wei; Li Shuheng; Zhu Dakui			The application of geographic information technology to coastal geomorphology	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												With the development of modern oceanic observation technologies, coastal survey data have been experiencing a substantial growth. The integration management of the data from different disciplines, different sources and different formats has become a major research field in coastal geomorphology by using Geographic Information System (GIS). This paper puts forward a new methodology framework of GIS techniques in coastal ocean geomorphology, including data acquisition, process, analysis, and representation. It focuses on some major GIS techniques to study the land-ocean interaction mechanism, such as spatial analysis, submarine topography model and three-dimension (3D) visualization, and apply its result to coastal urban planning, harbor site selection and geomorphology environment about coral reef and islands on the continental shelf. The case studies cover the whole coastal ocean to serve the social community, economical development and diplomatic rights for decision-making all round in the coastal zone. The research shows clearly that the application of coastal multi-source geospatial platform has changed the traditional coastal geomorphology science dramatically from its research scope, fields and methods, however, as made clear in this paper, extracting accurate information from remote sensing data and GIS databases for coastal geomorphological applications is a nontrivial challenge that requires the combined knowledge and skills of information scientists and geomorphologists.																	0253-505X						2009	28	5					49	57										WOS:000273214400006

To complete this study, the methods employed consisted of the application of remote sensing data and geographic information systems to extract information on spatial distribution of mangrove and tidal flat ecosystems, as well as on the reclamation area for human development and indicator investigation and analysis, using remote sensing extracted and field survey monitored data with Microsoft Excel (MS Excel). Applying indicators for sustainable utilization and management of marine ecosystems, developed in recent studies for the Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area, demonstrated changes and trends in significant ecosystems, such as coral reefs and mangroves. The outcomes showed that from 1998 to 2003, living coral cover was reduced by 20% on average in the Ha Long Bay area and by 13% in Cat Ba (Hang Trai - Dau Be), and projected that living coral cover would be reduced by a further 10% to 50% by 2010. The number of coral species was much reduced by 15% to 72% in the Ha Long - Cat Ba area. Mangrove area also decreased between 1995 and 2004, particularly after 2000, and is projected to be only 10,000 ha in 2010 in Quang Ninh. Marine ecosystems in the coastal waters of Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area have degraded significantly, particularly coral reefs, mangroves and tidal flats.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2009	12	3					243	248		10.1080/14634980903140364								WOS:000270156100003

Regional estimates of reef carbonate dynamics and productivity using Landsat 7 ETM+, and potential impacts from ocean acidification	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Using imagery at 30 m spatial resolution from the most recent Landsat satellite, the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), we scale up reef metabolic productivity and calcification from local habitat-scale (10(-1) to 10(0) km(2)) measurements to regional scales (10(3) to 10(4) km(2)). Distribution and spatial extent of the North Florida Reef Tract (NFRT) habitats come from supervised classification of the Landsat imagery within independent Landsat-derived Millennium Coral Reef Map geomorphologic classes. This system minimizes the depth range and variability of benthic habitat characteristics found in the area of supervised classification and limits misclassification. Classification of Landsat imagery into 5 biotopes (sand, dense live cover, sparse live cover, seagrass, and sparse seagrass) by geomorphologic class is >73 % accurate at regional scales. Based on recently published habitat-scale in situ metabolic measurements, gross production (P=3.01 x 10(9) kg C yr(-1)), excess production (E = -5.70 x 10(8) kg C yr(-1)), and calcification (G = -1.68 x 10(6) kg CaCO3 yr(-1)) are estimated over 2711 km(2) of the NFRT. Simple models suggest sensitivity of these values to ocean acidification, which will increase local dissolution of carbonate sediments. Similar approaches could be applied over large areas with poorly constrained bathymetry or water column properties and minimal metabolic sampling. This tool has potential applications for modeling and monitoring large-scale environmental impacts on reef productivity, such as the influence of ocean acidification on coral reef environments.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2009	380						103	115		10.3354/meps07920								WOS:000265907000009

Rugosity-based regional modeling of hard-bottom habitat	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Systematic conservation planning is most often directed at the representation and protection of marine biodiversity. However, direct observation and sampling of marine biodiversity is extremely time consuming and expensive. Due to these constraints, marine conservation planners have sought proxies for marine biodiversity to use in their models, Hard-bottom habitats support high levels of biodiversity and are frequently used as a surrogate for it in marine spatial planning. Rugosity (i.e. the roughness of the seafloor) is an indicator of hard-bottom habitat. In the present study, we expand on previous analyses of the relationship between rugosity and hard-bottom and create the first data-driven regional rugosity model to predict hard-bottom habitat. We used logistic regression to create an empirical model and compare it to other pre-formulated definitions of rugosity with receiver operator characteristic curves. Our model performed better than all other models and was able to correctly predict the presence or absence of hard-bottom habitat with similar to 70 % accuracy. This model offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to more traditional survey methods, and should be of value to regional conservation planners and fisheries managers as an initial predictor of hard-bottom habitat. By testing this model with low-resolution (90 m) bathymetry data, we demonstrate that this type of information may be used in marine conservation plans in regions such as developing countries, where high-resolution data is not currently available. Further, our model offers a proxy for marine habitat diversity in non-coastal areas, an under-represented sector in marine conservation planning.

This quest implies that fish-habitat relationships are characterized across different spatial scales. Remote sensing allows now for a routine description of habitats from global-regional to detailed reef scales, thus theoretically offering access to hierarchical spatial analysis at multiple scales. To judge the progress in using remotely sensed habitat variables for reef fish study, existing peer-reviewed papers on the subject are reviewed. We tabulated the significant fish-habitat relationships given the different study sites, fish and habitat variables, statistical analysis, sampling efforts and scales. Studies generally do not corroborate each other. Instead, the exercise provides a diversity of thematic results from which lessons remain equivocal. It is thus justified to recommend more systematic and hierarchical remote-sensing based research in the future. We advocate the use of remote-sensing early in the design of the fish study, as part of a coherent conceptual scheme spanning all spatial scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The role of topography in promoting fractal patchiness in a carbonate shelf landscape	CORAL REEFS												Satellite remote sensing has shown numerous aspects of coral reef seascapes to be fractal. That is, they display characteristics of scale-invariance and complexity. To date, an understanding of why reefscapes adopt this curious scaling has been lacking. This property was investigated using high-resolution terrain models built using bathymetric LiDAR soundings of the shallow Puerto Rico insular shelf. A computer-simulation model constructed using simple random processes was adequate to describe many of the intricacies of actual coral reef terrain. This model, based on fractional Brownian motion (fBm), produced surfaces that were visually and statistically indistinguishable from natural seabeds, at spatial scales of 0.001-25 km2. The conformity between model and nature allowed us to ascertain the importance of topography as a driver for the fractal patchiness that has been shown to occur in plan-view maps of reefscapes (e.g. Purkis et al. J Sediment Res 75:861-876, 2005, J Geol 115:493-508, 2007). For the considered Puerto Rican shelf, the necessary Brownian-like seabed topography likely arose through karst erosion overprinted by several episodes of reef development.

As this CO2 is absorbed by seawater, it not only reacts causing a reduction in seawater pH (or acidification) but also decreases the carbonate mineral saturation state (Omega), which plays an important role in calcification for many marine organisms. Ocean acidification could affect some of the most fundamental biological processes of the sea in coming decades. Observations obtained in situ from Volunteer Observing Ships and the multiple geochemical surveys have been extended using satellite remote sensing and modeled environmental parameters to derive estimates of sea-surface alkalinity (A(T)) and carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2,sw)). Pairing estimates of A(T) and pCO(2,sw) have permitted characterisation of the changes in sea-surface Omega, which have transpired over the past decade throughout the Greater Carribean Region as a consequence of ocean acidification. The results reveal considerable spatial and temporal variability throughout the region. Despite this variability, we observe a strong decrease in aragonite saturation state (Omega(arg)) at a rate of approximately -0.012 +/- 0.001 Omega(arg) yr(-1) (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.001).				Eakin, C.

J	Beech, T; Dowd, M; Field, C; Hatcher, B; Andrefouet, S				Beech, Talia; Dowd, Michael; Field, Chris; Hatcher, Bruce; Andrefouet, Serge			A stochastic approach to marine reserve design: Incorporating data uncertainty	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Marine reserves, or protected areas, are used to meet an array of biodiversity and conservation objectives. The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers, The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves. In order to do this, a simplified version of the marine reserve design optimization problem is considered. A Metropolis-Hastings random search procedure is introduced to systematically sample the model solution space and converge on an optimal reserve design. Incorporation of the uncertain input data builds on this process and relies on a parametric bootstrapping procedure. This allows for the solution (i.e, the marine reserve design) to be expressed as the probability of any planning unit being included in the marine reserve network. Spatial plots of this acceptance probability are easily interpretable for decision making under uncertainty. The bootstrapping methodology is also readily adapted to existing comprehensive reserve design algorithms. Here, a preliminary application of the algorithm is made to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (in the Caribbean Sea) based on satellite-derived and mapped conservation features (from Landsat).

Diversity, biomass and distribution pattern of Sargassum beds in the South West lagoon of New Caledonia (South Pacific)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Sargassum (Phaeophyceae, Fucales) is a genus of worldwide distribution recently recognised to proliferate in several regions of the South Pacific. In New Caledonia, species of this genus naturally structure one of the major lagoon habitats but their extent, composition and biomass remain largely unknown. To fill these gaps in our knowledge over large areas, we applied a combination of remote sensing and in situ methods applied to the Neo Caledonian South West Lagoon. Space borne high resolution Landsat (30-m resolution) and Quickbird (2.4-m resolution) images of the Neo Caledonian South West lagoon were used to estimate the spatial extent of the different beds of interest. Species composition was determined for 11 Sargassum beds and seasonal variations were investigated for four representative beds over an 18 month period using quadrats and transects. Relationships between surface cover and biomass were estimated from seasonal field data sets. Finally, four methods requiring variable levels of sampling effort were designed to estimate the total biomass at the scale of each bed, considering (or not) the specific composition, and spatial and temporal variations. Seven Sargassaceae species were identified. Mean surface cover (24.4-51.6%) and total biomass [3.4-1,461.9 t dry matter (DM)] varied widely between beds. Overall, biomass temporal variations were not significantly different, but species-level variations seemed to be bed-specific. The extent of the 11 beds was 9 km(2); their total biomass was estimated and compared using each of the four methods, and the most precise method provided an estimate of 2,900 t DM. This study demonstrates a way of characterising Sargassum beds, efficiently and on a large scale, using a combination of remotely sensed and in situ data. These methods should be useful for possible future biomonitoring of Sargassum beds in New Caledonia, and in other areas worldwide.

Utility of shallow-water ATRIS images in defining biogeologic processes and self-similarity in skeletal Scleractinia, Florida reefs	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A recently developed remote-sensing instrument acquires high-quality digital photographs in shallow-marine settings within water depths of 15 m. The technology, known as the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System, provides remarkably clear, georeferenced imagery that allows visual interpretation of benthic class (substrates, organisms) for mapping coral reef habitats, as intended, Unforeseen, however, are functions new to the initial technologic purpose: interpretable evidence for real-time biogeologic processes and for perception of scaled-up skeletal self-similarity of scleractinian microstructure. Florida reef sea trials lacked the grid structure required to map contiguous habitat and submarine topography. Thus, only general observations could be made relative to times and sites of imagery. Degradation of corals was nearly universal; absence of reef fish was profound. However, similar to 1% of more than 23,600 sea-trial images examined provided visual evidence for local environs and processes. Clarity in many images was so exceptional that small tracks left by organisms traversing fine-grained carbonate sand were visible. Other images revealed a compelling sense, not Yet fully understood, of the microscopic wall structure characteristic of scleractinian Corals. Conclusions drawn from classifiable images are that demersal marine animals, where imaged, are oblivious to the equipment and that the technology has strong capabilities beyond mapping habitat. Imagery acquired along predetermined transects that cross a variety of geomorphic features within depth limits will (1) facilitate construction of accurate contour maps of habitat and bathymetry without need for ground-truthing, (2) contain a strong geologic component of interpreted real-time processes as they relate to imaged topography and regional geomorphology, and (3) allow cost-effective monitoring of regional- an local-scale changes in an ecosystem by use of existing-image global-positioning system coordinates to re-image areas. Details revealed in the modern setting have taphonomic implications for what is often found in the geologic record.																	0749-0208					SEP	2008	24	5					1320	1338		10.2112/08-1049.1								WOS:000259385500021

Quantification of two decades of shallow-water coral reef habitat decline in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary using Landsat data (1984-2002)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The loss of coral reef habitats has been witnessed at a global scale including in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. In addition to field surveys that can be spatially limited, remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of the changes occurring on coral reef habitats. Here, we utilize an 18-year time series of Landsat 5/TM and 7/ETM+ images to assess changes in eight coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, namely Carysfort Reef, Grecian Rocks, Molasses Reef, Conch Reef, Sombrero Reef, Looe Key Reef, Western Sambo and Sand Key Reef. Twenty-eight Landsat images (1984-2002) were used, with imagery gathered every 2 years during spring, and every 6 years during fall. The image dataset was georectified, calibrated to remote sensing reflectance and corrected for atmospheric and water-column effects. A Mahalanobis distance classification was trained for four habitat classes ('coral', 'sand', 'bare hardbottom' and 'covered hardbottom') using in situ ground-truthing data collected in 2003-2004 and using the spectral statistics from a 2002 image. The red band was considered useful only for benthic habitats in depths less than 6 m. Overall mean coral habitat loss for all sites classified by Landsat was 61% (3.4%/year), from a percentage habitat cover of 19% (1984) down to 7.6% (2002). The classification results for the eight different sites were critically reviewed. A detailed pixel by pixel examination of the spatial patterns across time suggests that the results range from ecologically plausible to unreliable due to spatial inconsistencies and/or improbable ecological successions. In situ monitoring data acquired by the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) for the eight reef sites between 1996 and 2002 showed a loss in coral cover of 52% (8.7%/year), whereas the Landsat-derived coral habitat areas decreased by 37% (6.2%/year). A direct trend comparison between the entire CREMP percent coral cover data set (1996-2004) and the entire Landsat-derived coral habitat areas showed no significant difference between the two time series (ANCOVA; F-test, p = 0.303, n = 32), despite the different scales of measurements.

Regional-scale seagrass habitat mapping in the Wider Caribbean region using Landsat sensors: Applications to conservation and ecology	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems. The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, through retrospective research scientists can approach and understand ecosystem changes. This contributes to the fundamental understanding of both human-induced and natural dynamics in ecosystems worldwide. This also holds for fast changing coastal areas with mangrove ecosystems, which are important for biodiversity, for coastal protection, and for the daily livelihood of millions of people in tropical coastal developing countries. In addition, retrospective research generates a basis for predictions that can be used early on to protect an ecosystem. In attempting to protect ecosystems from adverse human-induced change and destruction, and to manage them for sustainability, scientists are only beginning to investigate and understand natural ecosystem dynamics. It is important and advisable to gather, combine and analyse all possible data that allow a researcher to look back in time. This paper reviews the available retrospective methods, and highlights the transdisciplinary way (i.e. combination between basic and applied sciences on one hand, and social and human sciences on the other) in which retrospective research on a scale between months and centuries can be carried out, but it also includes methods on larger scales that may be marginally relevant. The paper particularly emphasizes the lack of transdisciplinary (not interdisciplinary) integration between sciences in retrospective research on mangrove forests in the past. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Seagrass mapping in the northern Gulf of Mexico using airborne hyperspectral imagery: A comparison of classification methods	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Mapping areas of seagrass is important, in part because the extent of seagrass habitat can serve as a general indicator of coastal ecosystem health. While aerial photography and multispectral imagery have commonly been used to map seagrass, digital hyperspectral imagery is at the forefront of current mapping technology in many natural resource applications. In this study, HyMap hyperspectral imagery at 2.9-m resolution was used to map seagrass distribution off Horn Island, Mississippi, and estimate its areal coverage. Seagrass beds and sand-bottom classes were defined based on visual interpretation of the imagery coupled with field observations. Image spectra were sampled for each class in three water-depth zones determined by distance from shore. Supervised image classifications were performed using maximum likelihood, minimum distance to means, and spectral angle mapper methods to compare relative accuracies in mapping seagrass coverage. The maximum likelihood classification produced the highest overall accuracy of 83%. The spectral angle mapper yielded the lowest accuracy due to the predominant influence of water-column optical properties on the apparent spectral characteristics of seagrass and sand bottom. The ML classification indicated total seagrass coverage of 107 ha. This compared favorably with the results of a separate, independent study based on aerial photography acquired 1 day after the HyMap flyover. For tracking seagrass coverage in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the mapping of individual seagrass patches at a spatial resolution of at least 3 m is recommended.

To investigate this question, hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, turbidity and chlorophyll pigment concentration were measured in three coral reef lagoons. The three sites enabled us to get data over very diverse environments: oligotrophic and sediment-poor waters in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia, eutrophic waters in the Cienfuegos Bay (Cuba), and sediment-rich waters in the Laucala Bay (Fiji). In this paper, optical algorithms for turbidity are presented per site based on 113 stations in New Caledonia, 24 stations in Cuba and 56 stations in Fiji. Empirical algorithms are tested at satellite wavebands useful to coastal applications. Global algorithms are also derived for the merged data set (193 stations). The performances of global and local regression algorithms are compared. The best one-band algorithms on all the measurements are obtained at 681 nm using either a polynomial or a power model. The best two-band algorithms are obtained with R412/R620, R443/R670 and R510/R681. Two three-band algorithms based on Rrs620. Rrs681/Rrs412 and Rrs620. Rrs681/Rrs510 also give fair regression statistics. Finally, we propose a global algorithm based on one or three bands: turbidity is first calculated from Rrs681 and then, if < 1 FTU, it is recalculated using an algorithm based on Rrs620. Rrs681/Rrs412. On our data set, this algorithm is suitable for the 0.2-25 FTU turbidity range and for the three sites sampled (mean bias: 3.6 %, rms: 35%, mean quadratic error: 1.4 FTU). This shows that defining global empirical turbidity algorithms in tropical coastal waters is at reach.

Preface: High spatial resolutionremote sensing for environmental monitoring and management	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												This special feature in the journal of Spatial Science brings together a collection of papers showing environmental monitoring and management applications of high spatial resolution remotely sensed image data. As illustrated by the papers in this special feature, and a growing number of papers in ecology, environmental management and remote sensing journals (Butler, 2006; Mumby et aL, 2001; Zanoni and Goward, 2003), there is an increasing need for spatial information derived from multi-spectral sensors at the scales of traditional aerial photography. The application of moderate spatial resolution image data has produced limited results for mapping and monitoring small features (< 10 m) within terrestrial and aquatic habitats, Such as individual tree crowns and their associated biophysical variables, coral reef structures and seagrass distribution. With nominal spatial resolutions less than 5 m x 5 m, there now exists the capacity to acquire fully radiometrically and geometrically corrected data to map and monitor complex structures and patterns of small features. High spatial resolution airborne and satellite digital image sources in various forms are now easily obtainable for agencies responsible for monitoring natural and built environments. Spatial data, including airborne and satellite images, are globally accessible thanks to Virtual Globes, such as GoogleEarth and Microsoft's Virtual Earth. Organisations responsible for managing natural and built environments are now faced with choices of how to transform these data into management-relevant spatial information. Many standard per-pixel based approaches developed for moderate spatial resolution image data do not work on single- or multidate high spatial resolution image data, and it is not efficient to subject these data to visual interpretation. The papers presented in this special issue illustrate a variety of approaches developed to address some of these challenges in terrestrial and aquatic environments.

The 2005 coral-bleaching event Roatan (Honduras): Use of pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) in satellite assessments	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Radiometric normalisation is a necessary precursor to detecting coral-bleaching from a time series of imagery. Using IKONOS and QuickBird, the pseudo-invariant-feature (PIF) approach was assessed, and found that small subsets and land-based PIFs lead to erroneous normalisation. In comparison, favourable results were achieved by using benthic sand and deep water subsets, coupled to a sun-deglint process. Furthermore, it was found the more traditional strategy of 'difference imaging' to be compromised by slight spatial alignment errors between image sets. Our alternative approach, based on spectral radiance, ably discerned significant brightening of areas of seafloor populated by dense stands of Acropora, corroborating the Occurrence of a documented bleaching event.

J	Andrefouet, S				Andrefouet, S.			Coral reef habitat mapping using remote sensing: A user vs producer perspective. Implications for research, management and capacity building	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Remote sensing is a tool that shows its real power and value for large-scale work. However, published coral reef applications often still focus on spatially limited pilot sites which are investigated for research purposes, while synoptic, reliable and thematically rich habitat maps are in growing demand everywhere around the Planet for a variety of applications. The observed failure in widespread generalization is primarily due to differences in the criteria that scientists (producers) and managers (users) have to obey in their respective professional activities. To enhance the situation and promote mass production of habitat maps, especially in a capacity building context, the traditional producer's habitat mapping flow chart is challenged and compared with a user's flow chart that has been repeatedly applied to high resolution images for a variety of recent management projects. The user's flow chart is a drastic simplification of the producer's chart. It conforms to different principles, in the search for representativity and specificity and thus exhaustivity. The habitat maps done respecting these principles provide a spectacular increase in the ratio habitat complexity/accuracy that was previously the norm. However, in addition to basic knowledge on a limited set of . image processing techniques, the user's chart implies that practitioners in both developed and developing countries also acquire. expertise in recognizing coral reef structures to be able to take advantage of the empirical but efficient a priori contextual editing techniques. The proposed user's flow chart should be promoted by funding agencies for capacity building in order to quickly fill the current gaps in reliable geographical data.																	1449-8596	1836-5655				JUN	2008	53	1					113	129		10.1080/14498596.2008.9635140								WOS:000258303000011

This requires understanding patterns of coral's susceptibility to thermal stress and how coral communities will change with the environmental variables associated with climate change. This study combined surface currents, wind velocity; sea surface temperature (SST), UV radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and chlorophyll-a concentration for the western Indian ocean and known relationships with coral bleaching and mortality to derive predictor variables that correlate with thermal stress. SST variability, W maximum temperature and wind speed had the highest influence on susceptibility estimates. Two susceptibility models were developed using Spatial Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and cosine amplitude-AHP methods and a fuzzy logic technique for integrating environmental variables into a measure of susceptibility. Susceptibility models identified regional gradients in environmental stress, with the north-western Indian Ocean and some central Indian Ocean islands as high and the southern African coastline and islands east of Madagascar as low vulnerability regions. Half of the strictly no take zones in the region are situated in locations with medium to high susceptibility. Future studies using high-resolution data can better estimate the vulnerability of specific locations and the establishment of marine protected areas where coral reef diversity is more likely to persist through climate change.

It has been suggested that Abrolhos reefs (Brazil/South-West Atlantic) are subjected to a steady coastal influence, although there is still little information regarding this assumption. In this work, we have analyzed a set of environmental parameters concerning sedimentation characteristics at the Abrolhos reefs, near 18 degrees S-39 degrees W. The analysis included remote sensing, model and in situ data to provide a three-dimensional quantitative description of the processes that influence sediment apportionment to the reefs. Mineralogy and natural radioactivity of sediment trapped at three reef sites in a transect perpendicular to the coastline were used in conjunction with numerical weather prediction model and remote sensing databases. We have observed an increase of around 100% of sediment flux during the summer compared to the winter season. A comparison of regional rainfall regime, sediment plume dynamics and a year-around monitoring of polar fronts trajectories and surface wind showed that the wind-driven resedimentation due to polar front activity is the major contributor to the intensification of sedimentation processes at the offshore area of Abrolhos reefs, despite river runoff from mainland.

J	Prates-Clark, CD; Saatchi, SS; Agosti, D				Prates-Clark, Cassia Da Conceicao; Saatchi, Sassan S.; Agosti, Donat			Predicting geographical distribution models of high-value timber trees in the Amazon Basin using remotely sensed data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Species distribution models were developed for three high economic value timber trees (Calophyllum brasiliensis, Carapa quianensis and Virola surinamensis) that are heavily harvested in the Amazon Basin. A combination of habitat measurements extracted from remote sensing data (MODIS, QSCAT and SRTM) and bioclimatic surfaces was examined to ascertain the most influential factors determining the occurrence of these tree species. The prediction of species' occurrence rates was tested separately for each species distribution model and the results were examined for their ability to accurately map the spatial distribution of these tree species. By evaluating the omission and commission rates we concluded that species distribution models based on remote sensing data contributed significantly in quantifying environmental properties used to summarize the ecological niche of each tree species. Specific vegetation characteristics (such as percentage of tree cover, vegetation moisture and roughness, annual NDVI and mean LAI during the dry LAI) showed the dependence of these species' occurrence in more densely vegetated forests. Areas with high leaf area (even during the dry months) and areas with high vegetation moisture were predicted as potential species habitat for C. brasiliensis. The density vegetation during the dry season and vegetation phenology were strongly correlated with climate differences, such as variations in air temperature and precipitation seasonality for V surinamensis. Lower elevation areas with more exuberant vegetation and a high greenness index were among the most important factors accounting for the geographical distribution of C. guianensis. Species distribution models are increasingly important in many fields of research and conservation. The potential of remotely sensed data to monitor environmental changes in tropical areas, along with the understanding of ecosystem function, are both critical for conservation of biodiversity and the long-term process of sustaining ecosystems.

ReefTemp: An interactive monitoring system for coral bleaching using high-resolution SST and improved stress predictors	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Anomalously high sea surface temperatures (SST) have led to repeated mass coral bleaching events on a global scale. Existing satellite-based systems used to monitor conditions conducive to bleaching are based on low-resolution (0.5 degrees, similar to 50 km) SST data. While these systems have served the research and management community well, they have inherent weaknesses that limit their capacity to predict stress on coral reefs at local scales, over which bleaching severity is known to vary dramatically. Here we discuss the development and testing of ReefTemp, a new operational remote sensing application for the Great Barrier Reef that assesses bleaching risk daily using: high-resolution ( 2 km) SST, regionally validated thermal stress indices, and color-graded legends directly related to past observations of bleaching severity. Given projections of sea temperature rise, ReefTemp is timely as it can accurately predict bleaching severity at a local scale and therefore help to give focus to future research and monitoring efforts.

Coral reef benthic productivity based on optical absorptance and light-use efficiency	CORAL REEFS												In the interest of determining productivity across a range of spatial scales (meters to many kilometers) and in different reef environments, this paper proposes a technique for measuring productivity based on remote sensing of optical absorptance and light-use efficiency. The concept is straightforward: gross primary production equals plant-incident irradiance multiplied by plant absorptance multiplied by the plant's light-use efficiency (GPP = E (d) A epsilon). Both E (d) and A are derivable from various remote sensing data sources, thus the approach is feasible. This paper presents a demonstration of the application for Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, HI based on Quickbird satellite imagery and SHOALS LIDAR data. E (d) is modeled at every point in the image, and the image itself is inverted to provide A. Organismal-scale epsilon reported in the literature is taken as a surrogate for community-scale epsilon. The resulting GPP image compares well with the range of GPP values for reef-flats in general, as well as the distribution and range of GPP for Kaneohe Bay in particular. Though results likely can be improved by using spectral imagery and more accurate values for epsilon, this concept study demonstrates the tractability of this approach for measuring coral reef GPP.																	0722-4028					MAR	2008	27	1					49	59		10.1007/s00338-007-0289-8								WOS:000252767200007

Predictability of reef fish diversity and abundance using remote sensing data in Diego Garcia (Chagos Archipelago)	CORAL REEFS												The diversity, abundance and distribution of reef fish are related to heterogeneity and physical complexity of benthic habitat. However, the field effort required to evaluate these aspects of the benthos in situ, at the scale of entire reefscapes, is greatly constrained by logistical and resource limitations. With moderate ground truthing, both substratum type and seabed topography are amenable to monitoring using satellite data. Here, remote sensing imagery was used to resolve the bathymetry and benthic character of a reef system in Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territory). Replicate fish counts were made at seven measurement stations across the study area using visual census. Monte Carlo simulation revealed that species richness and abundance of several guilds and size groupings of reef fish appraised in situ were correlated with the satellite-derived seabed parameters over areas of seafloor as large as 5,030 m(2). The study suggests that satellite remote sensing is capable of predicting habitat complexity at a scale relevant to fish. Furthermore, as larger size classes of fish were better predicted with the satellite habitat complexity data, this technique could be used to predict fish stocks and identify potential sites for marine protected areas where intensive field surveys are not practical.

Remotely-sensed chlorophyll a data therefore provide a framework to investigate the primary patterns of biological activity in this oceanic basin. Monthly chlorophyll a data from the 8-year Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View sensor (SeaWiFS) mission, and data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were analyzed with the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) online data analysis system "Giovanni". The data indicate that despite the normal low chlorophyll a concentrations (0.1-0.2 mg m(-3)) in these oligotrophic waters, there is a characteristic seasonal bloom in March-April in the northernmost open Red Sea (24 degrees to 27.5 degrees N) concurrent with minimum sea surface temperature. The location of the highest chlorophyll concentrations is consistent with a linear box model [Eshel, G., and Naik, N.H., 1997. Climatological coastal jet collision, intermediate water formation, and the general circulation of the Red Sea. J. Phys. Oceanogr. 27(7), 1233-1257.] of Red Sea circulation. Two years in the data set exhibited a different seasonal cycle consisting of a relatively weak northern spring bloom and elevated chlorophyll concentrations to the south (21.5 degrees to 24 degrees N). The data also indicate that large coral reef complexes may be sources of either nutrients or chlorophyll-rich detritus and sediment, enhancing chlorophyll a concentration in waters adjacent to the reefs.

The role of digital bathymetry in mapping shallow marine vegetation from hyperspectral image data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Hyperspectral remote sensing is a proven technology for measurement of coastal ocean colour, including sea-bed mapping in optically shallow waters. Using hyperspectral imagery of shallow (<15m deep) sea bed acquired with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-550), we examined how changes in the spatial resolution of bathymetric grids, created from sonar data (echosounding) and input to conventional image classifiers, affected the accuracy of distributional maps of invasive (Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides) and native (kelp) seaweeds off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The addition of a low-resolution bathymetric grid, interpolated from soundings by the Canadian Hydrographic Service, improved the overall classification accuracies by up to similar to 10%. However, increasing the bathymetric resolution did not increase the accuracy of classification maps produced with the supervised (Maximum Likelihood) classifier as shown by a slightly lower accuracy (2%) when using an intermediate-resolution bathymetric grid interpolated from soundings with a recreational fish finder. Supervised classifications using the first three eigenvectors from a principal-components analysis were consistently more accurate (by at least 27%) than unsupervised (K-means classifier) schemes with similar data compression. With an overall accuracy of 76%, the most reliable scheme was a supervised classification with low-resolution bathymetry. However, the supervised approach was particularly sensitive, and variations in accuracy of 2% resulted in overestimations of up to 53% in the extent of C. fragile and kelp. The use of a passive optical bathymetric algorithm to derive a high-resolution bathymetric grid from the CASI data showed promise, although fundamental differences between this grid and those created with the sonar data limited the conclusions. The bathymetry (at any spatial resolution) appeared to improve the accuracy of the classifications both by reducing the confusion among the spectral classes and by removing noise in the image data. Variations in the accuracy of depth estimates and inescapable positional inaccuracies in the imagery and ground data largely accounted for the observed differences in the classification accuracies. This study provides the first detailed demonstration of the advantages and limitations of integrating digital bathymetry with hyperspectral data for the mapping of benthic assemblages in optically shallow waters.

Mapping of coral reefs using hyperspectral CASI data; a case study: Fordata, Tanimbar, Indonesial	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Airborne remote sensing with a CASI-550 sensor has been used to map the benthic coverage and the bottom topography of the Pulau Nukaha coral reef located in the Tanimbar Archipelago (Southeast Moluccas, Eastern Indonesia). The image classification method adopted was performed in three steps. Firstly, five geomorphological reef components were identified using a supervised spectral angle mapping algorithm in combination with data collected during the field survey, i.e. benthic cover type, percentage cover and depth. Secondly, benthic cover mapping was performed for each of the five geomorphological components separately using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm followed by class aggregation using both spectral and spatial information. Finally, 16 benthic cover classes could be labelled using the benthic cover data collected during the field survey. The overall classification accuracy, calculated on the biological diverse fore reef, was 73% with a kappa coefficient of 0.63. A reliable bathymetric model (up to a depth of 15m) of the Pulau Nukaha reef was also obtained using a semi-analytical radiative transfer model. When compared with independent in-situ depth measurements, the result proved relatively accurate (mean residual error: -0.9m) and was consistent with the seabed topography (Pearson correlation coefficient: 86%).																	0143-1161						2008	29	8					2359	2391		10.1080/01431160701408469								WOS:000254348100012

Satellite remote sensing of spratly islands using SAR	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Spratly Islands, located in the southern part of the South China Sea (SCS), consist of more than 100 small islands, coral reefs and banks. Remote sensing is the only way to obtain a synoptic view of all of the islands in such a large area. It has been demonstrated that satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a very powerful tool for monitoring meso-scale and small-scale ocean processes in a large area. In this study, satellite SAR images were used to study the ocean environment in the area of Spratly Islands. The aim was to understand the capability of satellite remote sensing to monitor ocean processes and provide information for future field studies. Two sets of high-resolution European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS)-2 SAR images over the entire Spratly Islands area were collected in April and December 2005. The ocean features were identified/extracted from the SAR images to overlay the bathymetric map for comparison. Some case studies of SAR mapping on Spratly Islands are described and issues regarding existing navigation charts are discussed.																	0143-1161						2008	29	21					6427	6436		10.1080/01431160802175405								WOS:000260326200027

Coral reef communities, habitats, and substrates in and near sanctuary zones of Ningaloo Marine Park	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												As Australia's longest fringing reef, Ningaloo Reef lies close to the mainland of northwest Australia in an area of high tourism potential. The establishment of sanctuary zones in and around the northern Ningaloo Marine Park has necessitated improvements in understanding of the biodiversity and distribution of habitats and substrates in the reef lagoon, its seaward barrier, and the adjacent shelf environments. Using a combination of video transects in forereef-to-shelf environments, global positioning system-controlled ground-truthing of colour satellite images, and aerial photography for shallow lagoon settings, 16 habitat types were identified and mapped regionally. Lagoon substrates described in previous reconnaissance were mapped here in greater detail, and some of the first data on poorly known forereef and shelf communities have been analysed from the video transects. There is a strong correlation between reef morphology, inherited substrate type, and coral communities across reef lagoons and their associated barriers, where an energy gradient controlled by wave-driven and tidal circulation in reef flat and lagoon environments is reflected in the distribution and cover of robust to more delicate coral communities. Morphological controls are less distinct in island-associated habitats, where increased turbidity, differing wave energy, and more variable topography result in higher substrate variability and increasing soft coral communities. The data obtained in this study provide a background for management of biodiversity and monitoring of future impacts in some of the sanctuary zones likely to experience increased use in the northern Ningaloo Reef.

J	Holden, H; LeDrew, E				Holden, Heather; LeDrew, Ellsworth			An examination of variability in vertical radiometric profiles in a coral reef environment	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A significant challenge to remote sensing of submerged ecosystems in the littoral zone is correcting the signal received at the sensor for the complex and variable effects of the water column. Remote sensing scientists often assume that the optical properties of a scene do not vary horizontally and thus assume that a single attenuation coefficient can be applied for water column correction. The validity of this assumption is tested in this case study. Multispectral vertical water column profiles were collected in the field with a dropsonde radiometer to examine the wavelength-specific behaviour of light in a tropical coral reef environment with variable water depths and bottom types. Cluster analysis results indicated that on a wavelength-specific basis, the majority (no less than 70%) of both the downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance profiles can be categorized as one cluster, indicating that the assumption of horizontal consistency is valid. ANOVA revealed that significant variability in downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance attenuation coefficients is explained by water depth when bottom type remains constant. Conversely, ANOVA also revealed that insignificant variability is explained by change in bottom type when water depth remains constant.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2008	24	1					224	231		10.2112/05-0446.1								WOS:000252592600021

Marine and coastal applications in landscape ecology	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Landscape ecology traditionally has been limited to the study of terrestrial systems; however, the questions and methods defining the science are equally relevant for marine and coastal systems. The reciprocal relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes and the overarching effect of scale on this relationship was being explored in some marine and coastal settings as the general discipline of landscape ecology was evolving throughout the latter two decades of the last century. As with all components of the biosphere, an understanding of these relationships is critical for successful management of marine and coastal systems. In these systems, widely dispersed field or ship-based observations and lack of broad scale data have historically precluded quantification of large-scale patterns and processes and hindered management efforts. However, relatively recent advances in geographic information systems, remote sensing and computer technologies have begun to address these issues and are now permitting assessments of pattern and process in oceans. The intent of this special issue is to highlight research that is adapting the tools of landscape ecology to answer ecological questions within marine and coastal systems, to address the unique challenges faced in these landscapes, and to stimulate an exchange of ideas and solutions to common problems. Inspiration for this special issue of Landscape Ecology began with a special session on "Marine and Coastal Applications in Landscape Ecology" that was held at the 19th Annual Symposium of the United States Regional Association of the International Association for Landscape Ecology, March 31-April 2, 2004 in Las Vegas, Nevada.																	0921-2973						2008	23			1			1	5		10.1007/s10980-007-9141-3								WOS:000252922800001

Ontogenetic patterns of habitat use by reef-fish in a Marine Protected Area network: a multi-scaled remote sensing and in situ approach	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) on the west coast of the island of Hawaii (West Hawaii) has been shown to vary in its effectiveness to replenish depleted aquarium fish stocks. To determine the abundance and distribution of habitats needed to better design and manage MPAs in Hawaii, underwater video transects, remote sensing data and a benthic classification scheme were combined to develop a map of reef habitats previously identified as important to the life history of aquarium fish and other reef species. Using these maps, an assessment was conducted to quantify habitat use by different life history stages of the most commonly live-caught aquarium fish, the yellow tang Zebrasoma flavescens, in existing MPAs. Rugosity, small reef features (i.e. percent cover of dominant reef species) and the abundance and size of fish were quantified in 1 15 circular plots to determine the accuracy of mapping efforts and the distribution of fish life history stages across the reef in 4 MPAs. Visual classification and mapping of habitat types was 93% accurate and consistent with percent cover of substrates quantified at the quadrat level. The different life history stages of yellow tangs were distributed along distinct habitat types in all of the MPAs examined. New recruits and juveniles of the yellow tang showed similar patterns of habitat use among sites and were associating with coral-rich areas and patches of the finger coral Porites compressa. In contrast, the distribution and abundance of adults varied greatly within and among sites. The development of a ground-truthed habitat map allowed a holistic examination of habitat use by yellow tang, including most life history stages, which provides key information for the design of MPAs and the advancement of ecosystem-based management.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2008	365						217	232		10.3354/meps07492								WOS:000259379600019						
J	Houk, P; van Woesik, R				Houk, Peter; van Woesik, Robert			Dynamics of shallow-water assemblages in the Saipan Lagoon	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Saipan Lagoon (Northern Mariana Islands) was first examined for benthic composition and habitat distribution in the late 1940s. Here, we employ a 4-stage approach to evaluate and explain change in the distribution of the 9 habitats previously demarcated. We show that there have been considerable reductions in seagrass, staghorn Acropora, and Acropora palifera dominated habitats (-3.72, -1.26, and -1.37 km(2), respectively) that were replaced by 6.16 km(2) of sand (similar to 20% of the lagoon area). Multiple regressions showed that the spatial extent of Enhalus seagrass was positively related with, and best predicted by, the adjacent watershed area and lagoon width. Although the interaction was not as strong, Enhalus also increased in accordance with human development. The size of the Halodule seagrass and macroalgal habitat was negatively related to water-flow velocities and positively related to human development, while its integrity (i.e. the density of seagrass within a given habitat) decreased with human development. Taken together, the results suggest Enhalus and Halodule respond differently to proxies of watershed pollution, and contradict contemporary doctrine linking pollution with reduced seagrass density. This study found no relationship between offshore habitats and watershed characteristics, but suggests their expansion and contraction on relatively short time scales is a result of large-scale disturbances such as typhoons. We posit that, while habitat integrity can be altered by human disturbances, habitat identity is only altered under extreme conditions. In summary, this study advances habitat mapping by increasing resolution and accuracy, which, in turn, improves the texture at which reef ecology is used by management.																	0171-8630						2008	356						39	50		10.3354/meps07252								WOS:000254963900004

Determining the Influence of Seascape Structure on Coral Reef Fishes in Hawaii Using a Geospatial Approach	MARINE GEODESY					104th Annual Meeting of the Association-of-American-Geographers	APR 07, 2008	Boston, MA					We assessed the utility of several LIDAR-derived seascape metrics (e.g. depth, rugosity, slope, variance in depth) to determine which measures of the seascape demonstrated important relationships with fish assemblage structure and would ultimately serve as the best ecological criteria to advance predictive modeling of fish assemblages using remote sensing and GIS analysis. Variance in depth (within a 75 m radius) was the seascape metric that had the strongest relationships with most fish assemblage metrics, followed by depth and slope. Our results demonstrate the potential for using remotely sensed measures of the seascape to support predictive mapping and modeling of fish assemblages.

Fishers from Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, visually interpreted a Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral satellite image to identify shallow-water marine environments. Their assessments were used to direct a supervised classification of the image and create habitat maps with indigenously defined habitat classes. Results show that these participatory remote sensing techniques produce,accurate broad-scale marine habitat maps that can be useful to managers and decision makers. Participatory methods that draw from indigenous habitat definitions also have the potential benefit of generating new insights about socio-ecological processes and enhancing local acceptance and understanding of conservation projects by allowing stakeholders to actively contribute in management planning.

Bathymetry, water optical properties, and benthic classification of coral reefs using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery	CORAL REEFS												The complexity and heterogeneity of shallow coastal waters over small spatial scales provides a challenging environment for mapping and monitoring benthic habitats using remote sensing imagery. Additionally, changes in coral reef community structure are occurring on unprecedented temporal scales that require large-scale synoptic coverage and monitoring of coral reefs. A variety of sensors and analyses have been employed for monitoring coral reefs: this study applied a spectrum-matching and look-up-table methodology to the analysis of hyperspectral imagery of a shallow coral reef in the Bahamas. In unconstrained retrievals the retrieved bathymetry was on average within 5% of that measured acoustically, and 92% of pixels had retrieved depths within 25% of the acoustic depth. Retrieved absorption coefficients had less than 20% errors observed at blue wavelengths. The reef scale benthic classification derived by analysis of the imagery was consistent with the percent cover of specific coral reef habitat classes obtained by conventional line transects over the reef, and the inversions were robust as the results were similar when the benthic classification retrieval was constrained by measurements of bathymetry or water column optical properties. These results support the use of calibrated hyperspectral imagery for the rapid determination of bathymetry, water optical propel-ties, and the classification of important habitat classes common to coral reefs.																	0722-4028					DEC	2007	26	4					819	829		10.1007/s00338-007-0271-5								WOS:000251579300011

Spatial predictability of juvenile fish species richness and abundance in a coral reef environment	CORAL REEFS												Juvenile reef fish communities represent an essential component of coral reef ecosystems in the current focus of fish population dynamics and coral reef resilience. Juvenile fish survival depends on habitat characteristics and is, following settlement, the first determinant of the number of individuals within adult populations. The goal of this study was to provide methods for mapping juvenile fish species richness and abundance into spatial domains suitable for micro and meso-scale analysis and management decisions. Generalized Linear Models predicting juvenile fish species richness and abundance were developed according to spatial and temporal environmental variables measured from 10 m up to 10 kin in the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia. The statistical model was further spatially generalized using a 1.5-m resolution, independently created, remotely sensed, habitat map. This procedure revealed that : (1) spatial factors at 10 to 100-m scale explained up to 71% of variability in juvenile species richness, (2) a small improvement (75%) was gained when a combination of environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales was used and (3) the coupling of remotely sensed data, geographical information system tools and point-based ecological data showed that the highest species richness and abundance were predicted along a narrow margin overlapping the coral reef flat and adjacent seagrass beds. Spatially explicit models of species distribution may be relevant for the management of reef communities when strong relationships exist between faunistic and environmental variables and when models are built at appropriate scales.

J	Stambler, N; Shashar, N				Stambler, Noga; Shashar, Nadav			Variation in spectral reflectance of the hermatypic corals, Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora damicornis	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Reflectance spectra were measured off pink and brown color morphs of the branching hermatypic corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora damicornis in the northern Red Sea. Results showed that though some of the brown morphs were identical between coral species, other brown morphs were found only in S. pistillata corals. Reflectance of pink morphs differed between these two species, possibly due to differences in Pocilloporin pigments between them. Spectral variation between color morphs was higher than between species, and corals could exhibit both colors in the same colony. These results show that species recognition based on reflectance spectra is possible in some cases, yet it may be limited to specific color morphs or to discrimination between a small numbers of well-described coral species.

An integrated study for the assessment of tsunami impacts: A case study of South Andaman Island, India using remote sensing and GIS	COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The December 26, 2004 tsunami has caused extensive damage in the Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, India, affecting 115.36 km of coastline. In order to identify the impacts of tsunami in South Andaman of the Andaman Islands, the study has been carried out using satellite data for pre-tsunami (Feb. 2003) and post-tsunami (March 2005). This paper provides an assessment of damages caused by tsunami and suitable resettlement places for the people using remote sensing and GIS technology. Assessment of tsunami inflicted damage to island ecosystems assumes greater importance owing to their life-sustaining and livelihood support abilities. Apart from the reparation caused to life and property, significant damage has afficted the ecosystem, which will have long lasting effects. The tsunami-induced damage to coastal ecosystems was studied based on coastal landuse, geomorphology and coastal critical habitat for South Andaman Island using remote sensing and GIS. An area of 3,366 ha of land area was affected by tsunami. Within the coastal ecosystem, coral reef and mangrove were also severely affected. The study of landforms shows that the land is submerged. The severity of damages and their consequences suggest the need for a definite restoration ecology programme.

Enhancing the detection and classification of coral reef and associated benthic habitats: A hyperspectral remote sensing approach	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Coral reefs and associated benthic habitats are heterogeneous in nature. A remote sensor designed to discriminate these environments requires a high number of narrow, properly placed bands which are not currently available in existing satellite sensors. Optical hyperspectral sensors mounted on aerial platforms seem to be appropriate for overcoming the lack of both high spectral and spatial resolution of satellite sensors. This research presents results of an innovative coral reef application by such a sensor. Using hyperspectral Airborne Imaging Spectroradiometer for Applications (AISA) Eagle data, the approach presented solves the confounding influence of water column attenuation on substrate reflectance on a per-pixel basis. The hyperspectral imagery was used in band ratio algorithms to derive water depth and water column optical properties (e. g., absorption and backscattering coefficients). The water column correction technique produced a bottom albedo image which revealed that the dark regions comprised of sea grasses and benthic algae had albedo values approximate to 15%, whereas sand- and coral-dominated areas had albedos > 30% and approximate to 15-35%, respectively. The retrieved bottom albedo image was then used to classify the benthos, generating a detailed map of benthic habitats, followed by accuracy assessment.																	0148-0227					AUG 24	2007	112	C8							C08014	10.1029/2006JC003892								WOS:000249032100001

Conservation management of these precious ecosystems relies on accurate and up-to-date information about ecosystem health and the distribution of species and habitats, but such information can be costly to gather and interpret in the field. Remote sensing has proven capable of collecting information on geomorphologic zones and substrate types for coral reef environments, and is cost-effective when information is needed for large areas. Remote sensing-based mapping of coral habitat variables known to influence biodiversity has only recently been undertaken and new sensors and improved data processing show great potential in this area. This paper reviews coral reef biodiversity, the influence of habitat variables on its local spatial distribution, and the potential for remote sensing to produce maps of these habitat variables, thus indirectly mapping coral reef biodiversity and fulfilling information needs of coral reef managers.

J	Scopelitis, J; Andrefouet, S; Largouet, C				Scopelitis, Julie; Andrefouet, Serge; Largouet, Christine			Modelling coral reef habitat trajectories: Evaluation of an integrated timed automata and remote sensing approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The rapid degradation of many reefs worldwide calls for more effective monitoring and predictions of the trajectories of coral reef habitats as they cross cycles of disturbance and recovery. Current approaches include in situ monitoring, computer modelling, and remote sensing observations. We aimed to combine these three sources of information for Abore Reef in New Caledonia by using: (1) a generic timed automata model of reef habitat trajectories, (2) two high spatial resolution multispectral images acquired before and after hurricane Erika in a 2-year interval (March, 2003), and (3) extensive field data on Abore's benthic community structure. Field and remote sensing observations were used to verify model predictions of habitat evolution during the 2-year interval. We also tested whether a fairly generic model of habitat evolution can be used to flag local incorrect image change detection interpretation. The automaton manipulates objects such as states, transitions and clocks (transition times), and we found that it is possible, with expert knowledge, to describe complex habitat trajectories with this formalism. On Abore Reef, we analyzed 22 heterogeneous polygons mapped before and after hurricane Erika using a 36 habitat typology. We examined 75 trajectories suggested by the before-after image classifications and critically reviewed the benefits of the combined timed automata model-image approach. The Abore Reef case study confirms that this is a fruitful path to maximize the benefits of both tools, and minimize their respective drawbacks. However, we conclude that timed automata and remote sensing analysis need to be locally optimized to achieve useful results, and suggests further improvements by using hybrid models able to manipulate continuous, and fuzzy, properties.

Optimal scales to observe habitat dynamics: A coral reef example	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A new technique to estimate the characteristic length scales (CLSs) of real ecological systems provides an objective means to identify the optimal scale(s) of observation to best detect underlying dynamical trends. Application of the technique to natural systems has focused on identifying appropriate scales to measure the dynamics of species as descriptors of community and ecosystem dynamics. However, ecosystem monitoring is often based not on assessing single species, but on species assemblages, functional groups, or habitat types. We asked whether the concept of CLSs based on dynamic interactions among species could be extended to examine interactions among habitat types and thus to identify optimal scales for observing habitat dynamics. A time series of three spatial maps of benthic habitats on a Caribbean coral reef was constructed from aerial photographs, Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) images, and IKONOS satellite images, providing the short time sequence required for this technique. We estimated the CLS based on the dynamics of three distinct habitat types: dense stands of seagrass, sparse stands of seagrass, and Montastrea patch reefs. Despite notable differences in the areal extent of and relative change in these habitats over the 21-year observation period, analyses based on each habitat type indicated a similar CLS of similar to 300 m. We interpret the consistency of CLSs among habitats to indicate that the dynamics of the three habitat types are linked. The results are encouraging, and they indicate that CLS techniques can be used to identify the appropriate scale at which to monitor ecosystem trends on the basis of the dynamics of only one of a disparate suite of habitat types.

Coupling ecology and GIS to evaluate efficacy of marine protected areas in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In order to properly determine the efficacy of marine protected areas ( MPAs), a seascape perspective that integrates ecosystem elements at the appropriate ecological scale is necessary. Over the past four decades, Hawaii has developed a system of 11 Marine Life Conservation Districts ( MLCDs) to conserve and replenish marine resources around the state. Initially established to provide opportunities for public interaction with the marine environment, these MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning MPA design and function using multiple discrete sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the effficacy of existing MLCDs using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Analysis of benthic cover validated the a priori classification of habitat types and provided justification for using these habitat strata to conduct stratified random sampling and analyses of fish habitat utilization patterns. Results showed that a number of. sh assemblage characteristics (e.g., species richness, biomass, diversity) vary among habitat types, but were significantly higher in MLCDs compared with adjacent. shed areas across all habitat types. Overall. sh biomass was 2.6 times greater in the MLCDs compared to open areas. In addition, apex predators and other species were more abundant and larger in the MLCDs, illustrating the effectiveness of these closures in conserving fish populations within their boundaries. Habitat type, protected area size, and level of protection from. shing were all important determinates of MLCD effectiveness with respect to their associated. sh assemblages. Although size of these protected areas was positively correlated with a number of. sh assemblage characteristics, all appear too small to have any measurable influence on the adjacent. shed areas. These protected areas were not designed for biodiversity conservation or. sheries enhancement yet still provide varying degrees of protection for. sh populations within their boundaries. Implementing this type of biogeographic process, using remote sensing technology and sampling across the range of habitats present within the seascape, provides a robust evaluation of existing MPAs and can help to de. ne ecologically relevant boundaries for future MPA design in a range of locations.																	1051-0761					APR	2007	17	3					715	730		10.1890/06-0536								WOS:000245744500008	17494391

Hydrodynamic characteristics of a fringing coral reef on the east coast of Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan	CORAL REEFS												To investigate the characteristics of currents on a fringing coral reef, a field survey was conducted, mostly under weak wind conditions in summer, on the east coast of Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan, which is encompassed by well-developed fringing reefs. For the same study period, numerical simulations of the current were also performed using a shallow water turbulent flow model with high accuracy reef bathymetry data, which were estimated from high-resolution imagery obtained from satellite remote sensing. The numerical simulation results showed good agreement with the observed data and revealed that the currents have an appreciable magnitude of tide-averaged velocities, even during neap tides, which are governed mostly by wave set-up effects. The results also indicated that temporal variations in velocity and water surface elevation during a tide cycle in the reef exhibit highly asymmetrical patterns; in spring tides especially, the velocities around channels indicate rapid transitions over a short period from peak ebb flow to peak flood flow. The simulations also indicated that a big channel penetrating deeply into the reef attracts the tide-averaged mean flow, even from distant areas of the reef.

While most monitoring programs rely primarily on data collected in situ by trained divers, digital photographs and video are used increasingly to extract ecological indicators, provide a permanent visual record of reef condition, and reduce the time that divers spend underwater. In this study, we describe the development and application of a video-based reef survey methodology based on an algorithm for image registration and the estimation of image motion and camera trajectory. This technology was used to construct two-dimensional, spatially accurate, high-resolution mosaics of the reef benthos at a scale of up to 400 m(2). The mosaics were analyzed to estimate the size and percent cover of reef organisms and these ecological indicators of reef condition were compared to similar measurements collected by divers to evaluate the potential of the mosaics as monitoring tools. The ecological indicators collected by trained divers compared favorably with those measured directly from the video mosaics. Five out of the eight categories chosen (hard corals, octocorals, Palythoa, algal turf, and sand) showed no significant differences in percent cover based on survey method. Moreover, no significant differences based on survey method were found in the size of coral colonies. Lastly, the capability to extract the same reef location from mosaics collected at different times proved to be an important tool for documenting change in coral abundance as the removal of even small colonies (< 10 cm in diameter) was easily documented. The two-dimensional video mosaics constructed in this study can provide repeatable, accurate measurements on the reef-plot scale that can complement measurements on the colony-scale made by divers and surveys conducted at regional scales using remote sensing tools.

The ecosystem of corals is rich in biodiversity. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for categorizing coral reefs and is the most cost - effective approach for the large - scale reef survey. The Dongsha Atoll, more than 300 km(2) with an average depth of 10 m, is located at the northern continental margin of the South China Sea. It has been abused by destructive fishing during recent decades. Three satellite imageries (Quickbird2, ETM + and SPOT5) are used to evaluate the capabilities of SPOT5 imagery to provide data that are useful for categorizing the current distribution of coral reefs therein. During the data processing, unsupervised classification functions are adopted for ETM + and SPOT5 data, while the supervised classification method is used for Quickbird2. The classes are (or not) merged into coral reef, and then will be operated by vectorization, simplification, and topological analysis. There are 1 331 coral reefs larger than 100 m(2) with a detection limit of 3 x 3 pixels at the multi - band data of Quickbird2, which is taken as the comparison baseline. The results extracted from SPOT5 and ETM images are less in number and area than those from the Quickbird2 image, whereas the results from SPOT5 data are better than those of ETM data at the silty lagoon due to its higher resolution. SPOT5 XS band 2 fails to distinguish the deep substrate inside the atoll compared with ETM data because of its poor penetration capability. Only SPOT XS band 1 cannot be used to differentiate coral reef from sand bottom. Merging the SPOT5 multi - bands data with the spatial resolution of SPOT5 pan - data and referring to ETM imagery are expected to provide an optimal satellite - based approach for mapping of coral reefs.																	0253-505X						2007	26	2					26	35										WOS:000246032600003

Wayne			Relationships between reef fish communities and remotely sensed rugosity measurements in Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The realization that coral reef ecosystem management must occur across multiple spatial scales and habitat types has led scientists and resource managers to seek variables that are easily measured over large areas and correlate well with reef resources. Here we investigate the utility of new technology in airborne laser surveying (NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL)) in assessing topographical complexity (rugosity) to predict reef fish community structure on shallow (< 10 m deep) patch reefs. Marine portions of Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, were surveyed remotely using the EAARL, and reef fish populations were visually surveyed on 10 patch reefs at independent, randomly selected stations (n = 10-13 per reef). Rugosity at each station was assessed in situ by divers using the traditional chain-transect method (10-m scale), and remotely using the EAARL submarine topography data at multiple spatial scales (2, 5, and 10 m). The rugosity and biological datasets were analyzed together to elucidate the predictive power of EAARL rugosity in describing the variance in reef fish community variables and to assess the correlation between chain-transect and EAARL rugosity. EAARL rugosity was not well correlated with chain-transect rugosity, or with species richness of fishes (although statistically significant, the amount of variance explained by the model was very low). Variance in reef fish community attributes was better explained in reef-by-reef variability than by physical variables. However, once the reef-by-reef variability was taken into account in a two-way analysis of variance, the importance of rugosity could be seen on individual reefs. Fish species richness and abundance were statistically higher at high rugosity stations compared to medium and low rugosity stations, as predicted by prior ecological research. The EAARL shows promise as an important mapping tool for reef resource managers as they strive to inventory and protect coral reef resources.

Mapping the distribution of coral reefs and associated sublittoral habitats in Pacific Panama: a comparison of optical satellite sensors and classification methodologies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This research compared the ability of Landsat ETM+, Quickbird and three image classification methods for discriminating amongst coral reefs and associated habitats in Pacific Panama. Landsat ETM+ and Quickbird were able to discriminate coarse and intermediate habitat classes, but this was sensitive to classification method. Quickbird was significantly more accurate than Landsat (14% to 17%). Contextual editing was found to improve the user's accuracy of important habitats. The integration of object-oriented classification with non-spectral information in eCognition produced the most accurate results. This method allowed sufficiently accurate maps to be produced from Landsat, which was not possible using the maximum likelihood classifier. Object-oriented classification was up to 24% more accurate than the maximum likelihood classifier for Landsat and up to 17% more accurate for Quickbird. The research indicates that classification methodology should be an important consideration in coral reef remote sensing. An object-oriented approach to image classification shows potential for improving coral reef resource inventory.																	0143-1161						2007	28	22					5047	5070		10.1080/01431160701258062								WOS:000250358800007

Classification of benthic composition in a coral reef environment using spectral unmixing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing is being applied with increasing success in the evaluation and management of coral ecosystems. We demonstrate a successful application of hyperspectral image analysis of the benthic composition in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii using data acquired from NASA's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. We employ a multi-level approach, combining a semi-analytical inversion model with linear spectral unmixing, to extract information on the coral, algae and sand composition of each pixel. The unmixing model is based on the spectral characteristics of the dominant species and substrate types in Kaneohe Bay, and uses an optimization routine to mathematically invert the relationship of how each component spectrally interacts and mixes. The functional result is the ability to quantitatively classify individual pixel composition according to the percent contribution from each of three main reef components. Output compares favorably with available field measurements and habitat information for Kaneohe Bay, and the overall analysis illustrates the capacity to simultaneously derive information on water properties, bathymetry and habitat composition from hyperspectral remote sensing data. Further, the resulting spatial analysis capacity contributes an improved capability for monitoring coral ecosystems and an important basis for resource management decisions.																	1931-3195						2007	1								011501	10.1117/1.2815907								WOS:000260914300063

Evaluation of satellite remote sensing for operational monitoring of sediment plumes produced by dredging at Hay Point, Queensland, Australia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												This study describes the potential of multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the operational monitoring of sediment plume produced by dredging between 8 May and 31 October 2006 at Hay Point, Northern Queensland, Australia. The methodology involved atmospheric correction of the TM, ETM+ and MODIS images, the development and verification of a Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) model, and the evaluation of the image derived TSS maps for tracking sediment plume movements and its influence on the fringing coral environment. TSS empirical models are developed from TM/ETM+ Band 3 with R-2 = 0.92 and from MODIS Band 12 with R-2 = 0.61. The accuracy of the TSS model for TM/ETM+ is +/- 3.2 (mg l(-1)) and for MODIS is +/- 16.0 (mg l(-1)). The estimated sediment plume displacement and rate of dispersion show high correlation with the tidal amplitude. Wind speed greater than 6 m s(-1) increases the sediment plume movements during the ebb tide. The frequency of the plume extending beyond the fringing coral islands during dredging operations is in agreement with the field observed coral mortality due to sediment accumulation.																	1931-3195						2007	1								011506	10.1117/1.2834768								WOS:000260914300058

Assessing the effect of management zonation on live coral cover using multi-date IKONOS satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Change in live coral cover within the nine different management zones of the Marine Protected Area (MPA) around Bunaken Island, Indonesia, was estimated using IKONOS satellite image data for 2001 and 2004. For both years, field data were used to classify image pixels on a semi-quantitative scale based mainly on coral cover. The resulting substrate maps had overall classification accuracies of 78% and 81%, respectively. Change was estimated for each zone using a post-classification comparison. Results indicated an increase in live coral cover in one zone, a decrease in two other zones, and no change in the remaining six zones. The results show no obvious influence of the MPA's zonation plan on changes in live coral cover in the three year period investigated, and the study demonstrates the use of remote sensing to determine change in live coral cover, to assess zonation effectiveness, and to guide management efforts.

Assessment of mangrove vegetation on Abu Minqar Island of the Red Sea	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The island of Abu Minqar is located near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez of the Red Sea and it is the only island in the area with rich stands of Avicennia marina mangrove. The island is highly vulnerable to damage from pollution associated with coastal activities, massive tourism development and hotel constructions along the coast of Al Ghardaqa. High resolution QuikBird satellite images were used for mapping the mangrove vegetation on the island and to establish a baseline database for future monitoring of the changes of the mangrove habitat on the island.

Western Indian Ocean coral communities: bleaching responses and susceptibility to extinction	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A field study of coral bleaching and coral communities was undertaken spanning 8 countries and similar to 35 degrees of latitude in 2005. This was combined with studies in southern Kenya and northeast Madagascar in 1998 and Mauritius in 2004 to develop a synoptic analysis of coral community structure, bleaching response, susceptibility of the communities to bleaching, and the relative risk of extinctions in western Indian Ocean coral reefs. Cluster analysis identified 8 distinct coral communities among the 91 sites sampled, with 2 distinct communities in northern South Africa and central Mozambique, a third in the central atolls of the Maldives, and 5 less differentiated groups, in a swath from southern Kenya to Mauritius, including Tanzania, the granitic islands of the Seychelles, northeast Madagascar, and Reunion. Massive Porites, Pavona, and Pociflopora dominated the central and northern Indian Ocean sites and, from historical records, replaced dominance by Acropora and Montipora. From southern Kenya to Mauritius, coral communities were less disturbed, with Acropora and Montipora dominating, and a mix of subdominants including branching Porites, Fungia, Galaxea, massive Porites, Pocillopora, and Synarea. The survey identified an area from southernmost Kenya to Tanzania as having the least disturbed and highest diversity reefs, and as being a regional priority for management. Taxa vulnerable to future extinction based on their response to warm water, population density, and commonness include largely low-diversity genera with narrow environmental ranges, such as Gyrosmilia interrupta, Plesiastrea versipora, PlerogyTa sinuosai and Physogyra lichtensteini.

By classifying three kinds of remote sensing imagery, we compared abilities to detect invasive mangrove distributions and to discriminate mangroves from surrounding terrestrial vegetation. Using three analytical techniques, we compared mangrove mapping accuracy for various sensor-technique combinations. ANOVA of accuracy assessments demonstrated significant differences among techniques, but no significant differences among the three sensors.

After performing georeferencing and normalization of the images, density slicing was used to extract the waterline. Comparisons of extracted waterline positions with ground-level data for eight transects and global positioning system (GPS) tracks of the island shorelines showed that NIR bands were superior to SWIR bands because of the characteristics of the coral reef coasts, including a lack of foam and suspended sediments (which can affect the NIR wavelength region, if present) and the presence of remnant water on reef flats during low tide (which can affect the SWIR wavelength region). A linear relationship was found between the estimation errors of waterline positions and the spatial resolutions of the NIR sensors. Analysis on estimation errors and image costs showed that Terra ASTER band 3 was the most cost-effective sensor for extracting waterlines with reasonable accuracy. The results serve as general guidelines for using satellite-derived data to estimate intertidal topography and detect and monitor shorelines in coral reef environments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Mapping coral reef benthic substrates using hyperspectral space-borne images and spectral libraries	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The suitability of Hyperion, the first civilian hyperspectral sensor in space, for mapping coral reef benthic substrates has been investigated in this study. An image of Cairns Reef, in the northern section of the Australian Great Barrier Reef (GBR), was acquired during Hyperion Calibration and Validation activities. A field experiment was carried out on Cairns Reef to collect information about the optical properties of the water in the area and to map benthic cover by means of video transects. An approach was used to classify the Hyperion image that allows convenient mapping of benthic substrate type and water depth simultaneously. A hyperspectral library of radiance at Hyperion altitude was simulated using a spectral library of GBR benthic substrates, a Hydrolight 4.1 radiative transfer model, and an in-house atmospheric model similar to Modtran-3.7. The image was then classified using the Hyperion at-sensor radiance data and the Spectral Angle Mapper metric using the simulated at-sensor spectral library. The results suggest that using spectral libraries created with forward modelling from the sea bottom to top of the atmosphere are useful tools for interpretation of reefs and can give better results in image classification than classifying the image after removing atmospheric and water column effects. The results also suggest that bottom type and water depth can be separated and mapped simultaneously provided hyperspectral data is available. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gilbert, A; Andrefouet, S; Yan, L; Remoissenet, G				Gilbert, Antoine; Andrefouet, Serge; Yan, Laurent; Remoissenet, Georges			The giant clam Tridacna maxima communities of three French Polynesia islands: comparison of their population sizes and structures at early stages of their exploitation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Several lagoons of the atolls of Tuamotu Archipelago and volcanic islands of the Australes Archipelago (French Polynesia) are characterized by enormous populations of the clam Tri-dacna maxima, a species considered as endangered in many locations worldwide. Even if this resource can still be considered as virtually intact, the growing harvesting pressure to feed Tahiti's market (up to 50 t of wet matter y(-1)), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons, will soon call for management action to sustain a fishery that currently targets a large, virtually pristine stock. Hence, we present T maxima population sizes and structures for two atolls (Fangatau and Tatakoto) and one island (Tubuai), where high clam densities and population sizes have promoted a small-scale, but growing, commercial fishery since the late 1990s. We followed an earlier pilot study, in which a combination of remote sensing and in situ data provided an estimate of the Fangatau clam population size (23.6 +/- 5.3 million clams, mean 95% confidence interval, for 4.05 km(2) of mapped lagoon). We obtain 88.3 +/- 10.5 and 47.5 +/- 5.2 million clams for Tatakoto (mapped area of 11.46 km(2)) and Tubuai (mapped area of 16.3 km(2)), respectively. Accounting for contrasted length frequency distribution curves and one common size-weight relationship, the total biomasses are 1485 +/- 177 t, 1162 +/- 272 t, and 2173 +/- 232 t of commercial flesh for Tatakoto, Fangatau, and Tubuai, respectively. In addition, given the legal restriction on collecting clams smaller than 12 cm, the legally harvestable biomasses are 958 +/- 114 t, 1038 +/- 247 t, and 1971 +/- 210 t of flesh for Tatakoto, Fangatau, and Tubuai, respectively. The ratio between legal and total stock is much smaller for Tatakoto because this atoll is dominated by small clams, unlike the other two sites. The differences in population size and structure are discussed in terms of natural environment (habitats, degree of aperture to the ocean, temperature variations), providing insights on the natural variability between two similar systems (Tatakoto and Fangatau), and between different systems (the two atolls and the volcanic island of Tubuai), suggesting that future management schemes will have to be optimized locally.

J	Messie, M; Radenac, MH				Messie, Monique; Radenac, Marie-Helene			Seasonal variability of the surface chlorophyll in the western tropical Pacific from SeaWiFS data	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												We used Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) to document the seasonal cycle of surface chlorophyll in the western tropical Pacific. Surface waters in this region can be divided into two ecosystems. The western end of the cold, salty waters of the cold tongue with high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) characteristics occupies most of the eastern part Of the region, while warm, fresh, and oligotrophic waters of the warm pool stand in the western part. Nevertheless, disruption of the oligotrophy may show up at different locations. We reconstructed the seasonal cycle of chlorophyll, sea surface temperature (SST), winds, and surface currents from satellite data and satellite-derived products by extracting the annual and semi-annual harmonics of the time series at each grid point. The calculation was done for the 1999-2004 years in order to exclude the consequences of the major 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation event. The variance explained by the seasonal cycle for this period highlights three regions with high seasonality: (1) The oligotrophy/HNLC transition zone undergoes meridional seasonal displacements. The cold tongue is at its northernmost (southernmost) position during boreal spring (fall). These displacements can be explained in terms of meridional advection of chlorophyll-rich waters and are consistent with the seasonal cycle of the north and south equatorial countercurrents that transport phytoplankton-poor waters. (2) Ocean-color images show seasonal enrichments in the far western north equatorial countercurrent (NECC) area, especially during boreal spring. The chlorophyll maximum coincides with the maximum NECC velocity, follows a SST minimum, and occurs during the upwelling-favorable phase of the wind stress curl. We attribute these enrichments to local upwelling associated with current meandering, horizontal advection from further west, and transport of nutrient-rich waters by the New Guinea coastal undercurrent. (3) Near the Solomon Archipelago, we observe enhancements of chlorophyll concentration southwest of the islands in austral winter, when both the southwestward surface currents and the southeasterly wind stress are strongest. This may be a combination of an island-mass effect and wind-driven upwelling. Horizontal advection from the Solomon area leads to an almost concurrent seasonal chlorophyll enrichment in the northern Coral Sea. In the Gulf of Papua, high chlorophyll concentrations at the same time can be explained by the presence of a strong cyclonic circulation. This study highlights the richness of the response of surface chlorophyll to physical processes at the seasonal time scale in a region usually acknowledged as oligotrophic. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Review of solutions for 3D hydrodynamic modeling applied to aquaculture in South Pacific atoll lagoons	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A workshop organized in French Polynesia in November 2004 allowed reviewing the current methods to model the three-dimensional hydrodynamic circulation in semi-enclosed atoll lagoons for aquaculture applications. Mollusk (e.g. pearl oyster, clam) aquaculture is a major source of income for South Pacific countries such as French Polynesia or Cook Islands. This aquaculture now requires a better understanding of circulation patterns to improve the spatial use of the lagoons, especially to define the best area to set larvae collectors. The pelagic larval duration of the relevant species (< 20 days) and the size of the semi-closed lagoons (few hundreds of km 2) drive the specifications of the model in terms of the spatial and temporal scale. It is considered that, in contrast with fish, mollusk larvae movements are limited and that their cycle occurs completely in the lagoon, without an oceanic stage. Atolls where aquaculture is productive are generally well-bounded, or semi-closed, without significant large and deep openings to the ocean. Nevertheless part of the lagoon circulation is driven by oceanic water inputs through the rim, ocean swells, tides and winds. Therefore, boundary conditions of the lagoon system are defined by the spatial structure of a very shallow rim (exposition and number of hoas), the deep ocean swell climate, tides and wind regimes. To obtain a realistic 3D numerical model of lagoon circulation with adequate forcing, it is thus necessary to connect in an interdisciplinary way a variety of methods (models, remote sensing and in situ data collection) to accurately represent the different components of the lagoon system and its specific boundary conditions. We review here the current methods and tools used to address these different components for a hypothetical atoll of the Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia), representative of the semi-closed lagoons of the South Pacific Ocean. We hope this paper will serve as a guide for similar studies elsewhere and we provide guidelines in terms of costs for all the different stages involved. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Wayne; Kuffner, Ilsa B.; Hernandez, Raquel; Thompson, Philip			Airborne lidar sensing of massive stony coral colonies on patch reefs in the northern Florida reef tract	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In this study we examined the ability of the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) to discriminate cluster zones of massive stony coral colonies on northern Florida reef tract (NFRT) patch reefs based on their topographic complexity (rugosity). Spatially dense EAARL laser submarine topographic soundings acquired in August 2002 were used to create a 1-m resolution digital rugosity map for adjacent NFRT study areas characterized by patch reefs (Region A) and diverse substratums (Region B). In both regions, sites with lidar-sensed rugosities above 1.2 were imaged by an along-track underwater videography system that incorporated the acquisition of instantaneous GPS positions. Subsequent manual interpretation of videotape segments was performed to identify substratum types that caused elevated lidar-sensed rugosity. Our study determined that massive coral colony formation, modified by subsequent physical and biological processes that breakdown patch reef framework, was the primary source of topographic complexity sensed by the EAARL in the NFRT. Sites recognized by lidar scanning to be topographically complex preferentially occurred around the margins of patch reefs, constituted a minor fraction of the reef system, and usually reflected the presence of massive coral colonies in cluster zones, or their derivatives created by mortality, bioerosion, and physical breakdown.

This paper reports on the results of an intercalibration exercise in which two designs of commercially available instruments were used to measure reflectance spectra across a diverse, intertidal site. The substrates sampled included seagrasses, macroalgae, and sediments which varied in wetness and grain size. Spectra were compared statistically using several measures of similarity, and the results showed a high degree of correlation between the measured reflectance spectra. There were no significant differences between instruments from different manufacturers in the shape of reflectance spectra, but the signal-to-noise ratio varied considerably between individual instruments. Spectra measured by operators with lesser experience in field spectrometry tended to be more variable than those of more experienced operators, indicating that training and adherence to set protocols are important when implementing this method in the field situation. Spatial plots derived from field spectra showed essentially the same trends in surface features as plots created using traditional sampling and remote sensing methods. Furthermore, the use of field spectrometry as a stand-alone, low-cost method for rapidly mapping the distribution of major habitat types was demonstrated by the results of a survey of a large intertidal sandbank.

On the possibility of mapping living corals to the species level based on their optical signatures	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Several methods (Spectral Angle Mapper, first derivatives, spectral clustering) were used to test the possibility of discriminating live corals at the species level by using reflectance spectra obtained by close range underwater remote sensing. The Spectral Angle Mapper used with an in situ spectral library of 73 coral colonies recognised all corals correctly in an artificial remote sensing image created from the same coral spectra. The results did not change when "grey" noise was added to each pixel in the artificial image or when the artificial image was made from reflectance spectra modelled through a 5-m water column. The results showed that the within-species variability in optical properties of a set of four coral species, for which at least three different specimens were measured, was as high as between-species variability. Thus, it is highly unlikely that hard corals can be discriminated at a species level by means of remote sensing. Cluster analysis showed that it is difficult to recognise corals also at the genus level (Acropora vs. non-Acropora) based on their reflectance spectra. However, visual inspection of the coral spectra and clustering analysis suggest that it is possible to separate three main optical types of corals: green, blue, and brown corals. This may form the basis for an optical classification of corals that is more suited for remote sensing than traditional taxonomy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method linearizes color band data with respect to depth by subtracting an optically deepwater value from the entire waveband under consideration and taking the natural logarithm of the result. Next, this linearized waveband is rotated about the model 2 regression line computed against a bathymetry band. The rotated color band is decorrelated from water depth. We demonstrate the technique for a small area of Kailua Bay, Oahu, HI, using Quick-bird multispectral and Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey LIDAR data. Results indicate that color band data are effectively decorrelated from depth, while bottom reflector variability is maintained, thus providing the basis for further analysis of the depth-invariant wavebands. The primary benefit of our technique is that wavebands; are rotated independently, preserving relative spectral information.																	0196-2892					JUN	2006	44	6					1655	1660		10.1109/TGRS.2006.870405								WOS:000237824000026

This represents the first time that such an event has been interpreted through satellite remote sensing. Additionally, ocean current data and detailed swath bathymetry of the sea floor to the south-east of the coral spawn slicks suggest that elongate repeating slicks in this area are related to current flow over submarine channels. Assessment of these slicks in association with ancillary data, such as bathymetry, current velocities, weather, and timing of SAR acquisition allow a more robust interpretation of their origins. Through differentiating coral spawn and bathymetric slicks from oil and other biological slicks in shallow carbonate systems, such as the Timor Sea, petroleum and environmental assessments for these areas can be improved.

J	Vahtmae, E; Kutser, T; Martin, G; Kotta, J				Vahtmae, E; Kutser, T; Martin, G; Kotta, J			Feasibility of hyperspectral remote sensing for mapping benthic macroalgal cover in turbid coastal waters - a Baltic Sea case study	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Quantitative analysis of coastal marine benthic communities enables to adequately estimate the state of coastal marine environment, provide better evidence for environmental changes and describe processes that are conditioned by anthropogenic forces. Remote sensing could provide a tool for mapping bottom vegetation if the substrates are spectrally resolvable. We measured reflectance spectra of green (Cladophora glomerata), red (Furcellaria lumbricalis), and brown (Focus vesiculosus) macroalgae and used a bio-optical model in estimating whether these algae distinguish optically from each other, from sandy bottom or deep water in turbid water conditions of the Baltic Sea. The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (I) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumhricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species.

Through complementary field work the potential of the technique for change detection was verified. The general changes in SAV cover were examined using Landsat images from 1986, 1987, 1998, 2001 and 2003. Two of these images, from 1987 (Landsat TM) and 2003 (Landsat ETM+), were specifically analysed to create a map of the change in SAV cover. Overall, the general distribution of SAV stayed fairly stable over the period investigated, but the result also showed regions where significant alterations, both losses and gains, had occurred between the two years. Based on our findings and anecdotal information from local fishermen and seaweed farmers potential causative factors are discussed. It was concluded that a repeated mapping with satellite remote sensing is a suitable tool to monitor changes of seagrass and seaweed distribution in shallow tropical environments.

J	Kutser, T; Vahtmae, E; Martin, G				Kutser, T; Vahtmae, E; Martin, G			Assessing suitability of multispectral satellites for mapping benthic macroalgal cover in turbid coastal waters by means of model simulations	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												One of the objectives of monitoring benthic algal cover is to observe short- and long-term changes in species distribution and structure of coastal benthic habitats as indicators of ecological state. Mapping benthic algal cover with conventional methods (diving) provides great accuracy and high resolution, yet is very expensive and is limited by the time and manpower necessary. We measured reflectance spectra of three indicator species for the Baltic Sea: Cladophora glomerata (green macroalgae), Furcellaria lumbricalis (red macroalgae), and Fucus vesiculosus (brown macroalgae) and used a bio-optical model in an attempt to estimate whether these algae are separable from each other and sandy bottom or deep water by means of satellite remote sensing. Our modelling results indicate that to some extent it is possible to map the studied species with multispectral satellite sensors in turbid waters. However, the depths where the macroalgae call be detected are often shallower than the maximum depths where the studied species usually grow. In waters deeper than just a few meters, the differences between the studied bottom types are seen only in band 2 (green) of the multispectral sensors under investigation. It means that multispectral sensors are capable of detecting difference in brightness only in one band which is insufficient for recognition of different bottom types in waters where no or few in situ data are available. Configuration of MERIS spectral hands allows the recognition of red, green and brown macroalgae based on their spectral signatures provided the algal belts are wider than MERIS spatial resolution. Commercial stock of F. lumbricalis in West-Estonian Archipelago covers area where MERIS 300 m spatial resolution is adequate. However, strong attenuation of light in the water column and signal to noise ratio of the sensor do not allow mapping of Furcellaria down to maximum depths where it occurs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because most of the biophysical variables of corals (i.e., pigment content, live cover and algal overgrowth) are related to their reflectance spectra, the analysis and inversion of the spectra may provide an account of these variables. Our research was aimed at determining the relationship between the percent live cover and reflectance of corals. Two wavelength bands (405-425 nm, and 590-600 nm) were identified to establish the relationship. A linear relationship was observed, which showed higher correlation (R-2=0.886) at 405-425 nm when compared to 590-600 nm (R-2=0.602). Validation methods revealed that 405-425 nm wavelength range provided a better relationship than 590-600 nm in predicting percent live cover of corals.																	0094-8276					MAR 18	2006	33	6							L06603	10.1029/2005GL025056								WOS:000236331200004						
J	Hochberg, EJ; Apprill, AM; Atkinson, MJ; Bidigare, RR				Hochberg, EJ; Apprill, AM; Atkinson, MJ; Bidigare, RR			Bio-optical modeling of photosynthetic pigments in corals	CORAL REEFS												The spectral reflectance of coral is inherently related to the amounts of photosynthetic pigments present in the zooxanthellae. There are no studies, however, showing that the suite of major photosynthetic pigments can be predicted from optical reflectance spectra. In this study, we measured cm-scale in vivo and in situ spectral reflectance for several colonies of the massive corals Porites lobata and Porites lutea, two colonies of the branching coral Porites compressa, and one colony of the encrusting coral Montipora flabellata in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. For each reflectance spectrum, we collected a tissue sample and utilized high-performance liquid chromatography to quantify six major photosynthetic pigments, located in the zooxanthellae. We used multivariate multiple regression analysis with cross-validation to build and test an empirical linear model for predicting pigment concentrations from optical reflectance spectra. The model accurately predicted concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c (2), peridinin, diadinoxanthin, diatoxanthin and beta-carotene, with correlation coefficients of 0.997, 0.941, 0.995, 0.996, 0.980 and 0.984, respectively. The relationship between predicted and actual concentrations was 1:1 for each pigment, except chlorophyll c (2). This simple empirical model demonstrates the potential for routine, rapid, non-invasive monitoring of coral-zooxanthellae status, and ultimately for remote sensing of reef biogeochemical processes.																	0722-4028					MAR	2006	25	1					99	109		10.1007/s00338-005-0071-8								WOS:000235716200018

Uplift and subsidence associated with the great Aceh-Andaman earthquake of 2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Rupture of the Sunda megathrust on 26 December 2004 produced broad regions of uplift and subsidence. We define the pivot line separating these regions as a first step in defining the lateral extent and the downdip limit of rupture during that great M-w approximate to 9.2 earthquake. In the region of the Andaman and Nicobar islands we rely exclusively on the interpretation of satellite imagery and a tidal model. At the southern limit of the great rupture we rely principally on field measurements of emerged coral microatolls. Uplift extends from the middle of Simeulue Island, Sumatra, at similar to 2.5 degrees N, to Preparis Island, Myanmar (Burma), at similar to 14.9 degrees N. Thus the rupture is similar to 1600 km long. The distance from the pivot line to the trench varies appreciably. The northern and western Andaman Islands rose, whereas the southern and eastern portion of the islands subsided. The Nicobar Islands and the west coast of Aceh province, Sumatra, subsided. Tilt at the southern end of the rupture is steep; the distance from 1.5 m of uplift to the pivot line is just 60 km. Our method of using satellite imagery to recognize changes in elevation relative to sea surface height and of using a tidal model to place quantitative bounds on coseismic uplift or subsidence is a novel approach that can be adapted to other forms of remote sensing and can be applied to other subduction zones in tropical regions.

Capacity building in tropical coastal resource monitoring in developing countries: A re-appreciation of the oldest remote sensing method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Long-term decadal retrospection in spatio-temporal imagery analyses can only be carried out using aerial photographs, which are still the most detailed remotely sensed data available. Visual interpretation of such imagery is most efficient and inexpensive in the light of ecosystem monitoring research in developing countries, which are often unable to cope with the development or the cost of acquisition of commercial space-borne imaging (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird). In this light, the present paper explicitly analyses the methodological use of image attributes of air-borne imagery from mangrove forests, and investigates the consistency and constraints of mangrove image attributes in visually interpreted air-borne imagery. Six image attributes are analysed, and their application is illustrated using various mangrove sites in Kenya and Sri Lanka. Comparison of identification keys reveals that minor attributes such as 'ecological position' are informative, and that image attributes for a particular species or genus are apparently less plastic and more widely applicable than formerly assumed. Emphasis on compulsory fieldwork is made and constraints related to reflection and interference, amongst others, are discussed.

L. majuscula is a toxic cyanobacteria which fixes nitrogen and is found attached to: seagrass, algae and coral. The toxic and smothering nature of L. majuscula has affected human and environmental health in sensitive coastal ecosystems. To reduce these impacts, monitoring is an essential component of studying the origins and development of L. majuscula blooms. An accurate and cost effective means to map the extent of a bloom and its biophysical properties is needed. This study presents an operational approach for mapping the extent of L. majuscula blooms in the clear and shallow water regions of Moreton Bay, eastern Australia, from a combination of field and remotely sensed data sets. The ability to discriminate L. majuscula from other substrate types over a range of depths was first examined using detailed field reflectance spectra, measured optical properties of Moreton Bay waters and a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight 4.1). A two-stage process was then used to map L. majuscula. The spatial extent of L. majuscula and other major substrate types was first recorded from a boat-based survey by marine park authorities using point-based GPS measurements. This sampling was timed to coincide with an overpass of the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor. When the results of the boat-based mapping detected more than 25% L. majuscula cover in the study area, a cloud free Landsat 7 ETM+ image was acquired for that date. In the second stage of mapping, selected field survey data provided the basis for a supervised classification of the ETM+ image data to map L. majuscula. Effort and accuracy assessment of both field and image mapping methods indicated a trade-off between areal coverage and mapping accuracy. The Landsat 7 ETM+ based mapping procedure provided 100% areal coverage with 58% accuracy. In contrast, the boat-based field survey method covered only 0.5% of the study area, but with almost 100% mapping accuracy. The approach outlined in this work has been adopted as a standard operating procedure in Moreton Bay. This study illustrates how remote sensing can be combined with field monitoring, to provide marine park authorities with useful information to understand and manage blooms. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Northern Florida reef tract benthic metabolism scaled by remote sensing	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Holistic rates of excess organic carbon production (E) and calcification for a 0.5 km(2) segment of the backreef platform of the northern Florida reef tract (NFRT) were estimated by combining biotope mapping using remote sensing with community metabolic rates determined with a benthic incubation system. The use of ASTER multispectral satellite imaging for the spatial scaling of benthic metabolic processes resulted in errors in E and net calcification (G) of 48 and 431% respectively, relative to estimates obtained using AISA hyperspectral airborne scanning. At 19 and 125%, the E and G errors relative to the AISA-based estimates were less pronounced for an analysis that used IKONOS multispectral satellite imagery to spatially extrapolate the chamber process measurements. Our scaling analysis indicates that the holistic calcification rate of the backreef platform of the northern Florida reef tract is negligible at 0.07 g CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1). All of the mapped biotopes in this reef zone are net heterotrophic, resulting in an estimated holistic excess production rate of -0.56 g C m(-2) d(-1), and an overall gross primary production to respiration ratio of 0.85. Based on our finding of ubiquitous heterotrophy, we infer that the backreef platform of the NFRT is a sink for external inputs of suspended particulate organic matter. Further, our results suggest that the inward advection of inorganic nutrients is not a dominant forcing mechanism for benthic biogeochemical function in the NFRT. We suggest that the degradation of the northern Florida reef tract may parallel the community phase shifts documented within other reef systems polluted by organic detritus.

Distinctive seabed mounds were found in one area; video images from the mounds showed coral reef formation, and grab samples recovered L. pertusa reef framework and rubble. Skeleton samples were dated to 3,800 years BP. Grab samples contained 123 species of fauna. The reef structures, termed the Mingulay Reef Complex, were identified as topographic mound-like structures from the bathymetric data and were also visible on the backscatter images. The location of the reefs coincides with Atlantic bottom waters, close to a primary productivity centre and mixing zone, in an area where currents are likely to be accelerated by rocky seafloor ridges. This study shows that multibeam echosounders are powerful tools to locate and map deep-water coral reefs irrespective of water depth.

J	Finkl, CW; Benedet, L; Andrews, JL				Finkl, CW; Benedet, L; Andrews, JL			Submarine geomorphology of the continental shelf off southeast Florida based on interpretation of airborne laser bathymetry	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Airborne laser bathymetry (ALB) is a new laser bathymetric survey tool that has applicability in clear coastal (Case II) waters to depths of -70 m. The new sounding technique features rapid acquisition of large, high-quality data sets via variable swath widths that are independent of water depth. This advanced ALB system was deployed along the continental shelf of southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties), providing a contiguous data set for 160 km of coast from onshore to 6 km offshore. Image enhancement of the ALB digital data facilitates recognition of numerous seafloor features and bathymetric patterns. Bathymetric analysis of the 600-km(2) survey area on the continental shelf shows inherited lithologic features that are partly covered by surficial sediments. Primary parabathic (shore-parallel) provinces include: (1) nearshore rocky zones dominated by the Anastasia Formation, (2) coral-algal reef systems (Florida Reef Tract [FRT]), and (3) marine platforms (terraces). Sedimentary subprovinces include shoreface sands, interreefal sedimentary infills (coral rubble in basal sequences and near reef gaps), and finer-grained materials seaward of coral reefs. Tertiary topographic features include: (1) longshore bar and trough systems, shoals, sand sheets (flats), and diabathic (cross-shore) channels; (2) reef crests and ledges, forereef spur-and-groove topography, sediment ramps in large reef gaps, and incised paleo-river channels; and (3) drowned karst topography. Hierarchical organization (classification and mapping) of these bathymetric features is now possible for the first time because of the increased accuracy and density of ALB data. These data and related maps allow, for the first time, assessment of links between the influence of seabed morphology on wave transformation patterns and beach morphodynamics in southeast Florida.																	0749-0208					NOV	2005	21	6					1178	1194		10.2112/05A-0021.1								WOS:000233495200012						
J	Dekker, AG; Brando, VE; Anstee, JM				Dekker, AG; Brando, VE; Anstee, JM			Retrospective seagrass change detection in a shallow coastal tidal Australian lake	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite imagery was used to detect the change in seagrass and macroalgal communities of a shallow coastal lake over a period of 14 years. The lake benthic material was classified into sets of spectral classes representing the patterns and texture of the ecosystem, and then linked to environmentally relevant labels through a radiative transfer model. The classification results for 2002 achieved an accuracy of 76% for the least understood areas; other areas were significantly better, but not quantified. Classification results of 1988, 1991, and 1995 were consistent with past surveys and maps. Based on the change detection from 1988 to 2002 Posidonia, Ruppia and Halophila change slightly in the 14 year period from 1988 to 2002. However, Zostera has undergone significant change and adaptation. Early in the time series (between 1988 and 1991) a reduction in Zostera beds was evident, especially in the middle and south of the take with some areas not returning by 2002. Epiphytic growth over Zostera could be a confounding factor here, but the Landsat sensors do not have sufficient spectral resolution to detect these subtleties. Hyperspectral remote sensing could resolve this issue more clearly. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This unique resource is virtually intact, until recently being impacted only by local consumption. Increasing exports to Tahiti's market (up to 50 tonnes of wet matter y(-1)), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons (< 50 km(2)), have raised significant concerns for agencies charged with management of lagoonal resources. In order to evaluate whether the current harvesting pressure threatens long-term sustainability of this resource, it is necessary to estimate the total number of individual clams present and also the fraction of that stock that is currently targeted by fishers, who generally collect clams in very shallow waters (< 1 m), walking on the reef edges. Here, we present results for a pilot study evaluating this resource at Fangatau Atoll. Using a combination of data collected in situ and three remotely sensed images with different spatial resolution (1.5, 5.6, and 30 m), we estimate that the shallowest lagoonal areas (4.05 km(2) at depth < 6 m) harbour five classes of benthic habitat with significantly different clam areal covers and densities. Considering the cover/density values for each habitat class, 23.65 +/- 5.33 million clams (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) inhabit these 4.05 km(2). Assuming that current harvesting techniques will be maintained in the future, the commercially available stock represents 44% of the population located on 1.18 km(2) of the shallow lagoon. A comparison of results from the three remote sensing platforms indicates that high resolution, broadband multispectral sensors (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird) should provide the best existing platforms to conduct similar assessments elsewhere.

In this study, facies patterns and their spatial relationships are investigated quantitatively in an Arabian Gulf shallow subtidal carbonate ramp setting, using a synergy of IKONOS satellite imagery and vessel-based acoustic bathymetry survey. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the facies distribution on the seabed enabled quantification of relationships between eight dominant facies classes and the association of particular lithotopes to water depth. Fractal behavior was investigated using a combination of boundary- and patch-based metrics, and the spatial distribution of early diagenetically cemented hardgrounds and unconsolidated carbonate sand were shown to display strong fractal properties. In contrast, we show that landscape-scale processes can be treated as essentially deterministic and facies neighborhood patterns are strongly probabilistic. Identifying that the heterogeneity of shallow subtidal carbonate facies scales with a power law within certain thresholds has the potential to serve as a tool in environmental reconstruction in the ancient, where information on the lateral persistence of facies units is difficult to obtain.

J	Kirkpatrick, LA; Weishampel, JF				Kirkpatrick, LA; Weishampel, JF			Quantifying spatial structure of volumetric neutral models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Neutral models in landscape ecology that have been used as a framework to analyze actual landscapes have been largely planar. However, the natural world is greater than two dimensions; hence, many ecological structures, e.g., forest canopies or coral reefs, are better represented by topographies or tomographies. Because pattern and process or structure and function are intertwined, it becomes necessary. to develop methods to quantify these complex architectures. With the advent of remote sensing technologies such as lidars and sonars, that permit structural mapping of some of these systems, volumetric data are becoming more prevalent. In this study, we developed a suite of binary voxel-based neutral models that possessed random, anisotropic, and hierarchical properties. We then evaluated the extent to which fractal-derived measurements, i.e., lacunarity, the simple fractal dimension, and multifractal spectra, were able to discern among the constructed model types at two different densities (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05). Multifractal analysis, where spectra were defined by three parameters, was shown to be the most sensitive to the differences among the neutral structures. Lactunarity, defined by a single parameter, was shown to be fairly useful in discerning the structures. The simple fractal dimension was found to have limited capability. To more fully assess the ability of these and additional pattern recognition methods, better representations of natural morphologies need to be developed and analyzed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The region around Lakshadweep Islands is characterized by shallow submerged reef banks. This study demonstrates the use of IRS-P4 OCM satellite data in deciphering information about the extent of submerged reef banks in this area. The short wavelength OCM spectral bands have been found to be useful in detecting submerged reef banks as deep as 50-60 in below the ocean surface.

J	Moufaddal, WM				Moufaddal, WM			Use of satellite imagery as environmental impact assessment tool: A case study from the NW Egyptian Red Sea coastal zone	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Knowledge and detecting impacts of human activities on the coastal ecosystem is an essential management requirement and also very important for future and proper planning of coastal areas. Moreover, documentation of these impacts can help in increasing public awareness about side effects of unsustainable practices. Analysis of multidate remote sensing data can be used as an effective tool in environmental impact assessment (EIA). Being synoptic and frequent in coverage, multidate data from Landsat and other satellites provide a reference record and bird's eye viewing to the environmental situation of the coastal ecosystem and the associated habitats. Furthermore, integration of satellite data with field observations and background information can help in decision if a certain activity has caused deterioration to a specific habitat or not. The present paper is an attempt to utilize remote sensing data for assessment impacts of some human activities on the major sensitive habitats of the NW Egyptian Red Sea coastal zone, definitely between Ras Gemsha and Safaga. Through multidate change analysis of Landsat data (TM & ETM+ sensors), it was possible to depict some of the human infringements in the area and to provide, in some cases, exclusive evidences for the damaging effect of some developmental activities.																	0167-6369					AUG	2005	107	1-3					427	452		10.1007/s10661-005-3576-2								WOS:000231162600027	16418927

Coastal ocean color remote sensing techniques permit benthic habitats to be explored with higher resolution than ever before. The objective of this research was to develop an accurate benthic habitat map for an area off the northwest coast of Roatan Island, Honduras, using high-resolution multispectral IKONOS data. Atmospheric (Rayleigh and aerosol path radiance) and water column corrections (water depth and water column attenuation) were applied to the imagery, making it a robust method for mapping benthic habitats. Water depth for each pixel was calculated based on a site-specific polynomial model. A mechanistic radiative transfer approach was developed that removed the confound effect of the water column (absorption and scattering) from the imagery to retrieve an estimate of the bottom reflectance (albedo). Albedos were <= 12% for seagrass benthos, 12% to 24% for coral areas, and >= 24% for sand-dominated areas. The retrieved bottom albedos were then used to classify the benthos, generating a detailed map of benthic habitats, followed by accuracy assessment.																	0196-2892					JUL	2005	43	7					1592	1604		10.1109/TGRS.2005.847790								WOS:000230149900017

Remote sensing is a not intrusive, but powerful tool, which has been successfully used for the assessment and mapping of natural resources in coral reef areas. In this study we utilized GIS to combine Landsat TM imagery, aerial photography, aerial video and a digital bathymetric model, to assess and to map submerged habitats for Alacranes reef, Yucatan, Mexico. Our main goal was testing the potential of aerial video as the source of data to produce training areas for the supervised classification of LandsatTM imagery. Submerged habitats were ecologically characterized by using a hierarchical classification of field data. Habitats were identified on an overlaid image, consisting of the three types of remote sensing products and the bathymetric model. Pixels representing those habitats were selected as training areas by using GIS tools. Training areas were used to classify the Landsat TM bands 1, 2 and 3 and the bathymetric model by using a maximum likelihood algorithm. The resulting thematic map was compared against field data classification to improve habitats definition. Contextual editing and reclassification were used to obtain the final thematic map with an overall accuracy of 77%. Analysis of aerial video by a specialist in coral reef ecology was found to be a suitable source of information to produce training areas for the supervised classification of Landsat TM imagery in coral reefs at a coarse scale.

J	Purkis, SJ				Purkis, SJ			A "reef-up" approach to classifying coral habitats from IKONOS imagery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Monitoring coral reef benthos with satellites has typically followed a "sensor-down" approach, with the classification algorithm driven by statistics derived from the imagery. I adopt a "reef-up" method, drawing on statistics derived from hyperspectral optical field measurements of substrate reflectance to train image classification. In order to calibrate the satellite data with direct physical measurements of reflectivity, it is necessary to process both the imagery and in situ data to common units of albedo. Building upon a proof-of-concept study conducted by the author in the Red Sea, the link is made by correcting the remote sensing data for the effect of varying bathymetry using in situ measurement of water column optical properties and a digital elevation model constructed from a vessel-based acoustic survey, thereby yielding units of substrate reflectance. Extensive ground verification of the predictive benthic habitat map resulting from image classification showed that eight substrate classes were resolved with an overall accuracy of 69% down to a depth of 6 in, including live and dead coral framework. As compared to conventional from-image classification techniques, the reef-up method offers the potential for higher thematic accuracy while maintaining a greater degree of flexibility for repeat survey using platforms of higher spectral and spatial resolution, expected to come online in the near future. The fact that image acquisition and optical ground-truthing did not occur concurrently, is of particular relevance in confirming that in situ measurements can be made independent of image acquisition and retrospectively linked to appropriate substrate classes. Considering the wealth of hyperspectral data already acquired for shallow reef facies, the work highlights the potential of the reef-up approach for quantifying substrate distribution in coral environments using both air- and spaceborne platforms.

Laser bathymetric survey tools have applicability in clear coastal (Case 11) waters down to -70 meters depth. Deployed along the southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties) coast, an advanced ALB system provided a continuous dataset for 160 kilometers of coast from onshore to 5 kilometers offshore. Digital terrain models developed from this high-density bathymetric data permitted recognition A numerous seafloor features and bathymetric patterns from different image formats. Bathymetric analysis of the 600-km(2) survey area on the narrow continental shelf shows inherited lithologic features that are partly covered by surficial sediments. Primary parabathic provinces include: (1) nearshore rocky zones dominated by the Anastasia Formation, (2) coral-algal reef systems (Florida Reef Tract [FRT]), and (3) marine terraces. Secondary sedimentary subprovinces include shoreface sands, inter-reefial sedimentary infills (coral rubble in basal sequences and near reef gaps), and finer-grained materials seaward of the FRT. Tertiary topographic features include: (1) longshore bar and trough systems, shoals, sand sheets, and diabathic channels; (2) reef crests and ledges, forereef spurs and grooves, sediment ramps in large reef gaps, and incised paleo-river channels; and (3) drowned karst topography. Hierarchical organization of these bathymetric features is now possible for the first time because of the increased accuracy and density of bathymetric data obtained by ALB systems.																	0749-0208					MAY	2005	21	3					501	514		10.2112/05-756A.1								WOS:000229408900011

Continuous land/sea terrain was mapped by merging Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with satellite-derived bathymetry. Benthic habitat characterizations were created by-unsupervised classifications of Landsat imagery clustered using field data, and produced maps with an estimated overall accuracy of > 75% (Tau coefficient > 0.65). These were merged with Geocover-LC (land use/land cover) data to create continuous land/sea cover maps. Image pairs from different dates were analyzed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA) in order to detect areas of change in the marine environment over two different time intervals: 2000 to 2001, and 1991 to 2003. This activity demonstrates the capabilities of Landsat imagery to produce continuous summit-to-sea maps, as well as detect certain changes in the shallow-water marine environment, providing a valuable tool for efficient coastal zone monitoring and effective management and conservation.																	0034-7744					MAY	2005	53			1			185	193										WOS:000230498900021	17465158					
J	Riegl, BM; Purkis, SJ				Riegl, BM; Purkis, SJ			Detection of shallow subtidal corals from IKONOS satellite and QTC View (50, 200 kHz) single-beam sonar data (Arabian Gulf; Dubai, UAE)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We compared the results of seafloor classifications with special emphasis on detecting coral versus non-coral areas that were obtained from a 4x4-m pixel-resolution multispectral IKONOS satellite image and two acoustic surveys using a QTC View Series 5 system on 50 and 200 kHz signal frequency. A detailed radiative transfer model was obtained by in situ measurement of optical parameters that then allowed calibration of the IKONOS image against in situ optical measurements and a series of ground-truthing points. Eight benthic classes were distinguished optically with an overall accuracy of 69% and a Tau index T of 65. The classification of the IKONOS image allowed discrimination of three different coral assemblages (dense live, dense dead, sparse), which were confirmed by ground-truthing. Data evaluation of the acoustic surveys involved culling of datapoints with < 90% confidence and < 30% probability, two QTC-provided statistics, and the deletion of data classes without clear spatial patterns (visualized by single-class trackplots). The deletion of these ubiquitous classes was necessary in order to obtain any clearly interpretable spatial pattern of echo classes after the surveys were resampled to a regular grid and areas between the lines interpolated using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The 50 kHz acoustic seafloor classification was able to determine two classes (unconsolidated sand versus hardground) but was not able to determine corals. The 200 kHz survey determined high rugosity (=corals and sand ripples) versus low rugosity (=flat areas) but was not able to determine consolidated and unconsolidated sediments. Classes were extrapolated to the entire grid and polygons obtained from the two surveys were combined to provide maps containing four classes (rugose hardground=coral, flat hardground=rock, rugose softground=ripples and algae, flat softground=bare sand). Compared with the classification map derived from the IKONOS image, they were 66% accurate (T=59) when the most highly processed data (only selected classes, > 90% accuracy and > 30% probability) were used, and 60% accurate (T=53) when less processed data (selected classes only, all data) were used. Accuracy against ground-truthing points of the most highly processed dataset was 56% (T=46). These results indicate that results from optical and acoustic surveys have some degree of commonality. Therefore, there is a potential to produce maps outlining coral areas from optical remote-sensing in shallow areas and acoustic methods in adjacent deeper areas beyond optical resolution with the limitation that acoustic maps will resolve fewer habitat classes and have lower accuracy.

J	Andrefouet, S; Guzman, HM				Andrefouet, S; Guzman, HM			Coral reef distribution, status and geomorphology-biodiversity relationship in Kuna Yala (San Blas) archipelago, Caribbean Panama	CORAL REEFS												Most of the knowledge of the reef geomorphology and benthic communities of Kuna Yala coral reefs (Caribbean Panama) comes from the western side of the archipelago, a few tens of kilometers around Punta San Blas (Porvenir). To bridge the gap between Porvenir and the Colombia-Panama border, we investigated with Landsat images the extent and geomorphological diversity of the entire Kuna Yala to provide geomorphologic maps of the archipelago in 12 classes. In addition to remote sensing data, in situ survey conducted in May-June 2001 provided a Kuna Yala-wide first synoptic vision of reef status, in terms of benthic diversity (number of species of coral, octocorals, and sponges) and reef health (coral versus algal cover). For a total reef system estimated to cover 638 km(2) along 480 km of coastline, 195 km(2) include coral dominated areas and only 35 km(2) can be considered covered by corals. A total of 69 scleractinian coral, 38 octocoral, and 82 sponge species were recorded on the outer slopes of reef formations, with a slightly higher diversity in the area presenting the most abundant and diverse reef formations (western Kuna Yala). Attempts to relate benthic diversity and geomorphological diversity provided only weak relationships regardless of the taxa, and suggest that habitat heterogeneity within geomorphological areas explain better the patterns of coral diversity. This study confirms the potential of combined remote sensing and in situ surveys for regional scale assessment, and we suggest that similar approaches should be generalized for reef mapping and assessment for other reef sites.																	0722-4028					MAR	2005	24	1					31	42		10.1007/s00338-004-0444-4								WOS:000227742400006						
J	Turner, J; Klaus, R				Turner, J; Klaus, R			Coral reefs of the Mascarenes, Western Indian Ocean	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The reefs of the Mascarenes differ in structure and stage of development. Mauritius is the oldest island, bound by a discontinuous fringing reef and small barrier reef, with large lagoon patch reefs. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon with deep channels and few patch reefs. Reunion, the youngest island, has short stretches of narrow fringing reefs along southwestern coasts. The islets of St Brandon are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef. Reef mapping of the Mascarenes using satellite imagery provides an estimate of 705 km 2 of shallow reef habitats. These areas have been modified over geological time by changes in sea level, ocean-atmosphere disturbances and biological and chemical forcing. Further modification has resulted from historical changes in land-use patterns. Recent economic development has placed many of these reefs at risk from anthropogenic impact. The reefs of the Mascarenes have escaped mass mortality from bleaching to date, which increases their conservation significance within the wider Indian Ocean. The reefs are poorly protected. A case study shows how a geographic information system incorporating reef-habitat maps can help formulate and demonstrate Marine protected Area boundaries.																	1364-503X					JAN 15	2005	363	1826					229	250		10.1098/rsta.2004.1489								WOS:000225970100021	15598634

Analysis of archive sea-surface temperature (SST) data confirmed that the area is subject to recurrent and cyclic temperature anomalies at a frequency which suggests at least a partial link to the El Nino Southern Oscillation via the Indian Ocean Zonal Mode. Classification of high-resolution (4 ra pixel-size) IKONOS satellite data gave a large-scale synoptic overview of substrate zonation which, in tandem with a long-term ecological time-series study, allowed us to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the coral community. We show that the spatial expression of 4 coral assemblages, as mapped using the IKONOS imagery, is consistent with what would be predicted if reef development was repeatedly 'reset' on a decadal time-scale following recurring episodes of coral mass mortality induced by severe SST anomalies. Furthermore, merging the remotely sensed map of substrate distribution with a detailed bathymetric digital elevation model, revealed no evidence of any significant framework development in the past, suggesting that the cycle of temperature-induced mortality has been operating for some considerable time.

Satellite image data and derived maps of water column and substrate biophysical properties provide an opportunity to develop baseline mapping and monitoring programs for coastal and coral reef ecosystem health indicators. A significant challenge for satellite image data in coastal and coral reef water bodies is the mixture of both clear and turbid waters. A new approach is presented in this paper to enable production of water quality and substrate cover type maps, linked to a field based coastal ecosystem health indicator monitoring program, for use in turbid to clear coastal and coral reef waters. An optimized optical domain method was applied to map selected water quality (Secchi depth, Kd PAR, tripton, CDOM) and substrate cover type (seagrass, algae, sand) parameters. The approach is demonstrated using commercially available Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data over a coastal embayment exhibiting the range of substrate cover types and water quality conditions commonly found in sub-tropical and tropical coastal environments. Spatially extensive and quantitative maps of selected water quality and substrate cover parameters were produced for the study site. These map products were refined by interactions with management agencies to suit the information requirements of their monitoring and management programs. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It characterizes water clarity and is used as a proxy for water quality. Mapping of shallow water benthic habitats using optical means, including daytime visible satellite imagery, requires knowledge of K to correct for water column effects such as light absorption and scattering. Traditionally. K is derived from imagery using a priori knowledge of bottom types at different depths and specific locations. and assuming that light attenuates exponentially with depth. This technique is applied to three Landsat 7 satellite images (February, May, and July 2000) from the Florida Keys Reef Tract between Key Largo and Key West. Interpolated depth data, initially from NOAA vector chart data, with uncertainties of +/- 0.5 m. were draped over 30 m spatial resolution Landsat satellite imagery. K was derived for 27 sites where bright sand could be observed at depths between 3 and 20 m. The blue and green bands (Landsat bands 1 and 2 at 450-520 nm and 520-600 nm, respectively) provided K values consistent with time and location. Average K values for bands 1 and 2, respectively, were 0.029 and 0.043 m(-1) (Lower Keys), 0.050 and 0.072 m(-1) (Middle Keys), and 0.063 and 0.082 m(-1) (Upper Keys). The red band (band 3, 630-690 nm) provided more ambiguous and erroneous results with several negative K values.. attributed primarily to three factors: use of a simple atmospheric correction, the high absorption and rapid attenuation of red light in water. and low radiometric sensitivity of the Landsat ETM+ sensor. Despite the fact that these observations were a snapshot in time, trends were observed for the Upper, Middle, and Lower Keys, possibly due to the influence of more turbid Florida Bay waters.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0018-8158					NOV 15	2004	530				SI		489	493		10.1007/s10750-004-2691-3								WOS:000226416700056						
J	Wettle, M; Brando, VE; Dekker, AG				Wettle, M; Brando, VE; Dekker, AG			A methodology for retrieval of environmental noise equivalent spectra applied to four Hyperion scenes of the same tropical coral reef	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The accuracy of environmental variable estimation from remote sensing is strongly related to the capacity of the measurement for separating the desired radiance signal from the overall noise in a pixel or image. Therefore, an algorithm for locating the most suitable spatial areas for environmental noise equivalent retrieval in a remote sensing image was developed and validated, first on a custom-built monochromatic image and then on a multi-temporal, hyperspectral data set. The algorithm, Automated Local Convergence Locator (ALCL), successfully identified areas in the custom-built image where known amounts of added noise equivalents could be accurately retrieved. Applying ALCL to the hyperspectral data (four Hyperion scenes of the same tropical coral reef scene) confirmed that noise equivalent characteristics vary limitedly on a scene-by-scene basis. The four Hyperion noise equivalent spectra collected in locations identified by ALCL as suitable showed consistency in both shape and magnitude despite being acquired 6 months apart, and differed from equivalent spectra from image locations identified as not suitable for noise estimation. The ALCL algorithm and associated methodology required limited user input while objectively determining the areas in an image most suitable for noise equivalent estimation. The ALCL methodology is applicable to studies where noise equivalent quantities in remote sensing imagery need to be objectively determined, such as feasibility studies, environmental monitoring, and sensitivity analysis.

J	Miller, RL; McKee, BA				Miller, RL; McKee, BA			Using MODIS Terra 250 m imagery to map concentrations of total suspended matter in coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												High concentrations of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters directly affect or govern numerous water column and benthic processes. The concentration of suspended sediments derived from bottom sediment resuspension or discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. Although there has been considerable effort to use remotely sensed images to provide synoptic maps of suspended particulate matter, there are limited routine applications of this technology due in part to the low spatial resolution, long revisit period, or cost of most remotely sensed data. In contrast, near daily coverage of mediumresolution data is available from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra instrument without charge from several data distribution gateways. Equally important, several display and processing programs are available that operate on low cost computers. The utility of MODIS 250 m data for analyzing complex coastal waters was examined in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Using simple processing procedures, MODIS images were used to map the concentration of Total Suspended Matter (TSM). A robust linear relationship was established between band 1 (620-670 nm) MODIS Terra 250 m data and in situ measurements of TSM (r(2) = 0. 89; n = 52; MSE=4.74) acquired during six field campaigns. This study demonstrates that the moderately high resolution of MODIS 250 m data and the operating characteristics of the instrument provide data useful for examining the transport and fate of materials in coastal environments, particularly smaller bodies of water such as bays and estuaries.

J	Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ				Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ			Using biogeography to help set priorities in marine conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Biogeographic information has great potential to enhance systematic conservation planning, although it has yet to be routinely incorporated in marine situations. Fundamental differences between marine and terrestrial environments (physical, biological, and sociopolitical) mean that biogeographic data are harder to obtain for marine systems, biogeographic boundaries more difficult to define, and the outcomes of similar conservation approaches may differ Despite these challenges, an understanding of spatial context, connections, and scales of processes is needed to set conservation priorities that ensure the representation and continued persistence of species and habitats within functioning ecosystems. As we discovered in our review, scientific knowledge of marine systems is increasing rapidly thanks to recent advances in genetics, remote sensing, and geographical information systems. Such knowledge and tools have important implications for marine planning. We also reviewed the degree to which biogeography is incorporated into current marine conservation projects at spatial scales ranging from global to local. Overall, initiatives are becoming more regional in scope and incorporating biogeographic data in an increasingly rigorous manner However, initiatives that use few or no data are also on the rise and need to be treated with due caution. We recommend undertaking global and regional reviews within biogeographic frameworks; combining analytical approaches to determine biogeographic classifications and to define a range of potential conservation areas with stakeholder involvement to set priorities; understanding contemporary processes that maintain species distributions; and acquiring knowledge of historical distributions to provide appropriate baselines for current conservation. The urgent need for marine conservation, however, means that planning should proceed with the best currently available biogeographic information even while biogeographic research continues.																	0888-8892					AUG	2004	18	4					1004	1020		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00137.x								WOS:000222979400022

In situ studies of reflected spectra at the coral surface show that living and recently dead colonies can be distinguished. Here, we investigate whether such spectral differences can be detected using an airborne remote sensing instrument. The Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (Itres Research Ltd, Canada) was flown in two configurations: 10 spectral bands with 1-m(2) pixels and 6 spectral bands with 0.25-m(2) pixels. First, we show that an instrument with 10 spectral bands possesses adequate spectral resolution to distinguish living Porites, living Pocillopora spp., partially dead Porites, recently dead Porites (total colony mortality within 6 months), old dead (>6 months) Porites, Halimeda spp., and coralline red algae when there is no water column to confuse spectra. All substrata were distinguished using fourth-order spectral derivatives around 538 nm and 562 nm. Then, at a shallow site (Tivaru) at Rangiroa Atoll, Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia), we show that live and dead coral can be distinguished from the air to a depth of at least 4 m using first- and fourth-order spectral derivatives between 562-580 nm. However, partially dead and recently dead Porites colonies could not be distinguished from an airborne platform. Spectral differences among substrata are then exploited to predict the cover of reef substrata in ten 25-m(2) plots at nearby Motu Nuhi (max depth 8 m). The actual cover in these plots was determined in situ using quadrats with a 0.01-m(2) grid. Considerable disparity occurred between field and image-based measures of substrate cover within individual 25-m(2) quadrats. At this small scale, disparity, measured as the absolute difference in cover between field and remote-sensing methods, reached 25% in some substrata but was always less than 10% for living coral (99% of which consisted of Porites spp.). At the scale of the reef (all ten 25-m(2) quadrats), however, disparities in percent cover between imagery and field data were less than 10% for all substrata and extremely low for some classes (e.g. <3% for living Porites, recently dead Porites and Halimeda). The least accurately estimated substrata were sand and coralline red algae, which were overestimated by absolute values 7.9% and 6.6%, respectively. The precision of sampling was similar for field and remote-sensing methods: field methods required 19 plots to detect a 10% difference in coral cover among three reefs with a statistical power of 95%. Remote-sensing methods required 21 plots. However, it took 1 h to acquire imagery over 92,500 m(2) of reef, which represents 3,700 plots of 25 m(2) each, compared with 3 days to survey 10 such plots underwater. There were no significant differences in accuracy between 1-m(2) and 0.25-m(2) image resolutions, suggesting that the advantage of using smaller pixels is offset by reduced spectral information and an increase in noise (noise was observed to be 1.6-1.8 times greater in 0.25-m(2) pixels). We show that airborne remote sensing can be used to monitor coral and algal cover over large areas, providing that water is shallow and clear, and that brown fleshy macroalgae are scarce, that depth is known independently (e.g. from sonar survey).

Agardh and Sargassum mangarevense (Grunow) Setchell on heterogeneous Tahitian coral reefs using 4-meter resolution IKONOS satellite data	CORAL REEFS												Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum mangarevense (Halophyte, Sargassaceae) are two Fucales that have strong biotechnological potential for the cosmetic industries. To plan for the harvesting of these two species on Tahiti (French Polynesia, South Pacific Ocean) reefs, their total biomass is estimated for three morphologically different reefs using a combination of field data and three 4-m resolution IKONOS satellite images. Fieldwork provided mean algal cover for each of the main habitats of the reefs and a ubiquitous relationship linking percent cover and biomass. Images were used to map the spatial extent of the habitats. Image classification resulted in an overall habitat map accuracy of 70%. For the three reefs, the total biomass was 153,565 +/- 73,441, 561,718 +/- 192,956, and 215,203 +/- 75,012 tons of dry matter, which yielded a mean areal biomass of 0.173 +/- 0.083 kg.m(-2),0.133 +/- 0.046 kg.m(-2), and 0.193 +/- 0.067 kg.m(-2) (dry matter). The different total and areal biomass reflect different reef structures and the abundance of suitable substratum for algal settlement. Images reveal the spatial distribution of the algae, mostly located on the outer edges (crest and dense back-reef) of the reefs. Since percent cover data were collected during the cool season when algal densities are at their highest, the computed biomasses are maxima.

The mass of sediments in each of these plumes, which consist largely of neritic carbonate particles, was estimated using an algorithm for the calculation of suspended sediment concentrations. The Bermuda and Batabano plumes transported 0.22 and 1.2-1.35 million kg of sediment, respectively. The algorithm results were compared with the results from two other sediment mass algorithms and proved to be consistent. These results indicate the potential use of remote sensing to estimate carbonate flux from coral reefs and banks and atolls as an augmentation to in situ studies. In addition, the use of remote sensing data may improve estimates of the annual global carbonate sediment flux, a quantity important to models of global carbonate production and the global carbon cycle.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					39	47		10.1007/s00338-003-0355-9								WOS:000220937200005

Topographic variability is a prime component of habitat complexity, an ecological factor that both expresses and controls the abundance and distribution of many reef organisms. Following the acquisition of EAARL coverage over both mid-platform patch reefs and shelf-margin bank reefs within Biscayne National Park in August 2002, EAARL-based optical indices of topographic variability were evaluated at 15 patch reef and bank reef sites. Several sites were selected to match reefs previously evaluated in situ along underwater video and belt transects. The analysis used large populations of submarine topographic transects derived from the examination of closely spaced laser spot reflections along LIDAR raster scans. At all 15 sites, each LIDAR transect was evaluated separately to determine optical rugosity (Ro(tran)), and the average elevation difference between adjacent points (Av(deltaE(ap))). Further, the whole-site mean and maximum values of Ro(tran) and Av(deltaE(ap)) for the entire population of transects at each analysis site, along with their standard deviations, were calculated. This study revealed that the greater habitat complexity of inshore patch reefs versus outer bank reefs results in relative differences in topographic complexity that can be discerned in the laser returns. Accordingly, LIDAR sensing of optical rugosity is proposed as a complementary new technique for the rapid assessment of shallow coral reefs.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					48	59		10.1007/s00338-003-0365-7								WOS:000220937200006						
J	Hedley, JD; Mumby, PJ; Joyce, KE; Phinn, SR				Hedley, JD; Mumby, PJ; Joyce, KE; Phinn, SR			Spectral unmixing of coral reef benthos under ideal conditions	CORAL REEFS												Hyperspectral remote sensing has shown promise for detailed discrimination of coral reef substratum types, but, by necessity, it samples at pixel scales larger than reef substratum patch sizes. Spectral unmixing techniques have been successful in resolving subpixel areal cover in terrestrial environments. However, the application of spectral unmixing on coral reefs is fundamentally challenging, due not only to the water column, but also to the potentially large number of spectrally similar and ecologically significant end-member (substratum) classes involved. A controlled ex-situ experiment was conducted using field-spectrometer data to assess the accuracy of spectral unmixing techniques to estimate the areal cover of small-scale (<0.25 m(2)) assemblages of reef substrata (e.g., changes in cover between massive corals, branching corals, bleached corals, macroalgae, and coralline red algae). Mixture compositions were obtained precisely by analysis of digital images collected by a camera calibrated to the field of view of the spectrometer. Linear unmixing techniques were applied to derive estimates of substratum proportions using the full spectral resolution data and various transformations of it, including derivatives and down sampling (merging adjacent wavelengths into broader spectral bands). Comparison of actual and estimated substratum proportions indicate that spectral unmixing may be a practical approach for estimating subpixel-scale cover of coral reef substrata. In the most accurate treatment, coefficients of determination across all mixture sets were high for most end-member classes (37 of 52 cases with r(2) >0.64, i.e. r >0.8). The most successful analyses were based on derivatives of down-sampled data, implying that spectral unmixing benefits more from spectral smoothing and judicious choice of band locations than from high spectral resolution per se. Although these results show that changes in coral and algal cover can be determined by unmixing their spectra, the method is not yet an operational remote sensing tool. Primary empirical research is needed before taking the next step, which is to incorporate a water column, of variable depth, above the sea bed.

J	Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ; Apprill, A; Andrefouet, S				Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ; Apprill, A; Andrefouet, S			Spectral reflectance of coral	CORAL REEFS												Spectral reflectance (R) of corals is a fundamental parameter to coral reef remote sensing. We explore general trends as well as geographic and taxonomic variabilities of coral R using a data set consisting of 5,199 R's measured in situ at depths of up to 15 m for 195 coral colonies at 11 sites worldwide. Coral R ranges in magnitude from similar to0.5% at 400 nm to near 100% at 700 nm; mean coral R rises from similar to2.5% at 400-500 nm to similar to8% between 550 and 650 nm. All corals measured in this study exhibit one of two basic shapes of R, which we label the "brown" and "blue" modes. We postulate that brown-mode R is determined by pigment absorption solely by zooxanthellae, while blue-mode R arises through expression of a non-fluorescing coral-host pigment. Taxonomic and geographic variabilities are approximately equal to global variability, both in magnitude and shape, indicating that coral R is independent of taxonomic or geographic differences. We reason that this is to be expected, since R is determined by pigments that are conservative across geographic and taxonomic boundaries.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					84	95		10.1007/s00338-003-0350-1								WOS:000220937200009						
J	Ouillon, S; Douillet, P; Andrefouet, S				Ouillon, S; Douillet, P; Andrefouet, S			Coupling satellite data with in situ measurements and numerical modeling to study fine suspended-sediment transport: a study for the lagoon of New Caledonia	CORAL REEFS												This paper investigates the potential of remotely sensed data to map turbidity in a coral reef lagoon and to calibrate a numerical model of fine suspended-sediment transport. Simultaneous measurements of turbidity depth-profile and above-water spectral reflectance integrated according Landsat 7 ETM+ band 2 spectral sensitivity provide a linear regression relationship for the southwest lagoon of New Caledonia (r(2)=0.95, n=40). This relationship is applied to an empirically atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ image of the lagoon acquired on October 23, 2002. A comparison between Landsat estimates of turbidity and concurrent measurements at 14 stations indicates that the mean standard error in the satellite-estimated turbidity is 17.5%. The numerical model introduced in Douillet et al. (2001) is used to simulate the transport of fine suspended sediments in the lagoon in October 2002. A calibration of the erosion rate coefficient required by the model is proposed using in situ turbidity profiles and the remotely sensed turbidity field. In situ data are used to tune locally the erosion rate coefficient, while satellite data are used to determine its spatial zonation. We discuss necessary improvements in coupled studies of fine-sediment transport in coastal zones, namely relationships between turbidity and sediment concentration, integration of wave influence in the model, and correction of bottom reflection in satellite data processing.

The bleaching was not detected in band 3 (red), band 4 (near-infrared), or in the 1-m panchromatic band data. A total of 0.74 km(2) of bleached coral was identified, with detection occurring in waters as deep as 15 m. The procedure requires that one of the scenes be radiometrically normalized to match the reference scene prior to image differencing. A relative radiometric normalization was used in this case because variable cloud cover present in the image acquired during the bleaching event prevented reliable modeling of atmospheric effects. The success at coral bleaching detection at Keppel Islands represents both a "best-case" and a "cloud-challenged" scenario. It was a best-case scenario in that coral cover was extensive (70-90% live coral cover, mostly acroporids) and the bleaching level was extreme (92-95% of coral cover white bleached). It was a cloud-challenged scenario in terms of having extensive and highly variable cloud cover present in the image acquired during the bleaching event. Color difference images reveal extensive areas of bleached coral at sites away from our study area, indicating that this platform and methodology may be a valuable tool for mapping high coral cover areas during bleaching events. Additional studies and technique refinements would be required to test the detection limits of bleaching with IKONOS imagery or to develop a spectrally based bleaching detection index.

Yet, corals also mass spawn in the tropics, where SSTs vary little throughout the year. Here we show that the rise toward and fall from solar insolation maxima, which is the electromagnetic energy incident on the surface of the earth, coincide with coral spawning events in tropical Palau. Two insolation maxima (a consequence of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes) in the tropics lead to multiple spawning events per year. SSTs are poor predictors of coral spawning in the tropics. Multiple spawning events increase the rate of genetic recombination, which in turn may facilitate the likelihood of speciation and explain, in part, the high coral diversity in the tropics. We also show that mass spawning coincides with near-maximum solar insolation (5.0-7.2 kWh/m(2)/day) events from 33degreesN to 30degreesS in the western Pacific Ocean, and should be considered as one of the primary variables driving coral reproductive cycles.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					133	140		10.1007/s00338-003-0362-x								WOS:000220937200013

This study measured spectral reflectance from 17 species of western Caribbean reef biota including coral, algae, seagrasses, and sediments, as well as healthy and diseased coral. It sought to extend the spectral library of reef-associated species found in the literature and to test the spectral discrimination of a hierarchy of habitats, community groups, and species. We compared results from hyperspectral reflectance and derivative datasets to those simulated for the three visible multispectral wavebands of the IKONOS sensor. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths was identified by multivariate stepwise selection procedure (discriminant function analysis). Best discrimination at all levels was obtained using the derivative dataset based on 6-15 non-contiguous wavebands depending on the level of the classification, followed by the hyperspectral reflectance dataset which was based on as few as 2-4 non-contiguous wavebands. IKONOS wavebands performed worst. The best discriminating subset of wavelengths in the three classification resolutions, and particularly those of the medium resolution, was in agreement with those identified by Hochberg and Atkinson (2003) and Hochberg et al. (2003) for reef communities worldwide. At all levels of classification, reflectance wavebands selected by the analysis were similar to those reported in recent studies carried out elsewhere, confirming their applicability in different biogeographical regions. However the greater accuracies achieved using the derivative datasets suggests that hyperspectral data is required for the most accurate classification of reef biotic systems.

We classified and mapped seven morphological attributes of reefs (six marine habitats and reef-top islands) to 30-m depth at 30x30 m spatial resolution (pixel size) for the entire archipelago. The total archipelagic area (all coral reef and lagoon habitats) of the 16 atolls, five oceanic faros, and four oceanic platform reefs which comprise the Maldives is 21,372.72+/-1,068.64 km(2) (approx. 20% of the Maldives' Territorial Sea). A total of 2,041+/-10 distinct coral reef structures larger than 0.01 km(2) occur in the Maldives, covering an area of 4,493.85 km(2) (including enclosed reef lagoons and islands) to 30-m depth. Smaller areas of coral reef substratum cover another 19.29 km(2), bringing the total area of Maldivian coral reefs to 4,513.14+/-225.65 km(2). Shallow coral platforms thus occupy 21.1% of the total area of the archipelago (0.0052% of the EEZ area of the Maldives). Of these reefs, 538 are rim and oceanic reefs, covering 3,701.93 km(2) (82.5% of the total reef area), and 1,503 are patch reefs within the atoll lagoons, covering 791.92 km(2) (17.5% of the total reef area). Islands occupy only 5.1% of the total reef area. Mapping the Maldives' coral reefs at high spatial resolution is only possible with remote sensing and spatial analysis technologies. These greatly reduce the large uncertainty around current estimates of reef area. Our accurate measure of total reef area is only 50.6% of the current best estimate, a result having significant implications for predictions of the Maldives' reef productivity and response to global climate change. Here we present current best practice and compare the methods and measures with previous approaches.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					161	168		10.1007/s00338-003-0366-6								WOS:000220937200016

Because of new research this is questionable, which in our opinion, calls for a refinement to the original concept. We believe that the measure of variable fluorescence is pivotal to a new understanding. Our research enforces the growing conviction that the measurement of Fv/Fm can be interpreted as an analogue for nutrient stress. We measured variable fluorescence in axenic cultures at the CCMP at the Bigelow Laboratory. The Fv/ Fm of cultures, upon transfer to new media reached a maximum followed by a decline after approximately 30 days. The rate of decline does not appear to be species specific. Most of the clones remained relatively high after 30 days. The high Fv/Fm values observed in nutrient-replete cultures are not characteristic of the oligotrophic surface waters off Florida and the Bahamas, but are approached in the eutrophic waters of the Gulf of Maine. In contrast, Fv/Fm measurements of attached macroalgae and coral zooxanthellae are characteristically much higher than microalgae of either oligotrophic or eutrophic regions. Accordingly, we advance the case for interpretation of Fv/Fm in terms of nutrient stress in ecological studies and advocate that the old concept of new production should be modified.

J	Yamano, H; Tamura, M				Yamano, H; Tamura, M			Detection limits of coral reef bleaching by satellite remote sensing: Simulation and data analysis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring of coral reef bleaching has hitherto been based on regional-scale, in situ data. Larger-scale trends, however, must be determined using satellite-based observations. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images, the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and monitor coral reef bleaching is examined. The radiative transfer simulation indicates that the blue and green bands of Landsat TM can detect bleaching if at least 23% of the coral surface in a pixel has been bleached, assuming a Landsat TM pixel with a resolution of 30 x 30 in on shallow (less than 3 in deep) reef flats at Ishigaki Island, Japan. Assuming an area with an initial coral coverage of 100% and in which all corals became completely bleached, the bleaching could be detected at a depth of up to 17 in. The difference in reflectance of shallow sand and corals is compared by examining multitemporal Landsat TM images at Ishigaki Island, after normalizing for variations in atmospheric conditions, incident light, water depth, and the sensor's reaction to the radiance received. After the normalization, a severe bleaching event when 25-55% of coral coverage was bleached was detected, but a slight bleaching event when 15% of coral coverage was bleached was not detected. The simulation and data analysis agreed well with each other, and identified reliable limits for satellite remote sensing for detecting coral reef bleaching. Sensitivity analysis on solar zenith angle, aerosol (visibility) and water quality (Ch1 a concentration) quantified the effect of these factors on bleaching detection, and thus served as general guidelines for detecting coral reef bleaching. Spatial misregistration resulted in a high degree of uncertainty in the detection of changes at the edges of coral patches mainly because of the low (similar to30 m) spatial resolution of Landsat TM, indicating that detection of coral reef bleaching by Landsat TM is limited to extremely severe cases on a large homogeneous coral patch and shallow water depths. Satellite remote sensing of coral reef bleaching should be encouraged, however, because the development and deployment of advanced satellite sensors with high spatial resolution continue to progress.

This revolution of information is the result of heavy investment in new technology by governments and industry, rapid developments in computing power and storage, and easy dissemination of data over the internet. Today, remotely sensed data are available to virtually anyone with a desktop computer. Here, we review the status of one of the most popular areas of marine remote sensing research: coral reefs. Previous reviews have focused on the ability of remote sensing to map the structure and habitat composition of coral reefs, but have neglected to consider the physical environment in which reefs occur. We provide a holistic review of what can, might, and cannot be mapped using remote sensing at this time. We cover aspects of reef structure and health but also discuss the diversity of physical environmental data such as temperature, winds, solar radiation and water quality. There have been numerous recent advances in the remote sensing of reefs and we hope that this paper enhances awareness of the diverse data sources available, and helps practitioners identify realistic objectives for remote sensing in coral reef areas.

Spectral signatures of end-members are now relatively well known for predominant reef taxa (coral, algae) and for the background of the living communities (e.g. sediments). What remains unclear is whether the criteria for spectral discrimination between endmembers at the millimeter or centimeter scale remain valid when attempting to process images at several meters resolution. In other words, is it possible to scale-up spectral criteria of identification from species/organisms to communities? We address this issue with in situ and 'compact airborne spectrometer imager' (CASI) hyperspectral measurements of the tropical marine flora of 2 South Pacific Ocean coral reefs. Targets were the dominant algal species and communities encountered in the shallow (0 to 3 m) barrier and fringing reefs of Moorea Island and the outer margin of the rim of Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia). Stepwise wavelength selection and linear discriminant analysis highlighted the key non-redundant wavelengths necessary to achieve good separation between the predefined ecological groups. Comparison of the wavelengths identified from in situ and airborne measurements allowed definition of a subset of common wavelengths that were robust to changes in spatial scale and still provided excellent discrimination and classification accuracy between the ecological groups. These results suggest that continuous spectral signatures acquired in situ at the centimeter scale can be used to select key discrete wavelengths for remote-sensing observations of communities at the meter scale despite the spatial heterogeneity in benthic cover and the resulting spectral mixing.

Individual community components (biotic and geomorphologic bottom features) were first predicted and then classified into composite habitats. This approach differs from widely applied methods of direct classification based on remote sensing only. In situ coral reef community- condition assessment was first used to measure a response variable (percentage cover of habitat). Reef bottom features (topographic complexity, sand-sediment, rock-calcareous pavement and rubble) were then predicted using generalized additive models (GAMs) applied to continuous environmental maps, high-resolution Ikonos satellite images and a reef digital topographic model (DTM). Next, using GAMs on newly created bottom maps, models were fitted to predict coral community components (hard coral, sea-grass, algae, octocorals). At this stage, high-resolution maps of the geomorphologic and biotic components of the coral reef community at an experimental site (Akumal Reef in the Mexican Caribbean) were produced. Coral reef habitat maps were derived using GIS following a hierarchical classification procedure, and the resulting merged map depicting 8 habitats was compared against thematic maps created by traditional supervised classification. This general approach sets a baseline for future studies involving more complex spatial and ecological predictions on coral reefs.

In the French Antilles, about 80% of the coral communities are more or less damaged. A study has been undertaken in order to describe and understand the dynamics of this recent evolution. The aim of this study was also to detect the ecological descriptors able to characterize the state of health of coral communities by remote sensing. The species richness of coral communities, the most simple indicator of the biodiversity of the studied area, as well as diversity indices, revealed to be descriptors particularly stable and very little reactive to the degradation of the reef community. The coverage rate of the bottom by corals may be very different from one reef to another one or from one area to another one on the same reef. This does not necessarily imply the existence of a difference in the state of health between the communities. The most relevant criteria revealed to be associated with the state of health of coral colonies and the abundance of juvenile recruits. For the other components of the reef benthic community, the most pertinent descriptor was the ratio of the bottom covered with algal turf (healthy reefs) to that occupied by macro-algae (damaged reefs). These ecological descriptors revealed to be easy to estimate in a reproducible manner by observers who are not specialists of reef ecology. This extends the possibilities of monitoring the health of coral reefs through the assistance of non-scientific personnel (staff of the marine reserves, volunteers, etc.).																	0249-7395						2004	59	1-2					113	121										WOS:000220011300013						
J	Philipson, P; Lindell, T				Philipson, P; Lindell, T			Can coral reefs be monitored from space?	AMBIO												The dramatic bleaching events on the coral reefs recently have enhanced the need for environmental monitoring. Remote sensing is an important constituent for monitoring of reefs, and an invaluable complement to field observations. This paper discusses the possibilities and limitations of present high resolution satellites for mapping and monitoring coral reefs. The sensors with the best spatial and radiometric resolution available today, e.g. IKONOS, can be useful for mapping and monitoring of reefs, but they are too costly for global surveys. However, our coral bleaching studies indicate that massive bleaching could be detected even from satellites with lower resolution, like Landsat, SPOT, and IRS. They could also be useful for coarser, from a spatial and thematic point of view, global mapping and updating purposes. A more detailed monitoring requires both better spatial resolution and spectral resolution than today's sensors. In the future, it is necessary to construct a more reef specific sensor with a few specially selected narrow bands and a good spatial, radiometric and temporal resolution.																	0044-7447					DEC	2003	32	8					586	593		10.1639/0044-7447(2003)032[0586:CCRBMF]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000189317900014	15049357

Coral reefs are often remote, relatively large and shallow. Thus, optical remote sensing techniques provide an efficient and cost-effective approach to mapping and monitoring the condition of reefs. We tested the hypothesis that in-situ spectral signatures, together with water column attenuation measurements, satellite imagery and Geographical Information System, can effectively differentiate reef substrates. In situ upwelling radiances were collected for coarse descriptive habitat types near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas between 17 July and 27 July, 1998. Down-looking spectral scans from 300-750 nm were taken 1 m above the substrate and 1 m below the water surface, using a LiCor-1800 underwater spectroradiometer. Principal component analysis of upwelling radiances indicated that wavelengths from 515-580 nm are most useful in distinguishing between substrates. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) multi-spectral imagery was geo-registered and an ISODATA unsupervised classification was used to delineate reef features and associated communities. Using this method, we achieved an overall accuracy of 74% for coarse descriptive resolution mapping of seven substrate types (i.e. ocean, deep sand, shallow sand, deep coral, shallow coral, seagrass, and mixed sand and seagrass) within an area of 590 km(2) near Lee Stocking Island.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	2003	24	13					2627	2639		10.1080/0143116031000066990								WOS:000184005900005

Attempts to measure Earth's diverse objects have generated a wide range of platform alternatives, from geostationary satellites to low-flying aircraft. Now several additional options possessing unique attributes are available: the International Space Station (ISS) and Un-inhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This paper explores some of the tradeoffs among these alternatives for the special problem of remotely sensing the littoral zone, but especially the shallow ecosystems. Though the surface area of the littoral zone is relatively large, it is geographically disbursed and somewhat linear. Also, the spatial, spectral and temporal variability of ecosystems in this zone is very high, and signals are masked by the overlying water column. Ideally, a frequent revisit time would be desirable to monitor their health and changing condition. These characteristics place important constraints on platform choice as one tries to design a system to monitor these critical ecosystems and provide useful information for managing them. This paper discusses these tradeoff issues as offered mainly by three platform choices: free-flying satellites, ISS, UAVs and other aircraft.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	2003	24	13					2785	2804		10.1080/0143116031000066963								WOS:000184005900013						
J	Malthus, TJ; Mumby, PJ				Malthus, TJ; Mumby, PJ			Remote sensing of the coastal zone: an overview and priorities for future research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper uses the Special Issue of the International Journal of Remote Sensing on Remote Sensing of the Coastal Marine Environment to highlight recent advances in knowledge of remote sensing of the coastal zone and to define a series of priorities where future research into the application should be addressed. Advances were identified in the benefit of high spatial and spectral resolution data and complementary remote sensing techniques (e.g. optical and acoustic, optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)). Further benefits are identified in rapid and more frequent data acquisition, faster and more automated processing and a greater sampling intensity over conventional field-based techniques. Issues associated with adoption of remotely sensed data for management are discussed. Research priorities include the need for improved understanding and description of biotope classes and the functional interpretation of biotope maps and continued developments in understanding the radiative transfer properties of coastal environments. New knowledge is required on spatial and temporal variations of water column optical properties and its constituents. Methods for the best approaches to processing hyperspectral data require further investigation, as does the need for further testing of hyperspectral sensors for bottom type discrimination using data obtained at space-borne altitudes. Areas of value which continue to remain poorly investigated include the improvements to be gained from synergistic use of multi-wavelength remote sensing approaches, change detection techniques and multi-temporal comparisons and knowledge-based approaches to improve classification. The importance of specifically dedicated coastal zone sensors is discussed, as is alternative means of deployment (e.g. International Space Station (ISS) and Un-inhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)). The potential role of airborne digital photography for marine mapping is highlighted. The lack of accurate near-shore bathymetric data is identified as a key limitation in the application of geospatial data to coastal environments.

J	Gonzalez, A; Torruco, D; Liceaga, A; Ordaz, J				Gonzalez, A; Torruco, D; Liceaga, A; Ordaz, J			The shallow and deep bathymetry of the Banco Chinchorro reef in the Mexican Caribbean	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												This paper presents the use of two complementary remote sensing techniques in the Banco Chinchorro: satellite image and echosound. A cartographic relation was established between the shallower reef depths recorded by Landsat-MSS and those of greater depth recorded with echosound. A bathymetric map of the shallow lagoon areas and reeferest was generated from the Landsat-MSS image using exponential correspondence between reef depths and corrected digital values in the image. The reef lagoon exhibits a bathymetric gradient from I in in the north to 25 in in the south. The echosound data show a pinnacle with depths greater than 300 m. Largely due to intense coral growth, the most pronounced slopes are found near the leeward reeferest, and the more gradual on the windward margin. The use of these two complementary remote sensing techniques proved an efficient tool for characterizing reef morphology when depth strongly affects the efficacy of one or the other technique. The analytical delimitation of this complex reef is increasingly important because of its recent designation as a biosphere reserve area by the Mexican government. The present study is a pioneering effort that could be used as a pilot in future administrative, conservation, and sustainable management studies.																	0007-4977					JUL	2003	73	1					15	22										WOS:000187322800003

This problem is common in wide field-of-view images where there is limited control on acquisition conditions other than cloud cover. To eliminate most of these wave and glint patterns, we use the near-infrared band, which exhibits maximum absorption and minimal water leaving radiance over clear waters, to characterize the spatial distribution of relative glint intensity, which is then scaled by absolute glint intensities in each of the visible bands. The result is subtracted from the visible bands, thus filtering out glint effects. Corrected visible bands clearly reveal seabed structural features obscured in the original data. Before- and after-correction classifications of an Ikonos image of Lee Stocking Island (Bahamas) reveal an improvement of user's accuracies for critical benthic habitat classes such as coral-dominated habitat (46.8% versus 60.5%) or dense seagrass beds (31.7% versus 52.1%). This technique offers potential to use previously discarded sections of high spatial resolution airborne or satellite images of optically shallow water for mapping substrate features.																	0196-2892					JUL	2003	41	7	2				1724	1729		10.1109/TGRS.2003.815408								WOS:000184820100003						
J	Bouvet, G; Ferraris, J; Andrefouet, S				Bouvet, G; Ferraris, J; Andrefouet, S			Evaluation of large-scale unsupervised classification of New Caledonia reef ecosystems using Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												The capacity of the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor to classify the shallow benthic ecosytems of New Caledonia (South Pacific) is tested using a novel unsupervised classification method. The classes are defined by using a set of multiple spectral decision rules based on the image spectral bands. A general model is applied to the entire Southwest lagoon (5500 km(2)) and tested on three representative sites: a section of the barrier reef, a cay reef flat rich in corals, and a cay reef flat rich in algae and seagrass beds. In the latter one, the classification results are compared with a locally optimized model, with aerial color photographs and extensive ground-truthed observations. Results show that a reconnaissance of the main benthic habitats in shallow areas (<5 m depth) is possible, at a geomorphological scale for coral reef structure and at a habitat scale for seagrass beds. However, results directly issued from the model must be cautiously interpreted according to empirical spatial rules, especially to avoid confusion between coral slopes and shallow dense seagrass.

J	Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ; Andrefouet, S				Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ; Andrefouet, S			Spectral reflectance of coral reef bottom-types worldwide and implications for coral reef remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Coral reef benthic communities are mosaics of individual bottom-types that are distinguished by their taxonomic composition and functional roles in the ecosystem. Knowledge of community structure is essential to understanding many reef processes. To develop techniques for identification and mapping of reef bottom-types using remote sensing, we measured 13, 100 in situ optical reflectance spectra (400-700 nm, 1-nm intervals) of 12 basic reef bottom-types in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans: fleshy (1) brown, (2) green, and (3) red algae; non-fleshy (4) encrusting calcareous and (5) turf algae; (6) bleached, (7) blue, and (8) brown hermatypic coral; (9) soft/gorgonian coral; (10) seagrass; (11) terrigenous mud; and (12) carbonate sand. Each bottom-type exhibits characteristic spectral reflectance features that are conservative across biogeographic regions. Most notable are the brightness of carbonate sand and local extrema near 570 nm in blue (minimum) and brown (maximum) corals. Classification function analyses for the 12 bottom-types achieve mean accuracies of 83%, 76%, and 71% for full-spectrum data (301-wavelength), 52-wavelength, and 14-wavelength subsets, respectively. The distinguishing spectral features for the 12 bottom-types exist in well-defined, narrow (10-20 nm) wavelength ranges and are ubiquitous throughout the world. We reason that spectral reflectance features arise primarily as a result of spectral absorption processes. Radiative transfer modeling shows that in typically clear coral reef waters, dark substrates such as corals have a depth-of-detection limit on the order of 10-20 in. Our results provide the foundation for design of a sensor with the purpose of assessing the global status of coral reefs.

J	Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ				Hochberg, EJ; Atkinson, MJ			Capabilities of remote sensors to classify coral, algae, and sand as pure and mixed spectra	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We investigate the abilities of seven remote sensors to classify coral, algae, and carbonate sand based on 10,632 reflectance spectra measured in situ on reefs around the world. Discriminant and classification analyses demonstrate that full-resolution (1 nm) spectra provide very good spectral separation of the bottom-types. We assess the spectral capabilities of the sensors by applying to the in situ spectra the spectral responses of two airborne hyperspectral sensors (AAHIS and AVIRIS), three satellite broadband multispectral sensors (Ikonos, Landsat-ETM+ and SPOT-HRV), and two hypothetical satellite narrowband multispectral sensors (Proto and CRESPO). Classification analyses of the simulated sensor-specific spectra produce overall classification accuracy rates of 98%, 98%, 93%, 91%, 64%, 58%, and 50% for AAHIS, AVIRIS, Proto, CRESPO, Ikonos, Landsat-ETM+, and SPOT-HRV, respectively. Analyses of linearly mixed sensor-specific spectra reveal that the hyperspectral and narrowband multispectral sensors have the ability to discriminate between coral and algae across many levels of mixing, while the broadband multispectral sensors do not. Applying the results of the general mixing analyses to a specific spatial organization of coral, algae, and sand indicates that the hyperspectral sensors accurately estimate areal cover of the bottom-types regardless of pixel resolution. The narrowband multispectral sensors overestimate coral cover by 11-15%, while the broadband sensors underestimate algae cover by 7-29% and overestimate coral cover by 24-103%. We conclude that currently available satellite sensors are inadequate for assessment of global coral reef status, but that it is both necessary and possible to design a sensor system suited to the task.

Low salinity water can transport natural and manmade river-borne contaminants into the sea, and can directly stress marine ecosystems that are adapted to higher salinity levels. An efficient method of mapping surface salinity distribution over large ocean areas is required to address such environmental issues. We describe here an investigation of the utility of airborne remote sensing of sea surface salinity using an L-band passive microwave radiometer. The study combined aircraft overflights of the scanning low frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR) with shipboard and in situ instrument deployments to map surface and subsurface salinity distributions, respectively, in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. The goals of the investigation were (a) to assess the performance of the airborne salinity mapper; (b) to use the maps and in situ data to develop an integrated description of the structure and zone of influence of a river plume under prevailing monsoon weather conditions; and (c) to determine the extent to which the sea surface salinity distribution expressed the subsurface structure. The SLFMR was found to have sufficient precision (1 psu) and accuracy ( similar to 3 psu) to provide a useful description of plumes emanating from estuaries of moderate discharge levels with a salinity range of 16 to 32 psu in the open sea. The aircraft surveys provided a means of rapidly assessing the spatial extent of the surface salinity distribution of the plume, while in situ data revealed subsurface structure detail and provided essential validation data for the SLFMR. The combined approach allowed us to efficiently determine the structure and zone of influence of the plume, and demonstrated the utility of sea surface salinity remote sensing for studying coastal circulation in tropical seas.

From 1984 to the present, Landsat-5 thematic mapper (TM) and Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) images provide the longest time series available for change detection analysis over coral reefs. A time series of four Landsat-5 images and one Landsat-7 image spanning 1984-2000 was analyzed to detect changes in "coral-dominated", "sand", "algae", and "substrate" benthic classes for Carysfort Reef in the Florida Keys. To properly analyze this time series, a set of corrections was undertaken, which included noise-reduction correction, atmospheric correction, and TM-ETM+ data normalization. All images were classified with a Mahalanobis distance classifier using statistics from the 1984 image to identify the four benthic classes. The results were compared with historical ground-truthing data, a combination of high-resolution aerial photography and Ikonos satellite data, and results from a temporal texture change detection analysis. All data sets provided consistent results, with an extreme loss in coral cover between 1982 and 2000. The Landsat time series provided across-time progression and locations of the coral-dominated zones for all of Carysfort Reef. This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of combining Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ images for coral reef community scale change detection studies at a decadal scale. It opens the possibility of a cost-effective larger scale study, which could include an entire reef tract.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012	Hallock Muller, Pamela/0000-0002-1813-0482												0703-8992					APR	2003	29	2					201	209		10.5589/m02-095								WOS:000186749300006						
J	Isoun, E; Fletcher, C; Frazer, N; Gradie, J				Isoun, E; Fletcher, C; Frazer, N; Gradie, J			Multi-spectral mapping of reef bathymetry and coral cover; Kailua Bay, Hawaii	CORAL REEFS												We used high-resolution, airborne, digital, multi-spectral imagery to map bathymetry and the percent of living coral in the nearshore marine environment of Kailua Bay, Oahu, Hawai'i. Three spectral bands, with centers at 488, 551, and 577 nm (each with a full-width half maximum of 10 nm), were selected for good water transmission and good coral/sand/algae discrimination. However, the third band (577 nm) was not used in the depth and bottom-type solutions. The spatial resolution of 1 m per pixel was selected to balance resolution with the size of the total data set. A radiative transfer model accounting for the optical effects of the atmosphere, ocean surface, water, and reflection off the ocean bottom substrates was applied to the multi-spectral images, normalizing multiple images to one another for a mosaic that spans the bay. Atmospheric parameters in the radiative transfer model were estimated from published values measured for similar environments. Water-attenuation coefficients for the model were determined from the observed spectral data values over the sand bottom type in the bay. Relative depth and bottom-type coefficients were derived by a method most simply described as the "differencing" of two spectral bands. Accuracy exceeding 85% in predicted depth was achieved to a depth of 25 in. Depth prediction errors were assessed with comparison to hydrographic survey data. Classification of bottom-type coefficients into seven "percent living coral" categories results in 77% overall accuracy tested by diver-obtained line-intercept transect data (ground truth). Bottom-type coefficients derived by the model were corrected for atmospheric and ocean conditions on the date of collection, so spatial changes in bathymetry and "percent living coral" through time can be analyzed and related to environmental factors. The radiative transfer model and the "differencing" method used to solve for depth and "percent living coral" can be applied to any airborne, passive remote sensing digital data with appropriate spectral bands.																	0722-4028					APR	2003	22	1					68	82		10.1007/s00338-003-0287-4								WOS:000183018300014						
J	Finkl, CW; Krupa, SL				Finkl, Charles W.; Krupa, Steve L.			Environmental impacts of coastal-plain activities on sandy beach systems: Hazards, perception and mitigation	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Managed sandy beach environments along developed shores often appear safe and healthy because obvious hazards such as beach erosion and flooding are considered within the purview of various mitigation programs. A range of insidious and generally unseen hazards, mostly related to pollution, often pose greater threats to the wellbeing of beach systems than do the highly visible, well publicized shoreline retreat and inundation events. Some unseen hazards, such as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) laden with nutrients from. agro-urban activities on adjacent coastal plains,,are pervasive, processes of environmental degradation that occur so gradually that sequential impacts escape public attention. The contribution of SGDs to the coastal hydrologic regime is occasionally recognized in association with crescendo events associated with marine algal blooms that degrade water quality, bottom habitats, and coral reef ecology. Because the real dangers of SGD are probably unknown at this time, it is essential to initiate seepage meter studies of the already known high levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that are discharged to beach and nearshore environments. Locations of some of the larger submarine freshwater springs along the southeast Florida inner continental shelf are generally known, although volumes of flow have historically been reduced by reduction of head on the coastal plain. Submarine. groundwater provides, on a continual basis, the most direct nutrient linkage to nearshore environments. The insidious nature of the problem requires specialized detection techniques that incorporate site inspection of rock outcrop and reef morphology (for submarine springs and seeps), satellite and airborne remote sensing (coastal morphology, turbidity plumes), physical seepage measurement in situ, monitoring wells, and mini-piezometers to measure hydraulic flow. Discharges of surface water into estuaries exacerbate SGD-related pollution, as do sewage spills and outfall. pipes that discharge in the open ocean fronting beaches. Groundwater discharges for Palm Beach County are, for example, estimated at 1,659 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1). Total N in groundwater below the coastal plain adjacent to remnant Everglades averages about 1.3 mg l(-1). Groundwater nutrient fluxes to the coast are 5727 and 414 metric tons per year for N and P, respectively. Surface water contributions for N and P are respectively 2,473 and 197 metric tons per year. Nutrient delivery to beach and nearshore environments is a serious problem that threatens coastal water quality which in turn will impact beach-related activities. The full impact of the problem has yet to surface because it takes about 5 to 8 decades for groundwater from the interior parts of the coastal plain to reach the nearshore zone. Pollution of groundwaters has increased over the past five decades due to higher doses of fertilizers on croplands and runoff from expanding urban areas. The environmental quality of beach systems along this developed shore is clearly at risk from continuous pollution via nutrient-laden SGD.																	0749-0208					SPR	2003					35		132	150										WOS:000202961200014

US EPA, Off Res & Dev EMAP				Coral reef communities are threatened worldwide. Resource managers urgently need indicators of the biological condition of reef environments that can relate data acquired through remote-sensing, water-quality and benthic-community monitoring to stress responses in reef organisms. The "FORAM" (Foraminifera in Reef Assessment and Monitoring) Index (FI) is based on 30 years of research on reef sediments and reef-dwelling larger foraminifers. These shelled protists are ideal indicator organisms because: . Foraminifers are widely used as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators in many contexts; . Reef-building, zooxanthellate corals and foraminifers with algal symbionts have similar water-quality requirements; . The relatively short life spans of foraminifers as compared with long-lived colonial corals facilitate differentiation between long-term water-quality decline and episodic stress events; . Foraminifers are relatively small and abundant, permitting statistically significant sample sizes to be collected quickly and relatively inexpensively, ideally as a component of comprehensive monitoring programs; and . Collection of foraminifers has minimal impact on reef resources. USEPA guidelines for ecological indicators are used to evaluate the FI. Data required are foraminiferal assemblages from surface sediments of reef-associated environments. The FI provides resource managers with a simple procedure for determining the suitability of benthic environments for communities dominated by algal symbiotic organisms. The FI can be applied independently, or incorporated into existing or planned monitoring efforts. The simple calculations require limited computer capabilities and therefore can be applied readily to reef-associated environments worldwide. In addition, the foraminiferal shells collected can be subjected to morphometric and geochemical analyses in areas of suspected heavy-metal pollution, and the data sets for the index can be used with other monitoring data in detailed multidimensional assessments.

J	Ackleson, SG				Ackleson, SG			Light in shallow waters: A brief research review	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Until recently, optical processes in shallow water, where a large portion of solar photons penetrate to the ocean floor, has received little attention outside of a relatively small number of modeling and remote sensing investigations. In the open ocean, scales of variability in relation to optical attenuation length often permit the treatment of the in-water light field as a one-dimensional, depth-dependent problem. In shallow waters hosting productive benthic ecosystems, such as coral reefs or seagrasses, the in-water light field is often three-dimensional in character. In the past decade, quantitative investigations of benthic optical properties and the resulting shallow-water light field have been conducted, fueled by a variety of new sensors designed specifically to address the shallow water problem. Recent publications, as well as the papers contained in this volume, illustrate the rich diversity and interdisciplinary nature of shallow-water optical problems and highlight important issues that should attract closer attention in the future.																	0024-3590					JAN	2003	48	1	2				323	328		10.4319/lo.2003.48.1_part_2.0323								WOS:000182049800001						
J	Hedley, JD; Mumby, PJ				Hedley, JD; Mumby, PJ			A remote sensing method for resolving depth and subpixel composition of aquatic benthos	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The problem of subpixel heterogeneity in cover types has been addressed in terrestrial environments by the application of linear spectral unmixing techniques. However, in aquatic systems the interceding depth of water causes the apparent reflectance of the substrate to diverge from a linear model, and if depth is unknown these methods cannot be applied. A new technique is presented in which the conventional spectral unmixing method has been modified to calculate depth at each pixel in addition to the proportions of substrate type. The technique requires knowledge of the reflectance spectra of m pure substrata in n (n > m) spectral bands at depth 0 and the water diffuse attenuation coefficients for the site in the same bands. Depth, z, can be entirely unknown. The method is comparable to "classical" spectral unmixing and proceeds by performing a Gaussian elimination for endmember quantities and then solving the remaining nonlinear function of z for f(z) = 0 by successive approximation. Computer-based models are used to test the technique with realistic water diffuse attenuation coefficients and random spectra and actual spectra of coral reef substrata. The robustness of the technique is assessed against three forms of introduced error: measurement errors on the spectra to be unmixed, differences between the true endmember spectra and those used in the analysis, and measurement error on the water diffuse attenuation coefficients. The results of these tests imply the technique is sufficiently robust for use on real data. Furthermore, spectral unmixing of aquatic systems appears to be relatively insensitive to inaccuracies in depth estimation and offers great utility for benthic mapping.

J	Kutser, T; Dekker, AG; Skirving, W				Kutser, T; Dekker, AG; Skirving, W			Modeling spectral discrimination of Great Barrier Reef benthic communities by remote sensing instruments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Remote sensing can monitor coral reef health, provided the benthic substrates are spectrally resolvable through the water column and surface. We studied the separability of eight substrate types (live coral, dead coral, soft coral, sand, brown algae, green algae, red algae, cyanobacteria) and the influence of the overlying water. A spectral library of coral reef benthic communities was collected from the Great Barrier Reef. Hydrolight 4.1 was used to simulate remote sensing reflectances. One multispectral and two hyperspectral sensors were simulated: the Advanced Land Imager (ALI, space borne), Hyperion (space borne), and HyMap (airborne, at 1.5 km altitude). Spectral radiance differences above different substrates were calculated to estimate what substrates can be separated and to what depth of waters this can be done. The dominant features in reflectance spectra of,coral reef substrates are in the wavelength range 550-700 nm. Distinguishing various substrates in this part of the spectrum is limited to water depths of 5-6 m due to attenuation of the water. Below 550 nm some substrates have spectral features that are detectable by hyperspectral instruments even in deeper waters. Broader band instruments (e.g., ALI, Landsat) can provide some information about the substrate type. Sensors with a broad bandwidth provide fewer possibilities for developing analytical remote sensing algorithms for resolving significant numbers of substrate types in waters with variable depth. Hyperspectral sensors increase our capability to detect narrow spectral features that can be used for resolving various benthic communities.

J	Louchard, EM; Reid, RP; Stephens, FC; Davis, CO; Leathers, RA; Downes, TV				Louchard, EM; Reid, RP; Stephens, FC; Davis, CO; Leathers, RA; Downes, TV			Optical remote sensing of benthic habitats and bathymetry in coastal environments at Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas: A comparative spectral classification approach	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Remote sensing is a valuable tool for rapid identification of benthic features in coastal environments. Past applications have been limited, however, by multispectral models that are typically difficult to apply when bottom types are heterogeneous and complex. We attempt to overcome these limitations by using a spectral library of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), generated through radiative transfer computations, to classify image pixels according to bottom type and water depth. R-rs spectra were calculated for water epths ranging from 0.5 to 20 m at 0.5- to 1.0-m depth intervals using measured reflectance spectra from sediment, seagrass, and pavement bottom types and inherent optical properties of the water. To verify the library, computed upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance spectra were compared to field measurements obtained with a hyperspectral tethered spectral radiometer buoy (TSRB). Comparisons between simulated spectra and TSRB data showed close matches in signal shape and magnitude. The library classification method was tested on hyperspectral data collected using a portable hyperspectral imager for low light spectroscopy (PHILLS) airborne sensor near Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas. Two hyperspectral images were classified using a minimum-distance method. Comparisons with ground truth data indicate that library classification can be successful at identifying bottom type and water depth information from hyperspectral imagery. With the addition of diverse sediments types and different species of corals, seagrass, and algae, spectral libraries will have the potential to serve as valuable tools for identifying characteristic wavelengths that can be incorporated into bottom classification and bathymetry algorithms.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2003	48	1	2				511	521		10.4319/lo.2003.48.1_part_2.0511								WOS:000182049800020

Previous attempts at subsurface feature discrimination with satellite remote sensing have been limited in accuracy due to the effects of pixel mixing associated with poor spatial resolutions. While aerial reconnaissance may offer higher spatial resolutions than satellite sensors, it is often limited by the high costs of planning and implementing the missions, image rectification, area that can be covered, and repeat coverage. In this study, the Ikonos satellite with a 4- by 4-m spatial resolution in the multispectral bands was used as a tool for subsurface feature identification. The Single-Image Normalization Using Histogram Adjustment was used for atmospheric corrections on the imagery. Classification was peiformed using bands 1, 2, and 3 (blue, green, and red) to maximize the water-penetration capabilities of the sensor. An accuracy assessment of the classification results was performed using in situ data collected at 62 points one day prior to the image being acquired. It Was concluded that the Ikonos data were useful for discriminating sand, coral reef (at two depth intervals), and seagrass features (providing overall accuracies of 89 percent each for the two study areas). However, error still remained in discriminating small, diverse patch-reef features. This error (producers accuracy 67 percent) was found in the "Reef less than or equal to 5 m" class and was primarily attributed to the diversity of this spectral class, which may lead to a spectral signature based on the dominant cover type in a given pixel.

J	Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ				Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ			Mapping marine environments with IKONOS imagery: enhanced spatial resolution can deliver greater thematic accuracy	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The IKONOS 2 satellite was launched in late 1999 and carries the first commercial multispectral instrument to achieve 4 in spatial resolution. The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing because of the large areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, supervise image classification, and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy. For the high-resolution IKONOS imagery, pixel sizes were small enough to allow within-habitat textural information to be added to the classification. Making full use of this textural information in supervised classifications significantly improved (P<.01) thematic map accuracy for fine-level habitat discrimination (13 classes). Although significantly (P<.001) and almost 20% more accurate than Landsat TM, like other satellite-borne sensors, IKONOS data were unable adequately to discriminate 13 categories of coral, algal, and seagrass habitats (overall accuracy 50%). Comparison with CASI in a restricted area where only nine of these habitats were represented indicated that CASI (81% user accuracy) was significantly (P<.01) more accurate than IKONOS (64% user accuracy). Comparisons of IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI along a transect in the maximally penetrating blue part of the spectrum suggest that the poor descriptive resolution of satellite sensors is partly due to loss of radiance contrast, presumably as a result of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. Problems of scattering, coupled with the relatively poor spectral resolution of satellite sensors such as IKONOS, currently constrain their use for fine-level marine habitat mapping. IKONOS data enabled significantly more accurate mapping at a geomorphological scale (e.g., coral vs. seagrass) than other satellite sensors except Landsat TM. While reasonably high accuracies (75%) were obtained for such coarse-level habitat mapping, Landsat TM was more cost-effective than IKONOS, even for small (50 km(2)) areas. IKONOS may only be a cost-effective option if (i) independent field data are available to identify habitat patches, (ii) the area to be mapped is fairly small (<500 km(2)), and (iii) small-scale (<10 in) habitat dynamics are to be monitored. IKONOS data are unlikely to identify deterioration in coral reefs directly because changes in community structure cannot be resolved spectrally from the satellite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The spatial extent of benthic microalgae on Heron Reef (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia) was mapped using data from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper sensor. integrated with field measurements of sediment chlorophyll concentration and reflectance. Field-measured sediment chlorophyll concentrations. 2 ranging from 23-1.153 mg chl a m(2), were classified into low, medium, and high concentration classes (1-170, 171-290, and > 291 mg chl a m(-2)) using a K-means clustering algorithm. The mapping process assumed that areas in the Thematic Mapper image exhibiting similar reflectance levels in red and blue bands would correspond to areas of similar chlorophyll a levels. Regions of homogenous reflectance values corresponding to low, medium, and high chlorophyll levels were identified over the reef sediment zone by applying a standard image classification algorithm to the Thematic Mapper image. The resulting distribution map revealed large-scale ( > 1 km 2) patterns in chlorophyll a levels throughout the sediment zone of Heron Reef. Reef-wide estimates of chlorophyll a distribution indicate that benthic Microalgae may constitute up to 20% of the total benthic chlorophyll a at Heron Reef. and thus contribute significantly to total primary productivity on the reef.

J	Holden, H; LeDrew, E				Holden, H; LeDrew, E			Measuring and modeling water column effects on hyperspectral reflectance in a coral reef environment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Much attention has been given to hyperspectral remote sensing of benthic habitat recently to quantity spectral signatures, examine linear mixing, map geomorphic zonation, or identify temporal change with varying degrees of confidence and success. Relatively less attention has been given to the effects of the water column on the hyperspectral signal given various water depths and bottom types. Hyperspectral in situ reflectance was measured at both the top and bottom of the water column to examine the effects of the intervening water layer. A radiative transfer model was used to predict the top-of-the-water column reflectance from a large number of close-range measured bottom spectra. The measured and modeled hyperspectral reflectance spectra were examined separately to compare the degree to which different substrate types can be discriminated once the water column is "added" to the spectra. The classification accuracy assessment indicated that the ability to discriminate benthic habitat based on hyperspectral characteristics is limited when the effects of the water column are included as the kappa statistic drops from 0.70 to 0.49.

The mechanisms by which platform-derived neritic carbonates are transported to the pelagic water column and deep benthos are significant to the geological history of shallow carbonate platforms and the role of neritic carbonates in the marine carbon cycle. Aerial photography and satellite remote sensing observations of the Bahamas Banks and Bermuda indicate that major sediment transport events are caused by strong surface winds associated with storm systems. While this mechanism is not unexpected, these observations provide an initial assessment of the potential ability of remote sensing to detect these events and quantify the offshore mass transport of neritic carbonate.
