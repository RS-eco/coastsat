A method for identifying Sound Scattering Layers and extracting key characteristics	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Mid-trophic level water-column (pelagic) marine communities comprise millions of tonnes of zooplankton and micronekton that form dense and geographically extensive layers, known as sound scattering layers (SSLs) when observed acoustically. SSLs are ubiquitous in the global ocean, and individual layers can span entire ocean basins. Many SSLs exhibit clear diel vertical migration behaviour. Vertical migrations contribute substantially to the biological pump', such that SSLs have important global biogeochemical roles: SSLs are important conduits for vertical energy and nutrient flow. Ship-based remote sensing of SSLs using acoustic instruments (echosounders) enables their shape and density to be quantified, but despite SSLs being discovered in the 1940s, there is no consistent method for identifying or characterising SSLs. This hampers ecological and biogeographical studies of SSLs. We have developed an automated and reproducible method for SSL identification and characterisation, the sound scattering layer extraction method (SSLEM). It functions independently of echosounder frequency and the spatial scale (vertical and horizontal) of the data. Here we demonstrate the SSLEM through its application to identify SSLs in data gathered to a depth of 1000m using 38 kHz hull-mounted echosounders in the south-west Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea. SSLs were identified in the water column as horizontally extensive echoes that were above background noise. For each identified SSL, a set of 9 quantitative SSL metrics' (describing their shape, dynamics and acoustic backscattering distribution) were determined, enabling inferences to be made concerning the spatial arrangement, distribution and heterogeneity of the biological community. The method was validated by comparing its output to a set of visually derived SSL metrics that were evaluated independently by 8 students. The SSLEM outperformed the by-eye analysis, identifying three times the number of SSLs and with greater validity; 95% of SSLs identified by the SSLEM were deemed valid, compared to 75% by the students. In the same way that data obtained from satellites have enabled the study and characterisation of global phytoplankton distribution and production, we envisage that the SSLEM will facilitate robust, repeatable and quantitative analysis of the growing body of SSL observations arising from underway-acoustic observations, enhancing our understanding of global ocean function.

Philip P.; Decalf, Carole			Sediment-rich meltwater plumes and ice-proximal fans at the margins of modern and ancient tidewater glaciers: Observations and modelling	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Turbid meltwater plumes and ice-proximal fans occur where subglacial streams reach the grounded marine margins of modern and ancient tidewater glaciers. However, the spacing and temporal stability of these subglacial channels is poorly understood. This has significant implications for understanding the geometry and distribution of Quaternary and ancient ice-proximal fans that can form important aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs. Remote-sensing and numerical-modelling techniques are applied to the 200km long marine margin of a Svalbard ice cap, Austfonna, to quantify turbid meltwater-plume distribution and predict its temporal stability. Results are combined with observations from geophysical data close to the modern ice front to refine existing depositional models for ice-proximal fans. Plumes are spaced ca 3km apart and their distribution along the ice front is stable over decades. Numerical modelling also predicts the drainage pattern and meltwater discharge beneath the ice cap; modelled water-routing patterns are in reasonable agreement with satellite-mapped plume locations. However, glacial retreat of several kilometres over the past 40years has limited build-up of significant ice-proximal fans. A single fan and moraine ridge is noted from marine-geophysical surveys. Closer to the ice front there are smaller recessional moraines and polygonal sediment lobes but no identifiable fans. Schematic models of ice-proximal deposits represent varying glacier-terminus stability: (i) stable terminus where meltwater sedimentation produces an ice-proximal fan; (ii) quasi-stable terminus, where glacier readvance pushes or thrusts up ice-proximal deposits into a morainal bank; and (iii) retreating terminus, with short still-stands, allowing only small sediment lobes to build up at melt-stream portals. These modern investigations are complemented with outcrop and subsurface observations and numerical modelling of an ancient, Ordovician glacial system. Thick turbidite successions and large fans in the Late Ordovician suggest either high-magnitude events or sustained high discharge, consistent with a relatively mild palaeo-glacial setting for the former North African ice sheet.																	0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2015	62	6					1665	1692		10.1111/sed.12198								WOS:000362555200006

U.; Bhatpuria, Dhyey; Chauhan, Prakash			Signature analysis of satellite derived SSHa, SST and chlorophyll concentration and their linkage with marine fishery resources	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												This study aims to understand patterns, persistence and interrelationship between satellite derived oceanic variables. Time series near-synchronous sea surface height anomaly (SSHa), chlorophyll-a concentration (CC) and sea surface temperature (SST) derived from Topex/Poseidon altimeter, Oceansat-OCM and NOAA-AVHRR, respectively, were used for integrative signature analysis. Three dimensional surface and two dimensional spatial profiles of these variables were generated to understand the spatio-temporal variability. SST and SSHa were co-varying and CC shows an inverse correlation. The time series data analysis indicated bio-physical closely coupled processes. The patterns of variability in CC signatures were found to be associated with SSHa and SST signatures. High fish catch in terms of CPUE (catch-per-unit-effort) were found in low SSHa and corresponding high chlorophyll concentration area during the year 1998-2004 in the Northern Arabian Sea. SSHa signatures were detected earlier than CC and SST. Lower SSHa signatures were inferred as advanced information of the occurrence of productive sites in near future. This study would be useful to understand large scale bio-physical coupled processes for fishery resources exploration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Temporal changes in total and size-fractioned chlorophyll-a in surface waters of three provinces in the Atlantic Ocean (September to November) between 2003 and 2010	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Phytoplankton total chlorophyll concentration (TCHLa) and phytoplankton size structure are two important ecological indicators in biological oceanography. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment data, collected from surface waters along the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT), we examine temporal changes in TCHLa and phytoplankton size class (PSC: micro-, nano- and pico-phytoplankton) between 2003 and 2010 (September to November cruises only), in three ecological provinces of the Atlantic Ocean. The HPLC data indicate no significant change in TCHLa in northern and equatorial provinces, and an increase in the southern province. These changes were not significantly different to changes in TCHLa derived using satellite ocean-colour data over the same study period. Despite no change in AMT TCHLa in northern and equatorial provinces, significant differences in PSC were observed, related to changes in key diagnostic pigments (fucoxanthin, peridinin, 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin and zeaxanthin), with an increase in small cells (nano- and picophytoplankton) and a decrease in larger cells (micro-phytoplankton). When fitting a three-component model of phytoplankton size structure - designed to quantify the relationship between PSC and TCHLa to each AMT cruise, model parameters varied over the study period. Changes in the relationship between PSC and TCHLa have wide implications in ecology and marine biogeochemistry, and provide key information for the development and use of empirical ocean-colour algorithms. Results illustrate the importance of maintaining a time-series of in-situ observations in remote regions of the ocean, such as that acquired in the AMT programme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence for and relationship between recent distributed extension and halokinesis in the Farasan Islands, southern Red Sea, Saudi Arabia	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												This paper presents a structural evolution study of the Farasan Bank using an integration of field work, remote sensing data, and regional Bouguer gravity data interpretation. The architecture of the Farasan Islands is influenced by normal faults parallel to the Red Sea rift axis delineating a series of graben and asymmetric half-graben structures as well as salt domes. Geological data suggest that the negative gravity anomaly over the Farasan Bank reflects thick salt deposits. The gravity data shows a general NW-SE trend with the main negative anomaly coincident with the Farasan Islands. Gravity data together with seismic reflection data suggest that salt diapirs are elongated and parallel to the main rift orientation (NW-SE). This indicates that salt deposition and diapirism was controlled by rift-related basement structures. Forward modeling of gravity data constrained by marine seismic reflection interpretation reveals that the evaporites directly overlie the basement in most places. No pre-evaporite formation was detected. Integration of the modeling with field observations and interpretations suggests that the Farasan Islands are in an area of active extension. Extension and salt diapirism on the flank of the mid-ocean ridge is likely to be synchronous with renewed spreading at 5 Ma.

A SWIR based algorithm to retrieve total suspended matter in extremely turbid waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In ocean colour remote sensing, the use of Near Infra Red (NIR) spectral bands for the retrieval of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration in turbid and highly turbid waters has proven to be successful. In extremely turbid waters (TSM > 100 mg L-1) however, these bands are less sensitive to increases in TSM. Here it is proposed to use Short Wave Infra Red (SWIR) spectral bands between 1000 and 1300 nm for these extreme cases. This SWIR spectral region is subdivided into two regions, SWIR-I (1000 nm to 1200 nm) and SWIR-II (1200 nm to 1300 nm) which correspond to local minima in the pure water absorption spectrum. For both spectral regions the water reflectance signal was measured in situ with an ASD spectrometer in three different extremely turbid estuarine sites: Scheldt (Belgium), Gironde (France), and Rio de la Plata (Argentina), along with the TSM concentration. A measurable water reflectance was observed for all sites in SWIR-I, while in the SWIR-II region the signal was not significant compared to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of current Ocean Colour (OC) sensors. For the spectral band at 1020 nm (present in Ocean and Land Colour Instrument - OLCI, onboard Sentinel-3) and at 1071 nm, an empirical single band TSM algorithm is defined which is valid for both the Gironde and Scheldt estuarine sites. This means that a single algorithm can be applied for both sites without expensive recalibration. The relationship between TSM and SWIR reflectance at 1020 and 1071 nm is linear and did not show any saturation for the concentrations measured here (up to 1400 mg L-1), while saturation was observed for the NIR wavelengths, as expected. Hence, for extremely turbid waters it is advised to switch from NIR to SWIR4 wavelengths to estimate TSM concentration. This was demonstrated for an airborne hyperspectral dataset (Airborne Prism Experiment, APEX) from the Gironde estuary having several spectral bands in the SVVIR-I. The empirical single band SWIR TSM algorithm was applied to the atmospherically corrected scene providing a TSM concentration map of the Gironde from mouth to more upstream with concentrations expected in this region ranging from a few to several hundreds mg L-1. These results, i.e. the existence of a single relationship for the Scheldt and Gironde, not showing any decrease of sensitivity, highlights the importance of having SWIR bands in future ocean colour sensors for studying extremely turbid rivers, coastal areas and estuaries in the world. A further implication of these results is that there is a TSM limit for application of atmospheric correction algorithms which assume zero SWIR marine reflectance. That limit is defined here as function of wavelength and sensor noise level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Validation of standard and alternative satellite ocean-color chlorophyll products off Western Iberia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) product validation off the Western Iberian coast is here undertaken by directly comparing remote sensing data with in situ surface reference values. Both standard and recently developed alternative algorithms are considered for match-up data analysis. The investigated standard products are those produced by the MERIS (algal 1 and algal 2) and MODIS (OC3M) algorithms. The alternative data products include those generated within the CoastColour Project and Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) funded by ESA, as well as a neural net model trained with field measurements collected in the Atlantic off Portugal (MLPATLP). Statistical analyses showed that satellite Chl estimates tend to be larger than in situ reference values. The study also revealed that a non-uniform Chl distribution in the water column can be a concurring factor to the documented overestimation tendency when considering larger optical depth match-up stations. Among standard remote sensing products, MODIS OC3M and MERIS algal 2 yield the best agreement with in situ data. The performance of MLPATLP highlights the capability of regional solutions to further improve Chl retrieval by accounting for environmental specificities. Results also demonstrate the relevance of oceanographic regions such as the Nazare area to evaluate how complex hydrodynamic conditions can influence the quality of Chl products.

Geographical variability in the controls of giant kelp biomass dynamics	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimCoastal marine environments experience a wide range of biotic and abiotic forces that can limit and punctuate the geographical range and abundance of species through time. Determining the relative strengths and nonlinear effects of these processes is vital to understanding the biogeographical structures of species. There has been an ongoing discussion concerning the relative importance of these processes in controlling the dynamics of giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, an important structure-forming species on shallow reefs in the eastern Pacific. We used novel spatial time-series that span nearly three decades to determine the dominant drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass and the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate across the dominant range of the giant kelp in North America. LocationNear-shore areas from Ano Nuevo, California, to the USA/Mexico border. MethodsWe employed empirical orthogonal functions to elucidate the primary drivers of giant kelp canopy biomass across space and time and then fit generalized additive and linear models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance of each of these potential drivers along the c. 1500-km study region over a 25-year period. ResultsWave disturbance, nitrate availability and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation were the most important environmental predictors of giant kelp canopy biomass, explaining 24.5%, 12.7% and 6.1% of the variance, respectively. Environmental drivers of canopy biomass exhibited profound spatial differences in relative effect sizes. Nonlinear effect shapes of each potential biomass driver were determined, which explained these spatial differences. Main conclusionsThese large-scale analyses help to reconcile the local-scale conclusions of canopy biomass dynamics across the California coastline and show that these dynamics differ predictably in space and time in accordance with local and regional differences in environmental drivers. By characterizing the nonlinear effects of these drivers, we identified spatio-temporal patterns of processes that cannot be detected by remote sensing.																	0305-0270	1365-2699				OCT	2015	42	10					2010	2021		10.1111/jbi.12550								WOS:000361181900019

About three quarters of these toxic blooms are caused by dinoflagellate species. One dinoflagellate species, i.e., Karenia brevis, blooms nearly every year in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly on the West Florida Shelf (WFS), where these blooms cause millions of dollars in socioeconomic damage. In this letter, we use the red band difference (RBD) bloom detection technique for detection of low backscattering phytoplankton blooms, such as K. brevis, and conduct time-series analyses of the spatial extent of these blooms using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) monthly mean data spanning July 2002 (sensor inception) to September 2014. The time-series results show that the RBD successfully detects the documented HABs in the region, illustrating the seasonal and interannual variability, including the extensive blooms of 2005 and 2014.																	1545-598X	1558-0571				OCT	2015	12	10					2080	2084		10.1109/LGRS.2015.2448453								WOS:000359576400015

Ecology of the Ocean Sunfish, Mola mola, in the southern California Current System	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The common ocean sunfish, Mola mola, occupies a unique position in the eastern Pacific Ocean and the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) as the world's heaviest, most fecund bony fish, and one of the most abundant gelativores. M. mola frequently occur as bycatch in fisheries worldwide and comprise the greatest portion of the bycatch in California's large-mesh drift gillnet fishery. In this first long-term tagging study of any ocean sunfish species in the eastern Pacific, 15 M. mola (99 cm to 200 cm total length) were tagged in the southern California Bight (SCB) between 2003 and 2010 using 14 satellite pop-off archival tags (PATs) and one Fastloc Mk10 GPS tag. Ten tags provided positional data for a cumulative dataset of 349 tracking days during the months of july through March. Thirteen tags provided temperature and depth data. All M. mola remained within similar to 300 km of the coast, and nearly all exhibited seasonal movement between the SCB and adjacent waters off northern and central Baja California, Mexico. No tagged individuals were tracked north of the SCB. Tag depth data showed diel vertical migration and occasional deep (>500 m) dives. Data from the Fastloc GPS tag allowed close examination of the relationship between the movements of the largest tagged ocean sunfish (2 m TL) and fine-scale oceanographic features. Near-instantaneous satellite sea surface temperature images showed this individual associated with upwelling fronts along its migration path, which exceeded 800 km and ranged from 6 to 128 km from the coast. Tag depth data showed active use of the water column within the frontal zones. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images demonstrated that surface slicks, which often indicate convergent circulation, coincided with this type of front. Zooplankton tows in the southern region of tracking off central Baja California, Mexico revealed dense populations of salps toward the warm side of these fronts. Satellite tag and ecosystem data suggest that bio-physical interactions in coastal upwelling fronts create favorable foraging habitat. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Trajectory modeling of modern dust transport to the Southern Ocean and Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Aerosol deposition over the Southern Ocean and Antarctica has the potential to alter marine productivity and thus ocean carbon uptake while also impacting radiative balance due to scattering and absorption from atmospheric particulates. Quantification of modern emission, transport, and deposition of terrestrial dust and other airborne material from Southern Hemisphere sources is challenging due to low emission levels and poor detection from remote sensing platforms. Here forward trajectory modeling is used to explore atmospheric transport, independent of deposition processes, from 1979 to 2013. Trajectories are initiated from known arid dust source areas in South America (Patagonia), Australia, and southern Africa, with detailed consideration of New Zealand as a potential source. Results suggest that Patagonian and New Zealand dust and other aerosol emissions share strong atmospheric transport during all seasons, allowing even potentially small New Zealand emissions to contribute significantly to Southern Ocean and Antarctic aerosol loading. We find that atmospheric transport controlling distribution of dust and other aerosols shows distinct spatial variability. New Zealand and Patagonia rapidly contribute a high proportion of trajectories to West Antarctica, while in interior East Antarctica, source contributions are limited and highly mixed. The sensitivity of existing deep ice core sites to modern atmospheric transport is discussed. Finally, interannual variability of poleward trajectory extension over the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean highlights the association of both tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature and high-latitude wind variability (e.g., the Southern Annular Mode) with transport of dust and other aerosols to the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.

BIS exhibits more energetic tidal mixing, and water column stratification remains weak but persists year-round due to nearby estuarine exchange flow; RIS is less influenced by estuaries, and more seasonal with strong stratification in summer. We compared annual cycles of phytoplankton biomass and primary production in BIS and RIS using measurements (surface chlorophyll, C-14 primary production), primary pro duction models (Webb/Platt and BZE models), and satellite ocean color products. During 22 mo of sampling, measured surface chlorophyll was not significantly different between BIS (mean = 1.86 mg m(-3)) and RIS (1.69 mg m(-3)), and bimodal peaks of phytoplankton biomass and production occurred concurrently in both Sounds. In contrast, a 12 yr ocean-color based chlorophyll time series indicated higher long-term average surface chlorophyll in the more well-mixed system (BIS, mean = 1.50 mg m(-3); RIS, mean = 0.86 mg m-3). BIS annual primary production (318 to 329 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) was higher than RIS (239 to 256 g C m(-2) yr(-1); p < 0.001). These differences were most apparent during the summer, concurrent with the largest differences in water column stratification. Phytoplankton bloom phenology was driven by physical processes, with chlorophyll significantly related to water column stratification (r = -0.51, p = 0.01), depth of the euphotic zone (r = -0.54, p = 0.05), and surface water salinity (r = 0.54, p = 0.04). Primary production was correlated with surface water temperature (r = 0.57, p = 0.03) but the mechanisms underlying production differences between the Sounds remain unresolved. We hypothesize that different hydrographies give rise to different productivity between the Sounds.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				SEP 15	2015	535						29	45		10.3354/meps11386								WOS:000361694000003

Spatial scale and geographic context in benthic habitat mapping: review and future directions	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Understanding the effects of scale is essential to the understanding of natural ecosystems, particularly in marine environments where sampling is more limited and sporadic than in terrestrial environments. Despite its recognized importance, scale is rarely considered in benthic habitat mapping studies. Lack of explicit statement of scale in the literature is an impediment to better characterization of seafloor pattern and process. This review paper highlights the importance of incorporating ecological scaling and geographical theories in benthic habitat mapping. It reviews notions of ecological scale and benthic habitat mapping, in addition to the way spatial scale influences patterns and processes in benthic habitats. We address how scale is represented in geographic data, how it influences their analysis, and consequently how it influences our understanding of seafloor ecosystems. We conclude that quantification of ecological processes at multiple scales using spatial statistics is needed to gain a better characterization of species-habitat relationships. We offer recommendations on more effective practices in benthic habitat mapping, including sampling that covers multiple spatial scales and that includes as many environmental variables as possible, adopting continuum-based habitat characterization approaches, using statistical analyses that consider the spatial nature of data, and explicit statement of the scale at which the research was conducted. We recommend a set of improved standards for defining benthic habitat.

These blooms are relatively easy to detect optically because of the surface concentration of cells, the presence of phycocyanin pigments, and the elevated backscatter associated with cell size and the presence of gas vacuoles. Major challenges limiting the use of remote sensing have been, first, that many of these water bodies are small relative to the spatial resolution of ocean color satellites, and second, even with a bright algal target, the spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and repeat time for terrestrial satellites is often inadequate. The next generation of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors begin to address these issues with both increased spatial and spectral resolution. Weekly monitoring of Pinto Lake, California has demonstrated that this small water body provides an ideal testbed for development and application of algorithms applicable for legacy and next-generation sensors. Pinto Lake experiences seasonal nearly monospecific blooms with a pronounced species succession. Biomass (as chlorophyll) within Pinto Lake seasonally ranges from similar to 1 to 1000 mu g/L. Pinto Lake has been within the flight lines for several recent airborne missions, including the HyspIRI Preparatory Flight Campaign, and is often targeted for HICO acquisitions. Using these data we demonstrate that spectral-shape algorithms requiring minimal atmospheric correction can be used across a range of legacy sensors to detect cyanobacterial blooms and that, with the availability of high spectral resolution data and appropriate atmospheric correction, it is possible to separate the cyanobacterial genera Aphanizomenon and Microcystis. In California Aphanizomenon is typically non-toxic and blooms prior to toxin-producing Micro cystis, thus leading to the potential for an early warning system based on the identification of algal types.

Hyperspectral discrimination of floating mats of seagrass wrack and the macroalgae Sargassum in coastal waters of Greater Florida Bay using airborne remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Floating mats of vegetation serve to transfer biomass, nutrients and energy across marine habitats and alter the spectral properties of the sea surface. Here, spectral measurements from the airborne Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer (PRISM) imagery at 1-m resolution and experimental mesocosms were used to assess the hyperspectral properties of the macroalgae Sargassum and aggregations of the seagrass Syringodium filiforme wrack in Greater Florida Bay. A simple Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) effectively discriminated the presence of vegetation floating on the sea surface. The Sargassum Index derived from reflectance ratios at 650 and 630 nm was used to effectively discriminate Sargassum from Syringodium wrack. Mesocosm spectral measurements revealed an initial lowering of wrack reflectance over the first 3 days followed by a subsequent increase in reflectance over the next 8 days. The age of the wrack estimated from 2 to 5 days was best characterized using narrowband indices of the water absorption feature at 930 and 990 nm potentially from increasing water content in wrack leaves over time. Hyperspectral imagery (<10 nm) was necessary to differentiate between these two types of floating vegetation and assess age of the wrack. PRISM imagery revealed seagrass wrack organized in 5-35 m spaced windrows caused by Langmuir circulation. Wrack was only detectable at 60 m pixel resolution when densities were high and individual windrows were in close proximity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They were conducted at two sites with similar lithostratigraphic characteristics but different exposures to marine actions (the former being an abandoned cliff and the latter an active cliff). They provide a quantification of the production of debris with centimeter precision (from +/- 0.01 to 0.04 m). These surveys provided three major outcomes: 1) cliff retreat rates were measured at high spatial resolution with retreat values, unsurprisingly, 3-4 times higher for an active cliff than for an abandoned cliff. This result highlights that marine actions should be seen as not only a transport agent but also a particularly effective erosion agent; 2) a significant proportion of debris fall production (about 25%) in the total active cliff retreat was identified; and 3) one of the modalities of retreat was visualized as the creation of a basal notch, which propagates instability towards the upper part of the cliff face. Later, this instability generates rock falls coming from the whole cliff face. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A systematic approach to modeling marine mammal habitat in arctic regions using the lifetime and multi-generational Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) of Alaska Native hunters is developed to address this gap. The approach uses lifetime and cross-generational knowledge of subsistence hunters and their harvest data in the place of observational knowledge gained from Western scientific field surveys of marine mammal sightings. TEK information for mid-June to October was transformed to seal presence/pseudo-absence and used to train Classification Tree Analyses of environmental predictor variables to predict suitable habitat for bearded seals in the Bering Strait region. Predictor variables were derived from a suite of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric remote sensing products, transformed using trend analysis techniques, and aggregated. A Kappa of 0.883 was achieved for habitat classifications. The TEK information used is spatially restricted, but provides a viable, replicable data source that can replace or complement Western scientific observational data.																	2072-4292					SEP	2015	7	9					11863	11886		10.3390/rs70911863								WOS:000362511400042

An assessment of phytoplankton primary productivity in the Arctic Ocean from satellite ocean color/in situ chlorophyll-a based models	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We investigated 32 net primary productivity (NPP) models by assessing skills to reproduce integrated NPP in the Arctic Ocean. The models were provided with two sources each of surface chlorophyll-a concentration (chlorophyll), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), sea surface temperature (SST), and mixed-layer depth (MLD). The models were most sensitive to uncertainties in surface chlorophyll, generally performing better with in situ chlorophyll than with satellite-derived values. They were much less sensitive to uncertainties in PAR, SST, and MLD, possibly due to relatively narrow ranges of input data and/or relatively little difference between input data sources. Regardless of type or complexity, most of the models were not able to fully reproduce the variability of in situ NPP, whereas some of them exhibited almost no bias (i.e., reproduced the mean of in situ NPP). The models performed relatively well in low-productivity seasons as well as in sea ice-covered/deep-water regions. Depth-resolved models correlated more with in situ NPP than other model types, but had a greater tendency to overestimate mean NPP whereas absorption-based models exhibited the lowest bias associated with weaker correlation. The models performed better when a subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum (SCM) was absent. As a group, the models overestimated mean NPP, however this was partly offset by some models underestimating NPP when a SCM was present. Our study suggests that NPP models need to be carefully tuned for the Arctic Ocean because most of the models performing relatively well were those that used Arctic-relevant parameters.

Meteorological regimes modulating dust outbreaks in southwest Asia: The role of pressure anomaly and Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone on the 1-3 July 2014 case	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The present work examines the characteristics (source regions, pathways, vertical profiles) as well as the meteorological conditions and the role of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during a dust event on 1-3 July 2014 over southwest (SW) Asia. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, meteorological and satellite remote sensing (MOD'S, Meteosat, CALIPSO) observations are utilized. The major dust storm (AOD(550) up to 1.5-2.0) was generated in the southern Karakum desert in Turkmenistan as a result of intense north winds (Levar), due to enhanced pressure gradient between the Caspian Sea and Hindu Kush Mountains. The dust storm was vertically extended up to 5 km over the arid terrain of SW Asia, as a consequence of the deep mixing layer and increased convection, while over northern Arabian Sea it was mixed with another dust plume coming from Arabia and marine aerosols due to strong monsoon winds within the boundary layer. The regional topography, variations in pressure, monsoon circulation and the position of the ITCZ play a decisive role on modulation of the wind field, dust-storm pathways and vertical distribution of dust. Enhanced knowledge of atmospheric circulation and processes responsible for dust export over SW Asia and Arabian Sea in linkage to the Levar wind and Indian summer monsoon is essential for improving dust forecasts and simulations over the region.

On the variability of tidal fronts on a macrotidal continental shelf, Northern Patagonia, Argentina	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Tidal fronts are associated with the transition between homogeneous and vertically stratified water and are characterized by the simultaneous availability of light and nutrients that enhance the growth of marine productivity. We study the variability in the position of two tidal fronts located in Patagonia Argentina: the San Matias and Valdes fronts. The rate of tidal dissipation in these regions is among the highest of the world oceans. The study is based on the analysis of over 1200 satellite derived sea surface temperature images. The results indicate that the mean monthly position of both fronts is strongly linked to the characteristics of the bottom topography. In response to increasing surface heat flux the fronts displace toward shallower areas. Similarly, a slight displacement towards deeper waters is observed when the heat flux decreases. High frequency variability is revealed by the standard deviation around monthly averages. At the mouth of the San Matias gulf, the front location variability in the spring-neap cycle is around 10 km, while east of the Valdes Peninsula the fortnightly cycle is masked by high frequency fluctuations (similar to 30 km) governed by meanders and meso-scale filaments. A simple conceptual model is proposed which suggests that the mean frontal position is determined by the bottom topography while its seasonal variability is driven by the surface heat flux, and the front intensity is modulated by the spring-neap transition.

J	Huang, Z; Feng, M				Huang, Zhi; Feng, Ming			Remotely sensed spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Leeuwin Current is an anomalous poleward-flowing eastern boundary current that transports warm tropical waters southward and imposes significant ecological influences on the coastal marine ecosystems off Western Australia. In this study, we attempt to map the spatial structure of the sea surface temperature (SST) signature of the Leeuwin Current using MODIS satellite data, which is used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current for the period July 2002 to December 2012. A topographic Position Index (TPI) method is used to map the Leeuwin Current's SST signature from the MODIS SST images. The semi-automatic classification process involves automatically identifying areas occupied by warm SST waters of the Leeuwin Current and manually discarding detached Leeuwin Current features. The TPI mapping results enabled us to quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST signature, including its spatial structure, extent, and cross-shelf migration, as well as its associated surface chlorophyll a characteristics. This study showed that the TPI mapping is able to capture the complex spatial structures of the Leeuwin Current, including its meanders, offshoots and eddies along its path, as reflected in the SST data. Using an eddy-resolving, data-assimilating numerical ocean model, we were able to relate the Leeuwin Current's SST signature with its surface current speed signature, though generally the speed signature is on the offshore side of the SST signature by about 25 to 30 km. Temporal wavelet analyses indicated that the variability of the Leeuwin Current's SST structure is dominated by seasonal cycle. During austral winter, the warm SST signature of the current is close to the shelf break, having greater spatial extent and higher chlorophyll a concentrations. In contrast, during austral summer, the SST signature of the current moves offshore, with reduced spatial extent and chlorophyll a concentrations. The Leeuwin Current also has notable inter-annual variation, to a large extent in response to ENSO variability in the Pacific. In El Nino years the current's SST signature tends to have reduced spatial extent, move further inshore, and increase its chlorophyll a concentrations. The opposite occurs during the La Nina years, especially after the unprecedented 2010-11 La Nina/Ningaloo Nino event when there was a significant reduction of the surface chlorophyll a concentration within the Leeuwin Current's SST signature. The mapping method developed in this study will be also useful in detecting climate driven variability of other ocean boundary current systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Global retrieval of marine and terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence at its red peak using hyperspectral top of atmosphere radiance measurements: Feasibility study and first results	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll fluorescence is directly linked to the physiology of phytoplankton or plants. Here, we present a new satellite remote sensing approach to retrieve chlorophyll fluorescence at its red peak (similar to 685 nm) by using measurements from the hyperspectral instruments SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). This method, which is based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique, was used to exploit narrow spectral structures resulting from the filling-in of the Fraunhofer Fe I line, which originates from fluorescence. The reference spectra for chlorophyll fluorescence were calculated by the coupled ocean atmosphere radiative transfer model SCIATRAN. We compared our results on marine chlorophyll fluorescence observations with the MODIS Terra normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH) product for the average of years 2003-2011 and year 2009. Our method also enables the retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence above land vegetation scenes. The results for the fluorescence observed above terrestrial vegetation for July and December 2009 were compared to MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The comparisons show good spatial agreement between different retrievals providing evidence for the good performance of our algorithm. The method presented is generic and can be applied to other hyperspectral instruments in the future. Having established the retrieval technique, extensive studies of chlorophyll fluorescence will improve global knowledge on physiology and photosynthetic efficiency, in both the marine and terrestrial realms, and its dependence on environmental factors.

Can citizen science contribute to the evidence-base that underpins marine policy?	MARINE POLICY												Marine legislation is becoming ever more complex, so new cost-effective ways of obtaining and processing increasingly large data sets are required to support evidence-based policy making. Citizen science is one solution, but the uptake of the evidence generated by citizens among policy makers is often limited. Here, the importance of citizen science in delivery of the evidence-base that underpins marine policy was assessed using a series of case-studies. There was no consistent rationale for developing policy-relevant citizen science, but drivers included: lack of existing data, difficulty in collecting data by other means, the use of citizen science data by other organisations, and the capabilities of volunteers. Challenges to the uptake of marine citizen science were identified from policy-maker, scientist and citizen perspectives, and these related to data quality, data access, motivation of volunteers, and physical location. Citizen science has good potential to contribute to the evidence-base alongside traditional monitoring, remote sensing, and modelling, but only if outputs from citizen science projects are judged individually on quality. If this is the case, citizen science has an important role in delivery and understanding of future marine policy, but is only one part of an integrated solution.

J	Lee, ZP; Marra, J; Perry, MJ; Kahru, M				Lee, Zhongping; Marra, John; Perry, Mary Jane; Kahru, Mati			Estimating oceanic primary productivity from ocean color remote sensing: A strategic assessment	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												It has long been realized that approaches using satellite ocean-color remote sensing are the only feasible means to quantify primary productivity (PP) adequately for the global ocean. Through decades of dedicated efforts and with the help of various satellite ocean-color missions, great progresses have been achieved in obtaining global PP as well as its spatial and temporal variations. However, there still exist wide differences between satellite estimations and in situ measurements, as well as large discrepancies among results from different models. The reasons for these large differences are many, which include uncertainties in measurements, errors in satellite-derived products, and limitations in the modeling approaches. Unlike previous round-robin reports on PP modeling where the performance of specific models was evaluated and compared, here we try to provide a candid overview of three primary modeling strategies and the nature of present satellite ocean-color products. We further highlight aspects where efforts should be focused in the coming years, with the overarching goal of reducing the gaps between satellite modeling and in situ measurements.

Hydrosalinity and environmental land degradation assessment of the East Nile Delta region, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Environmental land degradation is a major impediment to the utilization of land in many arid and semi-arid regions of the World and is a major issue in the East Nile Delta (END), Egypt. Waterlogging and salt-affected soil problems have serious implications for irrigated areas leading to socio-economic and agricultural development problems. In the present study, timely and accurate detection of land degradation through remote sensing and hydrosalinity indicators, along with their characteristics and severity classification in a GIS environment, has been undertaken to provide, determine, assess and map reliable geo-information of environmental land degradation. This research deals with an assessment of hydrosalinity and environmental land degradation based on some new, but simple and practical, approaches for assessing salinity and spread of land degradation through digital image processing, geo-statistics and geochemistry. This analysis utilises Landsat 8, ASTER GDEM data, hydrochemical and statistical analyses using a GIS, together with other field collected data sets for the same date of May 2014. The hydrosalinity mapping and the statistical data analysis of TDS, major ions, groundwater grouping and hydrochemical facies and also water table maps between 1994 and 2014 reveals that the main sources of groundwater recharge and water bodies are mostly attributed to the continuous seepage from newly cultivated lands. The new flow regime is the main contributing factor to the rising water level, water salinity and waterlogging problems. Moreover, the spatial distribution of major ion content could be attributed to the leaching of aquifer materials along the flow path (Na, Ca, and Cl), the study area affected by agricultural pollution (Mg and SO4) and the leaching process which acts on the easily soluble evaporate-rich fluvio-marine sediments of a shallow aquifer (NO3 and PO4). The spatial distribution maps of the physico-chemical properties of soil such as EC, pH, SAR, Na, Cl, SO4 and Ca are compared with remote sensing salinity indices and then integrated to classify and map the salinity and salt-affected soil by using GIS tools. These indicate that increases in soil salinity levels pose a serious threat to sustainable agricultural developments that requires special attention to maintain an appropriate soil-water plant relationship by providing an adequate drainage system. The identification of land degradation mitigation measures requires thorough knowledge of the ground and surface water, human activities, and the salinity dynamics of the study area.

Here, we (1) review the current status of the diversity and distribution of coastal ecosystems in BCS, (2) assess the composition and coverage of these ecosystems in PNAs, and (3) identify coastal ecosystems of special interest for conservation. The combination of spatial analysis techniques was carried out using LandSat TM images and GIS processing, considering ecoregions and ecosystems in the coastal zone, as well as through the application of an ecosystem diversity index. In the BCS coastal zone, 11 ecosystems were identified: scrub, coastal water body, riparian, bare soil, halophyte, beach, salt flat, mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, and seagrass. The ecosystem diversity in BCS results from the coastal features that differentiate the Pacific and the Gulf coasts. PNAs include 17 % of coastal ecosystems. Bahia Magdalena (Pacific) and Bahia Concepcin (Gulf of California), which are key for conservation (including mangroves and seagrasses), should be considered either for classification as PNAs or for inclusion in coastal management programs. The combination of remote sensing and GIS with biogeographic and ecosystemic approaches in our study enabled to determine ecosystem diversity and set coastal conservation priorities in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Specifically, coastal ecosystems that are not currently included within PNAs and which should be considered as conservation priorities were identified.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				AUG	2015	19	4					609	619		10.1007/s11852-015-0411-y								WOS:000362017900015						
J	Yu, Y; Xu, HP; Xu, CW				Yu, Yang; Xu, Huiping; Xu, Changwei			Development of a Plug-and-Play Monitoring System for Cabled Observatories in the East China Sea	SENSORS												Seafloor observatories enable long term, continuous and multidisciplinary observations, promising major breakthroughs in marine environment research. The effort to remotely control in situ multidisciplinary equipment performing individual and cooperative tasks is both a challenge and a guarantee for the stable operations of functional observatories. With China starting to establish ocean observatory sensor networks, in this study we describe a monitoring system for cabled observatories in the East China Sea (ESOMS) that enables this effort in a plug and play way. An information oriented monitoring architecture for ESOMS was first introduced, derived from a layered control model for ocean observatory sensor network. The architecture contained three components and enabled bidirectional information flow of observation data and commands, based on which architecture components were designed to enable plug-and-play control within related model layers. A control method enabled by general junction box (GJB) and ocean sensor markup language (OSML) was thus proposed as the plug-and-play solution for implementing ESOMS. The GJB-OSML enabled control method (GOE Control Method) mainly actualized two processes, one of which was that the in situ GJB interfaced and represented every attached sensor as a Sensing Endpoint in the cabled observatory network. The other process was that the remote ESOMS utilized the same IP/Port related information modeled by OSML to create/operate a Function Node acted as agent of the in situ sensor. A case study for using ESOMS in the Xiaoqushan Seafloor Observatory was finally presented to prove its performance and applicability.

Discrimination between discrete and continuum scattering from the sub-seafloor	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												There is growing evidence that seabed scattering is often dominated by heterogeneities within the sediment volume as opposed to seafloor roughness. From a theoretical viewpoint, sediment volume heterogeneities can be described either by a fluctuation continuum or by discrete particles. In at-sea experiments, heterogeneity characteristics generally are not known a priori. Thus, an uninformed model selection is generally made, i.e., the researcher must arbitrarily select either a discrete or continuum model. It is shown here that it is possible to (acoustically) discriminate between continuum and discrete heterogeneities in some instances. For example, when the spectral exponent gamma 3 > 4, the volume scattering cannot be described by discrete particles. Conversely, when gamma(3) <= 2, the heterogeneities likely arise from discrete particles. Furthermore, in the range 2 < gamma(3) <= 4 it is sometimes possible to discriminate via physical bounds on the parameter values. The ability to so discriminate is important, because there are few tools for measuring small scale, O(10(-2) to 10(-1)) m, sediment heterogeneities over large areas. Therefore, discriminating discrete vs continuum heterogeneities via acoustic remote sensing may lead to improved observations and concomitant increased understanding of the marine benthic environment.

Assessment of ocean color data records from MODIS-Aqua in the western Arctic Ocean	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A broad suite of bio-optical and biogeochemical observations collected during the NASA-funded ICESCAPE expeditions to the western Arctic Ocean in 2010 and 2011 was used to validate ocean color satellite data products in this region, which is undergoing fast ecological changes in the context of a changing climate. Satellite-to-in situ match-ups for the MODIS instrument on board Aqua (MODISA) were evaluated using standard NASA empirical and semi-analytical algorithms to estimate chlorophyll-a (C-a), spectral marine inherent optical properties, and particulate organic carbon (POC). Results for the empirical algorithms were compared with those from the semi-analytical Generalized Inherent Optical Property (GIOP) algorithm. The findings presented here showed that MODISA Ca estimates were positively biased relative to in situ measurements, in agreement with previous studies that have evaluated ocean color retrievals in the Arctic Ocean. These biases were reproduced using both satellite and in situ measured remote sensing reflectances, R-rs(lambda), indicating that estimation errors are derived from the application of the empirical algorithm and not by the observed radiometry. This disparity appears to be caused by contributions of high spectral absorption from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which is a well-documented feature of Arctic Ocean waters. The current MODISA empirical algorithm (OC3M) appears to attribute CDOM absorption in the blue region of the spectrum to phytoplankton absorption. In contrast, GIOP showed significant improvement over OC3M C-a estimates by effectively discriminating between phytoplankton and CDOM absorption. Additionally, executing GIOP with an expanded set of spectral bands derived from in situ radiometry, instead of just six MODISA bands, further improved the performance of absorption estimates. These findings reinforce previous suggestions that semi-analytical approaches will provide more reliable data records for Arctic studies than existing empirical methods. POC estimates showed no clear bias relative to in situ measurements, suggesting that the empirical algorithm better represents high latitude oceans with regards to the bio-optical signature of suspended particulate stocks.

Basking sharks and oceanographic fronts: quantifying associations in the north-east Atlantic	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Understanding the mechanisms that link oceanographic processes and marine vertebrate space use is critical to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning, and for effective management of populations of conservation concern. The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus has been observed in association with oceanographic fronts - physical interfaces at the transitions between water masses - exploiting foraging opportunities resulting from zooplankton aggregation. However, the scale, significance and variability of these associations have not previously been established. Here, we quantify the influence of thermal and chlorophyll-a fronts on basking shark habitat use in the north-east Atlantic. We use animal-mounted archival tracking together with composite front mapping via Earth Observation (EO) remote sensing to provide an oceanographic context to shark movements. We investigate levels of association with fronts occurring over two spatio-temporal scales, (i) broad-scale, seasonally persistent frontal zones and (ii) contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts. Using random walk simulations and logistic regression within an iterative generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) framework, we find that seasonal front frequency is a significant predictor of shark presence. Oceanographic metrics time-matched to shark tracks indicate that sharks show a preference for productive regions and associate with contemporaneous thermal and chl-a fronts more frequently than could be expected at random. Moreover, we highlight the importance of front persistence and cross-frontal temperature step, which appear to interact to affect the degree of prey aggregation along thermal fronts in this shelf-sea system. Our findings confirm that surface frontal activity is a predictor of basking shark presence in the north-east Atlantic, both over seasonal timescales and in near real-time. These insights have clear implications for understanding the preferred habitats of basking sharks in the context of anthropogenic threat management and marine spatial planning in the region.

Extracting geometric information for tidal creek networks (TCN) geometry from remote sensing is essential to understanding their characteristics, formation, and evolution. Currently, the major obstacles to automated recognition using digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data are low relief, varying widths, high density, strong anisotropy, and complicated patterns. Conventional methods, such as the optimal-elevation threshold method, the optimal-curvature threshold method, and the D8 method, cannot achieve satisfactory performance under these conditions. We propose an automated method for extracting tidal creeks (AMETC) using topographic features detected from LiDAR. Specifically, a multi-window median neighborhood analysis was designed to enhance depressions both in mudflat and marsh environments; a multi-scale and multi-directional Gaussian-matched filtering method was incorporated to enhance width-variant TCs; and a two-stage adaptive thresholding algorithm was implemented to segment low-contrast TCs. The AMETC was tested on two large LiDAR datasets of the Jiangsu coast with different resolutions. The quantitative assessments show that AMETC successfully extracted both small and large TCs from our study areas. The true positive extraction rate reached 95%, outperforming conventional methods. The AMETC is robust and weakly dependent on scale, and rarely requires manual intervention. Further applications suggests that the AMETC has potential for extraction of other types of channel features (e.g., badland networks and ravines). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xue, CJ; Dong, Q; Qin, LJ				Xue Cunjin; Dong Qing; Qin Lijuan			A cluster-based method for marine sensitive object extraction and representation	JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA												Within the context of global change, marine sensitive factors or Marine Essential Climate Variables have been defined by many projects, and their sensitive spatial regions and time phases play significant roles in regional sea-air interactions and better understanding of their dynamic process. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based method for marine sensitive region extraction and representation. This method includes a kernel expansion algorithm for extracting marine sensitive regions, and a field-object triple form, integration of object-oriented and field-based model, for representing marine sensitive objects. Firstly, this method recognizes ENSO-related spatial patterns using empirical orthogonal decomposition of long term marine sensitive factors and correlation analysis with multiple ENSO index. The cluster kernel, defined by statistics of spatial patterns, is initialized to carry out spatial expansion and cluster mergence with spatial neighborhoods recursively, then all the related lattices with similar behavior are merged into marine sensitive regions. After this, the Field-object triple form of < O, A, F > is used to represent the marine sensitive objects, both with the discrete object with a precise extend and boundary, and the continuous field with variations dependent on spatial locations. Finally, the marine sensitive objects about sea surface temperature are extracted, represented and analyzed as a case of study, which proves the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				AUG	2015	14	4					612	620		10.1007/s11802-015-2452-0								WOS:000358335900004

Despite its ecological and economic importance, its biological environment is relatively unexplored. Satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration (an index of phytoplankton biomass) offer an observational platform to monitor the health of the Red Sea. However, little is known about the optical properties of the region. In this paper, we investigate the optical properties of the Red Sea in the context of satellite ocean-colour estimates of chlorophyll concentration. Making use of a new merged ocean-colour product, from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative, and in situ data in the region, we test the performance of a series of ocean-colour chlorophyll algorithms. We find that standard algorithms systematically overestimate chlorophyll when compared with the in situ data. To investigate this bias we develop an ocean-colour model for the Red Sea, parameterised to data collected during the Tara Oceans expedition, that estimates remote-sensing reflectance as a function of chlorophyll concentration. We used the Red Sea model to tune the standard chlorophyll algorithms and the overestimation in chlorophyll originally observed was corrected. Results suggest that the overestimation was likely due to an excess of CDOM absorption per unit chlorophyll in the Red Sea when compared with average global conditions. However, we recognise that additional information is required to test the influence of other potential sources of the overestimation, such as aeolian dust, and we discuss uncertainties in the datasets used. We present a series of regional chlorophyll algorithms for the Red Sea, designed for a suite of ocean-colour sensors, that may be used for further testing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Dynamic ocean management: Defining and conceptualizing real-time management of the ocean	MARINE POLICY												Most spatial marine management techniques (e.g., marine protected areas) draw stationary boundaries around often mobile marine features, animals, or resource users. While these approaches can work for relatively stationary marine resources, to be most effective marine management must be as fluid in space and time as the resources and users we aim to manage. Instead, a shift towards dynamic ocean management is suggested, defined as management that rapidly changes in space and time in response to changes in the ocean and its users through the integration of near real-time biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data. Dynamic management can refine the temporal and spatial scale of managed areas, thereby better balancing ecological and economic objectives. Temperature dependent habitat of a hypothetical mobile marine species was simulated to show the efficiency of dynamic management, finding that 82.0 to 34.2 percent less area needed to be managed using a dynamic approach. Dynamic management further complements existing management by increasing the speed at which decisions are implemented using predefined protocols. With advances in data collection and sharing, particularly in remote sensing, animal tracking, and mobile technology, managers are poised to apply dynamic management across numerous marine sectors. Existing examples demonstrate that dynamic management can successfully allow managers to respond rapidly to changes on-the-water, however to implement dynamic ocean management widely, several gaps must be filled. These include enhancing legal instruments, incorporating ecological and socioeconomic considerations simultaneously, developing 'out-of-the-box' platforms to serve dynamic management data to users, and developing applications broadly across additional marine resource sectors.

Two winter cases featuring BLCs associated with a post-frontal environment and the leading side of a high-pressure ridge are studied. Previous studies showed that these synoptic conditions contribute to the largest reflected short-wave radiation biases simulated over the SO. Results of the simulations suggest that the ACCESS-C model demonstrates an appreciable level of skill in simulating the macrophysical properties of the BLCs over the SO, generally consistent with the in situ and remote-sensing observations. However, some notable challenges remain: the area cloud fraction of the marine BLCs is consistently underpredicted; the fine-scale structure of the marine cumuli is poorly represented in the 4 km grid-length simulations; the capping inversion over the marine boundary layer is generally too high, associated with the marine BLCs being predicted at the wrong altitude and temperature ranges; the liquid water content (LWC) of the BLCs is underestimated; and the model representation of drizzle production can be too efficient. Sensitivity studies are also conducted to test a newly developed autoconversion microphysics scheme and shear-dominated planetary boundary-level (PBL) scheme. These parametrizations show notable improvement in cloud prediction for CASE B (i.e. better area cloud fraction and better average and maximum values of LWC). However, none of these tests is able to improve the simulated marine PBL structure. Overall, the simulated cloud biases are jointly influenced by physical parametrizations, poor representations of large-scale advection, surface fluxes and subsidence. More substantial observations are needed to improve our understanding of the origins and development of these biases and the relative contribution of these errors to the radiation budget over the SO.

Although they only account for 5% of the global land surface, over 550 million people live in deltas. These preferred livelihood locations, which feature flat terrain, fertile alluvial soils, access to fluvial and marine resources, a rich wetland biodiversity and other advantages are, however, threatened by numerous internal and external processes. Socio-economic development, urbanization, climate change induced sea level rise, as well as flood pulse changes due to upstream water diversion all lead to changes in these highly dynamic systems. A thorough understanding of a river delta's general setting and intra-annual as well as long-term dynamic is therefore crucial for an informed management of natural resources. Here, remote sensing can play a key role in analyzing and monitoring these vast areas at a global scale. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential of intra-annual time series analyses at dense temporal, but coarse spatial resolution for inundation characterization in five river deltas located in four different countries. Based on 250 m MODIS reflectance data we analyze inundation dynamics in four densely populated Asian river deltas-namely the Yellow River Delta (China), the Mekong Delta (Vietnam), the Irrawaddy Delta (Myanmar), and the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh, India)-as well as one very contrasting delta: the nearly uninhabited polar Mackenzie Delta Region in northwestern Canada for the complete time span of one year (2013). A complex processing chain of water surface derivation on a daily basis allows the generation of intra-annual time series, which indicate inundation duration in each of the deltas. Our analyses depict distinct inundation patterns within each of the deltas, which can be attributed to processes such as overland flooding, irrigation agriculture, aquaculture, or snowmelt and thermokarst processes. Clear differences between mid-latitude, subtropical, and polar deltas are illustrated, and the advantages and limitations of the approach for inundation derivation are discussed.

Riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) is discharged into oceans after a series of biogeochemical reactions in estuaries. Satellite monitoring of POC will improve our understanding of the carbon dynamics of these water bodies. Based on in situ data from four seasonal survey cruises, we developed an algorithm for estimating POC concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Reflectance ratios, Rrs(678)/Rrs(488) and Rrs(748)/Rrs(412), were set as inputs to calculate POC concentration in the PRE. The algorithm was then applied to MODIS/AQUA data to inverse POC concentrations in the PRE from 2002 to 2014. Additionally, sources, impact factors, and seasonal distributions of POC were also investigated. Phytoplankton contributed more to POC in off-shore waters than that in in-shore waters in autumn and spring, but showed the opposite pattern in winter. Under the influence of freshwater from the Pearl River, underwater topography, tides, winds, etc., the seasonal POC concentrations along a specific section, vertical to water depth gradient, decreased in different seasons. These decreases could be described by exponential functions (y = ae(bx), b < 0). The distribution of POC concentrations in the PRE resulted from complex physical and biogeochemical processes, which can change spatially and seasonally.																	2072-4292					JUL	2015	7	7					8683	8704		10.3390/rs70708683								WOS:000360919900020

While many effective and advanced methods have been developed, they are generally used independently of each other, despite the potential advantages of combining different modules into an integrated system. We develop here an image-driven remote-sensing mining system, RSMapMining (Remote Sensing driven Marine spatiotemporal Association Pattern Mining system), which consists of three modules. The image preprocessing module integrates image processing techniques and marine extraction methods to build a mining database. The pattern mining module integrates popular algorithms to implement the mining process according to the mining strategies. The third module, knowledge visualization, designs a series of interactive interfaces to visualize the marine data at a variety of scales, from global to grid pixel. The effectiveness of the integrated system is tested in a case study of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The main contribution of this study is the development of a mining system to deal with marine remote sensing images by integrating popular techniques and methods ranging from information extraction, through visualization, to knowledge discovery.																	2072-4292					JUL	2015	7	7					9149	9165		10.3390/rs70709149								WOS:000360919900039						
J	Wang, CS; Sun, GY; Dang, LJ				Wang, Chuansheng; Sun, Guiyan; Dang, Lijuan			Identifying Ecological Red Lines: A Case Study of the Coast in Liaoning Province	SUSTAINABILITY												The global decline in estuarine and coastal ecosystems is affecting critical ecosystem services. The spatial agglomeration of population, industries and resources has led to the emergence of regionally-specific ecological problems. Therefore, identifying ecological red lines, based on specific natural and environmental features, could help to differentiate the economic development and ecological protection directions or potentials of different regions in future. The aim of this case study is to define the ecological red line in the coastal zone of Liaoning Province, China, by evaluating the ecological importance and environmental stress in its marine and terrestrial ecosystems. For this purpose, the ecological importance of this area was first classified into four conservation indices (species, wetland, water and coast and islands) and assigned values of 5, 3 and 1 for indications of high, moderate and minor importance. In the meantime, environmental stress was also classified into four indices (water environment, salinization, soil erosion and erosion of coasts and islands) and assigned values of 5, 3 and 1 for indications of high, moderate and low stress, respectively. Then, based on an overlay analysis and evaluation of the above results, we defined two grades of ecological red line zones. Grade I ecological red line zones contain the areas with critical and diverse ecosystem services, areas of high importance for species conservation and nature reserves, as well as ecologically-vulnerable and sensitive areas. It is important in these areas to maintain the biological diversity and to improve the quality of the ecological environment, which should be strictly protected and explicitly controlled. Grade II ecological red line zones display areas with minimum requirements for maintaining the basic needs of a livable environment and human health, moderate to minor levels of ecological importance and high to moderate levels of environmental stress. To better control and protect such ecological red lines, setting up an ecological inventory through remote sensing satellites and ground-level monitoring and appraising the effectiveness of dynamical protection are highly recommended.																	2071-1050					JUL	2015	7	7					9461	9477		10.3390/su7079461								WOS:000360354500068

In situ observation plays a vital role in exploring the dynamic characteristics of the regional circulation and air-sea interaction. Remote sensing and regional modeling are expected to provide high-resolution data for studies of air-sea coupling; however, careful validation and calibration using in situ observations is necessary to ensure the quality of these data. Through a decade of effort, a marine observation network in the SCS has begun to be established, yielding a regional observatory for the air-sea synoptic system.Earlier observations in the SCS were scarce and narrowly focused. Since 2004, an annual series of scientific open cruises during late summer in the SCS has been organized by the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology (SCSIO), carefully designed based on the dynamic characteristics of the oceanic circulation and air-sea interaction in the SCS region. Since 2006, the cruise carried a radiometer and radiosondes on board, marking a new era of marine meteorological observation in the SCS. Fixed stations have been established for long-term and sustained records. Observations obtained through the network have been used to study regional ocean circulation and processes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. In the future, a great number of multi-institutional, collaborative scientific cruises and observations at fixed stations will be carried out to establish a mesoscale hydrological and marine meteorological observation network in the SCS.				yang, Lei/C-9880-2012; WANG, DongXiao/B-4445-2012; Wang, Xin/B-4624-2012													0003-0007	1520-0477				JUL	2015	96	7								10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00159.1								WOS:000359854800001

The optical properties of the Amazon Basin waters were analyzed from in situ measurements of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at 279 stations and downwelling diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-d) at 133 stations. Measurements of the apparent optical properties, suspended particulate matter (SPM) contents, and characteristics and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption spectra were performed during 16 cruises along the main Amazonian Rivers draining the Andes and for some tributaries. Surface-suspended sediment granulometry and mineralogy showed a stable distribution at the catchment scale, even over large distances and between tributaries. The particle number-size distribution was best described using a segmented distribution with a slope of 2.2 for the fine range (1-15 mu m), and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 440nm varied from 1.8 to 7.9m(-1). Overall, both R-rs and K-d were strongly correlated with SPM, although strong CDOM absorption limited the use of the blue spectrum. Reflectance saturation from blue to red was observed at approximately 100gm(-3), whereas the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength enabled the monitoring of the full SPM range (5-620gm(-3)). In contrast, K-d showed no saturation for SPM from green to NIR, and a linear model was calculated. The use of the reflectance ratio was investigated and shown to improve the suspended sediment concentration retrieval performance.

An improved algorithm for remotely sensing marine dissolved organic carbon: Climatology in the northern South China Sea shelf-sea and adjacent waters	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												By using field in situ observations, data from the NOMAD database, and remotely sensed data from MODIS-Aqua, an improved algorithm has been developed for estimating the surface concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Northern South China Sea Shelf-sea (NoSoCS) and adjacent waters through a combination of the remotely sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Unlike previously reported algorithms, which were based on only one of these two parameters, this algorithm does not require seasonal tuning and is applicable to both coastal and pelagic waters. The uncertainty in the remotely sensed concentrations of DOC is about +/- 4-10 mu M. The climatological distributions of the satellite-derived surface DOC in the NoSoCS and adjacent waters between 2002 and 2012 followed a general trend of increasing concentrations landward, from about 58 and 73 mu M in the open South China Sea (SCS) in January and July, respectively, to > 100 mu M at the mouth of the Pearl River. The intra-annual changes in the monthly average concentration of DOC in the NoSoCS follow a distinct seasonal cycle, with the lowest and highest concentrations, 56 mu M and 75 mu M, in February and July, respectively. The seasonal cycle of DOC was in phase with that of SST but out of phase with that of primary production, suggesting that biological activity was not likely its primary control. Instead, it was consistent with the entrainment of the cold and less DOC-rich sub-surface water in the surface water by enhanced vertical mixing during winter, and the high inflow of organic-rich river water to the NoSoCS in summer. Sub-regionally, lower concentrations of DOC were found in the known upwelling zones in the NoSoCS, where vertical mixing was enhanced. In the inner shelf, the effect of riverine input was indicated by higher concentrations of DOC in the plume of water at the mouth of the Pearl River. This work represents the first attempt to characterize the regional distribution of surface concentration of DOC in the NoSoCS and adjacent waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Observations of the variability of shallow trade wind cumulus cloudiness and mass flux	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Two years of ground-based remote sensing observations are used to study the vertical structure of marine cumulus near the island of Barbados, including their cloud fraction and mass flux profile. Daily radar derived cloud fraction profiles peak at different height levels depending on the depth of the cumuli and thus the extent to which they precipitate. Nonprecipitating cumuli have a peak cloud fraction of about 5% near mean cloud base (700m), whereas precipitating cumuli tend to have a peak of only 2% near cloud base. Nineteen percent of the precipitating cumuli are accompanied by large cloud fractions near the detrainment level of cumulus tops (similar to 1700m). Day-to-day variations in cloud fraction near cloud base are modest (similar to 3%). Nonprecipitating cumuli have their largest reflectivities near cloud top and an ascending core surrounded by a subsiding shell. Precipitating cumuli with enhanced elevated cloudiness (stratiform outflow) are deeper and contain larger vertical gradients in reflectivity and Doppler velocity than precipitating cumuli without such outflow. Bulk (3h) statistics reveal that nonprecipitating shallow cumuli are active and organized. They contain on average 79% in-cloud updrafts with 86% of them being organized in large coherent structures contributing to a maximum updraft mass flux of 8-36gm(-2)s(-1) just above cloud base. Alternatively, downdrafts contribute insignificantly to the mass flux and show little vertical and temporal variability (0-7gm(-2)s(-1)). Complementary Raman lidar information suggests that updraft mass flux profile slope is inversely related to environmental relative humidity.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				JUN 27	2015	120	12					6161	6178		10.1002/2014JD022950								WOS:000357956800024

Here an algorithm is introduced to simultaneously retrieve above-cloud aerosol optical thickness (AOT), the cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective particle radius (CER) of the underlying MBL clouds while also providing pixel-level estimates of retrieval uncertainty. This approach utilizes reflectance measurements at six Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels from the visible to the shortwave infrared. Retrievals are run under two aerosol model assumptions on 8years (2006-2013) of June-October Aqua MODIS data over the SE Atlantic, from which a regional cloud and above-cloud aerosol climatology is produced. The cloud retrieval methodology is shown to yield COT and CER consistent with those from the MODIS operational cloud product (MOD06) when forcing AOT to zero, while the full COT-CER-AOT retrievals that account for the above-cloud aerosol attenuation increase regional monthly mean COT and CER by up to 9% and 2%, respectively. Retrieved AOT is roughly 3 to 5 times larger than the collocated 532nm Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) retrievals, though closer agreement is observed with the CALIOP 1064nm retrievals, a result consistent with previous case study analyses. Regional cloudy-sky above-cloud aerosol DRE calculations are also performed that illustrate the importance of the aerosol model assumption and underlying cloud retrievals.

Monitoring acidic water in a polluted river with hyperspectral remote sensing (HyMap)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Sulphide mine waste extensively contaminates the Odiel River (southwest Spain), releasing sulphuric acid into the water body. Acidic water in this river precipitates and dissolves variably hydrated iron sulphate in a complex geological pattern controlled by climate. Local abrupt changes in the water pH in the vicinity of highly contaminated tributaries can be mapped by means of imaging spectroscopy using hyperspectral remote sensing (HyMap) data. Also, increased pH through mixing of acidic river water with marine water can be detected when the river reaches the area influenced by sea tides. Mapping the quality of water with hyperspectral data is confounded by vegetation, either dry or wet, rooted or floating. The spectral features of acidic water measured with a field spectrometer revealed the spectral influence of green vegetation, similar to the influence of the depth and transparency of water. Careful mapping of such parameters with HyMap data must therefore precede any spectral evaluation of water related to acidity in a river course. The spectral features detectable by HyMap data and associated with pH changes caused by contamination in river water by iron sulphide mine waste, and their controls, are described and references established for routine monitoring through hyperspectral image processing. ResumeLes dechets miniers sulfures polluent beaucoup la riviere Odiel (Sud-Ouest de l'Espagne), liberant de l'acide sulfurique dans l'eau courante.

This study presents the results of applying the hierarchical European Nature Information System (EUNIS) to classify and map the benthic habitats of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, a marine protected area (MPA), located in the mainland Portuguese southwest coast, in the Iberian Peninsula. The habitat map was modelled by applying a methodology based on EUNIS to merge biotic and abiotic key habitat drivers. The modelling in this approach focused on predicting the association of different data types: substrate, bathymetry, light intensity, waves and currents energy, sediment grain size and benthic macrofauna into a common framework. The resulting seamless medium scale habitat map discriminates twenty six distinct sublittoral habitats, including eight with no match in the current classification, which may be regarded as new potential habitat classes and therefore will be submitted to EUNIS. A discussion is provided examining the suitability of the current EUNIS scheme as a standardized approach to classify marine benthic habitats and map their spatial distribution at medium scales in the Portuguese coast. In addition the factors that most affected the results available in the predictive habitat map and the role of the environmental factors on macrofaunal assemblage composition and distribution are outlined.

Glaciological and marine geological controls on terminus dynamics of Hubbard Glacier, southeast Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Hubbard Glacier, located in southeast Alaska, is the world's largest nonpolar tidewater glacier. It has been steadily advancing since it was first mapped in 1895; occasionally, the advance creates an ice or sediment dam that blocks a tributary fjord (Russell Fiord). The sustained advance raises the probability of long-term closure in the near future, which will strongly impact the ecosystem of Russell Fiord and the nearby community of Yakutat. Here, we examine a 43year record of flow speeds and terminus position to understand the large-scale dynamics of Hubbard Glacier. Our long-term record shows that the rate of terminus advance has increased slightly since 1895, with the exception of a slowed advance between approximately 1972 and 1984. The short-lived closure events in 1986 and 2002 were not initiated by perturbations in ice velocity or environmental forcings but were likely due to fluctuations in sedimentation patterns at the terminus. This study points to the significance of a coupled system where short-term velocity fluctuations and morainal shoal development control tidewater glacier terminus position.																	2169-9003	2169-9011				JUN	2015	120	6					1065	1081		10.1002/2014JF003341								WOS:000357994400007						
J	Sagawa, T; Komatsu, T				Sagawa, Tatsuyuki; Komatsu, Teruhisa			Simulation of seagrass bed mapping by satellite images based on the radiative transfer model	OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL												Seagrass and seaweed beds play important roles in coastal marine ecosystems. They are food sources and habitats for many marine organisms, and influence the physical, chemical, and biological environment. They are sensitive to human impacts such as reclamation and pollution. Therefore, their management and preservation are necessary for a healthy coastal environment. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for mapping and monitoring seagrass beds. The efficiency of seagrass mapping, seagrass bed classification in particular, has been evaluated by mapping accuracy using an error matrix. However, mapping accuracies are influenced by coastal environments such as seawater transparency, bathymetry, and substrate type. Coastal management requires sufficient accuracy and an understanding of mapping limitations for monitoring coastal habitats including seagrass beds. Previous studies are mainly based on case studies in specific regions and seasons. Extensive data are required to generalise assessments of classification accuracy from case studies, which has proven difficult. This study aims to build a simulator based on a radiative transfer model to produce modelled satellite images and assess the visual detectability of seagrass beds under different transparencies and seagrass coverages, as well as to examine mapping limitations and classification accuracy. Our simulations led to the development of a model of water transparency and the mapping of depth limits and indicated the possibility for seagrass density mapping under certain ideal conditions. The results show that modelling satellite images is useful in evaluating the accuracy of classification and that establishing seagrass bed monitoring by remote sensing is a reliable tool.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					335	342		10.1007/s12601-015-0031-3								WOS:000357691000022

This offers valuable information to better mitigate coastal disasters, such as oil spills and other marine accidents, and provides the necessary ocean predictions to support the marine activities of government agencies, marine industries, and public users. The KOOS became operational in March 2012, and consists of several operational modules and realtime observations, including satellite remote sensing, coastal remote monitoring stations using high-frequency radar, and ocean observatories. The basic forecasting system includes weather, regional and high-resolution coastal circulation and wave prediction models; the practical application system includes storm surges, oil spills, and search and rescue prediction models. An integrated maritime port prediction system and data information and skill assessment systems are also part of the KOOS. In this work, the performance of the numerical models was evaluated by the skill assessment systems. From the monthly and yearly skill assessments, the models showed reasonable skill in predicting atmospheric and oceanic states except for the regional ocean circulation models. The ongoing development and improvement of the KOOS includes improvement of the model skills through the upgrade of the satellite-based sea surface temperature algorithm, the enhancement of the ocean monitoring ability, the upgrade of the forecasting models for higher spatial resolutions and the application of data assimilation techniques improved with the feedback from the skill assessment report.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				JUN	2015	50	2					353	369		10.1007/s12601-015-0033-1								WOS:000357691000024

A scientific and reasonable assessment of coastline resources will benefit the formulation of coastal development strategy and increase the comprehensive use efficiency of coastline resources. The use of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) helped to establish the system of indicators for the comprehensive suitability assessment of coastline resources with emphasis on production, human life and ecological protection. Of the total continental coastline of Zhejiang, the coastline with top priority given to production accounted for 4.9%; the coastline with moderate development, 10.3%; the coastline for residence and tourism, 21.9%; the coastline under ecological protection, 1.5%; and the reserve coastline, 61.4%. The coastlines have good port construction conditions and are located at the junction zone coast section of Pinghu City and Haiyan City, the southern mouth of the Yongjiang River, Ningbo to the north bank of Beilun, the coast of Xiangshangang Bay. These coastline sections are suitable for priority development or moderate development. The coastline sections that are suitable for urbanization or tourism development are located east of Haiyan City and northwest of Cixi City. Part of the coastline sections in the east of Xiangshan County and in the middle of Sanmen County need to be strictly protected due to its unique ecological service value.																	0031-7454					JUN	2015	98	2					224	236										WOS:000357837400011

The routine, for which deep water is assumed, begins with 3-D FFT of the radar image sequence, followed by the extraction of the dispersion shell from the 3-D image spectrum. Next, the dispersion shell is converted to a polar current shell (PCS) using a polar coordinate transformation. After removing outliers along each radial direction of the PCS, a robust sinusoidal curve fitting is applied to the data points along each circumferential direction of the PCS. The angle corresponding to the maximum of the estimated sinusoid function is determined to be the current direction, and the amplitude of this sinusoidal function is the current speed. For validation, the algorithm is tested against both simulated radar images and field data collected by a vertically-polarized X-band system and ground-truthed with measurements from an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). From the field data, it is observed that when the current speed is less than 0.5 m/s, the root mean square differences between the radar-derived and the ADCP-measured current speed and direction are 7.3 cm/s and 32.7 degrees, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed procedure, unlike most existing current inversion schemes, is not susceptible to high current speeds and circumvents the need to consider aliasing. Meanwhile, the relatively low computational cost makes it an excellent choice in practical marine applications.

Light-absorbing properties of mineral particles in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The light-absorbing attributes of minerogenic particle populations are presented for 32 sites from five areas of the Laurentian Great Lakes based on laboratory measurements of non-algal particulate absorption along with a particle size distribution (PSD) metric and total projected area of minerogenic particles per unit volume of water (PAV(m)) determined with an individual particle analysis (IPA) technique. IPA established clay mineral and calcite dominance as the primary and secondary composition cases, respectively, for the sampled populations. Estimates of spectral absorption properties of these populations are presented, including the mean absorption efficiency (<Q(a,m)>), the imaginary part of the refractive index (n'), and the mean package effect index (<Q(a,m)*>). Substantial differences in these attributes among the samples are documented; those for <Q(a,m)> and <Q(a,m)*> were explained well by the effects of optical thickness, which represent the multiplicative effects of n' and a PSD metric. Greater package effect is attributed to increases in n'. Mie theory calculations, based on the n' estimates and the IPA characterizations, depict substantial decreases in the spectral backscattering coefficient (b(b,m)) for the minerogenic particle populations from the red to blue spectral regions, relative to the case of nonabsorption. Related recommendations for mechanistic remote sensing initiatives to represent the effects of minerogenic particles are presented, including (1) use of PAVm as the optically active constituent metric, (2) use of <Q(a,m)> as the corresponding cross-section (interim value of 0.33 or 0.39), and (3) representation of the spectral character for bb,m reported here.

A technique for the remote sensing of atmospheric WV content using ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) has become available, which can routinely achieve accuracies for integrated WV content of 1-2 kg/m(2). Some experimental work has shown that the accuracy of WV measurements from a moving platform is comparable to that of (static) land-based receivers. Extending this technique into the marine environment on a moving platform would be greatly beneficial for many aspects of meteorological research, such as the calibration of satellite data, investigation of the air-sea interface, as well as forecasting and climatological studies. In this study, kinematic precise point positioning has been developed to investigate WV in the Arctic Ocean (80A degrees-87A degrees N) and annual variations are obtained for 2008 and 2012 that are identical to those related to the enhanced greenhouse effect.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUN	2015	34	6					1	4		10.1007/s13131-015-0680-1								WOS:000355857500001

A look-up table of wavelength-integrated UV irradiance (280-400 nm) on the sea surface is established using the coupled ocean atmosphere radiative transfer (COART) model. On the basis of the look-up table, the distributions of the UV irradiance at middle and low latitudes are inversed by using the satellite-derived atmospheric products from the Aqua satellite, including aerosol optical thickness at 550 nm, ozone content, liquid water path, and the total precipitable water. The validation results show that the mean relative difference of the 10 d rolling averaged UV irradiance between the satellite retrieval and field observations is 8.20% at the time of satellite passing and 13.95% for the daily dose of UV. The monthly-averaged UV irradiance and daily dose of UV retrieved by satellite data show a good correlation with the in situ data, with mean relative differences of 6.87% and 8.43%, respectively. The sensitivity analysis of satellite inputs is conducted. The liquid water path representing the condition of cloud has the highest effect on the retrieval of the UV irradiance, while ozone and aerosol have relatively lesser effect. The influence of the total precipitable water is not significant. On the basis of the satellite-derived UV irradiance on the sea surface, a preliminary simple estimation of ultraviolet radiation's effects on the global marine primary productivity is presented, and the results reveal that ultraviolet radiation has a non-negligible effect on the estimation of the marine primary productivity.

A round-robin comparison on in-water bio-optical algorithms	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) can be used for mapping biogeochemically relevant variables, such as the chlorophyll concentration and the Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) of the water, at global scale for use in climate-change studies. Prior to generating such products, suitable algorithms have to be selected that are appropriate for the purpose. Algorithm selection needs to account for both qualitative and quantitative requirements. In this paper we develop an objective methodology designed to rank the quantitative performance of a suite of bio-optical models. The objective classification is applied using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD). Using in situ Rrs as input to the models, the performance of eleven semi-analytical models, as well as five empirical chlorophyll algorithms and an empirical diffuse attenuation coefficient algorithm, is ranked for spectrally-resolved IOPs, chlorophyll concentration and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 489 nm. The sensitivity of the objective classification and the uncertainty in the ranking are tested using a Monte-Carlo approach (bootstrapping). Results indicate that the performance of the semi-analytical models varies depending on the product and wavelength of interest. For chlorophyll retrieval, empirical algorithms perform better than semi-analytical models, in general. The performance of these empirical models reflects either their immunity to scale errors or instrument noise in R data, or simply that the data used for model parameterisation were not independent of NOMAD. Nonetheless, uncertainty in the classification suggests that the performance of some semi-analytical algorithms at retrieving chlorophyll is comparable with the empirical algorithms. For phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm, some semi-analytical models also perform with similar accuracy to an empirical model: We discuss the potential biases, limitations and uncertainty in the approach, as well as additional qualitative considerations for algorithm selection for climate-change studies. Our classification has the potential to be routinely implemented, such that the performance of emerging algorithms can be compared with existing algorithms as they become available. In the long-term, such an approach will further aid algorithm development for ocean-colour studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, CY				Zhang, Caiyun			Applying data fusion techniques for benthic habitat mapping and monitoring in a coral reef ecosystem	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Accurate mapping and effective monitoring of benthic habitat in the Florida Keys are critical in developing management strategies for this valuable coral reef ecosystem. For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetiy data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5% and 83.5% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.

However, existing satellite remote sensing models of MPP only consider the effects of visible light radiation, ignoring the UVR. Additionally, the ocean color satellite data currently used for MPP estimation contain no UV bands. To better understand the mechanism of MPP model development with reference to satellite remote sensing, including UVR's effects, we first reviewed recent studies of UVR's effects on phytoplankton and MPP, which highlights the need for improved satellite remote sensing of MPP. Then, based on current MPP models using visible radiation, we discussed the quantitative methods used to implement three key model variables related to UVR: the UVR intensity at the sea surface, the attenuation of UVR in the euphotic layer, and the maximum or optimal photosynthetic rate, considering the effects of UVR. The implementation of these UVR-related variables could be useful in further assessing UVR's effects on the remote sensing of MPP, and in reevaluating our existing knowledge of MPP estimation at large spatial scales and long-time scales related to global change.

From data pretreatment, to algorithm design, to association rule mining and pattern visualization, this paper outlines a spatiotemporal mining framework for abnormal association patterns in marine environments, including pixel-based and object-based mining models. Within this framework, some key issues are also addressed. In the data pretreatment phase, we propose an algorithm for extracting abnormal objects or pixels over marine surfaces, and construct a mining transaction table with object-based and pixel-based strategies. In the mining algorithm phase, a recursion method to construct a direct association pattern tree is addressed with an asymmetric mutual information table, and a recursive mining algorithm to find frequent items. In the knowledge visualization phase, a "Dimension-Attributes" visualization framework is used to display spatiotemporal association patterns. Finally, spatiotemporal association patterns for marine environmental parameters in the Pacific Ocean are identified, and the results prove the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed mining framework.

Techniques used to quantify this pigment include fluorescence, UV spectrophotometer, chromatography, HPLC, and remote sensing. Determination of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll - a (Chl-a), has been used widely in many areas of science. The present study investigated the state of the global scientific literature on Chl-a, determining the countries, approaches, and environments where Chl-a has been studied and the geographic scale used. To obtain this scientometric information, we conducted a study from the Scopus database over a 21-year period from 1990 through 2011. This period saw significant increases in the number of publications (r=0.84 and P<0.001), different journals where publications appeared (160 journals), major papers with a multidisciplinary character, and a predominance of descriptive approaches with studies conducted in aquatic and marine habitats at a regional scale. The country with the highest number of publications was China (21.64% of total papers; location of study), and the USA had the highest number of authors (19.52% of total papers). The main determining factor for publications was socioeconomic (according to model selection criteria; AIC). This study highlight the multidisciplinary use of Chl-a, and may give some directions to new studies about this pigment.

Results showed that most of the variability resulted from the presence of a deep chlorophyll maximum. c(p), b(p), and b(bp) were all adequate proxies to estimate total suspended matter (TSM) but were mostly sensitive to particulate inorganic matter (PIM) in the surface layer, and particulate organic matter (POM) at the chlorophyll maximum depth. The backscattering ratio b approximate to</mml:mover>bp varied in the range of 0.005-0.05 and was inversely related to the POM : TSM ratio. According to the Twardowski et al. (2001) model, the PSD slope well represented b approximate to</mml:mover>bp and bulk refractive index n<mml:mo><overbar></mml:mover>p in relation to particulate composition. For inorganic particulate dominated waters, both <mml:mover accent="true">b<mml:mo>approximate to</mml:mover>bp and <mml:mover accent="true">n<mml:mo><overbar></mml:mover>p had a larger range and a higher mean value than at organic particulate dominated waters.

The main goals of this research are focused on the monitoring of land cover and mangrove spatial changes particularly for the Mundra forest in the western coast of Gujarat state, India, which is famous for its unique mangrove bio-diversity. The multi-temporal Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS)-II (IRS-1B) and III (IRS 136/RESOURCESAT-1) images captured in the year 1994 and 2010 were utilized for the spatio-temporal analysis of the area. The land cover and mangrove density was estimated by a unique hybrid classification which consists of K means unsupervised following maximum likelihood classification (MLC) supervised classification-based approach. The vegetation and non-vegetation layers has been extracted and separated by unsupervised classification technique while the training-based MLC was applied on the separated vegetation and nonvegetation classes to classify them into 11 land use/land cover classes, The climatic variables of the area involves wind, temperature, dew point, precipitation, and mean sea level investigated for the period of 17 years over the site. To understand the driving factors, the anthropogenic variables were also taken into account such as historical population datasets. The overall analysis indicates a significant change in the frequency and magnitude of sea-level rise from 1994 to 2010. The analysis of the meteorological variables indicates a high pressure and changes in mangrove density during the 17 years of time, which reveals that if appropriate actions are not initiated soon, the Mundra mangroves might become the victims of climate change-induced habitat loss. After analyzing all the factors, some recommendations and suggestions are provided for effective mangrove conservation and resilience, which could be used by forest official to protect this precious ecosystem.

J	Vanhellemont, Q; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Ruddick, Kevin			Advantages of high quality SWIR bands for ocean colour processing: Examples from Landsat-8	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring of water quality by satellite ocean colour data requires high quality atmospheric correction and especially the accurate quantification of the aerosol contribution to the top of atmosphere radiance. Several methods have been proposed for atmospheric correction over turbid waters, including modelling the marine contributions to the NIR signal or switching to longer short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths where the signal even in turbid waters can be assumed zero. Here we present the use of the high quality SWIR bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8, launched in 2013, to extend our existing turbid water atmospheric correction to extremely turbid waters. The atmospheric correction is image based, and no external measurements are required. The aerosol type is estimated using NIR and SWIR bands in clear water pixels, or in all water pixels using the two SWIR bands. The aerosol type is assumed to be constant over a single Landsat-8 tile (170 by 185 km), or allowed to vary spatially when using both SWIR bands. Realistic spatial patterns of marine reflectances are retrieved, uncorrelated with the estimated aerosol reflectance. Taking spatial and temporal variability into account, products from Landsat-8 compare well with those of MODIS Aqua and Terra also using the SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. The limitations of our previously published method (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2014a) are illustrated at higher turbidities, and removed by using the new method. The uncertainty caused by using a single aerosol type per scene is assessed. The advantages of the high spatial resolution L8/OLI data are clear for applications in coastal and estuarine waters. As an example of the advantage of high quality SWIR bands, and a SWIR-based atmospheric correction, an algorithm for detecting black suspended sediments from dredging and dumping operations is demonstrated here. In conclusion, L8/OLI is a powerful new tool for remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, and can be used as a precursor for future ocean colour missions with SWIR bands. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), products were retrieved from the sensor data that demonstrates the spatio-temporal variability of phytoplankton concentration in the northern Arabian sea near the coastline and open sea water of Pakistan, India, Iran and Oman. High concentration of Chl-a, were observed during two periods August to September and February to March respectively. It was also revealed that Chl-a, concentration was almost identical between the latitude 20 and 21 degrees N throughout the year.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				APR	2015	47	2					797	805										WOS:000355343000052						
J	Yao, ZG; Zhao, ZL; Han, ZG				Yao Zhi-Gang; Zhao Zeng-Liang; Han Zhi-Gang			Stratospheric gravity waves during summer over East Asia derived from AIRS observations	CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION												Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are the most important process in the middle and upper atmosphere and are usually associated with convection in the lower atmosphere in summer The satellite observation is an important data source in the study of the middle and upper atmospheric gravity waves, especially in marine areas lacking radiosonde data. Stratospheric GWs can be directly detected by using the AIRS stratospheric radiation observations. To understand the characteristics of the stratospheric gravity waves over East Asia, this study uses the hyperspectral infrared remote sensing data with the original spatial resolution to analyze the GWs in summer of 2007. AIRS observations from June to August of 2007 at different bands are used to analyze the deep convection and the stratospheric gravity waves over East Asia. Brightness temperatures (BTs) at 11 mu m are applied to identify the deep convection. BTs in the band of 4 mu m are used to identify the stratospheric GWs. The spatial correlation analysis is conducted between the deep convection and stratospheric GWs. The BT perturbations at 4 mu m and 15 pan are used to analyze the GW intensity in 30 similar to 40 km and near 41 km. Finally, several typical shapes of gravity waves are presented. AIRS observations show that over sea and land in the summer, stratospheric perturbation propagation from the source can be up to 1000 km away. The results of convection analysis and GW identification indicate that although the occurrence frequency of the deep convection events is significantly greater in the daytime than in the nighttime, the GW occurrence frequency is less in the daytime. The results show that the GW occurrence frequency in summer is up to 30%. The comparison shows that the active region of the deep convection is different from the most active gravity wave region although the stratospheric gravity waves and the deep convection are strongly correlated. Furthermore, it is found that the distribution patterns of the brightness temperature variances in 30 similar to 40 km and near 41 km extracted from AIRS are dramatically different. Finally, BT perturbation analysis shows that the distribution pattern of GWs seems very complicated. The stratospheric perturbation and the deep convection in East Asia are strongly statistically correlated, but their most active regions do not overlap very well. The stratospheric perturbation at night and its source may have a great spatial and temporal gap. In the near future, the numerical simulation and AIRS observations will be used to further verify the connection between the deep convection and stratospheric GWs.																	0001-5733					APR	2015	58	4					1121	1134		10.6038/cjg20150403								WOS:000353664300003

Radar Remote Sensing Estimates of Waves and Wave Forcing at a Tidal Inlet	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The time and space variability of wave transformation through a tidal inlet is investigated with radar remote sensing. The frequency of wave breaking and the net wave breaking dissipation at high spatial resolution is estimated using image sequences acquired with a land-based X-band marine radar. Using the radar intensity data, transformed to normalized radar cross section sigma(0), the temporal and spatial distributions of wave breaking are identified using a threshold developed via the data probability density function. In addition, the inlet bathymetry is determined via depth inversion of the radar-derived frequencies and wavenumbers of the surface waves using a preexisting algorithm (cBathy). Wave height transformation is calculated through the 1D cross-shore energy flux equation incorporating the radar-estimated breaking distribution and bathymetry. The accuracy of the methodology is tested by comparison with in situ wave height observations over a 9-day period, obtaining correlation values R = 0.68 to 0.96, and root-mean-square errors from 0.05 to 0.19 m. Predicted wave forcing, computed as the along-inlet gradient of the cross-shore radiation stress partial derivative S-xx/partial derivative x was onshore during high-wave conditions, in good agreement (R = 0.95) with observations.

Greenland ice sheet mass balance: a review	REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS												Over the past quarter of a century the Arctic has warmed more than any other region on Earth, causing a profound impact on the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to the rise in global sea level. The loss of ice can be partitioned into processes related to surface mass balance and to ice discharge, which are forced by internal or external (atmospheric/oceanic/basal) fluctuations. Regardless of the measurement method, observations over the last two decades show an increase in ice loss rate, associated with speeding up of glaciers and enhanced melting. However, both ice discharge and melt-induced mass losses exhibit rapid short-term fluctuations that, when extrapolated into the future, could yield erroneous long-term trends. In this paper we review the GrIS mass loss over more than a century by combining satellite altimetry, airborne altimetry, interferometry, aerial photographs and gravimetry data sets together with modelling studies. We revisit the mass loss of different sectors and show that they manifest quite different sensitivities to atmospheric and oceanic forcing. In addition, we discuss recent progress in constructing coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere models required to project realistic future sea-level changes.

The timing (phenology) and magnitude of the phytoplankton biomass are major determinants of trophic interactions. The Red Sea is one of the warmest and most saline basins in the world, characterized by an arid tropical climate regulated by the monsoon. These extreme conditions are particularly challenging for marine life. Phytoplankton phenological indices provide objective and quantitative metrics to characterize phytoplankton seasonality. The indices i.e. timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration are estimated here using 15 years (1997-2012) of remote sensing ocean-color data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative project (OC-CCI) in the entire Red Sea basin. The OC-CCI product, comprising merged and bias-corrected observations from three independent ocean-color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS), and processed using the POLYMER algorithm (MERIS period), shows a significant increase in chlorophyll data coverage, especially in the southern Red Sea during the months of summer NW monsoon. In open and reef-bound coastal waters, the performance of OC-CCI chlorophyll data is shown to be comparable with the performance of other standard chlorophyll products for the global oceans. These features have permitted us to investigate phytoplankton phenology in the entire Red Sea basin, and during both winter SE monsoon and summer NW monsoon periods. The phenological indices are estimated in the four open water provinces of the basin, and further examined at six coral reef complexes of particular socio-economic importance in the Red Sea, including Siyal Islands, Shams El Sheikh, Al Wajh bank, Thuwal reefs, Al Lith reefs and Farasan Islands. Most of the open and deeper waters of the basin show an apparent higher chlorophyll concentration and longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the winter period (relative to the summer phytoplankton growth period). In contrast, most of the reef-bound coastal waters display equal or higher peak chlorophyll concentrations and equal or longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the summer period (relative to the winter phytoplankton growth period). The ecological and biological significance of the phytoplankton seasonal characteristics are discussed in context of ecosystem state assessment, and particularly to support further understanding of the structure and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in the Red Sea.

J	Melin, F; Vantrepotte, V				Melin, F.; Vantrepotte, V.			How optically diverse is the coastal ocean?	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Coastal regions are a resource for societies while being under severe pressure from a variety of factors. They also show a large diversity of optical characteristics, and the potential to optically classify these waters and distinguish similarities between regions is a fruitful application for satellite ocean color. Recognizing the specificities and complexity of coastal waters in terms of optical properties, a training data set is assembled for coastal regions and marginal seas using full resolution SeaWiFS global remote sensing reflectance RRs data that maximize the geographic coverage and seasonal sampling of the domain. An unsupervised clustering technique is operated on the training data set to derive a set of 16 classes that cover conditions from very turbid to oligotrophic. When applied to a global seven-year SeaWiFS data set, this set of optical water types allows an efficient classification of coastal regions, marginal seas and large inland water bodies. Classes associated with more turbid conditions show relative dominance close to shore and in the mid-latitudes. A geographic partition of the global coastal ocean serves to distinguish general optical similarities between regions. The local optical variability is quantified by the number of classes selected as dominant across the period, averaging 5.2 classes if the cases accounting for 90% of the data days are considered. Optical diversity is more specifically analyzed with a Shannon index computed with the class memberships. Regions with low optical diversity are the most turbid waters as well as closed seas and inland water bodies. Oligotrophic waters also show a relatively low diversity, while intermediate regions between coastal domain and open ocean are associated with the highest diversity, which has interesting connections with ecological features.

Monitoring and trend mapping of sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS data: a case study of Mumbai coast	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in monitoring ecosystem health in the marine and coastal environment. Coastal ecosystem is largely dependent on ambient temperature and temperature fronts for marine/coastal habitat and its sustainability. Hence, thermal pollution is seen as a severe threat for ecological health of coastal waters across the world. Mumbai is one of the largest metropolises of the world and faces severe domestic and industrial effluent disposal problem, of which thermal pollution is a major issue with policy-makers and environmental stakeholders. This study attempts to understand the long-term SST variation in the coastal waters off Mumbai, on the western coast of India, and to identify thermal pollution zones. Analysis of SST trends in the near-coastal waters for the pre-and postmonsoon seasons from the year 2004 to the year 2010 has been carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Thermal Infra-red (TIR) bands. SST is calculated with the help of bands 31 and 32 using split window method. Several statistical operations were then applied to find the seasonal averages in SST and the standard deviation of SST in the study area. Maximumvariation in SSTwas found within a perpendicular distance of 5 km from the shoreline during the study period.

Several anthropogenic sources of thermal pollution could be identified which were found to impact various locations along the coast.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2015	187	4								10.1007/s10661-015-4386-9								WOS:000350685000012	25743152

Effect of continental shelf canyons on phytoplankton biomass and community composition along the western Antarctic Peninsula	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The western Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing dramatic climate change as warm, wet conditions expand poleward and interact with local physics and topography, causing differential regional effects on the marine ecosystem. At local scales, deep troughs (or canyons) bisect the continental shelf and act as conduits for warm Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, with reduced seasonal sea ice coverage, and provide a reservoir of macro- and micronutrients. Shoreward of many canyon heads are Adelie penguin breeding colonies; it is hypothesized that these locations reflect improved or more predictable access to higher biological productivity overlying the canyons. To synoptically assess the potential impacts of regional bathymetry on the marine ecosystem, 4 major canyons were identified along a latitudinal gradient west of the Antarctic Peninsula using a high-resolution bathymetric database. Biological-physical dynamics above and adjacent to canyons were compared using in situ pigments and satellite-derived sea surface temperature, sea ice and ocean color variables, including chlorophyll a (chl a) and fucoxanthin derived semi-empirically from remote sensing reflectance. Canyons exhibited higher sea surface temperature and reduced sea ice coverage relative to adjacent shelf areas. In situ and satellite-derived pigment patterns indicated increased total phytoplankton and diatom biomass over the canyons (by up to 22 and 35%, respectively), as well as increases in diatom relative abundance (fucoxanthin: chl a). While regional heterogeneity is apparent, canyons appear to support a phytoplankton community that is conducive to both grazing by krill and enhanced vertical export, although it cannot compensate for decreased biomass and diatom relative abundance during low sea ice conditions.

Based on the comparison of TSM predicted by these models with in situ measurements taken in the BYES, it was found that the MBPNN model produces a superior performance to the three existing models selected. Near-infrared band-based and shortwave infrared band-based combined model was used to remove the atmospheric effects from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and the TSM concentration was quantified from the MODIS data after atmospheric correction using the MBPNN model. It was found that the MBPNN model produces 41.4% uncertainty in deriving TSM concentration from the MODIS data. The MBPNN model-based climatological seasonal mean TSM concentration indicated that the highest TSM concentrations were found around the river estuaries, while the lowest values were found in the far offshore regions of the BYES. The MBPNN model-based monthly mean TSM concentration revealed that the highest TSM concentrations occurred in February, and the lowest in July. The diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 am (K-d(490)) depended heavily on TSM concentration in the BYES. The significant relationship (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.05) between K-d(490) and TSM concentration indicated that the BYES waters are TSM dominated types. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For more accurate understanding of phytoplankton community structure and its implications for ocean color remote sensing applications, we investigated seasonal changes in phytoplankton pigments with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), hyperspectral absorption coefficients of detritus (a(d)(lambda)), phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)), and colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)(lambda)), and hyperspectral a(ph)(X) derived from remote sensing reflectance (a(ph_Rrs-derived)(lambda)) in the coastal waters of Funka Bay from 2010 to 2012. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations measured by HPLC ranged from 029 to 8.6 mg m(-3). Phytoplankton community compositions, as estimated by chemotaxonomic analysis (CHEMTAX) based on HPLC phytoplanIcton pigments, showed a seasonal succession of diatoms, chlorophyll b-containing phytoplankton (chlorophytes and prasinophytes), and cyanobacteria. Additonally, to identify the dominant type of phytoplankton with an alternative technique to CHEMTAX analysis, we employed a derivative spectroscopy/similarity index (SI) approach for a(ph)(X) as an optical detection technique for discriminating between different types of phytoplankton. In particular for diatom-dominated stations, SI values relative to the second derivative spectra of a(ph)(lambda) of diatom cultures, isolated from our study region, were significantly higher than those for chlorophyll b-containing phytoplankton- and cyanobacteriadominated stations. Furthermore, we found a strong relationship between the SI values calculated from the second derivative spectra and the composition of diatoms as estimated by CHEMTAX. These results suggest that the two different methods validated each other's performance and precision in estimating relative diatom abundance from bulk samples and that it is possible to optically discriminate the dominance of diatoms using derivative spectra of a(ph)(lambda). We extended this combination approach to hyperspectral a(ph_Rrs_derived)(lambda), using a quasi-analytical algorithm within 400-546 nm range. We found a significant correlation between SI values obtained from the second derivative spectra of a(ph_Rrs-derived)(lambda)/a(ph_Rrs-derived)(443) and the composition of diatoms derived by CHEMTAX, but it was not as high as for a(ph)(lambda) measured by filter-pad analysis. These results indicate that using hyperspectral optical data of a(ph)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda) with derivative spectroscopy is potentially a promising approach to identify seasonal variability in the composition of diatoms in coastal waters. Furthermore, a hyperspectral approach in combination with CHEMTAX analysis as a reference for phytoplankton community structure has proven useful in improving our understanding of phytoplankton community structure in the coastal waters of Funka Bay.

J	Frouin, R; Pelletier, B				Frouin, Robert; Pelletier, Bruno			Bayesian methodology for inverting satellite ocean-color data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The inverse ocean color problem, i.e., the retrieval of marine reflectance from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, is examined in a Bayesian context. The solution is expressed as a probability distribution that measures the likelihood of encountering specific values of the marine reflectance given the observed TOA reflectance. This conditional distribution, the posterior distribution, allows the construction of reliable multi-dimensional confidence domains of the retrieved marine reflectance. The expectation and covariance of the posterior distribution are computed, which gives for each pixel an estimate of the marine reflectance and a measure of its uncertainty. Situations for which forward model and observation are incompatible are also identified. Prior distributions of the forward model parameters that are suitable for use at the global scale, as well as a noise model, are determined. Partition-based models are defined and implemented for SeaWiFS, to approximate numerically the expectation and covariance. The ill-posed nature of the inverse problem is illustrated, indicating that a large set of ocean and atmospheric states, or pre-images, may correspond to very close values of the satellite signal. Theoretical performance is good globally, i.e., on average over all the geometric and geophysical situations considered, with negligible biases and standard deviation decreasing from 0.004 at 412 nm to 0.001 at 670 nm. Errors are smaller for geometries that avoid Sun glint and minimize air mass and aerosol influence, and for small aerosol optical thickness and maritime aerosols. The estimated uncertainty is consistent with the inversion error. The theoretical concepts and inverse models are applied to actual SeaWiFS imagery, and comparisons are made with estimates from the SeaDAS standard atmospheric correction algorithm and in situ measurements. The Bayesian and SeaDAS marine reflectance fields exhibit resemblance in patterns of variability, but the Bayesian imagery is less noisy and characterized by different spatial de-correlation scales. Experimental errors obtained from match-up data are similar to the theoretical errors determined from simulated data. Regionalization of the inverse models is a natural development to improve retrieval accuracy, for example by including explicit knowledge of the space and time variability of atmospheric variables.

Simulating the effects of inelastic scattering on upwelling radiance in coastal and inland waters: implications for hyperspectral remote sensing	CURRENT SCIENCE												Successful interpretation of spectral images from hyperspectral sensors is particularly important to achieve some far-reaching goals, including the detection and assessment of harmful algal blooms, water quality characteristics, trophic status of water bodies and marine/freshwater primary production. The present work is motivated by the desire to study the effect of inelastic scattering (chlorophyll and gelbstoff fluorescence and water Raman scattering) on upwelling radiance through a direct method. The contribution of inelastic scattering to the emergent (upwelling) radiance from the water column is of significant importance and has relevance for the hyperspectral remote sensing of water colour. The method introduced to simulate inelastic scattering is a straightforward approach and differs from previous work in the way of derivation. The model allows for simulation of upwelling radiance for clear, turbid and productive (phytoplankton-dominated) waters. The results of this model are assessed by comparison with depth-dependant upwelling radiance data and results from the Hydrolight numerical model for these three water types. The comparisons show good agreement between measured and simulated values from the present model. The errors of this model are significantly small (when compared with those of the Hydrolight model) in the red wavelength region, where the chlorophyll fluorescence emission tends to peak around 685 720 nm when the concentration of chlorophyll is high in productive eutrophic waters. The magnitude and peak position at these wavelengths as produced by the present model could be used as precise indicators and predictors for the phytoplankton concentration in marine and inland water bodies. Thus, this work will have important implications in refining hyperspectral bio-optical algorithms for fluorescence and water Raman scattering as well as for the high concentrations and variabilities of water constituents in coastal and inland regions, and in evaluating remote sensing reflectance measurements of these water bodies.

J	Chang, CH				Chang, Chih-Hua			Development of ocean color algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations and inherent optical properties using gene expression programming (GEP)	OPTICS EXPRESS												This paper proposes new inversion algorithms for the estimation of Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) and the ocean's inherent optical properties (IOPs) from the measurement of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). With in situ data from the NASA bio-optical marine algorithm data set (NOMAD), inversion algorithms were developed by the novel gene expression programming (GEP) approach, which creates, manipulates and selects the most appropriate tree-structured functions based on evolutionary computing. The limitations and validity of the proposed algorithms are evaluated by simulated R-rs spectra with respect to NOMAD, and a closure test for IOPs obtained at a single reference wavelength. The application of GEP-derived algorithms is validated against in situ, synthetic and satellite match-up data sets compiled by NASA and the International Ocean Color Coordinate Group (IOCCG). The new algorithms are able to provide Chla and IOPs retrievals to those derived by other state-of-the-art regression approaches and obtained with the semi-and quasi-analytical algorithms, respectively. In practice, there are no significant differences between GEP, support vector regression, and multilayer perceptron model in terms of the overall performance. The GEP-derived algorithms are successfully applied in processing the images taken by the Sea Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), generate Chla and IOPs maps which show better details of developing algal blooms, and give more information on the distribution of water constituents between different water bodies.

Surfactant Associated Bacteria in the Sea Surface Microlayer: Case Studies in the Straits of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					IEEE Joint International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) / 35th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing	JUL 13-18, 2014	Quebec City, CANADA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, Canadian Remote Sensing Soc				Abstract. Certain genera of bacteria found in the near-surface layer of the ocean can be involved in the production and decay of surface active materials (surfactants), resulting in slicks on the sea surface. Slicks can be observed with airborne or satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Here, we report results that point to a connection between the presence of surfactant-producing bacteria in the upper layer of the ocean and slicks, observed visually and in SAR imagery of the sea surface. From DNA analysis of in situ samples taken during RADARSAT-2 satellite overpass in the Straits of Florida during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, we found a higher abundance of known surfactant-producing bacteria in the slick compared to the nonslick area; furthermore, a higher abundance of these bacteria were observed in the water column compared to those taken from the sea surface. Surfactants produced by marine bacteria in the organic matter-rich water column can then be transported to the sea surface through diffusion or advection. Within a certain range of wind-wave conditions, the organic materials (such as dissolved oil) in the water column processed by surfactant-associated bacteria can, thus, be monitored with high-resolution remote sensing techniques. Resume. Certains genres de bacteries presents pres de la surface de l'ocean peuvent etre impliques dans la production et la decomposition de matieres actives a la surface (agents tensioactifs), causant des films sur la surface de l'ocean. Ces films peuvent etre observes a l'aide de radars a synthese d'ouverture (RSO) aeroportes ou satellitaires. Ici, nous rapportons des resultats qui suggerent un lien entre la presence de bacteries productrices d'agents tensioactifs dans la couche superieure de l'ocean et des films observes visuellement et dans l'imagerie RSO de la surface de l'ocean. A partir d'analyses d'ADN provenant d'echantillons in situ pris lors du passage du satellite RADARSAT-2 au-dessus du detroit de Floride au cours du deversement de petrole de la plateforme Deepwater Horizon en 2010, nous avons trouve une plus grande abondance de bacteries connues comme productrices d'agents tensioactifs dans la nappe par rapport a la zone a l'exterieur de la nappe. En outre, une plus grande abondance de ces bacteries a ete observee dans la colonne d'eau par rapport a la surface. Les agents tensioactifs produits par les bacteries marines dans la colonne d'eau riche en matiere organique peuvent ensuite etre transportes a la surface de l'ocean par diffusion ou advection. Dans une certaine gamme de conditions de vent et de vagues, les matieres organiques (tels que le petrole dissous) dans la colonne d'eau transformees par des bacteries qui sont associees a des agents tensioactifs peuvent ainsi etre surveillees par des techniques de teledetection a haute resolution.																	0703-8992	1712-7971				MAR 4	2015	41	2			SI		135	143		10.1080/07038992.2015.1048849								WOS:000357364800007

Vessels, submersibles, and a host of unmanned platforms, including satellites, buoys, remotely operated vehicles, and in-water instrument arrays, are providing information that helps us better understand and manage activities that affect the ocean, Great Lakes, and adjacent coasts. Platforms and sensors track animals and ship traffic, send alerts to at-sea operators, map the seabed and its natural and archaeological resources, track spills, sample water, and define ocean soundscapes. Technologies are also employed to support complex diving operations, record marine life, document shipwrecks, log data, produce map products, and broadcast live feeds to the world.

We propose a mechanistic semi-analytic algorithm (MeSAA) to estimate sea surface pCO(2) in river-dominated coastal oceans using satellite data. Observed pCO(2) can be analytically expressed as the sum of individual components controlled by major factors such as thermodynamics (or temperature), mixing, and biology. With marine carbonate system calculations, temperature and mixing effects can be predicted using thermodynamic principles and by assuming conservative two end-member mixing of total dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity (e.g., the Changjiang River and Kuroshio water in the East China Sea, ECS). Next, an integral expression for pCO(2) drawdown due to biological effects can be parameterized using the chlorophyll a concentration (chla). We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the algorithm in the ECS during summertime. Sensitivity analysis shows that errors in empirical coefficients and three input satellite parameters (salinity, SST, chla) have limited influence on the algorithm, and satellite-derived pCO(2) is consistent with underway data, even though no in situ pCO(2) data from the ECS shelves was used to train the algorithm. Our algorithm has more physical and biogeochemical mechanistic meaning than empirical methods, and should be applicable to other similar systems.

Unique Sequence of Events Triggers Manta Ray Feeding Frenzy in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia	REMOTE SENSING												Manta rays are classified as Vulnerable to Extinction on the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species. In Australia, a key aggregation site for reef manta rays is Lady Elliot Island (LEI) on the Great Barrier Reef, similar to 7 km from the shelf edge. Here, we investigate the environmental processes that triggered the largest manta ray feeding aggregation yet observed in Australia, in early 2013. We use MODIS sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration and photic depth data, together with in situ data, to show that anomalous river discharges led to high chlorophyll (anomalies: 10-15 mg center dot m(-3)) and turbid (photic depth anomalies: -15 m) river plumes extending out to LEI, and that these became entrained offshore around the periphery of an active cyclonic eddy. Eddy dynamics led to cold bottom intrusions along the shelf edge (6 degrees C temperature decrease), and at LEI (5 degrees C temperature decrease). Strongest SST gradients (>1 degrees C center dot km(-1)) were at the convergent frontal zone between the shelf and eddy-influenced waters, directly overlying LEI. Here, the front intensified on the spring ebb tide to attract and shape the aggregation pattern of foraging manta rays. Future research could focus on mapping the probability and persistence of these ecologically significant frontal zones via remote sensing to aid the management and conservation of marine species.

A switching algorithm was developed for the atmospheric correction. The evaluation shows that MODIS measured R-rs at visible bands compare reasonably well with in situ R-rs, with the mean ratios ranging from 0.955 to 1.374. The spatiotemporal variation of R-rs in Bohai sea is characterized using MODIS data from July 2002 to June 2014. It is noted from the time series of monthly mean R-rs and wind speed a time lag for the response of R-rs to wind. Significant linear relationship is found between the monthly mean R-rs and wind speed, with the correlation coefficients much higher than those between the annual mean R-rs and total river discharge, indicating that wind plays a more important role than river discharge in determining the variation of R-rs in Bohai sea. Strong seasonal variation is observed in the monthly mean R-rs, which is the lowest during July and August and increases to the maximum in January-February and then decreases. Using the entire archive of MODIS/Aqua data over Bohai sea, this study documents the apparent optical properties which serve as an indicator of sediment transport, providing a low-cost and efficient way for monitoring the marine environmental change and for demonstrating the effect from sediment transport on coastal morphology and ecosystem.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				MAR	2015	8	3					1176	1184		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2380785								WOS:000352279200021						
J	Zhao, J; Temimi, M; Ghedira, H				Zhao, Jun; Temimi, Marouane; Ghedira, Hosni			Characterization of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman using MERIS fluorescence data	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												In this study, MERIS fluorescence data were utilized to monitor a toxin-producing dinoflagellate Cochlodinium bloom in 2008 in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. The bloom was characterized using modified fluorescence line height (MFLH), enhanced Red-Green-Blue (ERGB) and true color composites, and the ratio of particulate backscattering (b(bp)) to MFLH (b(bp)/MFLH). In addition to high MFLH values and dark colors in ERGB images which are generally observed when blooms happen, it was found that the Cochlodinium bloom indicated species-specific signatures which consisted of reddish brown colors in true color composites and bbp/MFLH values below 0.2 mW(-1) cm(2) mu m m(-1) sr. Based on these findings, Cochlodinium blooms were successfully distinguished from blooms dominated by other species that were found in the study area, like diatom, Noctiluca, and Trichodesmium. Qualitative analysis showed that the fluorescence-based approach presented better performance than the chlorophyll-a anomaly approach for HAB detection, despite the sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations, benthic vegetation in coastal shallow waters, and variations in environmental conditions. The applicability of the HAB characterization approach tested for the first time over the study area using MERIS data was discussed and can be anticipated with sufficient knowledge of local bloom history. Combing different ocean color products is strongly recommended to improve our understanding of HAB dynamics and enhance our ability to characterize them. This is of great importance for marine environment protection and management and can lead to valuable information for contingency planning.

Measuring acoustic habitats	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Many organisms depend on sound for communication, predator/prey detection and navigation. The acoustic environment can therefore play an important role in ecosystem dynamics and evolution. A growing number of studies are documenting acoustic habitats and their influences on animal development, behaviour, physiology and spatial ecology, which has led to increasing demand for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) expertise in the life sciences. However, as yet, there has been no synthesis of data processing methods for acoustic habitat monitoring, which presents an unnecessary obstacle to would-be PAM analysts. Here, we review the signal processing techniques needed to produce calibrated measurements of terrestrial and aquatic acoustic habitats. We include a supplemental tutorial and template computer codes in matlab and r, which give detailed guidance on how to produce calibrated spectrograms and statistical analyses of sound levels. Key metrics and terminology for the characterisation of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic sound are covered, and their application to relevant monitoring scenarios is illustrated through example data sets. To inform study design and hardware selection, we also include an up-to-date overview of terrestrial and aquatic PAM instruments. Monitoring of acoustic habitats at large spatiotemporal scales is becoming possible through recent advances in PAM technology. This will enhance our understanding of the role of sound in the spatial ecology of acoustically sensitive species and inform spatial planning to mitigate the rising influence of anthropogenic noise in these ecosystems. As we demonstrate in this work, progress in these areas will depend upon the application of consistent and appropriate PAM methodologies.

It was found that chlorophyll-a concentration and b(b)(555) gradually decrease from the northeastern to the southeastern CECZ due to global warming. The monthly average b(b)(555) slowly decreased in the CECZ from September, 1997 to September, 2013. The decreases of b(b)(555) led to decreases of nutrient supports and the diffuse attenuation coefficient, because the CECZ fell into the TSM-dominated coastal water category. However, the phytoplankton growth was not only limited by the nutrients provided, but also depended on the environmental temperatures, as well as some other. factors. As a result, the chlorophyll-a concentration gradually increased in the Bohai and Yellow Seas, but slowly decreased in the East China Sea. Since a large amount of the river around the CECZ discharged suspended matter into the global oceanic system, there was a strong co-variation of b(b)(555) between the CECZ and the global oceans. The use of b(b)(555) in the CECZ can account for 59% of the variations of b(b)(555) in the global oceanic system, which is much higher than that of the chlorophyll-a concentration, due to the variables impacting the spatial distribution of phytoplanlcton being much more complicated than those of the suspended matter.

Geospatially Integrated Seafloor Classification Scheme (G-ISCS): A New Method for Cognitively Interpreting Benthic Biogeomorphological Features	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Because benthic environments show ecotonal successions that biophysically fuse geomorphological units with biological coverages, there is a need for cognitive biogeomorphological classification methods. This study introduces a new geospatially integrated seafloor classification scheme (G-ISCS) methodology for cognitively interpreting geomorphological components and dominant biological covers from a variety of remotely sensed imagery within a geographic information system interface. An ordered, hierarchical classification scheme was thus developed to discriminate various categories such as physiographic realm, morphodynamic zone, geoform, landform, dominant surface sediment, dominant biological cover, and density of dominant biological cover. When applying the G-ISCS method to multispectral satellite imagery (e. g., GeoEye IKONOS-2), individual raw scenes were imported into IDRISI (c) Taiga to enhance frequency distributions of spectral reflectance through contrast stretching. Image enhancement was applied to blue, green, and red wavelength bands and combined to create 24-bit color composite images that were suitable for interpretation. Using ESRI ArcGIS (R) ArcMap software, raster catalogs were created for enhanced imagery data sets and projected on an interactive SmartBoard (R) overlay system for real-time, on-screen digitizing of seafloor feature boundaries at a nominal scale of 1:6000. Differentiation of marine environments was based on spectral reflectance characteristics of color, tone, saturation, pattern, and texture of the seafloor topology. Individual thematic subset maps were then created by hierarchical category and amalgamated in ArcMap to create interactive benthic environment maps. Attribute tables were compiled in conjugation with thematic map products to quantify relationships between mapping units, as well as to generate accurate biogeomorphological spatial statistics. Overall, the new G-ISCS method can be applied across multiple remote sensing platforms to cognitively delineate and interpret benthic biogeomorphological features along shelf environments.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2015	31	2					488	504		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14A-00007.1								WOS:000350575300026						
J	Wang, DC				Wang, Dacheng			Remote Sensing-Based Study on the Temporal Variations in Chlorophyll-a Concentration After Confo Oil Spill in Bohai Sea	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration was used to measure the impact of oil contamination on marine environment after the oil spill on June 4, 2011 in the Bohai Sea. The chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature was derived from MODIS images with 38.47 % and 7.63 % uncertainty, respectively. The impacts of oil spill on aquatic environments can be divided into three stages: (1) the beginning stage (0-7 weeks), during which the toxicity of other pollutants besides the oil exceeds the tolerance of most algae in the Bohai Sea; (2) the self-repairing stage (7-51 weeks), during which the petroleum hydrocarbon concentration is diluted by the physical and chemical degradation process of aquatic ecology and petroleum hydrocarbon becomes one an important carbon source for algal growth; and (3) long-term toxic affecting stage (> 1 year). However, there is currently little knowledge about the long-term toxic effect of oil spill on the natural assemblages of marine phytoplankton. In this study, we determined that the process for delivering nutrients required for algal growth from seabed to water column is slowed by the 'oil-packaged' suspended particles above the seabed. These results may be helpful for oil spill response, ecological remediation, and environment monitoring.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2015	43	1					133	142		10.1007/s12524-014-0381-9								WOS:000350890300014

The optical closure was obtained using the radiative transfer model, Hydrolight (Sequoia Inc.). Hydrolight simulations were carried out at all stations using "average particle" Petzold phase function and Fournier Forand phase function with optimum b (bp)/b (p) value. The optical properties derived from Hydrolight simulations were then compared with the measured optical properties. The widely used "average particle" phase function measured by Petzold 1972 for coastal waters was found to provide poor results for most of the stations while for few others it was found to produce results comparable to Fournier Forand phase function. The mean percentage deviation for water leaving radiance (remote sensing reflectance) simulated using Petzold and Fournier Forand phase function for wavelength 488 nm varied from 3.8 to 240.7 % (3.8 to 240.8 %) and 1.0 to 48.9 % (1.0 % to 49.0 %) respectively. These closure studies are essential in strengthening the confidence in models or algorithms developed for ocean color remote sensing and also in better understanding of the marine optical properties of waters of the study area.																	0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2015	43	1					163	171		10.1007/s12524-014-0393-5								WOS:000350890300017

Measuring floc strength accurately has been a difficult task due to the fragile, amorphous, and transient nature of the flocs. Here, we describe a micromechanical technique that was used to measure the tensile strength of soft flocculated aggregates produced from simulated marine clay sediments. In this study, artificial flocs similar to the ones that are found on and near the seabed, were prepared using Na-montmorillonite, guar gum, and sea salt. Using the micromechanical technique the average tensile strength of the flocs was found to be 667 +/- 189 Pa. The range of tensile strength values is consistent with the nature of the flocs and the measurement technique.

Oil pollution detection using spectral fluorescent signatures (SFS)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Marine oil spills can be highly dangerous given that the wind, waves and currents can scatter an oil spill over a wide area within just a few hours in the open sea. Remote sensing can effectively be used for detecting and monitoring of oil spills. Optical sensors provide important information for oil spill contingency planning. Remote sensing techniques have contributed a great extent to the development of oil pollution monitoring systems. However, the available detection methods, mainly designed for spaceborne and airborne long-distance inspection, are too expensive and complex to be used in an operational way by relatively unskilled personnel. In the framework of DEOSOM project (European AMPERA project), an innovative water inspection method was investigated, based on the analysis of suspicious water samples in laboratory using the spectral fluorescent signature (SFS) technique. The SFS technique is based on the fluorescence properties of the oil compounds. Different oil products were analyzed in the laboratory, using eight LED light sources with wavelengths ranging from 270 to 850 nm to excite the samples and a USB4000-FL fluorescence spectrometer to register the fluorescence spectra. Finally, an algorithm to identify oil products in polluted water samples with known substances was developed. The mean of the 16 replicas was calculated for each point and used to calculate the Euclidean distance with respect to a known sample constituted by distilled water and single oil. Finally, the percentage of similarity referred to every oil was determined.

This paper proposes a mutual-information-based quantitative association rule-mining algorithm (MIQarma) to address these challenges. MIQarma comprises three key steps. First, MIQarma calculates the asymmetrical mutual information between items with one scan of the database, and extracts pair-wise related items according to the user-specified information threshold. Second, a linking-pruning-generating recursive loop generates (k+1)-dimensional candidate association rules from k-dimensional rules on basis of the user-specified minimum support threshold, and this step is repeated until no more candidate association rules are generated. Finally, strong association rules are generated according to the user-specified minimum evaluation indicators. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of MIQarma, we present two case studies: one considers performance analysis and the other identifies marine abnormal association relationships.

We studied zooplankton-feeding little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel species of the Arctic, at their northernmost breeding site in Franz-Josef Land (80 degrees N), Russian Arctic. We tested the hypothesis that little auks still benefit from pristine arctic environmental conditions in this remote area. To this end, we analysed remote sensing data on sea-ice and coastal glacier dynamics collected in our study area across 1979-2013. Further, we recorded little auk foraging behaviour using miniature electronic tags attached to the birds in the summer of 2013, and compared it with similar data collected at three localities across the Atlantic Arctic. We also compared current and historical data on Franz-Josef Land little auk diet, morphometrics and chick growth curves. Our analyses reveal that summer sea-ice retreated markedly during the last decade, leaving the Franz-Josef Land archipelago virtually sea-ice free each summer since 2005. This had a profound impact on little auk foraging, which lost their sea-ice-associated prey. Concomitantly, large coastal glaciers retreated rapidly, releasing large volumes of melt water. Zooplankton is stunned by cold and osmotic shock at the boundary between glacier melt and coastal waters, creating new foraging hotspots for little auks. Birds therefore switched from foraging at distant ice-edge localities, to highly profitable feeding at glacier melt-water fronts within <5km of their breeding site. Through this behavioural plasticity, little auks maintained their chick growth rates, but showed a 4% decrease in adult body mass. Our study demonstrates that arctic cryosphere changes may have antagonistic ecological consequences on coastal trophic flow. Such nonlinear responses complicate modelling exercises of current and future polar ecosystem dynamics.

J	Varunan, T; Shanmugam, P				Varunan, Theenathayalan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			A model for estimating size-fractioned phytoplankton absorption coefficients in coastal and oceanic waters from satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												One of the central goals of using satellite ocean color remote sensing is to detect and identify different phytoplankton groups (size classes) and describe their variability continuously and synoptically for various applications including marine ecosystem dynamics, carbon and biogeochemical cycles, and related fields in oceanography. Taking the advantage of phytoplankton communities having distinct optical properties, this study presents a new model to explicitly detect and differentiate between three phytoplankton size-classes namely, picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and microphytoplankton, based on distinct differences in the optical signatures of these phytoplankton groups in a wide variety of coastal and oceanic waters. The model is based on the assumption that there is a significant relationship between chlorophyll-a concentration, and total as well as the size-fractioned absorption coefficients of phytoplankton. The new model is validated using three different in-situ datasets collected from a wide variety of locations in the global and regional oceans (including turbid coastal and eutrophic waters) and its results are further compared with those of the existing two- and three-component models. The new model performs better than other models in terms of yielding more accurate estimates of the total and size-dependent phytoplankton absorption coefficients across the entire visible wavelengths. Since satellite observation of 'ocean color' as detected by a remote sensor provides an estimate of the chlorophyll-a concentration, commonly used as an index of phytoplankton biomass, the new model is also applied to regional and global images of seasonal climatology over a decade of satellite ocean color observations provided by the MODIS-Aqua sensor. When applied to the MODIS-Aqua images of the Arabian Sea dominated by spatially intense algal blooms, the present model is generally excellent at predicting and describing the spatial distribution of these phytoplankton groups within cyclonic eddies and adjacent regions in the Arabian Sea. Conversely, size-fractioned phytoplankton absorption coefficients derived from global images of seasonal climatology are found to vary depending on the season and ocean basin. These global images imply that when phytoplankton abundance increases, larger size-classes are added incrementally to a background of smaller cells. Further examination of these data showed that picophytoplankton population is generally low, although dominating a major part of the surface ocean during summer and winter. Nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton populations are high in surface waters of the North and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific Oceans, Arabian Sea, and equatorial region, showing an increasing trend in summer and a decreasing trend in winter in each hemisphere. These results suggest that the new model is an important tool which will inspire further research to investigate different phytoplankton size classes and their variability on regional and global scales.

J	Harvey, ET; Kratzer, S; Philipson, P				Harvey, E. Therese; Kratzer, Susanne; Philipson, Petra			Satellite-based water quality monitoring for improved spatial and temporal retrieval of chlorophyll-a in coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The coastal zones are the most inhabited areas of the world and are therefore strongly affected by humans, leading to undesirable environmental changes that may alter the ecosystems, such as eutrophication. In order to evaluate changes in the environment an effective water quality monitoring system for the coastal zones must be in place. The chlorophyll-a concentration is commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and as indicator for eutrophication and it can be retrieved from ocean colour remote sensing data. Several operational monitoring systems based on remote sensing are in place to monitor the open sea and, to some extent, the coastal zones. However, evaluations of coastal monitoring systems based on satellite data are scarce. This paper compares the chlorophyll-a concentrations retrieved from an operational satellite system based on MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer) data with ship-based monitoring for the productive seasons in 2008 and 2010, in a coastal area in the Baltic Sea. The comparisons showed that the satellite-based monitoring system is reliable and that the estimations of chlorophyll-a concentration are comparable to in situ measurements in terms of accuracy and quantitative retrieval. A very strong correlation was found between measurements from satellite-derived chlorophyll-a compared to in situ measurements taken close in time (0-3 days), with RMSE of 64% and a MNB of 17%. The comparison of the monthly means showed improved RMSE and a MNB of only 8%. Furthermore, this study shows that MERIS is better at capturing spatial dynamics and the extent of phytoplankton blooms than ship-based monitoring, since it has a synoptic view and higher temporal resolution. Satellite-based monitoring also increases the frequency of chlorophyll-a observations considerably, where the degree of improvement is dependent on the sampling frequency of the respective monitoring programme. Our results show that ocean colour remote sensing can, when combined with field sampling, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring and management of the coastal zone. These results are important for eutrophication assessment and status classifications of water basins and can be applied to a larger extent within national and international agreements considering the coastal zones, e.g. the European Commission's Water Framework Directive.

J	Jones, EM; Doblin, MA; Matear, R; King, E				Jones, Emlyn M.; Doblin, Martina A.; Matear, Richard; King, Edward			Assessing and evaluating the ocean-colour footprint of a regional observing system	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												A recurring problem with point based marine observations is how to scale them up to infer local and regional dynamics, this is especially true of biogeochemical (BGC) variables such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved inorganic nutrients. The recent study by Oke and Sakov (2012) uses a combination of historical satellite imagery, and numerical model output to assess the footprint of physical variables in regional observing system. However, in the absence of long integrations of marine biogeochemical models, there are very few tools to interpret the biological dynamics that may be captured by a regional observing system. In this study, a generic approach to assess the biological footprint of regional observing systems is developed. We used the recently reprocessed gridded chlorophyll-a product (NASA OC3M algorithm) to estimate the spatial footprint of the biological observations of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) National Reference Station (NRS) network at intra-weekly, intra-monthly and intra-seasonal timescales. From this analysis, it is clear that the NRSs are only able to characterize variability at locations close (typically within 9-50 km) to the NRS sites at weekly timescales. However, at monthly and seasonal timescales, the NRS footprint is large enough to infer shelf and regional scale dynamics that are representative of substantial portions of the Australian shelf. This is a generic method that can be incorporated into the design and evaluation of regional observing systems where gridded ocean colour products are available.

Traditional methods are required to assess the three parts of losses including cleanup, socioeconomic losses, and environmental costs. It is relatively slow because assessment is complex and time consuming. A relatively quick method was developed to improve the efficiency of assessment, and then applied to the Penglai 19-3 accident. This paper uses an SAR image to calculate the oil spill area through Neural Network Classification, and uses historical oil-spill data to build the relationship between loss and other factors including sea-surface wind speed, and distance to the coast. A multiple regression equation was used to assess oil spill damage as a function of the independent variables. Results of this study can be used for regulating and quickly dealing with oil spill assessment. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A marine remote sensing survey, which was carried out to examine a landslide following a 6.2 R earthquake in 1995, that affected the coastal and near-shore delta plain zone on which Helike stood, accompanied by onshore borehole data, enabled us to postulate the geological processes leading to the Helike catastrophe.

Monthly level 3 and daily level 1 images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Satellite (MODIS) derived SST and chl-a from July 2002 to June 2011 around the archipelagic waters of Spermonde Indonesia were used to investigate the relationship between SST and chl-a and to forecast the potential fishing ground of Rastrelliger kanagurta. The results indicated that there was positive correlation between SST and chl-a (R=0.3, p<0.05). Positive correlation was also found between SST and chl-a with the catch of R. kanagurta (R=0.7, p<0.05). The potential fishing grounds of R. kanagurta were found located along the coast (at accuracy of 76.9%). This study indicated that, with the integration of remote sensing technology, statistical modeling and geographic information systems (GIS) technique were able to determine the relationship between SST and chl-a and also able to forecast aggregation of R. kanagurta.

One of the most important water quality parameters that can be assessed in coastal waters and river estuaries using remote sensing techniques is suspended sediment concentration (SSC). It regulates primary production and has substantial influence on the migration of pollutants, temperature, and marine life. In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imagine Spectrometry (MODIS) images were used to retrieve the SSC along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. MODIS of 250 m resolution data were utilized because they have the highest spatial resolution of all the MODIS bands. In situ data were gathered with multiple campaigns with fast motor boats, while the MODIS sensor was passing over the study area. The goal of this article is to apply artificial neural networks (ANN) to retrieve SSC from satellite remote sensing imagery. ANN function as an intelligent structure to model a variety of nonlinear relationships because iteration-based inversion methods need long computation times for common usage. Using a validation data set and a testing data set, the network could be validated. The learning process was more efficient which resulted in a shorter learning time. The validation data set played a vital role as a stopping criterion during the training procedure to overcome the overtraining problem. A robust relationship between MODIS bands 1 and 2 and in situ data was established based on a three-layer ANN with six neurons in the hidden layer. Root mean squared error and R-2 values for this model were 0.853 and 0.969 mg/L, respectively, for all data. Results of this study reveal that the SSC in the Caspian Sea gradually decreases from west to east.

J	McKinna, LIW				McKinna, Lachlan I. W.			Three decades of ocean-color remote-sensing Trichodesmium spp. in the World's oceans: A review	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Ocean-color sensors have provided the necessary platform for synoptic-scale detection and monitoring of the nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium spp. Such information is invaluable to global biogeochemical studies which require accurate estimates of atmospherically-fixed nitrogen. This article reviews literature from the past three decades and discusses the development of Trichodesmium-specific remote-sensing methods and how these have been revised with improved knowledge of bio-optical properties and remote-sensing technologies. Overall, the majority of Trichodesmium-specific detection methods have been non-quantitative and developed primarily for mapping the occurrence of dense surface aggregations of the cyanobacteria. The ability to positively discriminate and quantify low background concentrations of Trichodesmium (e.g. <3200 trichomes L-1) dispersed within the water column still remains an intractable problem. Furthermore, the spectral and spatial resolutions of existing ocean-color sensors are presently a limiting factor for quantitative Trichodesmium remote sensing.

We proposed the first biophysical environmental delineation of the SBS using globally available satellite remote sensing and model-assimilated data to categorize this area into unique and meaningful biophysical classes. Specifically, the SBS was partitioned into eight biophysical classes characterized by similar sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, currents, and salinity patterns. Areas within each class were expected to have similar habitat types and ecosystem functions. Our work supplemented prevailing global marine management schemes by focusing in on a regional scale with finer spatial resolution. It also provided a baseline for academic research, ecological assessments and will facilitate marine spatial planning and conservation activities in the area. In addition, the framework and methods of delineating biophysical environments we presented can be expanded throughout the whole Coral Triangle to support research and conservation activities in this important region.

J	Zheng, YM; Niu, ZG; Gong, P; Wang, J				Zheng, Yaomin; Niu, Zhenguo; Gong, Peng; Wang, Jie			A database of global wetland validation samples for wetland mapping	SCIENCE BULLETIN												A database of global wetland validation samples (GWVS) is the foundation for wetland mapping on a global scale. In this work, a database of GWVS was created based on 25 "wetland-related" keyword searches of a total of 3,506 full-text documents downloaded from the Web of Science. Eight hundred and three samples from a total of 68 countries and 141 protected areas were recorded by the GWVS, including samples of marine/coastal wetlands, inland wetlands and human-made wetlands, at ratios of 53 %, 41 % and 6 %, respectively. The results exhibit spatial distribution among Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World, the World Database on Protected Areas and the Database of Global Administrative Areas. Within most of the biomes, protected areas and countries examined, the very low concentration of samples requires more attention in the future. The greatest concentration of samples within a single biome is found in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest biome, accounting for 27 % of the total samples, while no sample is found in the biome of tropical and subtropical coniferous woodland. Greater efforts are expected to be made to record samples in Oceania, Central Europe, Northern Europe, Northern Africa, Central Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and midwestern South America. Our data show that it is feasible to map global wetlands using Landsat TM/ETM+ at 30-m resolution. The continued improvement of the GWVS sharing platform should be reinforced in the future, making a strong contribution to global wetland mapping and monitoring.																	2095-9273	2095-9281				FEB	2015	60	4					428	434		10.1007/s11434-014-0717-4								WOS:000349615700003

We also developed a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) for suspension culture of Gagome (a kelp species) in the same region. Models for Japanese kelp and Gagome showed that the distributions of the most suitable areas for both species overlapped. Competition between kelps was especially marked along the coastline between Hakodate and Esan. In addition, we examined the impact of oceanographic environmental changes and atmospheric events on scallop and kelp aquaculture sites, demonstrating that variations in the coastal Oyashio Current and the Tsugaru Warm Current significantly influenced the growth and harvesting seasons of scallops and kelps in Funka Bay and other sections of southern Hokkaido. Because a strong El Nino event occurred in 2010, January of that year was extremely cold. The proportion of suitable areas for both scallops and kelps during their respective growing seasons contracted in 2010. Thus, shifts in oceanographic and atmospheric conditions should be incorporated into sustainability management planning for coastal scallop and kelp aquaculture in southern Hokkaido.																	2071-1050					FEB	2015	7	2					1263	1279		10.3390/su7021263								WOS:000350217700010

Mangrove shrimp farm mapping and productivity on the Brazilian Amazon coast: Environmental and economic reasons for coastal conservation	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The present study evaluates the role of marine aquaculture in the conversion of mangrove forests into shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, Boone, 1931) farms using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques and analyzes the productivity of the installed farms in the mangroves and adjacent coastal plateau. The extension of the shrimp ponds was quantified using satellite image analysis, and the water quality of the shrimp farms was analyzed based on measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, and salinity. The productivity of the farms was measured using biometric data. The data were analyzed using ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. The results indicated that shrimp farms cover an area of similar to 0.8 km(2) (approximately 0.4% of Brazilian ponds), of which 29.4% are located within areas of mangroves, and 70.6% are located in the coastal plateau. Saltwater aquaculture contributed to the conversion of 0.53 km(2) of the mangroves into rearing ponds, which represents only 0.007% of the total area of the Amazonian mangroves. The installations in the mangrove presented significantly higher pH, temperature, transparency, and salinity compared with the ponds installed in the coastal plateau, although coastal plateau ponds had higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. Based on these differences, the mean sizes of the shrimp raised in the mangrove and coastal plateau ponds were 5.7 g and 4.3 g, respectively. However, the estimated value of one hectare of mangrove is much higher than its potential value in the production of shrimp. The considerable value of the ecosystem services provided by the mangroves indicates that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau is relatively less damaging in ecological and economic terms. Thus, we can consider that the production of shrimp in the coastal plateau instead of in mangrove areas is less damaging to the long-term conservation of mangrove forests, which follows the management best practices established by international organizations. The coastal zone is considered a common resource that belongs to all citizens in Iberoamerican countries, and it is defined as a zone of non-building. Therefore, we conclude that mangroves are more valuable intact than converted into aquaculture ponds. Hence, aquaculture activities in the Amazon coastal plain are not sustainable from environmental and socioeconomic perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oceanic loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta associate with thermal fronts: evidence from the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Oceanographic fronts are physical interfaces between water masses that differ in properties such as temperature, salinity, turbidity and chlorophyll a enrichment. Bio-physical coupling along fronts can lead to the development of pelagic biodiversity hotspots. A diverse range of marine vertebrates have been shown to associate with fronts, using them as foraging and migration habitats. Elucidation of the ecological significance of fronts generates a better understanding of marine ecosystem functioning, conferring opportunities to improve management of anthropogenic activities in the oceans. This study presents novel insights into the oceanographic drivers of habitat use in a population of marine turtles characterised by an oceanic-neritic foraging dichotomy. Using satellite tracking data from adult female loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta nesting at Cape Verde (n = 12), we tested the hypothesis that oceanic-foraging loggerheads associate with mesocale (10s to 100s of km) thermal fronts. We used high-resolution (1 km) composite front mapping to characterise frontal activity in the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem over 2 temporal scales: (1) seasonal front frequency and (2) 7 d front metrics. Our use-availability analysis indicated that oceanic loggerheads show a preference for the highly productive upwelling region between Cape Verde and mainland Africa, an area of intense frontal activity. Within the upwelling region, turtles appear to forage epipelagically around mesoscale thermal fronts, exploiting profitable foraging opportunities resulting from physical aggregation of prey.				godley, brendan/A-6139-2009; Miller, Peter/E-4525-2013	godley, brendan/0000-0003-3845-0034; Miller, Peter/0000-0002-5292-8789; Hodgson, Dave/0000-0003-4220-2076; Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956												0171-8630	1616-1599				JAN 20	2015	519						195	207		10.3354/meps11075								WOS:000349093800015

Are bio-telemetric devices a drag? Effects of external tags on the diving behaviour of great cormorants	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Externally attached remote-sensing devices used to study animals in their environment are a possible source of disturbance, notably in terms of drag, for diving species. The aim of the present study was to assess the possible effect of device-induced drag on the diving performance of great cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo. Based on wind-tunnel measurements, we assessed the effect of device size on drag and derived a formula to predict how drag changes as a function of both swim speed and device cross-sectional area. Tests on captive cormorants indicated that drag had an effect on the energy expenditure (using dynamic body acceleration as a proxy) during the dive. Wind tunnel-derived drag metrics were combined with data from the literature to construct a model predicting the power consumption of diving cormorants according to device size. Applying the model to dive data from 6 free-living great cormorants (recorded using implanted time-depth recorders) indicated that a device constituting only ca. 3% of the bird's cross-sectional area could cause a 1.7% increase in power consumption when swimming. However, if a bird maintains constant power underwater, e.g. by decreasing foraging speed with increasing drag, this would result in a 7.1% reduction in the distance travelled during the bottom (active hunting) phase of the dive. Device-related increases in drag are also likely to reduce the maximum speeds achievable by these pursuit predators. The present study highlights the interaction between both drag coefficient and swim speed for diving animals with externally attached devices.

On the vertical structure and spectral characteristics of the marine Low-Level Jet	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH					11th Conference of Meteorology, Climatology and Atmospheric Physics	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2012	Athens, GREECE					The aim of this work is the study of the vertical structure and the spectral characteristics of the marine Low Level Jets (LLJs) which are associated with frontal events. The analyzed data are based on remote sensing (sodar) and in-situ instrumentation measurements, performed during summer 2003, in the frame of the Coupled Boundary Layers Air-Sea Transfer Experiment in Low Winds (CBLAST-Low), at Nantucket Island, MA, U.S.A. The study of the vertical structure of the lower marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL), during a ten day period, has shown that the first 100 to 200 m, is characterized by strongly stable atmospheric conditions which are modified to slightly stable or almost neutral at higher levels. The frequent development of LLJs was also observed and was associated with frontal events, depending on the meteorological conditions. In order to understand the influence of the different physical processes and to study the vertical distribution of the wind intensity variations at the various time scales of interest, the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) algorithm was applied to the time series of the wind data from the sodar, at different levels. Results are presented and discussed for certain LLJ cases, where the observed LLJs were persistent for several hours or days while the analysis of the wind speed data showed high amplitude variations corresponding to contributions not only from inertial but also from diurnal and meso-scale motions.

A considerable increase in the number of vessels over the past decade has indicated the high potential for oil spillage and fire hazards. This study aims to determine the coastal areas that are under an oil spill/fire/explosion risk in the Istanbul Strait by using geoinformatics. Remote sensing technology, providing relatively quick and low-cost analysis of large areas, is used for classifying the shoreline and land-use activities in the fore-scene and back-scene zones followed by assigning risk scores to various GIS data layers and suitability evaluation based on the weight of each score. The risk components are prioritized and layers are allocated according to their risk scores. Major components that classify risk-posing areas are accident likelihood, number of historical assets, human-use resources, population, and lack of critical facilities. Segment-wise risk levels that resulted in comparatively higher scores indicate the vulnerable areas along the Strait to draw the attention of the society and the decision-makers who are responsible for the policy implications. The study acts as a guideline for developing coastal management strategies and implementing corresponding human policies.																	1747-7891	1878-0059				JAN 2	2015	14	1					54	73		10.1080/17477891.2014.986042								WOS:000346334100004

The first approach, anomaly detection methods, use the difference of a local region with respect to its neighborhood to analyze the image without using any prior information of the searched target. The second approach on the other hand uses a previously obtained signature of the target, which uniquely represents the target's reflection characteristics with respect to the spectral wavelengths. The signature of the target is matched with the pixels of the acquired image to decide on the existence and location of the searched target. These two approaches provide crucial information to detect oil spills to monitor environmental pollution. In this paper, we aim to use and compare anomaly and signature based target detection approaches for the identification of oil slicks. The study area is selected as the Gulf of Mexico, where one of the worst marine oil spill accidents in the history of the petroleum industry occurred in April 2010. The results indicate that signature based algorithms have a better performance in detecting, locating, and quantifying oil spills compared to the anomaly detection methods. Among the anomaly detection methods, the Gaussian Kernel Reed-Xiaoli (RX) method shows also a close performance to signature based methods, although it requires very long execution times on the down side.																	2165-0608		978-1-4673-7386-9				2015							2404	2407										WOS:000380500900584

GLOBIL: WWF'S GLOBAL OBSERVATION AND BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION PORTAL	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					Despite ever increasing availability of satellite imagery and spatial data, conservation managers, decision makers and planners are often unable to analyze data without special knowledge or software. WWF is bridging this gap by putting extensive spatial data into an easy to use online mapping environment, to allow visualization, manipulation and analysis of large data sets by any user. Consistent, reliable and repeatable ecosystem monitoring information for priority eco-regions is needed to increase transparency in WWF's global conservation work, to measure conservation impact, and to provide communications with the general public and organization members. Currently, much of this monitoring and evaluation data is isolated, incompatible, or inaccessible and not readily usable or available for those without specialized software or knowledge. Launched in 2013 by WWF Netherlands and WWF Germany, the Global Observation and Biodiversity Information Portal (GLOBIL) is WWF's new platform to unite, centralize, standardize and visualize geo-spatial data and information from more than 150 active GIS users worldwide via cloud-based ArcGIS Online. GLOBIL is increasing transparency, providing baseline data for monitoring and evaluation while communicating impacts and conservation successes to the public. GLOBIL is currently being used in the worldwide marine campaign as an advocacy tool for establishing more marine protected areas, and a monitoring interface to track the progress towards ocean protection goals. In the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation area, local partners are using the platform to monitor land cover changes, barriers to species migrations, potential human-wildlife conflict and local conservation impacts in vast wildlife corridor. In East Africa, an early warning system is providing conservation practitioners with real-time alerts of threats particularly to protected areas and World Heritage Sites by industrial extractive activities. And for globally consistent baseline ecosystem monitoring, MODIS-derived data are being combined with local information to provide visible advocacy for conservation. As GLOBIL is built up through the WWF network, the worldwide organization is able to provide open access to its data on biodiversity and remote sensing, spatial analysis and projects to support goal setting, monitoring and evaluation, and fundraising activities.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					511	514		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-511-2015								WOS:000380531900074

GENERATING A LONG-TERM SERIES OF SST AND CHLOROPHYLL-A FOR THE COAST OF IRELAND	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The use of remote sensing has increased greatly in recent years due to technological advances and its advantages in comparison with traditional methods. In the case of Ireland however the use of these techniques is not well established and only 17% of remote sensing studies are related to marine and coastal environments. As a first step, and taking into account that fisheries and aquaculture plays an important economic and social role in Ireland, a database of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) relating to the ICES fisheries management areas is being generated. Up to now three different products have been produced. These products correspond to the annual SST Climatology and annual SST Anomalies from 1982 to 2014, as well as the annual Chl-a Climatology taking into account the different life span of CZCS (1982-1986), SeaWIFS (1997-2010), MERIS (2002-2012) and MODIS-Aqua (2002-2014). Initially, the Chl-a Climatology was produced for each sensor individually while the creation of a continuous Chl-a series will be investigated in the future. Analysing the SST trends highlighted an increasing trend in SST values in Irish waters, a trend which was more pronounced in the northern areas (+0.54 degrees C in the last 10 years). Although there are differences between sensors, Chl-a concentration seems to present higher values in the Celtic Sea since 2009. Analysing the ICES Divisions individually highlighted that coastal areas presented the highest Chl-a concentrations, involving a clear differentiation in the optical properties of coastal and oceanic waters.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					933	940		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-933-2015								WOS:000380531900139

BENTHIC HABITAT MAPPING AND BIODIVERSITY ANALYSIS IN THE PRIMEIRAS AND SEGUNDAS ARCHIPELAGO RESERVE	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					The Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago Reserve is a recently established marine protected area, the largest in Africa, located in the waters of Northern Mozambique. This protected area is of significant local economic importance and global ecological relevance, containing the southernmost coral reefs in Eastern Africa. However, information related to the marine ecosystem, notably benthic habitat is very scarce. Twelve atolls were mapped in the region using object-based image classification of very-high resolution satellite imagery (IKONOS, Quickbird, and WorldView-2). Geographically referenced data on benthic cover and depth were gathered in the course of three fieldwork expeditions covering a total of four atolls and two shallow reef structures in the Segundas Archipelago. The resulting map allows the estimation of three distinct types of coral cover (field, patches, spurs and grooves); the differentiation of sand, rubble and rock substrate; and the detection of seagrass and brown macroalgae, identifying up to 24 benthic habitats. Average overall accuracy was above 50%. The high variability of the optical properties on the reef systems, in large due to the connectivity with the mainland via plumes, while interesting from an ecological perspective increases the challenges for remote sensing of bottom cover. New information indicates the presence of deep benthic cover extending from the atolls, suggesting the need for further research on Coastal Eastern African corals, namely on their resilience and connectivity, and supporting current knowledge of the existence of an almost continuous coral reef from Kenya to Mozambique. Coral and fish biodiversity data have been analysed together with the satellite-derived maps. Results support the local perception that ecosystems are in decline and uncover new information about biodiversity's spatial patterns. Our work provides a detailed depiction of marine habitats that may aid the management of the protected area, namely in the definition of fishing zones and coral cover monitoring.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					1009	1016		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1009-2015								WOS:000380531900150

SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT DETERMINED FROM SEQUENCE OF X-BAND RADAR IMAGES USING TEAGER-HUANG TRANSFORM	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					This work introduces a nonlinear and data-dependant method for extracting the significant wave height from a sequence of X-band radar images, which is based on the Teager-Huang Transform (THH). The THH comprises two parts, which are empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and application of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). EMD is applied to decompose the images into various decompositions, which are narrow-banded and have mono-components; TKEO separates the aforementioned narrow-banded components into their amplitude and frequency. The standard deviation of the separated amplitude is related to Hs, and, the relation is obtained by calibrating radar data with in situ data (buoy). The separated frequencies reveal the orientation and intensity of data, which are directly related to the direction of the waves. For validation, the method was applied to sequences of radar images that were obtained from the west coast of Taiwan. The results obtained using the method indicate that THH can be used specifically to estimate Hs with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.34 m. Furthermore, the developed method can efficiently measure the direction of waves at each specific point in an image.																	2194-9034						2015	47	W3					1265	1268		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-1265-2015								WOS:000380531900188

Innovative Technology Development for Arctic Exploration	OCEANS 2015 - MTS/IEEE WASHINGTON	OCEANS-IEEE				OCEANS MTS/IEEE Conference	OCT 19-22, 2015	Washington, DC	MTS, IEEE				The US Arctic and sub-Arctic regions are rapidly changing, creating potentially large impacts to marine ecosystems and ecosystem services. However, much of the current observing technology is ill suited to fully quantify these dynamic changes. The harsh, remote environment, expansive area, and extremely fine scale features present clear barriers to the efficient collection of effective environmental intelligence. In order to meet these challenges, NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, with support from Ocean and Atmospheric Research Division, has created the Innovative Technology for Arctic Exploration (ITAE) program to facilitate the development of new autonomous platforms and high-resolution sensing technologies that may be able to address this critical gap in mission capabilities. During the program's primary field testing year, ITAE successfully completed two large-scale research missions in the Bering and Chukchi Seas involving multiple new Arctic-capable platforms, including the Saildrone unmanned autonomous surface vehicle (Saildrone, Inc.), the Profiling Crawler (PRAWLER; NOAA-PMEL), a moored instrument drastically improving vertical resolution of data collection; and the Expendable Ice Tracking (EXIT) Floats, which allow for under-ice data collection (NOAA-PMEL). Through these platforms, ITAE also tested a variety of novel sensing technologies, such as the recently developed microfluidic nitrate sensor, the Lab-on-a-Chip (National Oceanography Centre, University of Southampton). Together, these developments helped to assess important and previously inaccessible aspects of the sea ice melt season.

More and more studies have been conducted to investigate the cause of green tide as well as its growth and drifting characteristics. However, most existing works either rely on single factor analysis or support vector machine-based multi-factor analysis that do not have an appropriate mechanism to handle categorical data. In this paper, categorical data analysis is adopted to study the effect of multiple environmental factors to the green algae evolution. Among the five factors we studied, temperature, wind force, and wave height have numerical values but weather condition and wind direction are nominal variables. We focus on the study of the correlation between these environmental factors and the size of distribution area of the green tide. Logistic regression models are built using remote sensing data from the Southern Yellow Sea acquired in 2013. Comprehensive analysis and evaluation are carried out, showing the main factors that affect the size of the bloom to be temperature and wave height, as well as their interaction. We also obtain the influence level of each main factor such that accurate prediction and early warnings of green tide can be made possible to alleviate the damage of the bloom.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000308

Recently, remote sensing techniques have been successfully applied in marine benthic mapping in coastal waters. However, the majority of these techniques have focused on either seagrasses meadows or coral reefs. There are a few studies that have been published validating a methodology for mapping SAV on brown macroalgae (Sargassum spp., Ecklonia spp.), seagrasses, and/or other macroalgae groups by spectral response from remote sensing. Hence, we studied the in-situ optical properties of living macroalgae, seagrasses, and rubble. The spectral characteristics of varied SAV groups were measured using the high resolution FieldSpec (R) 4 Hi-Res portable spectroradiometer. The study site selected was the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Rockingham, Western Australia as it is one of the fifteen biodiversity hotspots in Australia. Correlation and Principle Component Analysis were employed to evaluate the differences between SAV groups. The results have documented the spectral features of SAV and their associated habitats in Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Western Australia, and developed a spectral library to distinguish among seagrass species and algae groups (green, red, and brown benthic macroalgae). The implications of this study will contribute to estimate and detect the distribution and seasonal variation of SAV on a broader scale.																	0197-7385		978-0-933957-43-5				2015																		WOS:000380550000227

In order to simulate LAPAN-A3/IPB line imager data acquisition using high data rate modulator and demodulator (HDRM), it is required two independent simulation program. The background behind that was the data rate constraint. It took a large amount of CPU resources to simulate 105 Mbps CCSDS packet data formation. So the simulation was divided into two parts, the first part will simulate the 5 mbps CCSDS packet data formation and the second will simulate the 105 mbps pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS). This four channel payload of R,G,B and Ni system of LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite is quite similar with Landsat camera standard as an earth observation satellite. This paper will describe about the modulation and demodulation simulation process of the LAPAN-A3/IPB satellite data image by using HDRM. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The lack of adequate dissemination of marine environmental data and consequent poor knowledge available for operations at sea reduce the response capacity, leading to loss of lives and potential socio-economic damages. The SSA topic is being addressed by "TESSA", an industrial research project funded under the PON "Ricerca & Competitivita 2007-2013" program of Ministero Italiano dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita' e della Ricerca. TESSA is a joint effort of research groups of operational oceanography and scientific computing, and aims to strengthen and consolidate the operational oceanography service and to integrate it with advanced technological platforms in order to disseminate information for the SSA. The first product of TESSA is "SeaConditions", a public service providing ocean and weather forecasts for the Mediterranean Sea, on the web and mobile applications. Every day, forecasts are produced by operational services, such as the Mediterranean Monitoring and Forecasting Center (www.myocean.eu) for the ocean variables and ECMWF for the atmospheric variables. The service delivers detailed information with high spatial and temporal resolution. Main variables displayed on Google Maps are: bathymetry, weather and oceanographic forecasts and satellite ocean colour data. Ocean forecasts are given at different resolution since nested limited area models for Mediterranean sub-regions are also displayed. SeaConditions provides a user friendly interface with zoom and drag Google Maps' features allowing to display data with different levels of details. SeaConditions' main strength is to provide a single point of access to meteo-marine forecasts, which are based on advanced oceanographic models, remote sensing products and bathymetry, and to deliver high quality information. The SeaConditions products are available through web and mobile channels. The web portal www.sea-conditions.com is compatible with all modern web-browsers on all operating systems. For the mobile users, APPs were also developed to consider the different kind of screens and gesture/interactions. The APPs are available on AppleStore and Google Play.

On the other hand, the improved quality and volume of MBES data, as well as the increased demand for mapping products, is driving the desire for repeatable seafloor mapping approaches, analogous to the automated classification of satellite imagery in terrestrial remote sensing. In this context, the proposed study deals with Kongsberg EM3002D data and investigates how to tailor a proprietary hybrid classification approach, successfully developed for terrestrial Land Cover mapping, to seafloor characterization. Dataset includes full-coverage bathymetry, backscatter intensity and their derived textural / statistical features. Concurrent clam fisheries surveys (striped venus Chamelea gallina) give the chance to carry out sample-specific quantitative correlations and investigate how shellfish beds can affect MBES backscatter and consequently be used to detail the seafloor characterization. Experimental results show how to improve the overall acoustic seabed classification first integrating MBES data along with their derivatives and later combining information at both pixel and object level to detail the seafloor map legend in terms of probable presence of clams. The final habitat data is GIS-ready, hence suitable to be directly used for marine spatial/temporal planning and resource management.

The eutrophication in the offshore area is greatly weakening the functions of ecological environment, aquiculture and tourism of water, which badly hinders the sustainable social and economic development of cities and the coast. Qinhuangdao is an important coastal tourism and port trade city in our country, and its environmental change and development trend of the offshore area will directly affect the future development of the city. This thesis mainly introduces the current situation of eutrophication in the offshore area of Qinhuangdao City in Hebei, studies how to make use of remote sensing monitoring method to develop the monitoring and evaluation of eutrophication. Meanwhile, it also analyzes relevant research status at home and abroad so as to offer some help to the monitoring and evaluation of eutrophication in the offshore area.																			978-1-315-66798-0; 978-1-138-02867-8				2015							1261	1264										WOS:000377647700240

For several years, a number of cartographical studies have been undertaken but they generally only cover limited areas and the methods used, as well as their accuracy, vary widely from one site to another. An original approach has been initiated for this purpose along the coast of Corsica (1 000 km of coastline); it has involved (i) surveying all the available data (293 identified maps), (ii) selecting and extracting the most relevant data (date and method of acquisition, accuracy), (iii) updating the data on surface habitats (e.g. upper limits of the Posidonia oceanica meadows) by means of remote sensing of recent images, (iv) homogenizing all the available data (according to the typology of benthic biocenoses of the Mediterranean), (v) assembling the full set of data within an easily incrementable Geographical Information System (GIS), and (v) proposing a scale of reliability making it possible to associate a degree of confidence to each point on the map. This approach has resulted in the production of a map covering the whole Corsican coastline down to 50 to 150 m depth (depending on the sector considered), including, where there is an overlap, only the data with the highest degree of reliability. The surface area mapped is estimated at around 300 000 ha, which makes it one of the largest recent maps ever produced for the Mediterranean. This approach provides a basis for determining the value attributed to the various existing maps and proposing the most accurate map. In addition, offers a basis for targeting priority sectors for the production of new maps.																			978-605-85652-3-4				2015							263	269										WOS:000377577200026						
J	Rioja-Nieto, R; Moreno-Ruiz, JA; Gomez-Valdes, J				Rioja-Nieto, Rodolfo; Antonio Moreno-Ruiz, Juan; Gomez-Valdes, Jose			Effect of the management of a Natural Protected Area in the landscape of the mangrove forest in the Yucatan Peninsula	HIDROBIOLOGICA												Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) are one of the main conservation tools used to maintain biodiversity. Due to the limitations on the anthropogenic activities that are generally associated with these tools, it is important to determine their efficiency in order to justify and/or modify their operation. This study evaluates the effect of the management of the "El Palmar" state reserve, which was established 23 years ago, by comparing the landscape characteristics of the mangrove forest of the Natural Protected Area (NPA) and the adjacent area that has no historical conservation status. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used, as well as remote sensing techniques, based on the hierarchical analysis of quantitative characteristics of the habitat, the spectral similarity, contextual edition and the supervised classification of a multispectral Spot 5 image, to compare the area, fragmentation and compactness of ten types of mangrove habitats between the NPA and the adjacent area. The contrasted regions present the same general fragmentation pattern (p>0.05). However, when comparing the types of habitat, significant differences were observed (p<0.05) in the fragmentation, the area and the compactness of certain types of habitat. The observed differences do not indicate a clear effect of the protected area management strategies in the structure of the landscape and are possibly more related to the local conditions, ecological processes, and the natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting the management strategies of the NPA in such a manner that they have a positive effect in the integrity of the mangrove's forest.

The Master Plan provides the strategic vision of Romanian Black Sea management, providing a prioritized, sustainable, long-term approach, oriented to manage and combat erosion consequences and implications on the environment, marine ecosystems, economic and social values of the coastal area. An important component is the local strategic monitoring for collection of data and information on coastal work performance. The surveillance of the shore evolution started since 1980, currently the measurements are based on GPS and remote sensing modern techniques (LIDAR), beach profiles and granulommetry. This paper analyzes the preliminary results of beach behavior in context of starting in 2013-2014 the coastal protection works. The integration of data is provided by a GIS system that improves their accessibility and their availability. GIS also provides efficient functions for rapid production of thematic or synthetic maps, detection of spatial changes, for the assessment of future evolution, and for impact simulations.																	1314-2704		978-619-7105-35-3				2015							1035	1042										WOS:000371600100129

Despite river plumes represent one of the major gain in sedimentary budget of littoral cells, complex behavior of coastal plumes, like river discharge characteristics, wind stress and hydro-climatic variables, has not been yet fully investigated. Use of Earth Observation data allows the identification of spatial and temporal variations of suspended sediments related to river runoff, seafloor erosion, sediment transport and deposition processes. The objective of this study is to investigate superficial processes in sedimentary depositional marine environment integrating in-situ data and remote sensing data. The developed innovative approach allow quantitative evaluation of sediment dynamics using Earth Observation data, by relating spatial and temporal patterns of sediment dispersal with climatic forcings.					zucca, francesco/0000-0003-4119-5484												2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2265	2268										WOS:000371696702090

For instance, ecologically disruptive or harmful algal blooms in the marine environment show signs of increased frequencies. Some of these blooms are also optical extremes with intense manifestations in the satellite ocean colour record but often without correct derived metrics related to their occurrence, in some cases they are even omitted completely due to failures in atmospheric correction or cloud masking. Considering the ecological importance of these conditions on marine ecosystems and even human activities, they should be described quantitatively by remote sensing to be properly integrated into the statistical treatment of extreme events. Therefore, a spectral library was created containing the two main types of extreme blooms in European waters, namely intense cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea and coccolithophore blooms in the North-East Atlantic and Black Sea, including data previously excluded by operational satellite ocean colour processing. This library is a unique resource that can facilitate the use of novel spectral analysis and classification techniques for extreme marine optical events. Demonstration applications of such techniques gave results indicating single spectral classes may be sufficient to describe each case and that this kind of spectral library, analysis and classification could serve as important tools in the monitoring of these extreme events in terms of their occurrence, size, extent and evolution.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2273	2276										WOS:000371696702092

At the same time, the availability of more powerful computational resources enable the use of soft computing techniques that yield a target probability, instead of a hard decision. This paper proposes a realistic target model feasible for an Extended Target - Track before Detect framework. Physical phenomena related to the acquisition of high resolution X-band marine radar data are considered. Real radar data is used to assess the superior performance of the featured model with respect to previous approaches. Results show that the realistic model provides better estimations of the target velocity and size.

In this paper an effective reconstruction scheme, based on the Conjugate Gradient approach operating in Banach space, is proposed and successfully tested on simulated marine scenario.																	2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							4789	4792										WOS:000371696704218

In this paper a closer look has been presented on the problem of interpreting information about the features and conditions of marine environment from images taken at the sea coast and shallow water. Using this method allows for example selection of the objects on the image according to the differences in shape. Processes occurring in the shallow water, especially in the vicinity of the coast, influences the entire environment thus they play very important role. For example sea surface currents depends on them. By means of the mentioned above method author s would like to investigate this phenomenon. The use of mathematical transformations in terms of grain size morphological parameters such as size distribution and density of grain size range of the particles in the medium can be calculated. The results of such research may play important role in the field of SAR (Search and Rescue).

The paper presents some results of a substantiation study on the hydro-geological and hydro-bio-geomorphic, river, delta, marine and coastal environment, as well as the ecosystem state assessment of this natural and built area from the Romanian Black Sea shore. The analysis/modeling actions and the simulation of the natural hydro-geomorphological processes, as well as the analysis processes modified / induced by the anthropogenic factor, including the probable impact/evolution assessment of the deltaic ecosystem / coastal affected ecosystem were developed, in order to highlight the viable solutions that enable an efficient and sustainable management and renaturation of the Romanian coastal vulnerable areas. The evolution of the marine agitation factors, which are of crucial importance in the deltas and lagoons formation, extending a multi-criteria complex analysis on the response processes of the coast to the action of the marine agitation factors with ecological impacts from interested area, is highlighted. Accordingly, the final results of the hydro-bio-geo-morphological processes study of the shallow area allow the intervention opinions and the efficient management of the biotic and abiotic resources from the coastal system, based on the changes knowledge at different scales of the climatic conditions determined by the environment and reflected in different coastal ecosystem status indicators.

A recent warming trend in sea-surface waters has been clearly demonstrated by in situ measurements, remote sensing data and numerical models. Trends in sea-surface temperature (SST) for the past three to four decades based on remote sensing data generally agree with trends determined from in situ observations. Models suggest the current warming within the Baltic Sea lies within the range experienced during the past 500 years. The salinity and stratification of the deep waters are strongly linked to the major inflows of North Sea water that occur sporadically and bring high-saline water into the deep layers of the Baltic Sea. The major inflows normally occur during winter and spring and bring cold oxygen-rich waters into the deep basins. Since 1996, large inflows have also occurred during summer, bringing in warm low-oxygen water.																			978-3-319-16006-1; 978-3-319-16005-4				2015							131	144		10.1007/978-3-319-16006-1_7	10.1007/978-3-319-16006-1							WOS:000367908100010

CoastColour Round Robin data sets: a database to evaluate the performance of algorithms for the retrieval of water quality parameters in coastal waters	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												The use of in situ measurements is essential in the validation and evaluation of the algorithms that provide coastal water quality data products from ocean colour satellite remote sensing. Over the past decade, various types of ocean colour algorithms have been developed to deal with the optical complexity of coastal waters. Yet there is a lack of a comprehensive intercomparison due to the availability of quality checked in situ databases. The CoastColour Round Robin (CCRR) project, funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), was designed to bring together three reference data sets using these to test algorithms and to assess their accuracy for retrieving water quality parameters. This paper provides a detailed description of these reference data sets, which include the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) level 2 match-ups, in situ reflectance measurements, and synthetic data generated by a radiative transfer model (HydroLight). These data sets, representing mainly coastal waters, are available from doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.841950. The data sets mainly consist of 6484 marine reflectance (either multispectral or hyperspectral) associated with various geometrical (sensor viewing and solar angles) and sky conditions and water constituents: total suspended matter (TSM) and chlorophyll a (CHL) concentrations, and the absorption of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Inherent optical properties are also provided in the simulated data sets (5000 simulations) and from 3054 match-up locations. The distributions of reflectance at selected MERIS bands and band ratios, CHL and TSM as a function of reflectance, from the three data sets are compared. Match-up and in situ sites where deviations occur are identified. The distributions of the three reflectance data sets are also compared to the simulated and in situ reflectances used previously by the International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group (IOCCG, 2006) for algorithm testing, showing a clear extension of the CCRR data which covers more turbid waters.

The coastal water-leaving refectance of HICO was simulate from in situ hyperspectral remote sensing spectrum with 0.19 nm spectral resolution. According to the spectral simulation, characteristics bands of HICO were identified for water clarity estimation model. On the basis of correlation analysis between water transparency and simulation spectra, a single band model for estimating Secchi depth was established. Moreover, the relationship between Secchi depth band ratios of HICO were analyzed, and then a linear regression model of water clarity using simulated HICO was developed, with a mean relative error of 5.6% and relative mean square error of 0.29 m. The result indicates that the band ratio model of Rrs(507.18)/Rrs(518.64) of HICO could be used to retrieve Secchi depth in coastal waters.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0049-2				2015	9808								980817	10.1117/12.2207858								WOS:000369013400042

However, intensification without due attention to ecosystem services and sustainability of soil and water resources has contributed to land and water quality degradation such as soil erosion, decreased soil fertility and quality, salinization and nutrient discharge to surface and ground waters. Land use change from forests to crop lands has altered the vegetation pattern and hydrology of landscapes with increased nutrient discharge from crop lands to riverine environment. Global climate change will increase the amount of water required for agriculture in addition to water needed for additional irrigation development causing water scarcity in many dry, arid and semi-arid regions. The water and nutrient use efficiencies of agricultural production systems are still below 40 % in many regions across the globe. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer use in agriculture have accelerated the cycling of these nutrients in the landscape and contributed to water quality degradation. Such nutrient pollution has a wide array of consequences including eutrophication of inland waters and marine ecosystems. This chapter reviews major factors and drivers that affect water dynamics and nutrient pollution in agricultural landscapes. Water flux is the main driver of nutrient pollution and is influenced by land use (vegetation), soil physical and chemical characteristics and climate change. Appropriate land and water management practices that include irrigation scheduling and conservation practices are important for improving downstream water quality, quantity and the environmental services provided by the water. This approach can reduce agricultural water use by up to 65 % in arid and semi-arid irrigation areas. While fertilizer N and P for agriculture increased by 10 and 14 % respectively between 2010 and 2015, crop nutrient use efficiencies, of 25-65 % and 10-30 % for N and P respectively, were still low leading to losses of N and P from agricultural landscapes. Fertilizer and manure application together with legumes cropping contributed almost 60 % N and 69 % P to surface water systems from landscapes. Assessment of soil water, crop water and nutrient use, water losses by evapotranspiration (ET) and soil evaporation and their spatial and temporal variations is important for integrating field losses to landscape scale and to help develop management strategies for improving water quality and quantity of the landscape. A number of techniques such as ground based monitoring, remote sensing and isotopic, are available for assessments. This will provide opportunities to identify target areas for changing land use to improve water and nutrient use efficiencies, food security, reduce water quality degradation and enhance eco-system services of agricultural landscapes.																			978-3-319-21629-4; 978-3-319-21628-7				2015	18						145	180		10.1007/978-3-319-21629-4_5	10.1007/978-3-319-21629-4							WOS:000368525600005

Owing to the rapid development of hyperspectral remote sensing technology, resolution of hyperspectral image has got a huge boost. Thus data size of hyperspectral image is becoming larger. In order to reduce their saving and transmission cost, lossless compression for hyperspectral image has become an important research topic. In recent years, large numbers of algorithms have been proposed to reduce the redundancy between different spectra. Among of them, the most classical and expansible algorithm is the Clustered Differential Pulse Code Modulation (C-DPCM) algorithm. This algorithm contains three parts: first clusters all spectral lines, then trains linear predictors for each band. Secondly, use these predictors to predict pixels, and get the residual image by subtraction between original image and predicted image. Finally, encode the residual image. However, the process of calculating predictors is time-costing. In order to improve the processing speed, we propose a parallel C-DPCM based on CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) with GPU. Recently, general-purpose computing based on GPUs has been greatly developed. The capacity of GPU improves rapidly by increasing the number of processing units and storage control units. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA. It gives developers direct access to the virtual instruction set and memory of the parallel computational elements in GPUs. Our core idea is to achieve the calculation of predictors in parallel. By respectively adopting global memory, shared memory and register memory, we finally get a decent speedup.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-856-9				2015	9646								96460R	10.1117/12.2199270								WOS:000367784100021

As the closest island to connecting the continental shore of Zhejiang and the eastern Zhoushan Island after the project of Zhoushan Tran-Oceanic Bridges, it has experienced great changes during the past 40 years, and however little attention was paid to evaluate the coastline exploitation of Jintang Island. In this paper coastline positions were firstly extracted by combining histogram thresholding and band ratio techniques with visual interpretation supplemented, based on multitemporal medium-high resolution imagery from 1970 to 2011. And then the coastline exploitation degree for different periods was quantified from three index, coastline complexity, coastline artificial intensity and coastal use. The uncertainty for coastline extraction was controlled in one-pixel for each image. The results show that the position of coastline accreted seaward since 1970. As the natural coastline was straightened, the proportion of artificial coastline has surpassed the natural coastline after 1992. Until 2011, the dominant coastline type has been changed as artificial coastline, mainly covering urban/ industrial and port coast. The calculated coastline exploitation degree of Jintang Island in 1970, 1992, 2003 and 2011 is 0.637, 0.719, 0.734 and 0.929 respectively, showing an uptrend. Part 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the total coastline are relatively higher than other parts, and this generally coincides with the distribution of deep ports. It indicates that natural conditions and human policies may contribute to increasing coastline exploitation from 1970 to 2011. And Jintang Island is facing great human intervention for reclaiming more coastal land to develop the marine economy.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-854-5				2015	9644								96441O	10.1117/12.2193856								WOS:000367470500034

An important research topic to be studied during dredging operations in harbors and navigable waterways is the movement of fluidized muds before, during and after dredging operations. The fluid movement of the surficial sediments in the form of flocs, muck and mud is important to estimate in order to model the transport of solids material during dredging operations. Movement of highly turbid bottom material creates a lutocline or near bottom nephelometric layers, reduces the penetration of light reaching the water bottom. Monitoring and measurement systems recently developed for use in shallow marine areas, such as the Indian River Lagoon are discussed. Newly developed passive sondes and subsurface imaging are described. Methods and techniques for quantifying the mass density flux of total particulate matter demonstrate the use of multiple sensor systems for environmental monitoring and provide directional fluxes and movement of the fluidized solids. Airborne imaging of dredge site provide wide area surveillance during these activities. Passive sondes, optical imaging and acoustical sensors are used to understand horizontal and vertical mass flux processes. The passive sondes can be directionally oriented and are deployed during optical particle velocimetry system (OPVS) imaging of the flocs, particles and colloidal material motion. Comparison of the image based particle velocities are compared to electromagnetic and acoustic velocity imaging results. The newly developed imaging system provides a pathway for integration of subsurface hyperspectral imaging for particle compositional analysis.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-848-4				2015	9638								96380F	10.1117/12.2195829								WOS:000367320800011

A cloud removal approach from ocean color satellite images based on numerical modeling is introduced. The approach removes cloud-contaminated portions and then reconstructs the missing data utilizing model simulated values. The basic idea is to create the relationship between cloud-free patches and cloud-contaminated patches under the assumption that both of them are influenced by the same marine hydrodynamic conditions. Firstly, we find cloud-free GOCI (the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) retrieved suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the East China Sea before and after the time of cloudy images, which are set as initial field and validation data for numerical model, respectively. Secondly, a sediment transport model based on COHERENS, a coupled hydrodynamic-ecological ocean model for regional and shelf seas, is configured. The comparison between simulated results and validation images show that the sediment transport model can be used to simulate actual sediment distribution and transport in the East China Sea. Then, the simulated SSCs corresponding to the cloudy portions are used to remove the cloud and replace the missing values. Finally, the accuracy assessments of the results are carried out by visual and statistical analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove cloud from GOCI images and reconstruct the missing data, which is a new way to enhance the effectiveness and availability of ocean color data, and is of great practical significance.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-848-4				2015	9638								96380L	10.1117/12.2193112								WOS:000367320800015

Hyperspectral Variability of Phytoplankton Blooms in Coastal Waters off Kochi, South-eastern Arabian Sea	FISHERY TECHNOLOGY												Ocean colour radiometry offers cost-effective, frequently acquired synoptic data pertaining to phytoplankton biomass in surface waters and is of considerable value in monitoring and better understanding of algal blooms. Algal blooms have occur frequently in coastal waters resulting in severe negative impacts to local marine ecosystems and communities. Remote sensing reflectance [R-rs (lambda)] and absorption coefficients of phytoplankton blooms were measured in coastal waters off Kochi, Southeastern Arabian Sea, to investigate differences in the absorption and reflectance of different types of blooms. Peaks of the R-rs (lambda) spectra of Trichodesmium spp. bloom were at 490 nm, while those of nonbloom areas were 482, 560 and 570 nm. The absorption maximam of phytoplankton were at 435, 437, 438 and 439 nm in the blue region and 632, 674, 675 and 635 nm in the red region respectively for Trichodesmium spp., Chaetoceros spp., Dinophysis spp. and Prorocentrum spp. blooms. The study showed that the variation of a(ph) (lambda) with Chl a dominates the behavior of the R-rs (lambda) peak in these blooms.																	0015-3001						2015	52	4					218	222										WOS:000367100500003

Satellite based remote sensing systems could be implemented for a surveillance and monitoring network. At present, the SAR system is the most widely used sensor for this purpose as it offers day and night high resolution images and it is not influenced by the presence of cloud cover, dust or smoke over the scene. The operational capabilities of these kinds of sensors are limited by factors such as the low revisiting frequency over the scene, the data's high cost, and finally the inability to make a certain assessment of the nature of the detected event without collecting data from complementary instruments. SAR sensor limitations could be complemented by optical sensor capabilities. In particular, multispectral sensors like MODIS offer a high number of spectral bands to detect, identify, classify and describe an oil spill event, and guarantee daily image frequency. However, optical sensors are highly dependent on meteorological conditions over the study area, they offer only low and medium resolution images and, finally, dedicated algorithms for image processing do not exist at present. For these reasons, the optical sensors play only a subordinate role with reference to SAR sensors. This work shows the results achievable through the development of dedicated algorithms for automatic image processing from MODIS data, and a method to classify and describe oil spill events.																			978-1-4799-7992-9				2015							1653	1658										WOS:000366654400280

This activity will be driven by increased demand for energy and the marine resources of an Arctic Ocean accessible to ships. Oil and gas exploration, fisheries, mineral extraction, marine transportation, research and development, tourism, and search and rescue will increase the pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. Technologies that allow synoptic in situ observations year-round are needed to monitor and forecast changes in the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system at daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal scales. These data can inform and enable both sustainable development and enforcement of international Arctic agreements and treaties, while protecting this critical environment. In this paper, we discuss multipurpose acoustic networks, including subsea cable components, in the Arctic. These networks provide communication, power, underwater, and under-ice navigation, passive monitoring of ambient sound (ice, seismic, biologic, and anthropogenic), and acoustic remote sensing (tomography and thermometry), supporting and complementing data collection from platforms, moorings, and vehicles. We support the development and implementation of regional to basin-wide acoustic networks as an integral component of a multidisciplinary in situ Arctic Ocean observatory.

Unmanned aerial vehicles remote sensing system can be used to monitor oil spill conditions. In order to identify the oil spill area on aerial image accurately, the first step is oil spill region segmentation. The paper presents an image segmentation method of oil spill area based on fuzzy C-means Algorithm. Firstly, according to the color characteristics of the oil, the paper selects YCbCr color space as the feature space. Then, the paper uses fuzzy clustering algorithm to divide the color feature space. Finally, according to oil color model, the paper selects clustering result as the segmentation results of oil spill area. Experiment show that the proposed algorithm's accuracy for oil region segmentation of calibration attain to 95 percent.																	2352-538X		978-94-62520-84-4				2015	16						406	409										WOS:000364990300099

The impact of vibrational Raman scattering of air on DOAS measurements of atmospheric trace gases	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												In remote sensing applications, such as differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), atmospheric scattering processes need to be considered. After inelastic scattering on N-2 and O-2 molecules, the scattered photons occur as additional intensity at a different wavelength, effectively leading to "filling-in" of both solar Fraunhofer lines and absorptions of atmospheric constituents, if the inelastic scattering happens after the absorption. Measured spectra in passive DOAS applications are typically corrected for rotational Raman scattering (RRS), also called Ring effect, which represents the main contribution to inelastic scattering. Inelastic scattering can also occur in liquid water, and its influence on DOAS measurements has been observed over clear ocean water. In contrast to that, vibrational Raman scattering (VRS) of N-2 and O-2 has often been thought to be negligible, but it also contributes. Consequences of VRS are red-shifted Fraunhofer structures in scattered light spectra and filling-in of Fraunhofer lines, additional to RRS. At 393 nm, the spectral shift is 25 and 40 nm for VRS of O-2 and N-2, respectively. We describe how to calculate VRS correction spectra according to the Ring spectrum. We use the VRS correction spectra in the spectral range of 420-440 nm to determine the relative magnitude of the cross-sections of VRS of O-2 and N-2 and RRS of air. The effect of VRS is shown for the first time in spectral evaluations of Multi-Axis DOAS data from the SOPRAN M91 campaign and the MAD-CAT MAX-DOAS intercomparison campaign. The measurements yield in agreement with calculated scattering cross-sections that the observed VRS(N-2) cross-section at 393 nm amounts to 2.3 +/- 0.4% of the cross-section of RRS at 433 nm under tropospheric conditions. The contribution of VRS(O2) is also found to be in agreement with calculated scattering cross-sections. It is concluded, that this phenomenon has to be included in the spectral evaluation of weak absorbers as it reduces the measurement error significantly and can cause apparent differential optical depth of up to 3 x 10(-4). Its influence on the spectral retrieval of IO, glyoxal, water vapour and NO2 in the blue wavelength range is evaluated for M91. For measurements with a large Ring signal a significant and systematic bias of NO2 dSCDs (differential slant column densities) up to (-3.8 +/- 0.4) x 10(14) molec cm(-2) is observed if this effect is not considered. The effect is typically negligible for DOAS fits with an RMS (root mean square) larger than 4 x 10(-4).

Glacier-specific elevation changes in parts of western Alaska	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												The meltwater from glaciers in Alaska contributes strongly to global sea-level rise, but accurate determination is challenging as only two comparatively small glaciers have long-term measurements of annual mass balance (Gulkana and Wolverine). Simple upscaling of their values to the entire region is error-prone as their representativeness is unknown and might be biased. Alternatively, differencing digital elevation models (DEMs) from two epochs provides overall volume changes for a longer period of time that can be converted to mass changes using appropriate density assumptions. Here we combine outlines from two glacier inventories to determine glacier-specific elevation changes over a 50 year period for 3180 glaciers in western Alaska using DEM differencing. This allows us to determine the representativeness of the land-terminating Gulkana and Wolverine Glaciers for the entire region and to exclude calving glaciers (marine and lacustrine) from the sample. Mean changes for all land-terminating, lake-terminating and tidewater glaciers are -0.23 +/- 0.44, -0.63 +/- 0.40 and -0.64 +/- 0.66 m a(-1), respectively, and -0.7 and -0.6 m a(-1) for the two mass-balance or benchmark glaciers. Thus fortuitously their changes better represent calving glaciers and the overall mean (-0.63 +/- 1.14 m a(-1)) than the change of land-terminating glaciers, i.e. they are not representative for their own type. Different methods of considering potential DEM artefacts provide variable mean changes but the same general result.																	0260-3055	1727-5644					2015	56	70					184	192		10.3189/2015AoG70A227								WOS:000363001700022

Oceanographic data from two moorings revealed episodic events of potential supercooling at 30-40 m depth, including the possibility of in situ supercooling, while the polynya was open. We identified frazil ice-like signals in the IPS data down to 5-15 m depth, associated with large heat loss and windy, turbulent conditions in an active polynya. This likely represents the first IPS observation of frazil ice in the marine environment. On the day of the maximum signal of frazil ice, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar shows streaks of high backscatter within the polynya, indicating active frazil ice formation just downwind of the mooring sites. In addition, the longer-term potential supercooling that persisted for 1-3 weeks occurred twice despite the absence of polynya activity at the mooring sites. These events occurred during periods dominated by the northeastward current. A series of coastal polynyas had formed southwest of the mooring sites prior to these events. Thus, the water masses with potential supercooling were likely advected from these polynyas.

The project is aiming to prepare a technical infrastructure and set in motion operational procedures for the satellite monitoring of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. The main sources of input data for this system will be the results of systematic observations by metrological and environmental satellites such as TIROS N/NOAA, MSG (currently Meteosat 10), EOS/AQUA and Sentinel - 1, 2, 3 (in the future). The system will deliver on a routine basis the variety of structural and functional properties of this sea, based on data provided by relevant satellites and supported by hydro-biological models. Among them: the solar radiation influx to the sea's waters in various spectral intervals, energy balances of the short- and long-wave radiation at the Baltic Sea surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere over the Baltic, sea surface temperature distribution, dynamic states of the water surface, concentrations of chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigments in the Baltic waters, spatial distributions of algal blooms, the occurrence of coastal upwelling events, and the characteristics of primary production of organic matter and photosynthetically released oxygen in the water and many others.

In this study, we show the evolution of the planetary boundary layer based on in situ airborne measurements and ground-based remote sensing observations carried out during the MORE ( Marine Ozone and Radiation Experiment) campaign in June 2010. The campaign was held in a rural coastal Mediterranean region in Southern Italy. The study focuses on the observations made on 17 June. Vertical profiles of meteorological parameters and aerosol size distribution were measured during two flights: in the morning and in the afternoon. Airborne observations were combined with ground-based LIDAR, SODAR, microwave and visible radiometer measurements, allowing a detailed description of the atmospheric vertical structure. The analysis was complemented with data from a regional atmospheric model run with horizontal resolutions of 12, 4 and 1 km, respectively; back-trajectories were calculated at these spatial resolutions. The observations show the simultaneous occurrence of dust transport, descent of mid-tropospheric air and sea breeze circulation on 17 June. Local pollution effects on the aerosol distribution, and a possible event of new particles formation were also observed. A large variability in the thermodynamical structure and aerosol distribution in the flight region, extending by approximately 30 km along the coast, was found. Within this complex, environment-relevant differences in the back-trajectories calculated at different spatial resolutions are found, suggesting that the description of several dynamical processes, and in particular the sea breeze circulation, requires high-resolution meteorological analyses. The study also shows that the integration of different observational techniques is needed to describe these complex conditions; in particular, the availability of flights and their timing with respect to the occurring phenomena are crucial.				di Sarra, Alcide/J-1491-2016	di Sarra, Alcide/0000-0002-2405-2898; Junkermann, Wolfgang/0000-0002-7461-3024												0280-6509	1600-0889					2015	67								27721	10.3402/tellusb.v67.27721								WOS:000362822000001

Joint retrievals of cloud and drizzle in marine boundary layer clouds using ground-based radar, lidar and zenith radiances	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Active remote sensing of marine boundary-layer clouds is challenging as drizzle drops often dominate the observed radar reflectivity. We present a new method to simultaneously retrieve cloud and drizzle vertical profiles in drizzling boundary-layer clouds using surface-based observations of radar reflectivity, lidar attenuated backscatter, and zenith radiances under conditions when precipitation does not reach the surface. Specifically, the vertical structure of droplet size and water content of both cloud and drizzle is characterised throughout the cloud. An ensemble optimal estimation approach provides full error statistics given the uncertainty in the observations. To evaluate the new method, we first perform retrievals using synthetic measurements from large-eddy simulation snapshots of cumulus under stratocumulus, where cloud water path is retrieved with an error of 31 g m(-2). The method also performs well in non-drizzling clouds where no assumption of the cloud profile is required. We then apply the method to observations of marine stratocumulus obtained during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement MAGIC deployment in the Northeast Pacific. Here, retrieved cloud water path agrees well with independent three-channel microwave radiometer retrievals, with a root mean square difference of 10-20 g m(-2).

Derivation and analysis of a complete modern-date glacier inventory for Alaska and northwest Canada	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												We present a detailed, complete glacier inventory for Alaska and neighboring Canada using multi-sensor satellite data from 2000 to 2011. For each glacier, we derive outlines and 51 variables, including center-line lengths, outline types and debris cover. We find 86 723 km(2) of glacier area (27 109 glaciers >0.025 km(2)), similar to 12% of the global glacierized area outside ice sheets. Of this area 12.0% is drained by 39 marine-terminating glaciers (74 km of tidewater margin), and 19.3% by 148 lake- and river-terminating glaciers (420 km of lake-/river margin). The overall debris cover is 11%, with considerable differences among regions, ranging from 1.4% in the Kenai Mountains to 28% in the Central Alaska Range. Comparison of outlines from different sources on >2500 km(2) of glacierized area yields a total area difference of similar to 10%, emphasizing the difficulties in accurately delineating debris-covered glaciers. Assuming fully correlated (systematic) errors, uncertainties in area reach 6% for all Alaska glaciers, but further analysis is needed to explore adequate error correlation scales. Preliminary analysis of the glacier database yields a new set of well-constrained area/length scaling parameters and shows good agreement between our area altitude distributions and previously established synthetic hypsometries. The new glacier database will be valuable to further explore relations between glacier variables and glacier behavior.

Marine eutrophication constitutes an important facet of ocean water quality, and pertains to the natural process representing excessive algal growth due to nutrient supply of marine systems. Remote sensing technology provides the de-facto means for marine eutrophication assessment over large regions of the ocean, with increasingly high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work, monthly measurements of sea water quality variables - chlorophyll, nitrates, phosphates, dissolved oxygen - obtained from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) with spatial resolution 0.125 degrees for the East Mediterranean region over the period January 1999 to December 2010, are used to define regions or zones of similar eutrophication levels. A novel variant of the K-medoids clustering algorithm is proposed, whereby the spatial association of the different variables (multivariate textural information) is explicitly accounted for in terms of the multivariate variogram; i.e., a measure of joint dissimilarity between different variables as a function of geographical distance. Similar water quality regions are obtained for various months and years, focusing on the spring season and on the qualitative comparison of the traditional and proposed classification methods. The results indicate that the proposed clustering method yields more physically meaningful clusters due to the incorporation of the multivariate textural information.

On 13 July 2013, Typhoon Soulik crossed the Taiwan Strait, causing a significant impact on the strait's marine system. In this article, we document the use of remote-sensing data to study this impact by comparing sea surface temperature (SST), spatial distributions and concentrations of chlorophyll (Chl-a), and total suspended matter (TSM) in the strait over different time periods. During and after the typhoon, the TSM of the waters near the Minjiang estuary dramatically increased, while Chl-a and SST significantly decreased. To the southeast of Pingtan Island, the SST decreased and Chl-a significantly increased, causing strong upwelling that lasted eight to ten days. To the northwest of Taiwan Island, Chl-a and the TSM of the coastal waters dramatically increased. The strong cyclonic wind-stress of the typhoon enhanced heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere, and a large amount of rainfall and run-off significantly decreased the SST. During the typhoon, the increased sediment discharged into the strait by rivers, and the re-suspension of seafloor sediment, increased the concentration of TSM in the coastal waters. Seawater with relatively high sediment concentration was transported to the middle of the strait after being carried by wind-induced flows. In the waters near the typhoon's path, especially in the upwelling area, nutrient-rich bottom water stirred by the typhoon promoted an outbreak of aquatic organisms and significantly increased the probability of a red tide occurrence.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2015	36	8					2201	2218		10.1080/01431161.2015.1035407								WOS:000353577600012

We conducted a TRI survey of Breioamerkurjokull, a marine-terminating glacier in Iceland, imaging its terminus near the end of the melt season in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The ice velocities were as high as 5 m d(-1), with the fastest velocities near the calving front. Retreat of the glacier over the 3 year observation period was accompanied by strong embayment formation. Iceberg tracking with the radar shows high current velocities near the embayment, probably indicating strong meltwater outflow and mixing with relatively warm lagoon water.

Currently, the detection approach of monitoring the phenomenon of marine oil spill are usually divided into two types, which are optical and synthetic aperture radar SAR remote sensing imagery. Among all satellite sensors, SAR is still the most utilized for operational oil spill detection. Thus, adopt SAR imagery to achieve routinely monitoring. In the image analysis process, the discrimination of oil spills and look-alike phenomena e.g., low wind area, wind front area and natural slicks on SAR is a crucial task in marine oil spill. A support vector machine is employed to remote sensing image classification in this paper. Through the simulation of the Dalian oil spill event, the effectiveness of the proposed approach for SAR satellite image classification is verified. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Oil platforms and ships have different modes of behavior: offshore ships usually move with time, and even if they are moored, this mooring status won't last for months or years; while oil platforms are usually in the same place for a long time till they are removed or destroyed in disasters. In this paper, a detection strategy of ships and offshore oil platforms on the basis of remote sensing images and geographic information system was proposed. Satellite images were used to detect the distribution of ships and oil platforms in the Bohai Sea, and the map of oil spill risk from ships and oil rigs in the Bohai Sea was generated on the basis of an averaged oil spill probability.

Hygroscopic growth of atmospheric aerosol particles based on active remote sensing and radiosounding measurements: selected cases in southeastern Spain	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												A new methodology based on combining active and passive remote sensing and simultaneous and collocated radiosounding data to study the aerosol hygroscopic growth effects on the particle optical and microphysical properties is presented. The identification of hygroscopic growth situations combines the analysis of multispectral aerosol particle backscatter coefficient and particle linear depolarization ratio with thermodynamic profiling of the atmospheric column. We analyzed the hygroscopic growth effects on aerosol properties, namely the aerosol particle backscatter coefficient and the volume concentration profiles, using data gathered at Granada EARLINET station. Two study cases, corresponding to different aerosol loads and different aerosol types, are used for illustrating the potential of this methodology. Values of the aerosol particle backscatter coefficient enhancement factors range from 2.1 +/- 0.8 to 3.9 +/- 1.5, in the ranges of relative humidity 60-90 and 40-83 %, being similar to those previously reported in the literature. Differences in the enhancement factor are directly linked to the composition of the atmospheric aerosol. The largest value of the aerosol particle backscatter coefficient enhancement factor corresponds to the presence of sulphate and marine particles that are more affected by hygroscopic growth. On the contrary, the lowest value of the enhancement factor corresponds to an aerosol mixture containing sulphates and slight traces of mineral dust. The Hanel parameterization is applied to these case studies, obtaining results within the range of values reported in previous studies, with values of the gamma exponent of 0.56 +/- 0.01 (for anthropogenic particles slightly influenced by mineral dust) and 1.07 +/- 0.01 (for the situation dominated by anthropogenic particles), showing the convenience of this remote sensing approach for the study of hygroscopic effects of the atmospheric aerosol under ambient unperturbed conditions. For the first time, the retrieval of the volume concentration profiles for these cases using the Lidar Radiometer Inversion Code (LIRIC) allows us to analyze the aerosol hygroscopic growth effects on aerosol volume concentration, observing a stronger increase of the fine mode volume concentration with increasing relative humidity.

In operational mode it computes 48-h forecasts of the hydrodynamic and biochemical parameters describing the Baltic Sea state. The Cressman assimilation scheme was implemented as part of the system in order to improve overall model accuracy. The system uses satellite-measured sea surface temperature from the MODIS Aqua spectroradiometer for the assimilation process. The satellite measured SST is obtained from a predefined server, which is part of the Satellite Monitoring of the Baltic Sea Environment project (SatBattyk). To validate the model results and the impact of assimilation on the model's accuracy, two separate test runs were performed using historical data covering the years 2011 and 2012. Independent computations were performed for the model with and without satellite SST assimilation, respectively referred to in this paper as 3D CEMBS_A and 3D CEMBS. The results of the computations were then compared with satellite and in situ measured data to validate the model and the assimilation scheme's implementation. The objective of this paper is to describe the implementation of the satellite SST data assimilation algorithm and to present the results of the preliminary validation of the models with observations.

A new algorithm to retrieve chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption spectra in the UV from ocean color	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Accurate estimation of the absorption coefficient (a(g)) for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) over ultraviolet (UV) and short visible radiation wavelengths (with =275-450 nm) is crucial to provide a robust assessment of the biogeochemical significance of UV in the global ocean. Using a training data set spanning a variety of water types from the clearest open ocean to dynamic inshore waters, a novel algorithm to accurately resolve CDOM absorption spectra from ocean color is presented. Employing a suite of multivariate statistical approaches (principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and multiple linear regression), this new algorithm was developed with matched field data for CDOM spectra and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) at Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) bands. Freed from any presupposition about CDOM spectral shape or conventional spectral extrapolations from visible data, our algorithm allows direct retrieval of a fully resolved CDOM absorption spectrum over UV wavelengths from visible R-rs and further enables a global scale view of the dynamics of CDOM over different water types. Accuracy of a(g) retrieval is good, with a mean absolute percent difference for a(g) in the UV of approximate to 25%. With fully resolved spectra, maps of calculated CDOM spectral slopes (S275-295, S350-400) and slope ratios (S-R) are presented with the potential to provide new information about the chemical composition (e.g., molecular weight and aromaticity), sources, transformation, and cycling pathways of CDOM on global as well as regional scales. The new algorithm will contribute to improved accuracy for photochemical and photobiological rate calculations from ocean color.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JAN	2015	120	1					496	516		10.1002/2014JC010241								WOS:000349890000029

The influence of aerosols strongly depends on their spatial distribution and optical properties. The aerosol has natural and anthropogenic origin. Aerosol types can be also classified according to their size, sources or geographical origin (desert, continental, marine etc.). Mineral dust is one of the natural aerosols presented in the atmosphere. Its main source is the Sahara desert region. Saharan aerosol layers are frequently observed in Europe by means of active and passive remote sensing devices, especially in the frame of EARLINET and ACTRIS (3,) (5,) (6,) (7,) (8,) (9). In this paper, observations of vertical distribution of aerosols and assessment of their optical properties will be presented. Two-year (2013-2014) complex measurements were carried out by a ceilometer CHM-15k (Jenoptic) and two lidars in an urban area located in a mountain valley (Sofia, Bulgaria)(1). The ceilometer works 24 hours in automatic mode. Part of the results is compared with results obtained by lidars operating in photon counting modes for specific periods of simultaneous work(5). Supplementary data from: two meteorological stations; HYSPLIT back trajectory model(4); BSC-DREAM8b dust model(9); and the database of atmospheric radio sounding profiles from Department of Atmospheric Engineering of Wyoming University (USA) are also used in the analysis of the obtained results.

J	Banks, AC; Melin, F				Banks, Andrew Clive; Melin, Frederic			An assessment of cloud masking schemes for satellite ocean colour data of marine optical extremes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												One of the most important steps in utilizing ocean colour remote-sensing data is subtracting the contribution of the atmosphere from the signal at the satellite to obtain marine water-leaving radiance. To be carried out accurately, this requires clear-sky conditions, i.e. all clouds need to be excluded or masked from the data prior to atmospheric correction. The standard cloud mask used routinely in the processing of NASA global ocean colour data is based on a simple threshold applied to the Rayleigh-corrected top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance. The threshold is kept purposefully low to ensure high-quality processing at a global scale. As a consequence, the standard scheme can sometimes inadvertently mask important extreme optical events such as intense blue-green algal (cyanobacteria) blooms or the outflow of sediment-rich waters from some of the world's largest rivers. However, the importance of these extreme conditions, both for ecological and hydrological applications, requires that they should be appropriately monitored. Therefore, an assessment of existing cloud masking schemes that could provide valuable alternatives was carried out. A new hybrid cloud mask was also proposed and similarly tested. The selected schemes were systematically assessed over a full annual cycle of satellite ocean colour data on three example regions: the Baltic Sea, the Black and Azov Seas, and the Amazon River delta. The results indicate that the application of alternative cloud masking schemes produces a significant increase in clear-sky diagnostics that varies with the scheme and the region. Major occurrences of extreme optical conditions, such as cyanobacteria blooms, or river deltas formerly excluded from any processing may be recovered, but some schemes may underestimate the amount of thin clouds potentially detrimental to ocean colour atmospheric correction.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2015	36	3					797	821		10.1080/01431161.2014.1001085								WOS:000349639100008

Here we report on how active natural seepage can be detected and located in the water column and at the sea bed in real time through the integration of marine X-band radar, synthetic aperture radar, field observations, high resolution single beam acoustic methods, and meta-ocean data from the marine environment with a simple bubble rise model. The extent of predictions made using a bubble rise model narrow down the likely seafloor origin point of an observed surface feature to within a radius of 630 m within which clusters of acoustic contacts were detected. Use of averaged deep current velocities and directions narrows the radius to 130 m, and use of a smaller established range of bubble rise speeds from the Gulf of Mexico can narrow the predicted seafloor origin radius further to 16.5 m. These results are useful for focussing detailed sea bed search patterns for natural seepage and are also suggestive of a seep system with complex water column trajectories associated with Biloxi Dome in the Gulf of Mexico.

Evaluation of coastal erosion and accretion processes along the southwest coast of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu using geospatial techniques	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The impact of coastal erosion has adversely affected the socioeconomic conditions of the coastal community worldwide. The coastal environment is experiencing a wide range of natural and anthropogenic pressure in India. This study was carried out along the southwest coast of Kanyakumari, South India using multitemporal Landsat satellite images from 1999 to 2011. The long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 1999 and 2011, and the subsequent short-term changes were performed during 1999-2000, 2005-2006, and 2010-2011. Thus, the long-term coastal changes indicate that the net erosion rate is higher on the coasts of Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Manavalakurichi, Mandaikadu, and Thengapattinam; the values are 0.118, 0.105, 0.127, 0.133, and 0.017 m(2), respectively. Meanwhile, the annual erosion rate of these areas is 10,000, 9,000, 11,000, and 1000 m(2)/year. The coastal zones Ganapathipuram and Enayamputhandurai have experienced accretion; the net accretion rate is 0.271 and 0.081 m(2), respectively. Coastal beaches, beach ridges, and marine terraces are predominantly disturbed by the hydrodynamic processes including wave action, littoral current, and intervention of littoral drift by the artificial coastal structures like groins, revetments, and seawalls. Moreover, the study area has been demarcated with site-specific erosion and accretion zones based on the frequent seaward or landward coastline fluctuation through geospatial technique.

Satellite remote sensing data can be used to model marine microbial metabolite turnover	ISME JOURNAL												Sampling ecosystems, even at a local scale, at the temporal and spatial resolution necessary to capture natural variability in microbial communities are prohibitively expensive. We extrapolated marine surface microbial community structure and metabolic potential from 72 16S rRNA amplicon and 8 metagenomic observations using remotely sensed environmental parameters to create a system- scale model of marine microbial metabolism for 5904 grid cells (49km(2)) in the Western English Chanel, across 3 years of weekly averages. Thirteen environmental variables predicted the relative abundance of 24 bacterial Orders and 1715 unique enzyme-encoding genes that encode turnover of 2893 metabolites. The genes' predicted relative abundance was highly correlated (Pearson Correlation 0.72, P-value <10(-6)) with their observed relative abundance in sequenced metagenomes. Predictions of the relative turnover (synthesis or consumption) of CO2 were significantly correlated with observed surface CO2 fugacity. The spatial and temporal variation in the predicted relative abundances of genes coding for cyanase, carbon monoxide and malate dehydrogenase were investigated along with the predicted inter-annual variation in relative consumption or production of similar to 3000 metabolites forming six significant temporal clusters. These spatiotemporal distributions could possibly be explained by the co-occurrence of anaerobic and aerobic metabolisms associated with localized plankton blooms or sediment resuspension, which facilitate the presence of anaerobic micro-niches. This predictive model provides a general framework for focusing future sampling and experimental design to relate biogeochemical turnover to microbial ecology.

J	Finkl, CW; Makowski, C				Finkl, Charles W.; Makowski, Christopher			Autoclassification versus Cognitive Interpretation of Digital Bathymetric Data in Terms of Geomorphological Features for Seafloor Characterization	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The determination of seafloor geomorphological features has always been a difficult task, and it was not until the advent of marine remote sensing techniques that seafloor features could be accurately discerned. Airborne acquisition of digital bathymetric data provides a wealth of information that can be interpreted in different ways. This paper considers the pros and cons of computerized autoclassifications versus cognitive interpretations of seafloor features. The continental shelf off the southeast Florida coast contains LADS (laser airborne depth sounding) surveys that are here used to compare and contrast automated classifications of bathymetry with cognitive differentiation of marine geomorphological features. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with each approach, and the choice of methods depends on the purpose or goals of the project. Once seafloor features have been cognitively discerned from enhanced, color ramped, and vertically exaggerated bathymetry, machine classifications can be compared with known units. Using ArcGIs (R) ArcMap software, five- and seven-class unsupervised isocluster autoclassifications were found to moderately represent known bottom topography, whereas the interactive supervised autoclassification closely approximated cognitively discerned bathymetric patterns. Hand-drawn or digitized cognitively derived maps were more generalized than supervised computerized classifications based on training fields. Overall, both methods were found to be beneficial approaches, as they complement each other.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2015	31	1					1	16		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-14A-00006.1								WOS:000347868900001

Remotely sensed information was combined with on-board observer's data and published information to investigate the role of distinctive oceanographic features in relation to the life cycle of the Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), main target of the industrial fleet in SJG. Three frontal systems North, South and Outer SJG-are characterized. The North and South SJG fronts are associated with shrimp reproductive aggregations during late spring and summer. While both function as spawning/nursery grounds, they differ from each other in many respects. The thermohaline South SJG front has its maximum expression during the winter, reflecting the influence of the low-salinity Magellanic Plume, while the thermal North SJG front develops during spring and summer as the water column becomes stratified in the central basin of the gulf. Wind-related downwelling inshore of the front prevails in the North SJG, and upwelling in the South SJG frontal area. Chlorophyll a is concentrated near the thermocline on the stratified side of the North SJG, and for that reason, it is not detected by remote sensors during the spring bloom and the summer but becomes apparent offshore from the location of the front when the thermocline deepens during the fall (May). In the South SJG front, ChI-a concentration is apparent inshore from the front all year-round, related in part to upwelling-mediated resuspension. The northern end of the outer front coincides in time and space with a recurrent non-reproductive aggregation of red shrimp between November and January and is presumably related to foraging. It is argued that keeping the North and South SJG frontal systems off-limits to fishing is a central precautionary requisite for the sustainability of the shrimp fishery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A single algorithm to retrieve turbidity from remotely-sensed data in all coastal and estuarine waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Ocean color remote sensing has been shown to be a useful tool to map turbidity (T) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in turbid coastal waters. Different algorithms to retrieve T and/or SPM from water reflectance already exist, however there are important questions as to whether these algorithms need to be calibrated specifically for different regions. In the present work the potential generality of a semi-empirical single band turbidity retrieval algorithm using the near infrared (NIR) band at 859 nm in highly turbid waters is assessed. For completeness the use of 645 nm in medium to low turbidity waters is also proposed. Radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements from various European and South American coastal and shallow estuarine environments characterized by high concentrations of suspended sediments are analyzed. Reflectance and turbidity measurements were performed in the southern North Sea (SNS) and French Guyana (FG) coastal waters, and Scheldt (SC), Gironde (GIR) and Rio de la Plata (RdP) estuaries. Simulations showed that uncertainty for turbidity estimation associated with different particle types and bidirectional effects is typically less than 6%. When applied to field data from the five different sites, the semi-analytical algorithm performed well: turbidity estimates were within 12% and 22% of in situ values. A good performance was also found when the entire database was analyzed (n = 106) with a mean relative error of 13.7% and bias of 4.8%. The good performance of the algorithm for all these regions, despite differences in sediment characteristics, and the results of the radiative transfer simulations suggest the global applicability of the algorithm to map turbidity up to 1000 FNU. Consequently regional algorithms to retrieve SPM concentration from reflectance can be designed by combining this global algorithm to retrieve T from water reflectance with a regional relationship to convert T to SPM. This has the very practical advantage that the measurements needed to calibrate the latter T/SPM conversion for any new region are much easier and cheaper than in situ reflectance measurements.

Using the unique spectral signature of guano to identify unknown seabird colonies	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Despite the threats faced by seabirds in both terrestrial and marine habitats, even basic knowledge of the locations of colonies, population sizes and trends is lacking for many remote areas of the world. Recent studies have shown that the guano of Adelie penguins can be identified from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery and used to map colonies on coasts around continental Antarctica. Our study highlights a new technique based on the unique spectral signature of guano that can be used to discriminate seabird colonies from background geology and vegetation in a wider range of natural environments, including the vegetated and zoologically-diverse region of the Antarctic Peninsula; moreover, the method was effective for all densely colonial, surface-nesting seabirds. Using Landsat ETM imagery, we correctly identified all known seabird colonies of over 50 pairs in the area of Marguerite Bay. Almost all other areas with a similar spectral signature that were outside known breeding areas were single pixels that were readily distinguishable from genuine colonies. If these were excluded, only 4.1% of pixels appeared to represent unknown breeding or roosting sites, and warrant further investigation. The spatial extent of the guano provided a general guide to the number of individuals present, but further work would be required to determine the accuracy of this method for estimating population size. Spectral profiles of guano collected by satellite and hand-held spectrometers were compared with available data in spectral libraries and did not match with any known geological profile. There may also be potential for discriminating colonies of different species that differ in phenology and show seasonal changes in diet by the carefully-timed acquisition of suitable satellite imagery. We conclude that the remotely-sensed guano signature is a good indicator of the location of seabird breeding or roosting sites, with potentially wide application to other areas of the world.

However, these products lack information on the community structure of the phytoplankton, which is crucial for ecological modelling and ecosystem studies. To assess the usefulness of existing methods to differentiate phytoplankton functional types (PFT) or phytoplankton size classes from satellite data, in-situ phytoplankton samples collected in the Western Iberian coast, on the North-East Atlantic, were analysed for pigments and absorption spectra. Water samples were collected in five different locations, four of which were located near the shore and another in an open-ocean, seamount region. Three different modelling approaches for deriving phytoplankton size classes were applied to the in situ data. Approaches tested provide phytoplankton size class information based on the input of pigments data (Brewin et al., 2010), absorption spectra data (Ciotti et al., 2002) or both (Uitz et al., 2008). Following Uitz et al. (2008), results revealed high variability in microphytoplankton chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09 m(2) (mg chl)(-1) between 400 and 500 nm. This spectral analysis suggested, in one of the regions, the existence of small cells (<20 mu m) in the fraction of phytoplankton presumed to be microphytoplankton (based on diagnostic pigments). Ciotti et al. (2002) approach yielded the highest differences between modelled and measured absorption spectra for the locations where samples had high variability in community structure and cell size. The Brewin et al. (2010) pigment-based model was adjusted and a set of model coefficients are presented and recommended for future studies in offshore water of the Western Iberian coast.

J	Parthasarathy, A; Natesan, U				Parthasarathy, Anitha; Natesan, Usha			Coastal vulnerability assessment: a case study on erosion and coastal change along Tuticorin, Gulf of Mannar	NATURAL HAZARDS												Assessment of vulnerability is essential for identifying and recognizing the coastal livelihood, socio-economic and ecological security status. However, coastal vulnerability assessments require a complex dataset including human and socio-economic factors. In this study, we investigated coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to map the vulnerability of Tuticorin coast toward coastal erosion using remote sensing data and geographical information techniques based on a multi-indicator approach. Gulf of Mannar located along the southeast coast of India and declared as a marine national park with high ecological diversity faces threat due to anthropogenic interventions as a result of industrialization, sand and coral mining, etc. CVI highlights the vicinity where the physical effects may be the greatest. Beach width was considered as an additional parameter, since a large number of coastal habitations were present adjacent to the beach along the study area. Coastal erosion, slope and relative sea level rise are the major factors affecting the coastal vulnerability in Tuticorin. CVI scores were categorized into four classes, viz., low, moderate, high and very high risk. Out of 84-km coastal stretch, 15 % falls under high risk, 12 % moderate vulnerability and 73 % the low vulnerable category. This approach provides an insight to assess the vulnerability and the degree of potential threat to the coastal system in order to prioritize actions and to develop adaptation measures.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				JAN	2015	75	2					1713	1729		10.1007/s11069-014-1394-y								WOS:000346407100033

Acoustic data were collected continuously at 38 kHz frequency during eighteen transits carried out in the South-West Indian Ocean (20-60 degrees S, 50-80 degrees E) between 2010 and 2014. The data set used includes scientific and opportunistic fishing surveys from Integrated Marine Observing System database. A structure in three main depth layers i.e., "surface", "intermediate" and "deep", has been found continuously all along the survey. Changes of micronektonic vertical structure were investigated along North South latitude: the surface layer acoustic density and thickness decrease by going southward. The intermediate layer is generally almost empty except between 30 degrees S and 40 degrees S. The deep layer acoustic density increases from North to South but its thickness does not change significantly. To assess the importance of these vertical changes, a spatially constrained clustering was applied on acoustic data and a positive correlation was established between vertical acoustic organization and oceanographic fronts' position. We conclude that spatial organization of micronekton is structured depending on water masses and confirm the interest of collecting acoustic data from fishery vessels to complete scientific surveys that are often restricted in time and space.

Low-cost Bathymetric Survey for Marine Protected Areas: coral reefs and coastal islands	2015 IEEE/OES ACOUSTICS IN UNDERWATER GEOSCIENCES SYMPOSIUM					IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)	JUL 29-31, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE OES				Bathymetry surveys are the first step for every conservation effort on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Maps depicting depth and bottom geomorphology are used to generate hillshades, that later become basemaps for other themes, such as fish distribution, bottom types, and water quality. Bathymetry map availability is limited or non-existent at the scales that are necessary for MPA management plans. Survey costs by traditional sounding methods or new technologies, such as LIDAR, are prohibitive for most MPA budgets. Remote Sensing bathymetry is yet unreliable, except for crystal clear waters. A low-cost technique, based on commercially available GPS-echosounder units was applied to obtain detailed bathymetry of two MPAs in coastal Brazil: at the Parque Municipal Marinho da Coroa Alta ((PMMCA), located in the coastal reefs of Santa Cruz de Cabralia, State of Bahia, and Monumento Natural das Ilhas Cagarras ((MNIC), off Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro. Equipment consisted of a Simrad NSS-7 chartplotter mounted permanently on Iamany, a 7 m-long, fiberglass-hull, twin-engine boat for PMMCA, and a Garmin GPSMap 521 chartplotter mounted on Cacao, an inflatable, 6 m-long, single-engine boat hired for MNIC. Survey frequencies for the echosounders were set at 50 kHz. Cross-shelf, East-West lines spaced 100m apart with readings every second ((1-3 m, depending on boat speed) were obtained for PMMCA over 30 days of 4-6 hours of navigation around the highest tide ((ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 m above mean sea-level). At MNIC, radial lines surrounding each of the islands were placed 50 m apart at their outer limits, and readings were obtained every 10 seconds (similar to 10 m) in 7 days of 3-4 hours of navigation around the highest tides ((ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 m above mean sea-level). In the shallow coral reefs of Bahia, 62 km(2) were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 20m, while at the sandy bottom around the granite-gneiss islands of Rio de Janeiro, 6 km2 were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 40m. Data in the echosounders proprietary format, were saved on Micro-SD or SD memory cards, converted to XYZ format (.csv) and migrated to GIS, where a linear tide correction was applied. Interpolation methods such as Radial Basis Functions and ANUDEM generated maps with 10 m pixels for PMMCA ((presented at 1: 10.000 and 1: 25.000) and 5 m pixels for MNIC ((presented at 1: 3.000 and 1: 10.000). Average survey costs are estimated at R$500-650/day or R$1.000/km(2) (similar to US$ 250/day or similar to US$ 400/km(2)), depending on boat ownership vs. rental cost. This represents less than 1/10 of the official traditional survey costs, and even less when compared to LIDAR bathymetry. Precision obtained is an order of magnitude higher than previously available, and enough for environmental assessment for conservation management of the MPAs involved. Surveys were conducted at PMMCA under the auspices of Projeto Coral Vivo and at MNIC under Projeto Ilhas do Rio, both Petrobras Ambiental programmes.																			978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																		WOS:000412164600027						
B	Rivera-Collazo, IC			IEEE	Rivera-Collazo, Isabel C.			Looking at the 'Continent Divided by Water': coastal and human dynamics, and the potential for submerged landscapes in the Caribbean	2015 IEEE/OES ACOUSTICS IN UNDERWATER GEOSCIENCES SYMPOSIUM					IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)	JUL 29-31, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE OES				Research on the history and archaeology of the Caribbean has demonstrated the overwhelming importance of commerce and long distance trading and social networks for the peopling and the social development of the lands circling the Caribbean Sea. Navigation - riparian or maritime - is paramount in this consideration because water is ubiquitous in the 'water world' of the Caribbean Lowlands. The area includes the basins and deltas of two of the world's largest rivers, the Amazon and the Orinoco systems, and widely complex coastal plains stretching from northern Brazil and Surinam to Mexico, south Florida and the Caribbean Archipelago. The coastal dry land masses (continent or islands) are joined by water: rivers, swamps, marshes or the sea: a continent divided by water'. When the chronology of the social dynamics surrounding the Caribbean Sea are scrutinized, the pattern that emerges is of land - based economies and dispersed hunter - gatherer sites starting around 14kBP, but there is no evidence of settlement along the coasts or exploitation of marine resources until around 8kBP on the continents, or 7 -5kBP on the islands. These dates coincide with a general sea level stabilization at 3 - 5 m below msl around 7kya. As sea level rose, shallow coastal areas flooded, transforming the hydrology, oceanography and morphology of the coastlines. Given the rate of eustatic sea-level rise during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, much of the early coastal landscapes around the American continents and the Caribbean Islands should be currently submerged, along with the evidence of human use of ancient coasts. The dry sites we today assume as early reflect settlement patterns that correspond to a relatively late configuration of the coastal morphology. However, underwater archaeology in the Caribbean has mostly focused on wrecks, if on anything at all, with practically no attention being paid to drowned landscapes. No marine geophysics analysis has been applied to underwater archaeology in the Caribbean so far. Given that early evidence of human activity should be submerged and possibly buried, the application of acoustic remote sensing techniques is the most time and cost effective survey method. Among these, high - resolution multi-channel and 3D seismic reflection surveying, in particular 3D Chirp systems, have proven to be very useful for the investigation of drowned landscapes as they can provide detailed stratigraphic information and visualization of buried archaeological objects. Even though no local studies have been conducted yet, this presentation focuses on the northeastern corner of the Caribbean Archipelago, at the contact between the Greater and the Lesser Antilles (Mona Passage, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and the Anegada Passage), identifying areas with the highest potential for preservation of submerged landscapes and associated sites, from a geoarchaeological perspective. While side-scan sonars are useful to observe the sea floor and to identify shipwrecks or fishing technology, I emphasize on the potential of seismic surveys with sub-bottom profilers for the identification of buried ancient landscapes and associated sites, particularly in shallow, low-energy environments. This type of study and preliminary evaluation will serve as a basis to establish a solid collaborative research program that will permit a more complete understanding of the socio-natural dynamics of the peopling of the Caribbean region.																			978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																		WOS:000412164600058						
B	Sperle, M; Negri, E; Ternes, C			IEEE	Sperle, Marcelo; Negri, Eduardo; Ternes, Caroline			Automatic Classification of Sidescan Sonar Images for Mapping Marine Mineral Resources	2015 IEEE/OES ACOUSTICS IN UNDERWATER GEOSCIENCES SYMPOSIUM					IEEE/OES Acoustics in Underwater Geosciences Symposium (RIO Acoustics)	JUL 29-31, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE OES				The Brazilian continental shelf is one of the widest in the world, but its sea floor is still very poor known in terms of shallow mineral resources (siliceous, carbonates and heavy minerals sediments). The main source of published information on that comes from the Projeto REMAC (1974-1979) and the Programa REVIZEE (1995-2000), where a bare distribution of bottom sediment samples information were plotted on large scale maps. Despite of geophysical acoustics techniques have being widely used worldwide since fifty years ago, they are not often used in Brazil for a regular mapping of shallow mineral resources on the continental shelf. The exception is some local areas of interest for the oil industry. In this context, one of the easiest and cheapest ways for mapping the sea floor is the use of sidescan sonar imagery. Nowadays there are a number of Brazilian institutions and companies owners of these equipments and a few software for processing and interpretation of its data are available. However, as any geophysical data, the results depend a lot on direct geological information besides the professional expertise. In particular the interpretation of sidescan sonar images is very time consuming due to a labor-intensive and qualitative way of delimiting the sediment textural boundaries or targets, which generates many uncertainties. Another source of ambiguity comes from the interplay among the geotechnical properties of sediments/rocks, its spatial variations in 3D and the non-linear effects of the sound backscattering itself. One way for avoiding these subjectivities is the use of automated classification algorithms based on spectral analysis of the image properties. There is some commercial software in the market that produces reasonable results after automatic imaging classification. However, most of them are efficient only when the target object is well delimited-as for mapping cells in molecular biology or in remote sensing soil classification-but they produce odd results when the image properties change slightly. This is the case of acoustic images of sea floor resources acquired by sidescan sonar, because its backscattering changes in a complex way due to the spatial anisotropy; although the same target at different depths will give a different response due to sound transmission losses. In this paper we discuss the use of automated classification algorithms and its efficiency on mapping marine mineral resources based on sidescan sonar images. For this we have selected a strategic area on the Brazilian continental shelf where geological information is available for validating the results. The conclusion is that after the appropriate image processing (gain equalization, class definition, spatial and spectral subsets and filtering) we can automatically generate thematic textural maps of sea floor mineral resources, despite of its spatial and mineralogical complexities. These techniques might contribute for fast and standard mapping of marine mineral resources on the Brazilian continental shelf.																			978-1-4673-7019-6				2015																		WOS:000412164600037

PASSIVE ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENTS OF FLOW VELOCITY IN THE OCEAN	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION: MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ACOUSTICS, NOISE AND VIBRATION RESEARCH, 2015					22nd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)	JUL 12-16, 2015	Florence, ITALY					Measurements of velocity of oceanic currents are crucial for evaluating heat and mass transport, monitoring ocean dynamics, and understanding the ocean's role in climate. Reciprocal transmissions of acoustic signals provide a way to measure path-averaged current velocity in the ocean with high temporal resolution, on a large scale, and over extended periods of time. This approach is based on measurements of acoustic nonreciprocity, which is defined as differences between travel times or other acoustic quantities corresponding to sound propagation in opposite directions between two points. Acoustic nonreciprocity, which vanishes in motionless media, is a direct, sensitive measure of fluid motion, and is insensitive to uncertainties in the sound speed field and geometry of the experiment. The use of active reciprocal transmissions for ocean remote sensing applications is limited by capital and operational costs associated with low-frequency acoustic sources as well as concerns about potential impacts of transmissions on marine life. Underwater acoustic noise interferometry offers an alternative to active remote sensing by replacing probing signals generated by a dedicated source with two-point cross-correlations of diffuse ambient noise. Theory predicts that the cross-correlation function of diffuse noise measured at two locations in a generic inhomogeneous moving medium results in approximations to Green's functions describing sound propagation in opposite directions between the two measurement points; positive and negative lags correspond to propagation in opposite directions. Thus, two-point correlation functions allow one to quantify flow-induced acoustic nonreciprocity. In this paper, we use the data obtained in a noise interferometry experiment in the Straits of Florida to investigate the feasibility of passive remote sensing of currents in the ocean. We present the first experimental demonstration that acoustic nonreciprocity induced by oceanic currents can be measured by noise interferometry and that the current velocity can be retrieved from the acoustic noise cross-correlations.																			978-88-88942-48-3				2015																		WOS:000398997000020

Reclamation activities bring economic benefits and at the same time also bring great threat for offshore resources and coastal wetland ecosystem. At the end of the river, estuarine delta is a dynamic balancing system formed by the interaction of the hydrological process of river, sea and land. Because of its geographical position superiority, estuarine deltas often become populated areas of reclamation activity. Time-series remote sensing data, such as LANDSAT data hold considerable promise for investigating long-term dynamics of land use/cover change (LUCC), given their significant advantages of frequent temporal coverage and free cost. In this paper, through the support vector machine automatic interpretation method, the LUCC information for Liaohe estuary wetland from 1987 to 2014 was obtained using the LANDSAT images as the data source. Systems analysis of dynamic evolution characteristics was implemented for reclamation and land cover types in Liaohe wetland ecosystem. The reclamation estimation on the wetland ecosystem service function value loss was established, and the driving effect of reclamation on the evolution of wetland research was considered. Results show that ( 1) rapid growth for sea aquaculture and reclamation in 1987-1989 and the process slowed down in 1989-2000. Later during the period 2004-2014, the area of sea reclamation project increased rapidly (2) Liaohe estuarine wetland had been subject to much change. This resulted from direct and indirect impacts of the project of reclamation and marine aquaculture. The ecosystem service value was response to the wetland land use/cover changes. So it was concluded that the LUCC information can provide a reference for both ecological restoration and compensation funds after the formation of reclamation and effective wetland protection measures are needed informed by the change analysis.																			978-90-824846-0-1				2015							76	86										WOS:000398996200012

IMOS National Reference Stations: A Continental-Wide Physical, Chemical and Biological Coastal Observing System	PLOS ONE												Sustained observations allow for the tracking of change in oceanography and ecosystems, however, these are rare, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere. To address this in part, the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) implemented a network of nine National Reference Stations (NRS). The network builds on one long-term location, where monthly water sampling has been sustained since the 1940s and two others that commenced in the 1950s. In-situ continuously moored sensors and an enhanced monthly water sampling regime now collect more than 50 data streams. Building on sampling for temperature, salinity and nutrients, the network now observes dissolved oxygen, carbon, turbidity, currents, chlorophyll a and both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Additional parameters for studies of ocean acidification and bio-optics are collected at a sub-set of sites and all data is made freely and publically available. Our preliminary results demonstrate increased utility to observe extreme events, such as marine heat waves and coastal flooding; rare events, such as plankton blooms; and have, for the first time, allowed for consistent continental scale sampling and analysis of coastal zooplankton and phytoplankton communities. Independent water sampling allows for cross validation of the deployed sensors for quality control of data that now continuously tracks daily, seasonal and annual variation. The NRS will provide multi-decadal time series, against which more spatially replicated short-term studies can be referenced, models and remote sensing products validated, and improvements made to our understanding of how large-scale, long-term change and variability in the global ocean are affecting Australia's coastal seas and ecosystems. The NRS network provides an example of how a continental scaled observing systems can be developed to collect observations that integrate across physics, chemistry and biology.

This study presents an analysis of measurement uncertainties for a data set collected in the Ligurian Sea in Spring and assesses the impact on estimates of a(ph)(Chl)(*) (). It is found that a large proportion of apparent variability in this set of a(ph)(Chl)(*) () can be attributed to measurement errors.

Spectral-domain-based scattering analysis of fields radiated by distributed sources in planar-stratified environments with arbitrarily anisotropic layers	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												We discuss the numerically stable, spectral-domain computation and extraction of the scattered electromagnetic field excited by distributed sources embedded in planar-layered environments, where each layer may exhibit arbitrary and independent electrical and magnetic anisotropic response and loss profiles. This stands in contrast to many standard spectral-domain algorithms that are restricted to computing the fields radiated by Hertzian dipole sources in planar-layered environments where the media possess azimuthal-symmetric material tensors (i.e., isotropic, and certain classes of uniaxial, media). Although computing the scattered field, particularly when due to distributed sources, appears (from the analytical perspective, at least) relatively straightforward, different procedures within the computation chain, if not treated carefully, are inherently susceptible to numerical instabilities and (or) accuracy limitations due to the potential manifestation of numerically overflown and (or) numerically unbalanced terms entering the chain. Therefore, primary emphasis herein is given to effecting these tasks in a numerically stable and robust manner for all ranges of physical parameters. After discussing the causes behind, and means to mitigate, these sources of numerical instability, we validate the algorithm's performance against closed-form solutions. Finally, we validate and illustrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in case studies concerning active remote sensing of marine hydrocarbon reserves embedded deep within lossy, planar-layered media.

The results showed that the temperature, salinity, nutrients, and oxygen of seawater changed when El Nio/La Nia occurred. The variation of biological communities reflected the response of ecosystem to environmental changes. During El Nio period, Chl a concentration and phytoplankton community structure changed significantly, and the relative proportion of diatoms increased while dinoflagellates decreased. During La Nia period, the proportion of diatoms decreased, but the golden-brown algae and blue-green algae increased significantly. The variation of phytoplankton population directly affected the biodiversity of the bay, which were also quite sensitive to the marine environment changes. Meanwhile, the satellite remote sensing data of 2002-2011 (December-March) have been used to study the temporal connection change of Chl a and phytoplankton in the Prydz Bay. We found that there were significant differences in the monthly variation characteristics of satellite remote sensing Chl a and sea surface temperature (SST), which had some links with sea ice melting and El Nio/La Nia events. We found that the start time of bloom advanced, lagged or synchronized with the changes of the SST, and we also found the occurrence time of phytoplankton bloom corresponded with the sea ice melting inner bay. To some extent, this study will help us understand the relationships between ENSO events and the phytoplankton bloom in the Southern Ocean.

On the Front Line: frontal zones as priority at-sea conservation areas for mobile marine vertebrates	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												<list list-type="1" id="jpe12330-list-0001"> Identifying priority areas for marine vertebrate conservation is complex because species of conservation concern are highly mobile, inhabit dynamic habitats and are difficult to monitor. Many marine vertebrates are known to associate with oceanographic fronts - physical interfaces at the transition between water masses - for foraging and migration, making them important candidate sites for conservation. Here, we review associations between marine vertebrates and fronts and how they vary with scale, regional oceanography and foraging ecology. Accessibility, spatiotemporal predictability and relative productivity of front-associated foraging habitats are key aspects of their ecological importance. Predictable mesoscale (10s-100skm) regions of persistent frontal activity (frontal zones') are particularly significant. Frontal zones are hotspots of overlap between critical habitat and spatially explicit anthropogenic threats, such as the concentration of fisheries activity. As such, they represent tractable conservation units, in which to target measures for threat mitigation. Front mapping via Earth observation (EO) remote sensing facilitates identification and monitoring of these hotspots of vulnerability. Seasonal or climatological products can locate biophysical hotspots, while near-real-time front mapping augments the suite of tools supporting spatially dynamic ocean management.Synthesis and applications. Frontal zones are ecologically important for mobile marine vertebrates. We surmise that relative accessibility, predictability and productivity are key biophysical characteristics of ecologically significant frontal zones in contrasting oceanographic regions. Persistent frontal zones are potential priority conservation areas for multiple marine vertebrate taxa and are easily identifiable through front mapping via EO remote sensing. These insights are useful for marine spatial planning and marine biodiversity conservation, both within Exclusive Economic Zones and in the open oceans. Frontal zones are ecologically important for mobile marine vertebrates. We surmise that relative accessibility, predictability and productivity are key biophysical characteristics of ecologically significant frontal zones in contrasting oceanographic regions. Persistent frontal zones are potential priority conservation areas for multiple marine vertebrate taxa and are easily identifiable through front mapping via EO remote sensing. These insights are useful for marine spatial planning and marine biodiversity conservation, both within Exclusive Economic Zones and in the open oceans.

Christina; Tsay, Si-Chee; Chantara, Somporn			Interactions between biomass-burning aerosols and clouds over Southeast Asia: Current status, challenges, and perspectives	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The interactions between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation remain among the largest sources of uncertainty in the Earth's energy budget. Biomass-burning aerosols are a key feature of the global aerosol system, with significant annually-repeating fires in several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia (SEA). SEA in particular provides a "natural laboratory" for these studies, as smoke travels from source regions downwind in which it is coupled to persistent stratocumulus decks. However, SEA has been under-exploited for these studies. This review summarizes previous related field campaigns in SEA, with a focus on the ongoing Seven South East Asian Studies (7-SEAS) and results from the most recent BASELInE deployment. Progress from remote sensing and modeling studies, along with the challenges faced for these studies, are also discussed. We suggest that improvements to our knowledge of these aerosol/cloud effects require the synergistic use of field measurements with remote sensing and modeling tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Mesoscale fronts as foraging habitats: composite front mapping reveals oceanographic drivers of habitat use for a pelagic seabird	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE												The oceanographic drivers of marine vertebrate habitat use are poorly understood yet fundamental to our knowledge of marine ecosystem functioning. Here, we use composite front mapping and high-resolution GPS tracking to determine the significance of mesoscale oceanographic fronts as physical drivers of foraging habitat selection in northern gannets Morus bassanus. We tracked 66 breeding gannets from a Celtic Sea colony over 2 years and used residence time to identify area-restricted search (ARS) behaviour. Composite front maps identified thermal and chlorophyll-a mesoscale fronts at two different temporal scales-(i) contemporaneous fronts and (ii) seasonally persistent frontal zones. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), with generalized estimating equations (GEE-GAMs) to account for serial autocorrelation in tracking data, we found that gannets do not adjust their behaviour in response to contemporaneous fronts. However, ARS was more likely to occur within spatially predictable, seasonally persistent frontal zones (GAMs). Our results provide proof of concept that composite front mapping is a useful tool for studying the influence of oceanographic features on animal movements. Moreover, we highlight that frontal persistence is a crucial element of the formation of pelagic foraging hotspots for mobile marine vertebrates.

J	Abe, H; Ebuchi, N				Abe, Hiroto; Ebuchi, Naoto			Evaluation of sea-surface salinity observed by Aquarius	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Sea-surface salinity (SSS) observed by Aquarius was compared with global observations from Argo floats and offshore moored buoys to evaluate the quality of satellite SSS data and to assess error structures. Aquarius products retrieved by different algorithms (Aquarius Official Release version 3.0 [V3.0], Combined Active-Passive [CAP] algorithm version 3.0, and Remote Sensing Systems test bed algorithm version 3) were compared. The Aquarius SSS was in good agreement with in situ salinity measurements for all three products. Root-mean-square (rms) differences of the salinity residual, with respect to Argo salinity, ranged from 0.41 to 0.52 psu. These three Aquarius products exhibit high SSS deviation from Argo salinity under lower sea-surface temperature conditions (<10 degrees C) due to lower sensitivity of microwave emissivity to SSS. The CAP product deviates under strong wind conditions (>10 m s(-1)), probably due to model bias and uncertainty associated with sea-surface roughness. Furthermore, significant SSS differences between ascending (south-to-north) and descending (north-to-south) paths were detected. The monthly averaged Aquarius SSS (1 degrees x 1 degrees grid) was also compared with outputs from the ocean data optimal interpolation (OI) system operated by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science Technology (JAMSTEC) and the ocean data assimilation system used by the Meteorological Research Institute, Japan Meteorological Agency (MRI/JMA). Negative bias, attributed to near-surface salinity stratification by precipitation, was detected in tropical regions. For 40 degrees S-40 degrees N, rms difference, with respect to JAMSTEC OI, is 0.27 psu for the V3.0, while the CAP product rms difference is only 0.22 psu, which is close to the Aquarius mission goal.

Conflicts in Yellow River Delta protected areas (YRDPA) have arisen as a result of unpredictable natural hazards and unreasonable anthropogenic activities. The study applied remote sensing images and environmental and socioeconomic data to analyze the change of land use and land cover in YRDPA and to identify the driving forces for these changes from 1986 to 2010. The results show that land use has changed significantly over this period. The study analyzed the main conflict types, such as land use conflict, oil field exploration and wetland protection conflict, management conflict, and environmental conflict. The framework of conflict resolution is also presented, and resolution rules of sustainability, effectiveness, and adaptation are provided to mitigate conflicts to achieve coordinated marine management goals. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the causes and impacts of conflicts and to identify conflict resolution strategies for marine protected areas management.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2014	30	6					1307	1314		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-13-00199.1								WOS:000344828400019

Compared to Landsat heritage sensors, the OLI has enhanced features, which include its 12-bit radiometric resolution and the addition of a band centered at 443 nm. The dramatically improved data quality/quantity expands existing applications of Landsat imagery in aquatic sciences from the retrieval of bio-geochemical properties, such as near-surface concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS), to benthic mapping. This study offers analysis of OLI's absolute radiometric performance over bodies of water using benchmark observations, namely the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) ocean color observations and marine in situ radiometric measurements. Sensor-to-sensor comparisons are performed to derive gain factors (g(1)) from near-concurrent observations in TOA radiance and reflectance domains. The gains in the radiance domain were further validated/adjusted by determining a second set of gains (g(2)) via analysis of OLI-derived water-leaving radiance, i.e., L-w(lambda), against in situ measurements made either at the Ocean Color AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET-OC) sites or during field campaigns. The analyses yield the OLI calibration uncertainties that need to be accounted for when studying aquatic environments. It was found that, for the visible and near-infrared channels, the OLI radiometric responses, on average, are well in agreement (< 2 % discrepancies) with the TOA radiances estimated by ocean color satellites or those predicted by models based on measurements of aquatic and atmospheric properties. However, the TOA radiance at the new 443-nm band is found to be, on average, 3.4 % larger than the reference observations. The inter-sensor comparisons in the reflectance domain, however, indicated slightly different results with the OLI responses being low in the blue bands. To enhance the retrieval accuracy of aquatic-science products from OLI datasets, sets of temporally averaged gains (radiance and reflectance) are derived and recommended for use prior to the retrieval of in-water products.

Efficient and effective oil spill monitoring and detection can reduce response time, minimize remediation costs and limit dangerous impacts to the environment. An innovative satellite-based oil pollution detection framework is demonstrated in this paper, including satellite imaging system modeling-communication link configuration, noise model for image transmission and preprocessing. Finally, an optimized sequential detection of change-based image object detection algorithm is proposed to detect oil spill on the ocean surface from the enhanced remote sensing data. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer images of the Gulf of Mexico accident from NASA between May and June 2010 are adopted for testing in our framework. The results of this research show that the proposed algorithms can effectively distinguish the spill covering vast areas of the marine environment even with severe additive noise and have good separation properties against complex signatures, such as the vicinity to the irregular coast or foggy and cloudy weather conditions.																	1863-1703	1863-1711				NOV	2014	8	8					1405	1419		10.1007/s11760-012-0371-8								WOS:000344621800001

The infrared scanner (IRS), on board of HJ-1B, has an infrared channel IRS4 with 300 m and 4-days as its spatial and temporal resolution. Remote sensing data aquired using IRS4 is an available source for mornitoring thermal plume. Retrieval pattern for coastal sea surface temperature (SST) was built to monitor the thermal plume from nuclear power plant. The research area is located near Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS), where synchronized validations were also implemented. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data was interpolated spatially and temporally. The interpolated data as well as surface weather conditions were subsequently employed into radiative transfer model for the atmospheric correction of IRS4 thermal image. A look-up-table (LUT) was built for the inversion between IRS4 channel radiance and radiometric temperature, and a fitted function was also built from the LUT data for the same purpose. The SST was finally retrieved based on those preprocessing procedures mentioned above. The bulk temperature (BT) of 84 samples distributed near GNPS was shipboard collected synchronically using salinity-temperature-deepness (CTD) instruments. The discrete sample data was surface interpolated and compared with the satellite retrieved SST. Results show that the average BT over the study area is 0. 47 degrees C higher than the retrieved skin temperature (ST). For areas far away from outfall, the ST is higher than BT, with differences less than 1. 0 degrees C. The main driving force for temperature variations in these regions is solar radiation. For areas near outfall, on the contrary, the retrieved ST is lower than BT, and greater differences between the two (meaning > 1. 0 degrees C) happen when it gets closer to the outfall. Unlike the former case, the convective heat transfer resulting from the thermal plume is the primary reason leading to the temperature variations. Temperature rising (TR) distributions obtained from remote sensing data and in-situ measurements are consistent, except that the interpolated BT shows more level details (>5 levels) than that of the ST (up to 4 levels). The areas with higher TR levels (>2) are larger on BT maps, while for lower TR levels (<= 2), the two methods perform with no obvious differences. Minimal errors for satellite-derived SST occur regularly around local time 10 a. m. This makes the remote sensing results to be substitutes for in-situ measurements. Therefore, for operational applications of HJ-1B IRS4, remote sensing technique can be a practical approach to monitoring the nuclear plant thermal pollution around this time period.																	1000-0593					NOV	2014	34	11					3079	3084		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)11-3079-06								WOS:000344447700039

Predicting the distribution of deep-sea vulnerable marine ecosystems using high-resolution data: Considerations and novel approaches	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Little is known about species distribution patterns in deep-sea environments, primarily because sampling surveys in the high seas are expensive and time consuming. The increasing need to manage and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems, such as cold-water corals, has motivated the use of predictive modelling tools, which produce continuous maps of potential species or habitat distribution from limited point observations and full coverage environmental data. Rapid advances in acoustic remote sensing, oceanographic modelling and sampling technology now provide high quality datasets, facilitating model development with high spatial detail. This paper provides a short overview of existing methodologies for predicting deep-sea benthic species distribution, and illustrates emerging issues related to spatial and thematic data resolution, and the use of transect-derived species distribution data. In order to enhance the ecological relevance and reliability of deep-sea species distribution models, novel techniques are presented based on a case study predicting the distribution of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa in three carbonate mound provinces in Irish waters. Specifically, the study evaluates (1) the capacity of newly developed high-resolution (250 m grid cell size) hydrodynamic variables to explain local scale cold-water coral distribution patterns, (2) the potential value of species occurrence proportion data to maintain semi-quantitative information of coral prevalence (i.e. coverage) and sampling effort per grid cell within the response variable, and (3) mixed effect modelling to deal with spatially grouped transect data. The study shows that predictive models using vertical and horizontal flow parameters perform significantly better than models based on terrain parameters only. Semiquantitative proportion data may decrease model uncertainty and increase model reliability, and provide a fruitful avenue of research for analysing large quantities of video data in a detailed yet time-efficient manner. The study concludes with an outlook of how species distribution models could improve our understanding of vulnerable marine ecosystem functioning and processes in the deep sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating Light Availability, Seagrass Biomass, and Productivity Using Hyperspectral Airborne Remote Sensing in Saint Joseph's Bay, Florida	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Seagrasses provide a number of critical ecosystem services, including habitat for numerous species, sediment stabilization, and shoreline protection. Ariel photography is a useful tool to estimate the areal extent of seagrasses, but recent innovations in radiometrically calibrated sensors and algorithm development have allowed identification of benthic types and retrieval of absolute density. This study demonstrates the quantitative ability of a high spatial resolution (1 m) airborne hyperspectral sensor (3.2 nm bandwidth) in the complex coastal waters of Saint Joseph's Bay (SJB). Several benthic types were distinguished, including submerged and floating aquatic vegetation, benthic red algae, bare sand, and optically deep water. A total of 23.6 km(2) of benthic vegetation was detected, indicating no dramatic change in vegetation area over the past 30 years. SJB supported high seagrass density at depths shallower than 2 m with an average leaf area index of 2.0 +/- 0.6 m(2) m(-2). Annual seagrass production in the bay was 13,570 t C year(-1) and represented 41 % of total marine primary production. The effects of coarser spatial resolution were investigated and found to reduce biomass retrievals, underestimate productivity, and alter patch size statistics. Although data requirements for this approach are considerable, water column optical modeling may reduce the in situ requirements and facilitate the transition of this technique to routine monitoring efforts. The ability to quantify not just areal extent but also productivity of a seagrass meadow in optically complex coastal waters can provide information on the capacity of these environments to support marine food webs.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2014	37	6					1467	1489		10.1007/s12237-013-9764-3								WOS:000343722700012						
J	Chami, M; Thirouard, A; Harmel, T				Chami, Malik; Thirouard, Alexandre; Harmel, Tristan			POLVSM (Polarized Volume Scattering Meter) instrument: an innovative device to measure the directional and polarized scattering properties of hydrosols	OPTICS EXPRESS												An innovative instrument dedicated to the multispectral measurements of the directional and polarized scattering properties of the hydrosols, so-called POLVSM, is described. The instrument could be used onboard a ship, as a benchtop instrument, or at laboratory. The originality of the POLVSM concept relies on the use of a double periscopic optical system whose role is (i) to separate the plane containing the light source from the scattering plane containing the sample and the receiver and (ii) to prevent from any specularly reflected light within the sample chamber. As a result, a wide range of scattering angle, namely from 1 degrees to 179 degrees, is covered by the detector. Another originality of the instrument is to measure the Mueller scattering matrix elements, including the degree of polarization. A relevant calibration procedure, which could be of great interest as well for other instruments, is proposed to convert the raw data into physical units. The relative uncertainty in POLVSM data was determined at +/- 4.3%. The analysis of measurements of the volume scattering function and degree of polarization performed under controlled conditions for samples dominated either by inorganic hydrosols or phytoplankton monospecific species showed a good consistency with literature, thus confirming the good performance of the POLVSM device. Comparisons of POLVSM data with theoretical calculations showed that Mie theory could reproduce efficiently the measurements of the VSF and degree of polarization for the case of inorganic hydrosols sample, despite the likely non sphericity of these particles as revealed by one of the element of the Mueller matrix. Our results suggested as well that a sophisticated modeling of the heterogeneous internal structure of living cells, or at least, the use of layered sphere models, is needed to correctly predict the directional and polarized effects of phytoplankton on the oceanic radiation. The relevance of performing angularly resolved measurements of the Mueller scattering elements to gain understanding on the mechanisms processes involved in the scattering of light by marine particles, which has important implications for ocean color remote sensing studies, is demonstrated.

Great skua (Stercorarius skua) movements at sea in relation to marine renewable energy developments	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) are an increasing feature of the marine environment. Owing to the relatively small number of existing developments and the early stage of their associated environmental monitoring programmes, the effects of MREDs on seabirds are not fully known. Our ability to fully predict potential effects is limited by a lack of knowledge regarding movements of seabirds at sea. We used GPS tracking to improve our understanding of the movements at sea of a protected seabird species breeding in Scotland, the great skua (Stercorarius skua), to better predict how this species may be affected by MREDs. We found that the overlap of great skuas with leased and proposed MREDs was low; particularly with offshore wind sites, which are predicted to present a greater risk to great skuas than wave or tidal-stream developments. Failed breeders overlapped with larger areas of MREDs than breeding birds but the overall overlap with core areas used remained low. Overlap with wave energy development sites was greater than for offshore wind and tidal-stream sites. Comparison of 2011 data with historical data indicates that distances travelled by great skuas have likely increased over recent decades. This suggests that basing marine spatial planning decisions on short-term tracking data could be less informative than longer-term data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we highlight the importance of the Southern Ocean (SO) in developing a global algorithm for diatom using an Abundance Based Approach (ABA). A large global in situ data set of phytoplankton pigments was compiled, particularly with more samples collected in the SO. We revised the ABA to take account of the information on the penetration depth (Z(pd)) and to improve the relationship between diatoms and total chlorophyll-a (TChla). The results showed that there is a distinct relationship between diatoms and TChla in the SO, and a new global model (ABA(Zpd)) improved the estimation of diatoms abundance by 28% in the SO compared with the original ABA model. In addition, we developed a regional model for the SO which further improved the retrieval of diatoms by 17% compared with the global ABA(Zpd) model. As a result, we found that diatom may be more abundant in the SO than previously thought. Linear trend analysis of diatom abundance using the regional model for the SO showed that there are statistically significant trends, both increasing and decreasing, in diatom abundance over the past eleven years in the region.

Common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus interact with fish farms in the Mediterranean Sea. These interactions were investigated in a Greek bay by incorporating multiple geographic, bathymetric, oceanographic, and anthropogenic variables. 2. Generalized additive models (GAMs) and generalized estimation equations (GEEs) were used to describe dolphin presence. Visual surveys were conducted over 2909 km under favourable viewing conditions that included 54 dolphin group follows for 457 km. Sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data were obtained from remote sensing imagery, and distances to sources of human influences including fish farms, a ferro-nickel plant, and a slag disposal area were calculated within a geographic information system (GIS). 3. Bottlenose dolphins were encountered mainly in the south-eastern portion of the study area, and occurrence was not clearly related to SST and Chl-a, nor the ferro-nickel plant or nearby slag disposal area. 4. Dolphin occurrence generally increased within 20 km of fish farms, with four farms and dolphins displaying a positive relationship, seven no clear relationship, and two a negative one. 5. While it is likely that uneaten food and other detritus attract dolphin prey, individual farms (or clusters of farms) clearly had a different appeal. The proximity of the ferro-nickel plant and slag disposal area to attractive' fish farms could compromise dolphin health, but physiological data are unavailable. 6. The modelling of multiple variables allowed for a description of dolphin habitat use and attraction to some fish farms. More such data analysed in similar manner would be instructive for other areas where marine mammals and fish farms co-occur. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sargassum beds play a range of ecological roles in coastal waters, but their sustainability is threatened by pollution and reclamation within ASEAN countries with rapid economic growth. Before conservation initiatives can be implemented, it is necessary to establish their present distribution. These beds can be mapped using the noncommercial satellite, ALOS, which can provide multiband images using high spatial resolution optical sensors (sensitive to 10 m(-2) plots), AVNIR-2. These images are of sufficient quality for examining coastal ecosystems and, in this study, for mapping the Sargassum beds in the waters off the coast of Sattahip, Chon Buri Province, Thailand. This coastal zone is a natural marine park reserve and protected from human activities such as fishery and reclamation. Biomass data were obtained in January, February, March, and December 2009 from quadrat sampling. The biomass of Sargassum aquifolium (Turner) C. Agardh at a bottom depth of 1 m and 1.5-2 m was determined to be 7.73 and 92.75 g dw m(-2), while that of Sargassum oligocystum Montagne was found to be 44.05 and 87.97 g dw m(-2), respectively. Ground truth data were obtained in February and October 2012 from serial images taken by manta tow. Supervised classification is a procedure for identifying spectrally similar areas on an image by identifying "training" sites of known targets and then extrapolating those spectral signatures to other areas of unknown targets. By applying this methodology, the Sargassum beds off Sattahip can be detected with an accuracy of about 70%. It is estimated that the error is caused by mixel effects of the bottom substrates in individual pixels, each of which covers an area of 10 x 10 m. Our results indicate that the images captured by ALOS AVNIR-2 are informative and useful for mapping the -Sargassum beds in Southeast Asia.																	0006-8055	1437-4323				OCT	2014	57	5					367	377		10.1515/bot-2014-0015								WOS:000343111500004

Kendall			Autonomous Surface Vehicle Measurements of the Ocean's Response to Tropical Cyclone Freda	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												On 31 December 2012, an instrumented autonomous surface vehicle (ASV; Wave Glider) transiting across the Pacific from Hawaii to Australia as part of the Pacific Crossing (PacX) project came very close (46 km) to the center of a category 3 Tropical Cyclone (TC), Freda, experiencing winds of up to 37 ms(-1) and significant wave heights close to 10 m. The Wave Glider was instrumented for surface ocean-lower atmosphere (SOLA) measurements, including atmospheric pressure, surface winds and temperature, sea surface temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence (chlorophyll-a and turbidity), and surface-wave directional spectra. Such measurements in close proximity to a tropical cyclone are rare. This study presents novel observations of the ocean's response in three quadrants of TC Freda, collected from the instrumented glider. Evolution of the wind, the directional wave field, the sea surface temperature, and the Stokes drift profile (calculated from the wave directional spectrum) as Freda passed near the vehicle are examined. Results are discussed in the context of the recent coupled wind-wave modeling and large eddy simulation (LES) modeling of the marine boundary layer in Hurricane Frances (Sullivan et al. 2012). Processes by which cold nutrient-rich waters are entrained and mixed from below into the mixed layer as the TC passes near the Wave Glider are presented and discussed. The results of this encounter of an autonomous surface vehicle with TC Freda supports the use of ASVs for regular TC (hurricane) monitoring to complement remote sensing and "hurricane hunter" aircraft missions.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				OCT	2014	31	10					2169	2190		10.1175/JTECH-D-14-00012.1								WOS:000343071500012

Constraints on the late Quaternary glacial history of the Inylchek and Sary-Dzaz valleys from in situ cosmogenic Be-10 and Al-26, eastern Kyrgyz Tian Shan	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleoclimatic constraints from regions at the confluence of major climate systems are particularly important in understanding past climate change. Using geomorphic mapping based on remote sensing and field investigations, combined with in situ cosmogenic Be-10 and Al-26 dating of boulders associated with glacial landforms, we investigate the chronology of past glaciation in the Inylchek and Sary-Dzaz valleys in the eastern Kyrgyz Tian Shan, a tectonically active area with some of the highest peaks in the world outside of the Himalayas. Cosmogenic Be-10 and (26) Al exposure ages of boulders on moraines record up to five glacial advances including: Lateglacial age lateral moraine remnants and meltwater channels in the upper Inylchek Valley; Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage [MIS] 2) moraines in the Sary-Dzaz Valley and in a terminal moraine complex at the west end of the Inylchek Valley, overriding older moraines; an MIS 4 or 5 moraine remnant above the Inylchek terminal moraine complex; and an older high moraine remnant down-valley from the confluence of the Inylchek and Sary-Dzaz valleys. The evidence for glacial extent in this study is consistent with a limited ice expansion hypothesis for Tian Shan glaciation. Published results from the western and central Kyrgyz Tian Shan do not show evidence for significant LGM glacier expansion, which in combination with the results presented here, indicate a spatial variation in glacier records along the Tian Shan. This may reflect either paleoclimatic gradients or the impact of local physiographic conditions on responses to regional climate change, or both. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial assessment of fin whale hotspots and their association with krill within an important Antarctic feeding and fishing ground	MARINE BIOLOGY												Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus quoyi) habitat use and its relationship to environmental conditions are generally unknown in the Southern Ocean, presenting challenges for predicting their seasonal occurrence and potential effects of fishing pressure and climate change on this endangered species. Using biological data collected during 14 shipboard surveys off the northern Antarctic Peninsula and oceanographic data from satellite remote sensing, we mapped the distribution of fin whale hotspots, Antarctic krill abundance (biomass from acoustics, concentrations from nets) and ocean conditions during mid- and late-summer to investigate the environmental determinants of whale hotspots. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to test the hypothesis that intra-seasonal changes in fin whale hotspot distribution relate to sea surface temperature (SST), krill abundance and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). More whale hotspots (sightings and individuals) are observed during late- than mid-summer surveys. During mid-summer, hotspots occurred near Elephant Island while in late-summer they were distributed throughout the slope region in proximity to the mean location of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. The spatial mean of EKE did not differ between mid- and late-summer surveys, but the spatial mean of SST was significantly warmer during late-summer. The GAM for mid-summer indicates that fin whale hotspots were positively related to SST, EKE and acoustically determined krill biomass. The GAM for late-summer indicates the hotspots were negatively related to net-based krill abundance and positively related to acoustic krill biomass and EKE. This study is important because environmental determinants of fin whale hotspots may be used as reference points for implementing future conservation plans for their recovering populations.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				OCT	2014	161	10					2293	2305		10.1007/s00227-014-2506-7								WOS:000342415200009

Average water depths on the platform-tops, such as the Great Bahama Bank (GBB), are typically 10 m or less, with coral reef-rimmed margins, thick sediment accumulations, and the frequent occurrence of islands. There are, however, exceptions. For example, Cay Sal Bank (CSB), a little studied detached Bahamian carbonate platform with depths ranging from 30 to 7 m, is only slightly deeper than the GBB, but devoid of islands, lacks platform-margin coral reefs and holds little sediment on the platform-top; the platform is incipiently drowned. CSB is interesting as it is conspicuously larger (6000 sq. km) than other incipiently drowned platforms in the region, such as Serranilla Bank (1100 sq. km) and the Cat Island platform (1500 sq. km). Field and remote sensing data are assembled to provide insight into the sedimentology and geomorphology of the CSB. The influence of ocean climate, regional hydrodynamics, and Holocene flooding history are investigated to understand why platform-margin coral reef growth on CSB has been unable to keep pace with Holocene sea-level rise. A decade of regional sea-surface temperature data for the Bahamas report CSB to be situated in the same ocean climate regime as GBB. Temperature cannot explain the platform's different morphologies. The Florida Current has been evoked as a possible reason for the immature development of platform-top processes on the CSB, but numeric modeling suggests its influence to be restricted to the deep flanks of the bank. Further, sediment distribution on CSB, including infill patterns of karst depressions, suggest trade winds (easterlies) to drive platform-top hydrodynamics. By assembling a satellite-derived bathymetry map, it can be shown that CSB flooded earlier and at relatively higher rates of Holocene sea-level rise than its neighboring platforms. Flooding history is identified as the most feasible explanation for the atypical morphology of the CSB. By contrasting the present-day morphology of the CSB and the GBB, the work emphasizes how subtle differences in relative sea-level history can influence the growth of platform-margin coral reefs, features that in turn can conspire to set even closely neighboring carbonate platforms on divergent paths with regard to the development of marine landforms. This insight is relevant to interpreting the morphological diversity of carbonate platforms in the modem ocean and in the rock record. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Distributions of invertebrate larvae and phytoplankton in a coastal upwelling system retention zone and peripheral front	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Near-coastal retention of larvae affects the ecology of many marine species. In coastal upwelling ecosystems having strong offshore transport, larval ecology is greatly influenced by nearshore retention in bays and in the lee of headlands. Further, frontal dynamics along the periphery of retention zones can drive larval accumulation and transport. The purpose of this study is to examine larval distributions and associated processes across a retention zone and its peripheral front in the coastal upwelling environment of Monterey Bay, California, USA. During fall 2009 an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was used to observe environmental variability at high resolution and acquire targeted water samples. Invertebrate larvae in samples were subsequently identified and quantified using molecular methods. To infer ecological processes we examine larval distributions in relation to environmental processes revealed by the AUV data and the greater regional observing system. As a window into biological-physical interactions that may concentrate motile larvae in convergence zones, we examine more extensive in situ and remote sensing observations that describe distribution patterns of motile phytoplankton. During the 10-day study intensification of upwelling caused flow of cold water into the bay and formation of an upwelling front. Drifter and satellite observations showed retention of near-surface water within the bay inshore of the front, where a bloom of motile phytoplankton intensified. Larval distributions were related to processes inferred at a range of scales. At the scale of the retention zone, dense phytoplankton accumulations indicated concentration of motile plankton in a convergence zone created by flow toward the coast, as well as nutritional support for larvae. At the scale of the front, velocity and water property measurements indicated convergence between cold deep-shelf water transported shoreward along shoaling bathymetry and the overlying warm surface water, influencing plankton accumulation and vertical transport. At the finest scales resolved, aerial photography revealed banded accumulations of dense phytoplankton bloom patches and narrow foam lines, common indicators of small-scale convergence zones and consistent with internal wave processes. Exceptionally high larval concentrations were detected in samples from locations affected by frontal and internal wave dynamics. This study illustrates how autonomous feature recognition and targeted sampling with an AUV, applied within the greater context of multidisciplinary observation across regional to small scales, can advance plankton ecology research.

J	Singha, S; Velotto, D; Lehner, S				Singha, Suman; Velotto, Domenico; Lehner, Susanne			Near real time monitoring of platform sourced pollution using TerraSAR-X over the North Sea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Continuous operational monitoring by means of remote sensing contributes significantly towards less occurrence of oil spills over European waters however, operational activities show regular occurrence of accidental and deliberate oil spills over the North Sea, particularly from offshore platform installations. Since the areas covered by oil spills are usually large and scattered over the North Sea, satellite remote sensing particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) represents an effective tool for operational oil spill detection. This paper describes the development of a semi-automated approach for oil spill detection, optimized for near real time offshore platform sourced pollution monitoring context. Eight feature parameters are extracted from each segmented dark spot. The classification algorithm is based on artificial neural network. An initial evaluation of this methodology has been carried out on 156 TerraSAR-X images. Wind and current history information also have been analyzed for particular cases in order to evaluate their influences on spill trajectory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

IGCP-514 Participants	Paleovalley-related uranium: exploration criteria and case-studies from Australia and China	EPISODES												Uranium exploration and mining in Australia and China are significant and increasingly important sectors of each country's respective mineral industry Here we focus on similarities in the geology of paleovalley-related uranium mineralising systems, which can be used to refine strategies for exploration. Paleovalley-related uranium resources are developed as sandstone-hosted and surficial deposits within paleovalley-fills, deposited either on incised crystalline bedrock, or incised sedimentary cover that is often of similar age to the sediments that host the mineralisation. With respect to Sino-Australian examples, paleovalley-related uranium occurs mostly around the margins of Mesozoic and Cenozoic basins; often the mineralisation is hosted within sands contained within paleovalleys developed upon, or proximal to, Precambrian crystalline rock that contains primary uranium mineralisation. Numerous examples are known in Australia and China where granitic rocks of pre-Mesozoic age contain uranium in the range 10-100 ppm, concentrations significantly above the crustal average of 2.8 ppm uranium. Crystalline rocks with above-background levels of uranium that are incised by paleovalleys are often the inferred source of the sandstone-hosted uranium. In these regions, extensive fluvial systems developed particularly during Mesozoic and early Cenozoic times, eroded weathered basement rocks to physically disperse uranium into the cover sediments, with subsequent chemical remobilisation, dispersion and concentration of uranium occurring throughout the late Cenozoic. Paleovalley-related uranium deposits are typically hosted within unlithified sand, lignitic clays or calcreted channel-fill, deposited in continental or marginal marine environments. Sandstone-hosted uranium deposits in many cases contain impermeable clay layers, intercalated within the sedimentary sequence; impervious layers often form the upper and lower bounding strata of individual deposits. Uranium deposits are associated with reduced lithologies; mineralisation is developed where oxidising fluids (carrying dissolved U) were modified by interaction with reduced sands, the latter commonly containing pyrite and dispersed organic matter and/or seams of lignite. Mineralised bodies, often tabular or roll-shaped, formed along the interface between clay horizons and the sandy facies of paleovalley sediments. Geological, geophysical and geochemical features of the paleovalleys and related uranium deposits have been used to construct models to understand ore genesis and assist exploration for paleovalley-hosted uranium deposits. Australia and China remain highly prospective for the discovery of new paleovalley-related uranium deposits. The precise geometric definitions of the basin Margin and paleovalley architecture are important in identifying exploration targets and improving the effectiveness of drilling. This requires the integration of various geoscientific data sets. Refinements in remote sensing, geophysical techniques and data processing, in combination with sedimentological and depositional interpretations, provide an efficient approach for outlining the principal drainage patterns and channel dimensions. To help reduce risk, an exploration strategy should combine these technologies with a detailed understanding of the physicochemical parameters of uranium reduction, mobilisation and preservation.																	0705-3797					SEP	2014	37	3					150	171										WOS:000347369800001

Kurtis; Sathyendranath, Shubha; Platt, Trevor			Estimating concentrations of essential omega-3 fatty acids in the ocean: supply and demand	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Vertebrates have a universal requirement for essential fatty acids (FAs), but in the ocean these FAs are synthesized only by phytoplankton. All other marine organisms must source their essential FA directly from phytoplankton or indirectly through the food web. Thus, the growth and abundance of all organisms in the marine ecosystem is constrained not just by the rate of carbon fixation in photosynthesis but also by the rate of synthesis of essential FAs. Despite the significance of this controlling step, we have had until now only very limited knowledge of the amount, distribution and rate of synthesis of essential FAs in the sea. Here, we report results on the quantity of a specific essential omega-3 FA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the ocean, obtained with a novel application of ocean-colour data collected by remote sensing. Using in situ samples collected in the Northwest Atlantic, we developed a simple model to describe the relationship between total FAs and total chlorophyll-a. We refined these by examining the relationships of FAs produced predominantly by diatoms with the fraction of total chlorophyll-a derived from diatoms. These models were then applied to satellite data to map the distribution of EPA relative to diatom carbon in the Northwest Atlantic. With extrapolation to the global oceans, we were able to provide a first estimate of annual production of EPA, which demonstrated that the supply was barely sufficient to meet the nutritional demand of the world population in the present day; as the world population increases, this resource may become inadequate to meet those demands. This approach will allow us to begin to address issues such as the budget of essential FAs in the ocean and the maximum sustainable rate at which these FAs could be harvested from the ocean without compromising the integrity of the marine ecosystem.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				SEP-OCT	2014	71	7					1885	1893		10.1093/icesjms/fsu003								WOS:000343315900032						
J	Racault, MF; Sathyendranath, S; Platt, T				Racault, Marie-Fanny; Sathyendranath, Shubha; Platt, Trevor			Impact of missing data on the estimation of ecological indicators from satellite ocean-colour time-series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Ocean-colour remote sensing provides high-resolution and global-coverage of chlorophyll concentration, which can be used to estimate ecological indicators and to study inter-annual and long-term trends in the state of the marine ecosystem. To date, the record of ocean-colour observations is a rich one, including data from a number of sensors spanning more than three decades. The ESA Ocean-Colour Climate Change Initiative has advanced seamless merging of ocean-colour observations from missions during the period 1990s to 2010s. However, comparison of these more recent observations with records from 1970s to 1980s remains a complex undertaking, particularly for absolute values of chlorophyll concentration, primarily due to differences in the sensors. A further impediment to the analysis of the past records is the non-uniform distribution of gaps in the observations, in both time and space dimensions, when data from two or more sensors are compared. Here, we use the CZCS gap distribution from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1978-1986) as a mask to evaluate the impact that missing data may have on the estimation of six ecological indicators, when using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data set. Specifically, we evaluate the precision and accuracy of indicators by computing the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the bias arising purely from missing data. We develop an original resampling method allowing comparison of indicator estimates between SeaWiFS reference time-series and SeaWiFS time-series with CZCS-like gaps. We reduce some of the sampling gaps by applying a linear interpolation procedure, and compute multi-year averages of the indicators for every one-by-one degree pixel where sufficient data are available. Indicators from SeaWiFS reference and SeaWiFS with CZCS-like gaps are compared. Lowest uncertainty arising from missing data is observed in the indicators of annual mean and median chlorophyll concentration (global mean RMSE of 8% and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 1%), whilst higher uncertainty is recorded for the peak chlorophyll values and the duration of the phytoplankton growing period (global mean RMSE of 33 and 47% respectively and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 20%). Timing of initiation of the increasing phase of chlorophyll concentration in the seasonal cycle and timing of peak chlorophyll are subject to a global mean RMSE of nearly two months and a bias of two weeks or less. The present quantitative evaluation of uncertainty due to missing data demonstrates that, when pooled to create a nine-year climatology at 8-day temporal resolution, the coverage of CZCS is adequate for many climate-related studies on the marine ecosystem. Phytoplankton annual mean biomass can be estimated with low error in approximately 95% of the global oceans (i.e. regions where the indicators can be estimated with RMSE values of less than 30% and bias within 10%), and the phenological patterns can be estimated with low error in approximately 25% of the global oceans.

J	Mitchell, C; Cunningham, A; Mckee, D				Mitchell, Catherine; Cunningham, Alex; Mckee, David			Remote sensing of particulate absorption coefficients and their biogeochemical interpretation: A case study in the Irish Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We propose a method for (i) obtaining particulate absorption coefficients from optical remote sensing reflectance signals and (ii) partitioning these coefficients into separate components for phytoplankton cells and mineral particles. This method makes the initial assumption that absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the region of interest is either constant, or so low that its variability can be neglected. It uses a slightly modified version of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (Lee et al., 2009) to recover the non-water absorption (a) and particulate backscattering (bbp) coefficients, and then obtains an estimate of absorption by CDOM, and the bacicscattering to absorption ratios for minerals and phytoplankton, by fitting upper and lower boundaries to the resulting data cluster. These ratios are employed in linear un-mixing equations to resolve the contributions of phytoplanlcton and minerals to the particulate absorption coefficient. The performance of the method was evaluated using reflectance spectra generated by an optical model of the Irish Sea which incorporated realistic specific inherent optical properties and distributions of constituent concentrations. It was then used to recover absorption coefficients for phytoplankton and suspended minerals in the 488 nm waveband from MODIS remote sensing data for the central Irish Sea for the period May 2005-November 2012. The partitioned coefficients showed strong seasonality, with suspended mineral absorption peaking in winter and phytoplanlcton absorption becoming dominant in spring and summer. By employing locally determined specific inherent optical properties, it was possible to estimate the average annual cycles in the concentrations of the two constituents. These cycles proved to be consistent with previously published models of particle dynamics in the region in which mineral concentrations are elevated by winter mixing and increasing water column stability in spring is followed by a period of phytoplankton growth. We conclude that it is possible to resolve the separate contributions of phytoplankton and minerals to particulate absorption in waters where these constituents are the dominant determinants of optical variability, and that the partitioned absorption coefficients can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of biogenic and minerogenic particles in shelf sea ecosystems. 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.																	0034-4257	1879-0704				SEP	2014	152						74	82		10.1016/j.rse.2014.06.003								WOS:000343392200007

Satellite remote sensing reveals coastal upwelling events in the San Matias Gulf-Northern Patagonia	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Coastal upwelling events are effective in fluxing nutrients upward to the euphotic layer, thus promoting the growth of marine phytoplankton. Satellite data may provide useful information to detect and characterize upwelling events in regions of sparse in-situ observations. We analyze the coastal upwelling process on the western San Maths Gulf, on the northern continental shelf of Argentina, based on the analysis of remote sensing and in-situ data. Upwelling events are characterized by their frequency of occurrence and magnitude. During the austral summer we found roughly 6 upwelling-favorable wind events per year. Satellite derived sea surface temperature (SST) data provide evidence of upwelling in 85% of the cases between 2000 and 2008. Analysis of specific events provides clues on the wind forcing characteristics required to generate upwelling, and on characteristic space and time scales of the process. On February 2005 SST data reveal a narrow coastal band (similar to 10 km) of relative cold water extending similar to 100 km along the west coast of SMG. The SST in this band was 1.5 degrees C lower than further offshore. Near bottom temperature fluctuations from in-situ daily observations collected at two nearshore locations are significantly correlated with along-shore wind stress, suggesting that coastal upwelling is a dominant process controlling high-frequency temperature fluctuations near-shore. A simple quantitative estimate reveals a volume of upwelled water reaching the sea surface of about 10(10) m(3) during one relatively intense upwelling event.

J	Palacio-Aponte, G				Palacio-Aponte, Gerardo			Land cover modification geoindicator applied in a tropical coastal environment	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Environmental changes due to natural processes and anthropic modifications can be characterized by the degree of land cover modification and its environmental implications overtime. The main goal of the present study was to propose and apply a land cover modification geoindicator in order to assess the environmental condition of the territory per landscape units. It was designed to interpret diffuse information and transform it into a synthetic indicator that will be useful for environmental managers. The geoindicator evaluation was performed through a multi-temporal analysis of medium resolution Landsat satellite images and their unsupervised classification according to the direction of land use transitions. A change detection analysis between image pairs from 1973, 1991 and 2001 was made to detect unaffected areas and the areas in which positive or negative land cover changes could be observed. The proposed methodology was applied in the coastal palustrine area; specifically, in the marine-terrestrial ecotone of Campeche, Mexico. Geoindicator values during the 1974-1991 and 1991-2001 periods were low, 46.5% and 40.9%, respectively, due to the intrinsic limitations of coastal wetlands for productive activities. Urban and suburban transition areas showed high degrees of modification of about 39.5% and 32.1% for the first and the second period, respectively. Moderate modification, 4.9% in the first period and 5.7% in the second, was observed in isolated landscape units with recovering vegetation. The proposed geoindicator showed physiognomic and functional evidence of affectation levels from human activities, regeneration patterns and alteration of the landscape structure, modulated by the historical-economic process in the studied area.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP	2014	62	3					1111	1128		10.15517/rbt.v62i3.12215								WOS:000343187200023	25412539					
J	Zoffoli, ML; Frouin, R; Kampel, M				Zoffoli, Maria Laura; Frouin, Robert; Kampel, Milton			Water Column Correction for Coral Reef Studies by Remote Sensing	SENSORS												Human activity and natural climate trends constitute a major threat to coral reefs worldwide. Models predict a significant reduction in reef spatial extension together with a decline in biodiversity in the relatively near future. In this context, monitoring programs to detect changes in reef ecosystems are essential. In recent years, coral reef mapping using remote sensing data has benefited from instruments with better resolution and computational advances in storage and processing capabilities. However, the water column represents an additional complexity when extracting information from submerged substrates by remote sensing that demands a correction of its effect. In this article, the basic concepts of bottom substrate remote sensing and water column interference are presented. A compendium of methodologies developed to reduce water column effects in coral ecosystems studied by remote sensing that include their salient features, advantages and drawbacks is provided. Finally, algorithms to retrieve the bottom reflectance are applied to simulated data and actual remote sensing imagery and their performance is compared. The available methods are not able to completely eliminate the water column effect, but they can minimize its influence. Choosing the best method depends on the marine environment, available input data and desired outcome or scientific application.																	1424-8220					SEP	2014	14	9					16881	16931		10.3390/s140916881								WOS:000343106600070	25215941

Monitoring Coastal Changes along Damietta Promontory and the Barrier Beach toward Port Said East of the Nile Delta, Egypt	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Monitoring the coastal changes along Nile Delta coast is a very interesting task It provides an opportunity to implement strategic coastal planning and resource potentiality. Studying sequential periods of thematic mapper (TM) satellite, SPOT, and Egysat-1 images covering the periods from 1973, 1984, 1987, 1991, 2003, 2007, to 2011 for the coastal strip between Damietta and Port Said helps us understand the behavior of this coast in terms of physical and human processes. Human processes are apparently reflected in several faces of erosion/accretion with consequent shoreline changes. The resulting rates and forms of coastal change are unbelievable and unexpected. Average rates of shoreline change from -35 m/y to 40 m/y were measured from the satellites and verified from the ground depending on the implemented protection measures and shoreline orientation in relation to marine processes. We divided the studied coastal strip accordingly into four major sectors. The long sector (sector 4) between Damietta and Port Said (45 km length) is studied through four stations carefully selected in early studies taking into consideration the same processes and the position of newly constructed oil and gas facilities. After the construction of a seawall east of the Damietta branch outlet, Damietta spit shows considerable changes. New areas of erosion and accretion have developed with average rates of -61.45 m/y and 94.82 m/y, respectively, and SE migration of 78.3 m/y. Managing coastal development and reviewing the strategy of constructing oil and gas facilities along the Damietta Port Said barrier beach are very important tasks. This coast is very narrow, threatened by wave storms, and, most significantly, it is eroding (-18.7 m/y at Station 1 and -9.5 m/y at Station 3). The presence of such facilities may also accelerate the subsidence of this narrow coast. At the same time several promising and ambitious projects suitable for this coastal environment are waiting for investors; one of these projects concerns the triangle of Damietta spit.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2014	30	5					993	1005		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00112.1								WOS:000342967700011

Nevertheless, there is a lack of tools that allow us to retrieve automatically relevant mesoscale structures from large satellite image databases. This paper focuses on the development and validation of a content-based image retrieval system to classify and retrieve oceanic structures from satellite images. The images were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor. The study area is about W2 degrees - 21 degrees, N19 degrees - 45 degrees. This system conducts labeling and retrieval of the most relevant and typical mesoscale oceanic structures, such as upwellings, eddies, and island wakes located in the Canary Islands area and in the Mediterranean and Cantabrian seas. Our work is based on several soft computing technologies such as fuzzy logic and neurofuzzy systems.

The size distributions and optical properties of these particles are poorly known. Utilizing a newly developed inversion technique from the measured angular scattering pattern, we were able to examine POM and PIM in terms of detailed particle size distributions (PSD) and optical volume scattering functions (VSF), gaining further insights and knowledge of particles that will greatly improve biogeochemical investigations and remote-sensing algorithms. We report the results on two extremes or end-members of possible coastal environments, sediment-laden, turbid Mobile Bay, Alabama, USA and biologically productive, clear water Monterey Bay, California, USA. The optically inferred mass concentrations of PIM and POM, when accounting for the fractal nature of suspended particles, agreed well with the respective gravimetric determinations within the analysis and inversion uncertainty. Despite intra- and inter-site variability, the inferred PSDs in both coastal regions commonly showed an apparent background population of PIM at radii <0.6-1 mu m overlaid by POM of radii between 2 and 20 mu m. The PSDs also saw increased contribution by PIM at radii >50 mu m. The clearly distinctive PSDs between PIM and POM provide evidence to support the Risovic two component model for suspended particulates. The shape of the VSFs, i.e., the scattering phase functions, for POM are similar between the two sites (backscattering ratio approximate to 0.0015), but the PIM in Monterey Bay exhibited a higher backscattering ratio than in Mobile Bay (backscattering ratios 0.012 vs. 0.008, respectively). At both sites, the mass-specific scattering cross section values for PIM (sigma([PIM])) are about 70-80% lower than sigma([POM]), while the mass-specific backscattering cross section values for PIM (sigma(b[PIM])) are 10-25% greater than sigma(b[POM]).

The marine plankton environments of Biscay Ocean, Biscay Eddies, Biscay Slope and Biscay Shelf are defined. The Shelf region (Armorican and Celtic) is further divided into Stratified Shelf, Frontal and Tidally Mixed. Seasonal distributions of chlorophyll a are given for all environment from in situ measurements and remote sensing data. Mixing and stabilisation of surface water in the euphotic layer for the start of the spring bloom using in situ profiling measurements is examined. Some regional responses for the slope current, dinoflagellate blooms and interannual variations in spring diatom numbers with respect to weather and climate in the Bay of Biscay and around the British Isles are suggested and discussed. An example of the Eastern European Ocean Margin continental slope response to winter weather (sea level atmospheric pressure forcing) resulting in warm winter water in the southern Bay of Biscay (Navidad, with eddy production) and off the Shetland continental slopes (the warm-water supply route to the Arctic) is given from the slope climate observation series.

Unlike the algorithm developed by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS), implemented in the Aquarius Data Processing System (ADPS) to produce Aquarius standard products, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's CAP algorithm does not require monthly climatology SSS maps for the salinity retrieval. Furthermore, the ADPS-RSS algorithm fully uses the National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) wind for data correction, while the CAP algorithm uses the NCEP wind only as a constraint. The major updates to the CAP algorithm include the galactic reflection correction, Faraday rotation, Antenna Pattern Correction, and geophysical model functions of wind or wave impacts. Recognizing the limitation of geometric optics scattering, we improve the modeling of the reflection of galactic radiation; the results are better salinity accuracy and significantly reduced ascending-descending bias. We assess the accuracy of CAP's salinity by comparison with ARGO monthly gridded salinity products provided by the Asia-Pacific Data-Research Center (APDRC) and Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). The RMS differences between Aquarius CAP and APDRC's or JAMSTEC's ARGO salinities are less than 0.2 psu for most parts of the ocean, except for the regions in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, near the outflow of major rivers and at high latitudes.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				AUG	2014	119	8					5360	5379		10.1002/2014JC009939								WOS:000342519500037						
J	Werdell, PJ; Roesler, CS; Goes, JI				Werdell, P. Jeremy; Roesler, Collin S.; Goes, Joaquim I.			Discrimination of phytoplankton functional groups using an ocean reflectance inversion model	APPLIED OPTICS												Ocean reflectance inversion models (ORMs) provide a mechanism for inverting the color of the water observed by a satellite into marine inherent optical properties (IOPs), which can then be used to study phytoplankton community structure. Most ORMs effectively separate the total signal of the collective phytoplankton community from other water column constituents; however, few have been shown to effectively identify individual contributions by multiple phytoplankton groups over a large range of environmental conditions. We evaluated the ability of an ORM to discriminate between Noctiluca miliaris and diatoms under conditions typical of the northern Arabian Sea. We: (1) synthesized profiles of IOPs that represent bio-optical conditions for the Arabian Sea; (2) generated remote-sensing reflectances from these profiles using Hydrolight; and (3) applied the ORM to the synthesized reflectances to estimate the relative concentrations of diatoms and N. miliaris. By comparing the estimates from the inversion model with those from synthesized vertical profiles, we identified those conditions under which the ORM performs both well and poorly. Even under perfectly controlled conditions, the absolute accuracy of ORM retrievals degraded when further deconstructing the derived total phytoplankton signal into subcomponents. Although the absolute magnitudes maintained biases, the ORM successfully detected whether or not Noctiluca miliaris appeared in the simulated water column. This quantitatively calls for caution when interpreting the absolute magnitudes of the retrievals, but qualitatively suggests that the ORM provides a robust mechanism for identifying the presence or absence of species.

J	Adler, A				Adler, Antony			The Ship as Laboratory: Making Space for Field Science at Sea	JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY												Expanding upon the model of vessels of exploration as scientific instruments first proposed by Richard Sorrenson, this essay examines the changing nature of the ship as scientific space on expedition vessels during the late nineteenth century. Particular attention is paid to the expedition of H.M.S. Challenger (1872-1876) as a turning point in the design of shipboard spaces that established a place for scientists at sea and gave scientific legitimacy to the new science of oceanography. There was a progressive development in research vessel design from "ship as instrument" to "ship as laboratory" and changing spatial practices aboard these vessels were paralleled by changes in shipboard culture. I suggest that the "ship as laboratory" has now in turn been supplanted by a new model, the "ship as invisible technician", as oceanographic research vessels deploy remote-sensing equipment and gather data that are no longer analyzed on board.																	0022-5010	1573-0387				AUG	2014	47	3					333	362		10.1007/s10739-013-9367-7								WOS:000340937300001	24122291					
J	Bertazzon, S; O'Hara, PD; Barrett, O; Serra-Sogas, N				Bertazzon, Stefania; O'Hara, Patrick D.; Barrett, Olesya; Serra-Sogas, Norma			Geospatial analysis of oil discharges observed by the National Aerial Surveillance Program in the Canadian Pacific Ocean	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Oil pollution resulting from day to day human maritime activities contributes a high portion of the overall input into marine environments, constituting a major threat to marine ecosystems worldwide. In Canada, the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) extensively monitors and collects information on oily discharges using remote sensing devices. Despite the availability of data from NASP and other surveillance programs internationally, there is a paucity of spatial analyses of oil pollution patterns, particularly in their association with human marine pursuits. The objective of this paper is to analyze the association between observed oily discharges and human maritime activities in the Canadian Pacific Ocean. This study used Poisson regression to spatially model detected oily discharges with marine traffic, coastal facilities and proximity to coast. Further, it developed localized ('regional') models to address spatial heterogeneity. The models identify recreational activities, passenger traffic, commercial traffic, fisheries, and proximity to the coast as predictors of observed oily discharges. The regional models yield more accurate and reliable estimates of local associations, and identify more parsimonious sets of predictors for each region. By identifying and accounting for human activities most associated with oily discharge patterns, the models developed in this study could be used to estimate pollution rates in areas with less surveillance, and identify areas where NASP coverage may need to be increased. Spatially explicit rates estimated by these models can be used to monitor the effectiveness of programs and policy aimed at reducing discharge rates of oily pollution. This study can be used as a model approach for extending the analysis to the other coasts of Canada, using available NASP data. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper intends to develop models to retrieve absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, suspended sediments and coloured dissolved organic matter and describe vertical profiles of chlorophyll and suspended sediments from satellite ocean colour data. These models make use of the relationships between remote sensing reflectance ratios R-rs (555)/R-rs (443) and R-rs (620)/R-rs (490) versus a(ph) (443) and a(ph) (555), and a(cdom) (443), and a(d) (443) to derive the model parameters. Validation with the in-situ data obtained from coastal waters around India and other regional waters (e.g., NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data-Set, NOMAD) shows that the new models are more accurate in terms of producing the spectral absorption coefficients (a(ph), a(d), a(cdom) across the entire visible wavelengths 400-700 nm) in a wide variety of waters. Further comparison with existing models shows advantage of the new models that have important implications for remote sensing of turbid coastal and eutrophic waters. The retrieved absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and suspended sediments (non-algal matter) are also found to relate better to chlorophyll and total suspended sediments. Taking advantages of this, we derive models to determine and describe the vertical profiles of chlorophyll and suspended sediment concentrations along the depth. The model parameters are derived empirically. These new parameterizations show potential in estimating the vertical profiles of chlorophyll and suspended sediments with good accuracy. These results suggest robustness and suitability of the new models for studying the ecologically important components of optically complex turbid and eutrophic waters using remote sensing data.

However, limitations exist when using data derived from satellite remote sensing as virtual stations are usually distant from areas of interest for management. Modelled sea surface temperature will, in most cases, provide a general over a large spatial scale rather than a specific prediction. Understanding the relationship between remotely sensed sea temperature and in situ temperature enables real-time management responses to sea temperature, in relation to both long-term changes and short-term anomalies, and their biological implications. Historically, the effects of most thermal stress events on marine communities have been observed opportunistically or realised well after the event, due to the use of in situ loggers and the associated time-lag between the event, logger retrieval and data interpretation. Understanding the susceptibility of marine communities to, and recovery from, thermal stress events requires reliable estimation of the events in real time at local spatial scales. To further understand the relationship between in situ and satellite derived sea temperatures, and develop a real-time monitoring tool, a simple linear interpolation was undertaken to estimate local in situ temperature, at depth, using near real-time satellite derived sea surface temperatures. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch 50 km sea surface temperature (SST) data was selected because of its readily available and continual near real-time update of sea surface temperatures worldwide. In situ temperature logger data from four Western Australian marine protected areas (MPAs) were used to develop and test the linear interpolation. Utilising the model, we were able to successfully estimate the in situ temperature to within +/- 1 degrees C, at least 78% of the time, including temperature anomalies experienced in February 2011, at sites of interest across the four MPAs. This simple linear interpolation model will be used to improve near real-time estimates of temperature for broadscale monitoring of MPAs throughout Western Australia, allowing greater understanding and informed management response to long-term changes and short-term temperature anomalies. Future expansion of the sites monitored, improved satellites resolution and an annual review of data sources will ensure that the data used for management of this threat to water quality remains at the highest level of accuracy possible with the available data.

For the 642 daily coincident measurements that were obtained, MODIS AOT generally varies within the predicted uncertainty of the retrieval over ocean (Delta AOT = +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05 . AOT). The results from the remote sensing have been used to examine the accuracy in estimates of aerosol optical properties in the Arctic, generated by global climate models and from in situ measurements at the Zeppelin station, Svalbard. AOT simulated with the Norwegian Earth System Model/Community Atmosphere Model version 4 Oslo global climate model does not reproduce the observed seasonal variability of the Arctic aerosol. The model overestimates clear-sky AOT by nearly a factor of 2 for the background summer season, while tending to underestimate the values in the spring season. Furthermore, large differences in all-sky AOT of up to 1 order of magnitude are found for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 model ensemble for the spring and summer seasons.

Repeated mapping of reefs constructed by Sabellaria spinulosa Leuckart 1849 at an offshore wind farm site	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Sabellaria spinulosa reefs are considered to be sensitive and of high conservation status. This article evaluates the feasibility of using remote sensing technology to delineate S. spinulosa reefs. S. spinulosa reef habitats associated with the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site were mapped using high resolution sidescan sonar (410 kHz) and multibeam echo sounder (< 1 m(2)) data in 2005 (baseline), 2007 (pre-construction baseline) and 2012 (post-construction). The S. spinulosa reefs were identified in the acoustic data as areas of distinct irregular texturing. Maps created using acoustic data were validated using quantitative measures of reef quality, namely tube density (as a proxy for the density of live S. spinulosa), percentage cover of S. spinulosa structures (both living and dead) and associated macrofauna derived from seabed images taken across the development site. Statistically significant differences were observed in all physical measures of S. spinulosa as well the number (S) and diversity (H') of associated species, derived from seabed images classified according to the presence or absence of reef, validating the use of high resolution sidescan sonar to map these important biogenic habitats. High precision mapping in the early stages allowed for the micro-siting of wind turbines in a way that caused minimal damage to S. spinulosa reefs during construction. These habitats have since recovered and expanded in extent. The surveys undertaken at the Thanet Offshore Windfarm site demonstrate the importance of repeat mapping for this emerging industry, allowing habitat enhancement to be attributed to the development whilst preventing background habitat degradation from being wrongly attributed to the development.

The covered area is about 1,200 km(2) and the impacted area reached 40,000 km(2) on 31 May. This also occurred in the following two years, 2009 and 2010. We analyzed the satellite data from MODIS and the results showed that sea surface temperature increased 1-3 degrees C in U. prolifera bloom locations. The macroalgae in the water may have been the cause of the increase of sea surface temperatures. Rapid increases of U. prolifera biomass during the blooms may have increased radiation absorption of the water, and thus enhanced the rate of heating at the sea surface. The present study represents a preliminary observation, which is an important step for understanding influences of macroalgae on ocean surface conditions.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JUL-SEP	2014	17	3			SI		299	304		10.1080/14634988.2014.944471								WOS:000342280800012

A New Inversion Model to Estimate Bulk Refractive Index of Particles in Coastal Oceanic Waters: Implications for Remote Sensing	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												An inversion model is developed to estimate bulk refractive index (eta(bp) relative to water) for understanding the particle assemblages and dynamics in coastal oceanic waters. The model is based on an inversion of Mie theory combined with parameterizations such as the backscattering ratio, hyperbolic slope of the particle size distribution, and bulk density (relative to water). With the advent of high-frequency in-situ spectral attenuation and fluorescence-turbidity sensors, these parameters can be easily measured and used in the new model to estimate the eta(bp) values. To test the robustness of this model, the eta(bp) values estimated from the new model are verified with the Mie input refractive index values (relative to water) and those produced by an existing model. The new model is also applied to spatial, temporal, and vertical in-situ profile data measured from turbid coastal waters off Point Calimere and clear waters off Chennai, southeast part of India. The eta(bp) values estimated by the present model are generally agreeable with the previously reported eta(bp) values (1.02-1.28) for these waters. By contrast, the existing model tends to provide relatively high eta(bp) values (1.10) for clear waters and low eta(bp) values (1.215) for relatively clear and sediment-laden waters. Application of these models to time-series in-situ data from moderately turbid and highly turbid waters reveals that the vertical distribution patterns of eta(bp) from the new model correspond better with turbidity patterns (with an increasing eta(bp) trend in sediment-laden bottom waters) that display large variations depending on the tidal cycles of the day. However, the existing model produces a very narrow range of eta(bp) values displaying nearly homogenous patterns regardless of the turbidity variation along the depth. The new model enables more reliable estimates of eta(bp) for living cells (1.02-1.07 because of higher water content) in clear waters, detrital particles (1.07-1.15) and minerals/mineral-detrital particles (>1.15 because of lower water content). These results suggest that the new model will have important implications for studies of the particle assemblages in coastal oceanic waters, with the feasibility of remote estimation of eta(bp) with the proof-of-concept approaches which will inspire further research into the nature of particles in the ocean and their variability on regional and global scales.

Satellite-derived spectral-averaged alpha(ph) was used as the key predictor of phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency in the model. The alpha(ph)-based model yields an annual integrated NPP of approximately 55 Pg C year(-1) for the global oceans over the period 2003-2010. The accuracy of the model was validated by comparing it with in situ NPP at three sites, and the logarithmic root-mean-square error of the model was approximately 0.18. The model performance was also compared with two existing NPP models (chlorophyll-based model and carbon-based model) in terms of spatial distribution, seasonal cycles, and accuracy. The comparison results indicated that the alpha(ph)-based model has improved accuracy in describing NPP variation for monthly timescales compared with the other two models. We were surprised to find that the spatial distribution of global ocean NPP provided by the alpha(ph)-based model is more similar to the carbon-based model than the chlorophyll-based model. Although many additional studies need to be conducted, the performance of the alpha(ph)-based model in this work may encourage us to estimate ocean NPP from satellite-derived phytoplankton pigment absorption.				yang, xiaofeng/K-5245-2015	yang, xiaofeng/0000-0001-9920-4641												1939-1404	2151-1535				JUL	2014	7	7			SI		3084	3092		10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2298863								WOS:000341568700035						
J	Arteaga, L; Pahlow, M; Oschlies, A				Arteaga, Lionel; Pahlow, Markus; Oschlies, Andreas			Global patterns of phytoplankton nutrient and light colimitation inferred from an optimality-based model	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The widely used concept of constant "Redfield" phytoplankton stoichiometry is often applied for estimating which nutrient limits phytoplankton growth in the surface ocean. Culture experiments, in contrast, show strong relations between growth conditions and cellular stoichiometry with often substantial deviations from Redfield stoichiometry. Here we investigate to what extent both views agree by analyzing remote sensing and in situ data with an optimality-based model of nondiazotrophic phytoplankton growth in order to infer seasonally varying patterns of colimitation by light, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the global ocean. Our combined model-data analysis suggests strong N and N-P colimitation in the tropical ocean, seasonal light, and N-P colimitation in the Northern Hemisphere, and strong light limitation only during winter in the Southern Ocean. The eastern equatorial Pacific appears as the only ocean area that is essentially not limited by N, P, or light. Even though our optimality-based approach specifically accounts for flexible stoichiometry, inferred patterns of N and P limitation are to some extent consistent with those obtained from an analysis of surface inorganic nutrients with respect to the Redfield N: P ratio. Iron is not part of our analysis, implying that we cannot accurately predict N cell quotas in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions. Elsewhere, we do not expect a major effect of iron on the relative distribution of N, P, and light colimitation areas. The relative importance of N, P, and light in limiting phytoplankton growth diagnosed here by combining observations and an optimal growth model provides a useful constraint for models used to predict future marine biological production under changing environmental conditions.

(3) The aerosol retrieval algorithms by using measurements from ground-based instruments, such as CE318-2 and CE318-DP. The retrieval results from spaceborne sensors, airborne camera and ground-based measurements include total AOD, fine-mode AOD, coarse-mode AOD, size distribution, particle shape, complex refractive indices, single scattering albedo, scattering phase function, polarization phase function and AOD above cloud. Finally, based on the research, the authors present the problems and prospects of atmospheric aerosol research by using polarization remote sensing, and provide a valuable reference for the future studies of atmospheric aerosol.																	1000-0593					JUL	2014	34	7					1873	1880		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)07-1873-08								WOS:000338826600030

High-resolution X-Band radar measurements of currents, bathymetry and sea state in highly inhomogeneous coastal areas	OCEAN DYNAMICS												In this paper, high-resolution wave, current and water depth fields derived by marine X-Band radar are presented for a coastal region of extreme tidal currents in the presence of inhomogeneous bathymetry at the south coast of New Zealand's North Island. The current and water depth information for the presented location covers an area of approximately 13 km(2) with a spatial resolution of 225 m and an update rate of 3 min. The sea state data provides a spatial representation of coastal effects like wave shoaling and refraction forced by bathymetry and current interaction. The near-surface current measurements about 3 km off the coast show expected tidal current pattern with maximum northwest/southeast current of 1.5-2 m/s alongshore. This is in agreement with currents from the RiCOM hydrodynamic model. The spatial resolution of the observed current field exhibits in addition small-scale current features caused by the influence of the local bathymetry. These data demonstrate the insight to be gained in complex, high-energy coastal situations through the use of high-resolution remote sensing techniques.

Marine radar ocean wave retrieval's dependency on range and azimuth	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The strength of the surface wave signal in marine X-band radar (MR) images strongly depends on range and azimuth (i.e., the angle between antenna look and peak wave direction). Traditionally, MR wave analysis is carried out in a set of rectangular windows covering the radar field of view (FOV). The FOV is typically partially obstructed, e.g., due to the coastline or ship superstructures. Especially for ships that are subject to regular course changes, this results in an increased variability or error associated with wave parameters. Using MR measurements from R/P FLIP, acquired off California during the 2010 US Office of Naval Research (ONR) high resolution air-sea interaction (Hi-Res) experiment, this study quantifies the dependency of the radar-based 2D wave spectrum and parameters on range and azimuth. With the help of reference data from a nearby Datawell Waverider buoy, we propose empirical methods to remove the dependency and we illustrate their efficacy.

From silk to satellite: half a century of ocean colour anomalies in the Northeast Atlantic	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Changes in phytoplankton dynamics influence marine biogeochemical cycles, climate processes, and food webs, with substantial social and economic consequences. Large-scale estimation of phytoplankton biomass was possible via ocean colour measurements from two remote sensing satellites - the Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS, 1979-1986) and the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS, 1998-2010). Due to the large gap between the two satellite eras and differences in sensor characteristics, comparison of the absolute values retrieved from the two instruments remains challenging. Using a unique in situ ocean colour dataset that spans more than half a century, the two satellite-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) eras are linked to assess concurrent changes in phytoplankton variability and bloom timing over the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. Results from this unique re-analysis reflect a clear increasing pattern of Chl-a, a merging of the two seasonal phytoplankton blooms producing a longer growing season and higher seasonal biomass, since the mid-1980s. The broader climate plays a key role in Chl-a variability as the ocean colour anomalies parallel the oscillations of the Northern Hemisphere Temperature (NHT) since 1948.

Despite the status of marine protected area and World Heritage listing of the GBR, local seagrass meadows are under stress from reduced water quality levels; with reduction in the amount of light available for seagrass photosynthesis defined as the primary cause of seagrass loss throughout the GBR. Methods have been developed to map GBR plume water types by using MODE quasi-true colour (hereafter true colour) images reclassified in function of their dominant colour. These data can be used as an interpretative tool for understanding changes in seagrass meadow health (as defined in this study by the seagrass area and abundance) at different spatial and temporal scales. We tested this method in Cleveland Bay, in the northern GBR, where substantial loss in seagrass area and biomass was detected by annual monitoring from 2007 to 2011. A strong correlation was found between bay-wide seagrass meadow area and biomass and exposure to turbid Primary (sediment-dominated) water type. There was also a strong correlation between the changes of biomass and area of individual meadows and exposure of seagrass ecosystems to Primary water type over the 5-year period. Seagrass meadows were also grouped according to the dominant species within each meadow, irrespective of location within Cleveland Bay. These consolidated community types did not correlate well with the exposure to Primary water type, and this is likely to be due to local environmental conditions with the individual meadows that comprise these groupings. This study proved that remote sensing data provide the synoptic window and repetitivity required to investigate changes in water quality conditions over time. Remote sensing data provide an opportunity to investigate the risk of marine-coastal ecosystems to light limitation due to increased water turbidity when in situ water quality data is not available or is insufficient.

However, the remoteness and logistical complexity of operating in Antarctica, especially during winter, make such an assessment difficult. Satellite imaging is increasingly recognised as a valuable method for remote animal population monitoring, yet its accuracy and reliability are still to be fully evaluated. We report here the first ground visit of an emperor penguin colony first discovered by satellite, but also the discovery of a second one not indicated by satellite survey at that time. Several successive remote surveys in this coastal region of East Antarctica, both before and after sudden local changes, had indeed only identified one colony. These two colonies (with a total of ca. 7,400 breeding pairs) are located near the Mertz Glacier in an area that underwent tremendous habitat change after the glacier tongue broke off in February 2010. Our findings therefore suggest that a satellite survey, although offering a major advance since it allows a global imaging of emperor penguin colonies, may miss certain colony locations when challenged by certain features of polar ecosystems, such as snow cover, evolving ice topology, and rapidly changing habitat. Moreover our survey shows that this large seabird has considerable potential for rapid adaptation to sudden habitat loss, as the colony detected in 2009 may have moved and settled on new breeding grounds. Overall, the ability of emperor penguin colonies to relocate following habitat modification underlines the continued need for a mix of remote sensing and field surveys (aerial photography and ground counts), especially in the less-frequented parts of Antarctica, to gain reliable knowledge about the population demography and dynamics of this flagship species of the Antarctic ecosystem.																	1932-6203					JUN 25	2014	9	6							e100404	10.1371/journal.pone.0100404								WOS:000338709500046	24963661					
J	Garaba, SP; Voss, D; Zielinski, O				Garaba, Shungudzemwoyo P.; Voss, Daniela; Zielinski, Oliver			Physical, Bio-Optical State and Correlations in North-Western European Shelf Seas	REMOTE SENSING												Color of seawater has become an integral tool in understanding surface marine ecosystems and processes. In this paper we seek to assess the correlations and consequently the potential of using shipborne remote sensing products to infer marine environmental parameters. Typical seawater parameters are chlorophyll-a (chl-a), colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), suspended particulate material (SPM), Secchi-disk depth (SDD), temperature, and salinity. These parameters and radiometric quantities were observed from a total of 60 stations covering German Bight, North Sea, Inner Seas, Irish Sea, and Celtic Sea. Bio-optical models developed in this study were used to predict the in situ measured parameters, with low mean unbiased percent differences and absolute percent difference less than 35%. Our investigations show that the use of ocean color products namely the Forel-Ule Index to infer seawater parameters is encouraging. The constrained spatial and temporal span of measured in situ parameters does limit the accuracy of our models. Absorption coefficients of the main color producing agents CDOM, chl-a, and inorganic fraction of SPM (iSPM) were determined to estimate absorption budgets. During the field campaign, iSPM was the primary light absorber over the spectral range (400-700 nm) although variabilities were observed in the regional seas.																	2072-4292					JUN	2014	6	6					5042	5066		10.3390/rs6065042								WOS:000338763300017						
J	Chen, J; Quan, WT; Cui, TW; Song, QJ; Lin, CS				Chen, Jun; Quan, Wenting; Cui, Tingwei; Song, Qingjun; Lin, Changsong			Remote sensing of absorption and scattering coefficient using neural network model: Development, validation, and application	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The total absorption (a(lambda)) and backscattering (b(b)(lambda)) coefficients of natural waters are the most significant factors affecting light propagation within water columns, and thus play indispensable roles in the estimation of aquatic biomass, primary production, and carbon pools. Despite its importance, no accurate retrieval model has been specifically developed for both oceanic and coastal waters, but significant efforts have been made in regard to oceanic inversion models. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the applicability of the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) in deriving a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) from oceanic and coastal waters, and to improve it using a neural network-based semi-analytical algorithm (NNSAA). Based on a comparison of the a(X) and bb(X) predicted by these models with field measurements taken from the national aeronautics and space administration bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD), the Yellow Sea and China East Sea, it is shown that the NNSAA model (R-2 > 0.82 and mean relative error, MRE = 20.6-35.5%) provides a stronger performance than the QAA model (R-2 < 0.73 and MRE = 32.2-69.6%). The model was also applied to MODIS data after atmospheric correction using a near-infrared-based and shortwave infrared-based combined model. Through validation by field measurements, it was shown that the NNSAA model can predict a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) with high accuracy (R-2 >0.77 and MRE < 39.9%). Finally, the NNSAA model was used to map the global climatological seasonal mean a(443) and b(b)(555) for the time range of July 2002 to September 2013. Except the coastal zones, it was shown that the a(443) and b(b)(532) in some high-latitude areas are much higher than in the mid- and low-latitude regions, due to the effects of spurious signals from neighboring sea-ice. In the equatorial oceans, the a(443) value in the surface water is considerably higher in the equatorial Pacific than in the equatorial Atlantic in the upwelling region, while the integrate a(443) is much higher in the Atlantic than in the throughout the entire tropical gyre areas. The difference between a(443) and b(b)(532) in the subsurface water is due to a pronounced deep biomass maximum existing in the equatorial Atlantic, which is associated with the higher nitrate in the lower euphotic zone.

J	Priede, IG				Priede, Imants G.			Biogeography of the Oceans: a Review of Development of Knowledge of Currents, Fronts and Regional Boundaries from Sailing Ships in the Sixteenth Century to Satellite Remote Sensing	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The development of knowledge of global biogeography of the oceans from sixteenthcentury European voyages of exploration to present-day use of satellite remote sensing is reviewed in three parts; the pre-satellite era (1513-1977), the satellite era leading to a first global synthesis (1978-1998), and more recent studies since 1998. The Gulf Stream was first identified as a strong open-ocean feature in 1513 and by the eighteenth century, regular transatlantic voyages by sailing ships had established the general patterns of winds and circulation, enabling optimisation of passage times. Differences in water temperature, water colour and species of animals were recognised as important cues for navigation. Systematic collection of information from ships' logs enabled Maury (The Physical Geography of the Sea Harper and Bros. New York 1855) to produce a chart of prevailing winds across the entire world's oceans, and by the early twentieth century the global surface ocean circulation that defines the major biogeographic regions was well-known. This information was further supplemented by data from large-scale plankton surveys. The launch of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, specifically designed to study living marine resources on board the Nimbus 7 polar orbiting satellite in 1978, marked the advent of the satellite era. Over subsequent decades, correlation of satellite-derived sea surface temperature and chlorophyll data with in situ measurements enabled Longhurst (Ecological Geography of the Sea. Academic Press, New York 1998) to divide the global ocean into 51 ecological provinces with Polar, Westerly Wind, Trade Wind and Coastal Biomes clearly recognisable from earlier subdivisions of the oceans. Satellite imagery with semi-synoptic images of large areas of the oceans greatly aided definition of boundaries between provinces. However, ocean boundaries are dynamic, varying from season to season and year to year. More recent work has focused on the study of variability of currents, fronts and eddies, which are often the focus of high biological productivity. Direct tracking of animals using satellite-based systems has helped resolve the biological function of such features and indeed animals instrumented in this way have helped the study of such features in three dimensions, including depths beyond the reach of conventional satellite remote sensing. Patterns of surface productivity detected by satellite remote sensing are reflected in deep sea life on the sea floor at abyssal depths > 3,000 m. Satellite remote sensing has played a major role in overcoming the problems of large spatial scales and variability in ocean dynamics and is now an essential tool for monitoring global change.

Short- and long-term response of phytoplankton to ENSO in Prydz Bay, Antarctica: Evidences from field measurements, remote sensing data and stratigraphic biomarker records	JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA												The study provides one of the first lines of evidence showing linkages between Antarctic phytoplankton abundance and composition in response to ENSO, based on historical reconstruction of sediment biomarkers. In addition to sediment biomarkers, field measured and remote sensing data of phytoplankton abundance were also recorded from Prydz Bay, Eastern Antarctica. Community structure of field measured phytoplankton showed significant El Nio/La Nia-related succession during 1990 to 2002. In general, the number of algae species decreased during El Nio and La Nia years compared to normal years. Austral summer monthly variation of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC), and sea surface temperature (SST) indicated that ENSO impacted the timing of phytoplankton blooms during 2007 to 2011. Phytoplankton blooms (indicated by Chl-a and POC) preceded the increases in SST during El Nio years, and lagged behind the SST increases during La Nia years. Stratigraphic record of marine sedimentary lipid (brassicasterol, dinosterol and alkenones) biomarkers inferred that the proportions of different algae (diatoms, dinoflagellates and haptophytes) changed significantly between El Nio and La Nia events. The relative proportion of diatoms increased, with that of dinoflagellates being decreased during El Nio years, while it was reversed during La Nia years.

Environmental monitoring of El Hierro Island submarine volcano, by combining low and high resolution satellite imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												El Hierro Island, located at the Canary Islands Archipelago in the Atlantic coast of North Africa, has been rocked by thousands of tremors and earthquakes since July 2011. Finally, an underwater volcanic eruption started 300 m below sea level on October 10, 2011. Since then, regular multidisciplinary monitoring has been carried out in order to quantify the environmental impacts caused by the submarine eruption. Thanks to this natural tracer release, multisensorial satellite imagery obtained from MODIS and MERIS sensors have been processed to monitor the volcano activity and to provide information on the concentration of biological, chemical and physical marine parameters. Specifically, low resolution satellite estimations of optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration under these abnormal conditions have been assessed. These remote sensing data have played a fundamental role during field campaigns guiding the oceanographic vessel to the appropriate sampling areas. In addition, to analyze El Hierro submarine volcano area, WorldView-2 high resolution satellite spectral bands were atmospherically and deglinted processed prior to obtain a high-resolution optimal diffuse attenuation coefficient model. This novel algorithm was developed using a matchup data set with MERIS and MODIS data, in situ transmittances measurements and a seawater radiative transfer model. Multisensor and multitemporal imagery processed from satellite remote sensing sensors have demonstrated to be a powerful tool for monitoring the submarine volcanic activities, such as discolored seawater, floating material and volcanic plume, having shown the capabilities to improve the understanding of submarine volcanic processes.

Whereas shape analysis has largely been addressed over the last decades, the multiscale analysis of the geometry of opened planar curves has received little attention. We here show that classical multiscale techniques cannot properly address this issue and propose an original wavelet-based scheme.

Murray			Ecohydrodynamics of Cold-Water Coral Reefs: A Case Study of the Mingulay Reef Complex (Western Scotland)	PLOS ONE												Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications.

Widespread, rapid grounding line retreat of Pine Island, Thwaites, Smith, and Kohler glaciers, West Antarctica, from 1992 to 2011	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We measure the grounding line retreat of glaciers draining the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica using Earth Remote Sensing (ERS-1/2) satellite radar interferometry from 1992 to 2011. Pine Island Glacier retreated 31 km at its center, with most retreat in 2005-2009 when the glacier ungrounded from its ice plain. Thwaites Glacier retreated 14 km along its fast flow core and 1 to 9 km along the sides. Haynes Glacier retreated 10 km along its flanks. Smith/Kohler glaciers retreated the most, 35 km along its ice plain, and its ice shelf pinning points are vanishing. These rapid retreats proceed along regions of retrograde bed elevation mapped at a high spatial resolution using a mass conservation technique that removes residual ambiguities from prior mappings. Upstream of the 2011 grounding line positions, we find no major bed obstacle that would prevent the glaciers from further retreat and draw down the entire basin.

The applicability of Lee's quasi-analytical algorithm-based semi-analytical model, Wang's switching model, Chen's semi-analytical model, jamet's neural network model, and the MBPNN model is evaluated using the NASA bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD) and the Eastern China Seas dataset. Based on the comparison of Kd(490) predicted by these five models, with field measurements taken in global oceanic and coastal waters, it is found that the MBPNN model provides a stronger performance than the Lee, Wang, Chen, and Jamet's models. The atmospheric effects on the MODIS data are eliminated using near-infrared band-based and shortwave infrared band-based combined models, and the K-d(490) is quantified from the MODIS data after atmospheric correction using the MBPNN model. The study results indicate that the MBPNN model produces similar to 28% uncertainty in estimating K-d(490) from the MODIS data. Finally, an exemplification of the applicability of the model to the coastal regions in the Eastern China Seas is carried out. Our results suggest that the K-d(490) shows a large variation in the Eastern China Seas, ranging from 0.02 to 4.0 m(-1), with an average value of -0.17 m(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Lang, HT; Zhang, J; Zhang, T; Zhao, D; Meng, JM				Lang, Haitao; Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Ting; Zhao, Di; Meng, Junmin			Hierarchical ship detection and recognition with high-resolution polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Ship surveillance by remote sensing technology has become a valuable tool for protecting marine environments. In recent years, the successful launch of advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors that have high resolution and multipolarimetric modes has enabled researchers to use SAR imagery for not only ship detection but also ship category recognition. A hierarchical ship detection and recognition scheme is proposed. The complementary information obtained from multipolarimetric modes is used to improve both the detection precision and the recognition accuracy. In the ship detection stage, a three-class fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is used to calculate the segmenting threshold for prescreening ship candidates. To reduce the false alarm rate (FAR), we use a two-step discrimination strategy. In the first step, we fuse the detection results from multipolarimetric channels to reduce the speckle noise, ambiguities, sidelobes, and other sources of interference. In the second step, we use a binary classifier, which is trained with prior data collected on ships and nonships, to reduce the FAR even further. In the ship category recognition stage, we concatenate texture-based descriptors extracted from multiple polarmetric channels to construct a robust ship representation for category recognition. Furthermore, we construct and release a ship category database with real SAR data. We hope that it can be used to promote investigations of SAR ship recognition in the remote sensing and related academic communities. The proposed method is validated by a comprehensive experimental comparison to the state-of-the-art methods. The validation procedure showed that the proposed method outperforms all of the competing methods by about 5% and 15% in terms of ship detection and recognition, respectively.

J	Barron, RK; Siegel, DA; Guillocheau, N				Barron, Rebecca K.; Siegel, David A.; Guillocheau, Nathalie			Evaluating the importance of phytoplankton community structure to the optical properties of the Santa Barbara Channel, California	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Observations from the Santa Barbara Channel, California, were used to evaluate relationships among optical properties and phytoplankton community structure. Phytoplankton community structure was determined by statistically analyzing 10 diagnostic phytoplankton pigment concentrations using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The first four EOF modes explained 82% of phytoplankton community structure variability and were interpreted as a mixed community mode composed mostly of nanoplankton, a mode dominated by microplankton (diatoms and dinoflagellates), a mode describing alternating diatom and dinoflagellate dominance, and a mode reflecting picoplankton presence. Variations in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and phytoplankton absorption spectra were related to changes of the mixed microplankton modal amplitudes. Characteristics of the CDOM spectrum were further dependent on whether diatoms or dinoflagellates were dominant. The particle backscattering coefficient was significantly correlated with EOF modes describing the mixed microplankton and the picoplankton communities. The influence of phytoplankton community structure was also seen in the performance of standard ocean color algorithms using the in situ data set. The present results demonstrate that many optical characteristics vary significantly with changes in phytoplankton community structure and suggest that improvements in remote-sensing algorithms will require model coefficients to vary accordingly. Further, changes in phytoplankton community composition affect both dissolved and particle absorption and scattering properties, not simply the phytoplankton-specific properties, creating challenges for the development of algorithms aimed at assessing phytoplankton community structure from satellite observations.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2014	59	3					927	946		10.4319/lo.2014.59.3.0927								WOS:000339904300023

Owing to the complexity of P chemistry, remote sensing detection of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations currently remains limited especially for optically complex turbid inland waters. To address this need, a new TP remote sensing algorithm is developed based on prior water optical classification and the use of support vector regression (SVR) machine. The in situ observed datasets, used in this study, were collected at specific times during 2009 similar to 2011, covering a total of 232 stations from eight cruises in Lakes Taihu, Chaohu, Dianchi, and Three Gorges reservoir of China. Three types of waters were first classified by using a recently developed NTD675 (Normalized Trough Depth of spectral reflectance at 675 nm) water classification method. Then, spectral regions sensitive specifically to each water type were explored and expressed via several band ratios and used for retrieval algorithm development. The established type-specific SVR algorithms yield relatively high predictive accuracies. Specifically, the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) produced with the independent validation samples were achieved at 32.7, 23.2, and 14.1 % for type 1, type 2, and type 3 waters, respectively. Such water type-specific SVR algorithms are more accurate for the classified waters than an aggregated SVR algorithm for the nonclassified water and also superior to commonly used statistical algorithms. Moreover, application of the developed algorithms with HJ1A/HSI image data demonstrates that the algorithms have a large potential for remote sensing estimation of TP concentrations in optically complex turbid inland waters.

Here, we quantify the ecological resilience of the largest reef in the Caribbean and map potential benefits of marine reserves under two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. Resilience is calculated using spatial ecological models and defined as the probability of a reef remaining in its coral-dominated basin of attraction such that it does not flip into an alternate, algal-dominated attractor. In practice, resilience is the probability that coral populations will maintain the ability to exhibit a recovery trend after acute disturbances such as hurricanes. The inputs required to estimate resilience are a reef's initial state, physical environment, and disturbance regime. One major driver of reef resilience is herbivory by parrotfish and recent action to protect parrotfish in Belize was found to have increased resilience 6-fold. However, the expected benefits of parrotfish protection to future coral cover were relatively modest with only a 2- to 2.6-fold improvement over a business-as-usual scenario, demonstrating how resilience and ecosystem states are decoupled. Global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had little impact on average coral state unless it was accompanied by local controls of fishing. However, combined global and local action reduced the rate of reef degradation threefold. Operationalizing resilience explicitly integrates available biophysical data and accommodates the complex interactions among ecological processes and multiple types of disturbance.

Microwave backscattering from surf zone waves	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The microwave backscatter properties of surf zone waves are analyzed using field observations. By utilizing a preexisting, independent, water surface discrimination technique, the microwave returns were extracted along individual waveforms and the data from shoaling (steepening) waves, surf zone breaking waves, and remnant foam were separated and quantified. In addition, a wave tracking analysis technique allows the returns to be examined on a wave-by-wave basis as individual waves progress through the shoaling zone and break on a nearshore sand bar. Normalized radar cross sections (NRCS), polarization ratios, Doppler spectra, and scatterer velocities were collected using a dual-polarized, X-band radar operating at lower grazing angles than previously reported (1 degrees-3.5 degrees). The results indicate that the maximum NRCS levels are from the active breaking portions of the wave and were consistently about -20 dB, regardless of radar polarization, azimuth angle, wave height, or wind speed. In addition, breaking waves induce broadening of the Doppler spectra and mean scatterer velocities that correlate well with the carrier wave celerity. Analysis of the polarization ratios suggest that the active breaking portions of the wave are depolarized but that higher polarization ratios (>0 dB) are found on the leading edges shoreward of the active breaking portions of the waves, which indicates a clear distinction between two scattering regimes. These results are consistent with scattering from a very rough surface that is being mechanically generated by the breaking process, showing a good agreement with the expected grazing angle dependency of a Lambertian scatterer.

Assessing the cross platform performance of marine mammal indicators between two collocated acoustic recorders	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Equipment and deployment strategies for remote passive acoustic sensing of marine environments must balance memory capacity, power requirements, sampling rate, duty-cycle, deployment duration, instrument size, and environmental concerns. The impact of different parameters on the data and applicability of the data to the specific questions being asked should be considered before deployment. Here we explore the effect of recording and detection parameters on marine mammal acoustic data across two platforms. Daily classifications of marine mammal vocalizations from two passive acoustic monitors with different subsampling parameters, an AURAL and a Passive Aquatic Listener (PAL), collocated in the Bering Sea were compared. The AURAL subsampled on a preset schedule, whereas the PAL sampled via an adaptive protocol. Detected signals of interest were manually classified in each dataset independently. The daily classification rates of vocalizations were similar. Detections from the higher duty-cycle but lower sample rate AURAL were limited to species and vocalizations with energy below 4 kHz precluding detection of echolocation signals. Temporal coverage from the PAL audio files was limited by the adaptive sub-sampling protocol. A method for classifying ribbon (Histriophoca fasciata) and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) vocalizations from the sparse spectral time histories of the PAL was developed. Although application of the acoustic entropy as a rapid assessment of biodiversity was not reflective of the number of species detected, acoustic entropy was robust to changes in sample rate and window length.

In the oceans, indicators of plankton can be measured using a variety of observing systems including: mooring stations, ships, autonomous floats and ocean colour remote sensing. Given the broad range of temporal and spatial sampling resolutions of these different observing systems, as well as discrepancies in measurements obtained from different sensors, the estimation and interpretation of plankton indicators can present significant challenges. To provide support to the assessment of the state of the marine ecosystem, we propose a suite of plankton indicators and subsequently classify them in an ecological framework that characterizes key attributes of the ecosystem. We present two case studies dealing with plankton indicators of biomass, size structure and phenology, estimated using the most spatially extensive and longest in situ and remote-sensing observations. Discussion of these studies illustrates how some of the challenges in estimating and interpreting plankton indicators may be addressed by using for example relative measurement thresholds, interpolation procedures and delineation of biogeochemical provinces. We demonstrate that one of the benefits attained, when analyzing a suite of plankton indicators classified in an ecological framework, is the elucidation of non-trivial changes in composition, structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem.

In this study we used remote sensing techniques to model the degree of spatial overlapping between the Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and Argentine fisheries, assuming this as a proxy of risk for albatrosses. Eleven tags were deployed on albatrosses during the non-breeding seasons 2011 and 2012 in the Patagonian Shelf. Their distribution overlapped to different extents with the two coastal trawl, three offshore trawl and one demersal long-line fisheries. The overlap index showed highest values with both coastal fleets, followed by the ice-chilling trawl fleet. These intersections were located in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, in coastal areas of the SE of Buenos Aires province, El Rincon estuary and over the shelf break. The analysis of intersections of focal areas from albatrosses and all fisheries allowed the identification of thirty-four fishing management units (1 degrees by 1 degrees grid within the Argentine EEZ) classified as of medium, high or very high conservation priority. Very high priority units were placed between 35 and 38 degrees S in the external mouth of Rio de la Plata, and between 45 and 47 degrees s in neighboring waters East to the hake fishing closure. Although there were possible biases due to the limited number of tracked birds and the locations where albatrosses were captured and instrumented, the information presented in this study provides a comprehensive picture of important areas of overlapping during winter that could be used by the fishery administration to prioritize conservation actions under limited resource scenarios.

Field observations of mesozooplankton biomass, and chlorophyll a data from transects (different seasons) and large-scale surveys (autumn) were used for validation of the remote sensing products and modeling results. The validation showed that satellite data are well suited to study temporal and spatial dynamics of chlorophyll a in the Barents Sea and that the model is an essential tool for secondary production estimates. Temperature, open water area, chlorophyll a, and zooplankton biomass show large interannual variations in the Barents Sea. The climatic variability is strongest in the northern and eastern parts. The moderate increase in net primary production evident in this study is likely an ecosystem response to changes in climate during the same period. Increased open water area and duration of open water season, which are related to elevated temperatures, appear to be the key drivers of the changes in annual net primary production that has occurred in the northern and eastern areas of this ecosystem. The temporal and spatial variability in zooplankton biomass appears to be controlled largely by predation pressure. In the southeastern Barents Sea, statistically significant linkages were observed between chlorophyll a and zooplankton biomass, as well as between net primary production and fish biomass, indicating bottom-up trophic interactions in this region.

Two new satellite sensors, the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the NASA Aquarius SAC-D missions, are now providing the first space-borne measurements of the sea surface salinity (SSS). In this paper, we present examples demonstrating how SMOS-derived SSS data are being used to better characterize key land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interaction processes that occur within the marine hydrological cycle. In particular, SMOS with its ocean mapping capability provides observations across the world's largest tropical ocean fresh pool regions, and we discuss from intraseasonal to interannual precipitation impacts as well as large-scale river runoff from the Amazon-Orinoco and Congo rivers and its offshore advection. Synergistic multi-satellite analyses of these new surface salinity data sets combined with sea surface temperature, dynamical height and currents from altimetry, surface wind, ocean color, rainfall estimates, and in situ observations are shown to yield new freshwater budget insight. Finally, SSS observations from the SMOS and Aquarius/SAC-D sensors are combined to examine the response of the upper ocean to tropical cyclone passage including the potential role that a freshwater-induced upper ocean barrier layer may play in modulating surface cooling and enthalpy flux in tropical cyclone track regions.

MODIS, MERIS and GOCI seawater reflectance products at green, red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths are generated using atmospheric correction algorithms designed for turbid coastal waters then compared. Good agreement is obtained in the green and red while significant differences are observed in the NIR. The standard GOCI algorithm and a new one based on a regional empirical relationship established using MODIS satellite data are both proved to perform well over the whole range of water turbidity. Finally the dynamics of SPM is reconstituted along a three-month period to highlight a steady-state and stratified situation before the overpass of a large typhoon which mixed the water column, destroyed the deep-chlorophyll maximum and enhanced resuspension of bottom sediments varying according to tidal cycles.

J	Vanhellemont, Q; Neukermans, G; Ruddick, K				Vanhellemont, Quinten; Neukermans, Griet; Ruddick, Kevin			Synergy between polar-orbiting and geostationary sensors: Remote sensing of the ocean at high spatial and high temporal resolution	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Ocean colour sensors have been capturing the state of the world's oceans for over a decade. They are typically installed on polar-orbiting satellites and cover the entire earth every 1 to 2 days. This temporal resolution is insufficient to observe oceanic processes occurring at a higher frequency, especially when taking cloud cover into account. Data from geostationary platforms can be obtained with a much better temporal resolution (images every 15 or 60 min), and thus are useful to study those processes. We show that by synergistically combining marine reflectance data from SEVIRI, a geostationary sensor, and MODIS Aqua, a polar orbiter, the resulting product is an improvement over both data sources. The synergy approach takes the reflectance from MODIS, with high quality and high spatial resolution, and modulates this over the day by the temporal variability of the SEVIRI reflectance, normalized to the SEVIRI reflectance at the time of MODIS overpass. The temporal frequency of the synergy product is much better than that of MODIS, and by using the latter's high quality data, the limited spatial and radiometric resolution of SEVIRI is enhanced. As the SEVIRI data is limited to a single broad red band (560-710 nm), the applications of the synergy product are limited to parameters that can be derived from this band, such as suspended particulate matter (SPM), turbidity (T) and the diffuse attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (Kpar) in turbid waters. A geostationary ocean colour sensor over Europe will provide invaluable data concerning our marine environment. The cost of increasing the spatial resolution of a geostationary sensor is very high, and this study illustrates that a lower resolution geostationary ocean colour sensor combined with a high resolution polar orbiting sensor, can provide a high frequency synergetic product with high spatial resolution.

Remote sensing of assimilation number for marine phytoplankton	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Estimating primary production at large spatial scales is key to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Algorithms to estimate primary production are well established and have been used in many studies with success. One of the key parameters in these algorithms is the chlorophyll-normalised production rate under light saturation (referred to as the light saturation parameter or the assimilation number). It is known to depend on temperature, light history and nutrient conditions, but assigning a magnitude to it at particular space-time points is difficult. In this paper, we explore two models to estimate the assimilation number at the global scale from remotely-sensed data that combine methods to estimate the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton. The inputs to the algorithms are the surface concentration of chlorophyll, seasurface temperature, photosynthetically-active radiation af the surface of the sea, sea surface nutrient concentration and mixed-layer depth. A large database of in situ estimates of the assimilation number is used to develop the models and provide elements of validation. The comparisons with in situ observations are promising and global maps of assimilation number are produced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Tropical islands quick data gap analysis guided by coral reef geomorphological maps	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A gap analysis is the initial step towards the identification of areas where data are needed. However, often, data coverage cannot be assessed against a reference that objectively guides the identification of both gaps and priority areas for data acquisition. Here, we describe a quick, effective and reproducible spatial data gap analysis approach based on the relationship between location of available metadata and coral reef geomorphological richness. In Solomon Islands, we identified gaps defined by high richness and low biological data coverage. We collected metadata only, to avoid dealing with data ownership, availability, and formats, and to be able to identify gaps in less than two months. This fast method does not replace quantitative and comprehensive gap analysis, but provides effective identification of areas of high natural value and limited knowledge. The method is widely applicable and particularly invaluable for large and complex domains such as the Coral Triangle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Coral reefs are facing threats from both natural and anthropogenic factors. Monitoring, protecting and studying these ecosystems are considered as a complex process because they are underwater features. Remote sensing can be quite useful in this by providing huge amount of database of satellite images. Landsat series have been providing satellite data for last 50years and now it is one of the large databases providing satellite imageries. Accurate processing of these images can increase the accuracy of coral reef information extraction from these images. Classification is one of the important processes that can give adequate and precise information about coral reefs. This study is intended to compare various supervised classification techniques available for extraction of information from the image and to suggest best of them. Maximum Likelihood and Support Vector Machine have proven to be good classification module that can be used to classify Landsat Images to coral reef detection and monitoring.																	1947-5705	1947-5713				APR 3	2014	5	2					173	184		10.1080/19475705.2013.802748								WOS:000335002900006

The knowledge of such complex depositional systems is important in understanding of coastal evolution and for coastal management. The present study deals with the subsurface identification of interfaces between fluvial and beach/shallow marine systems, using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). GPR profiles were measured along dip direction, at two sites on the coastal plain of Santa Catarina state (Pinheira and Passo de Tones), where deposits of fluvial and beach/foredune ridge systems occur. GPR data showed that fluvial and beach deposits are interdigitated in subsurface, with reflectors showing different downlap directions. The results of this study allow a more complete knowledge of the complex interfaces between marine and continental systems. Also, the identification of hidden older fluvial deposits in the subsurface of coastal plains gives important geoteclinical information to be considered in the use and occupation of coastal areas and during prospection for placer deposits.

J	Shih, PTY; Chen, YH; Chen, JC				Shih, Peter Tian-Yuan; Chen, Ya-Hsing; Chen, Jie-Chung			Historic Shipwreck Study in Dongsha Atoll with Bathymetric LiDAR	ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION												Dongsha Atoll is a coral reef located in the South China Sea. The surrounding area is characterized by dangerous shoals. Historic shipwrecks mark past human activities. Due to the shallow water and risky navigational conditions in the area, a sonar survey with platforms on the water surface was not feasible. Airborne bathymetric LiDAR, which utilizes green laser for measurement, however, is a proven convenient method for studying shipwrecks around the atoll, particularly in shallow-water areas. At a point density of about 3.5m by 3.5m, four shipwrecks were identified. The bathymetric measurements allow not only the length of the shipwreck to be estimated, but also its height above the sea floor. The full waveform record of the laser reflection also provided information to separate the wreckage from its surroundings. This provides an excellent working environment for marine archaeological analysis, as not only the location, but also the depth and geomorphological information can be assessed in an integrated setting.

A review of ocean color remote sensing methods and statistical techniques for the detection, mapping and analysis of phytoplankton blooms in coastal and open oceans	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The need for more effective environmental monitoring of the open and coastal ocean has recently led to notable advances in satellite ocean color technology and algorithm research. Satellite ocean color sensors' data are widely used for the detection, mapping and monitoring of phytoplankton blooms because earth observation provides a synoptic view of the ocean, both spatially and temporally. Algal blooms are indicators of marine ecosystem health; thus, their monitoring is a key component of effective management of coastal and oceanic resources. Since the late 1970s, a wide variety of operational ocean color satellite sensors and algorithms have been developed. The comprehensive review presented in this article captures the details of the progress and discusses the advantages and limitations of the algorithms used with the multi-spectral ocean color sensors CZCS, SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS. Present challenges include overcoming the severe limitation of these algorithms in coastal waters and refining detection limits in various oceanic and coastal environments. To understand the spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms and their triggering factors, it is essential to consider the possible effects of environmental parameters, such as water temperature, turbidity, solar radiation and bathymetry. Hence, this review will also discuss the use of statistical techniques and additional datasets derived from ecosystem models or other satellite sensors to characterize further the factors triggering or limiting the development of algal blooms in coastal and open ocean waters.

Satellite-retri chlorophyll-a concentrations from temporarily ice-free zones were validated with contextual field data. were then integrated per month on a grid size of 20 x 20 km, resulting in 10 grids/fields. Factors teste their influence on spatial and temporal variation of chlorophyll-a were: sea-ice concentration from sz and sea-ice thickness, ocean stratification, water temperature and salinity time-series simulated b ice-ocean model NAOSIM. The time series analysis for those ten ice-free fields showed a regional separ according to different physical processes affecting phytoplankton distribution. At the marginal ice zon melting sea-ice was promoting phytoplankton growth by stratifying the water column and poten seeding phytoplankton communities. In this zone, the highest mean chlorophyll concentration ave for the productive season (April-August) of 0.8 mgC/m3 was observed. In the open ocean the phytoplz variability was correlated highest to stratification formed by solar heating of the upper ocean layers. C zone around Svalbard showed processes associated with the presence of coastal ice were rather suppre than promoting the phytoplanlcton growth. During the twelve years of observations, chlorophyll concentrz significantly increased in the southern part of the Fram Strait, associated with an increase in sea s temperature and a decrease in Svalbard coastal ice.

J	Lin, JR; Tang, DL; Alpers, W; Wang, SF				Lin, Jingrou; Tang, Danling; Alpers, Werner; Wang, Sufen			Response of dissolved oxygen and related marine ecological parameters to a tropical cyclone in the South China Sea	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												It is well known that tropical cyclones can cause upwelling, decrease of sea surface temperature, increase of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and enhancement of primary production. But little is known about the response of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration to a typhoon in the open ocean. This paper investigates the impact of a typhoon on DO concentration and related ecological parameters using in situ and remote sensing data. The in situ data were collected 1 week after the passage of the super-typhoon Nanmadol in the northern South China Sea in 2011. An increase in DO concentration, accompanied by a decrease in water temperature and an increase in salinity and Chl-a concentration, was measured at sampling stations close to the typhoon track. At these stations, maximum DO concentration was found at a depth of around 5 m and maximum Chl-a concentration at depths between 50 and 75 m. The layer of high DO concentration extends from the surface to a depth of 35 m and the concentrations stay almost constant down to this depth. Due to the passage of the typhoon, also a large sea level anomaly (21.6 cm) and a high value of Ekman pumping velocity (4.0 x 10(-4) m s(-1)) are observed, indicating upwelling phenomenon. At the same time, also intrusion of Kuroshio waters in the form of a loop current into the South China Sea (SCS) was observed. We attribute the increase of DO concentration after the passage of the typhoon to three effects: (1) entrainment of oxygen from the air into the upper water layer and strong vertical mixing of the water body due to the typhoon winds, (2) upwelling of cold nutrient-rich water which stimulates photosynthesis of phytoplankton and thus the generation of oxygen, which also increases the DO concentration due to cold water since the solubility of oxygen increase with decreasing water temperature, and, possibly, (3) transport of DO enriched waters from the Western Pacific to the SCS via the intrusion of Kuroshio waters.

Viewing Marine Bacteria, Their Activity and Response to Environmental Drivers from Orbit	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Satellite-based remote sensing of marine microorganisms has become a useful tool in predicting human health risks associated with these microscopic targets. Early applications were focused on harmful algal blooms, but more recently methods have been developed to interrogate the ocean for bacteria. As satellite-based sensors have become more sophisticated and our ability to interpret information derived from these sensors has advanced, we have progressed from merely making fascinating pictures from space to developing process models with predictive capability. Our understanding of the role of marine microorganisms in primary production and global elemental cycles has been vastly improved as has our ability to use the combination of remote sensing data and models to provide early warning systems for disease outbreaks. This manuscript will discuss current approaches to monitoring cyanobacteria and vibrios, their activity and response to environmental drivers, and will also suggest future directions.

Contrasts between wave- and tide-dominated oolitic systems: Holocene of Crooked-Acklins Platform, southern Bahamas	FACIES												As the stratigraphic record is neither homogenous nor isotropic, a fundamental challenge in sedimentary geology is characterizing and predicting the nature of variability. Although many nearshore to shallow-marine siliciclastic depositional systems have been grouped into wave-dominated and tide-dominated classes, many facies models of carbonate systems have not recognized or applied this distinction. To fill this gap, the purpose of this study is to compare and contrast the hydrodynamic processes, sedimentology, geomorphology, and stratigraphy of an oolitic tide-dominated shoal complex and an oolitic wave-dominated shoreline system from the same area (Crooked-Acklins Platform, southern Bahamas). Field, petrographic, granulometric, remote-sensing, and hydrodynamic data illustrate marked contrasts between the two end members. The wave-dominated shoreface system near French Wells on the leeward margin is influenced by small (H-s < 30 cm) waves and only weak, wave-driven currents (< 15 cm/s, net southward flow); the passage of Hurricane Irene (in 2011) had only a local impact on the shoreface. The low-energy setting favors generation and alongshore transport of ooids and peloids of fine- to medium-sized sand, and has facilitated nearly 1 km of shoreface progradation, forming geomorphic bodies with margin-parallel geometry. The stratigraphic record of the area includes a coarsening- and shoaling-upward succession. In contrast, the similar to 7-km-wide, tide-dominated shoal on the southwestern margin is dominated by vigorous tidal currents (in excess of 50 cm/s, and reversing twice daily). These currents generate margin-normal bars and channels consisting of oolitically coated grains of medium to coarse sand size. Stratigraphically, above a basal clast-rich deposit, sediment size and sorting vary across the shoal. The open-ocean and the platformward flanks of the shoal, most impacted by tide and wave energy, include the cleanest oolitic sand, with fines accumulating in the stabilized shoal interior. Overall, the oolitic shoal aggraded and expanded platformward over bioturbated peloid-ooid sand. These results reveal how sediment, geomorphology, and stratigraphy differ between tide- and wave-dominated end members, patterns broadly analogous to several ancient examples. These data collectively illustrate the processes that create multi-scale linkages among stratigraphic patterns, geological facies bodies, and granulometry (e.g., depositional porosity and permeability). These linkages provide information that could be used to predict sedimentological and geomorphical trends in ancient analogues.

A method for estimating colony sizes of Ad,lie penguins using remote sensing imagery	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are important predators of krill (Euphausia spp.) and Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarctica) during summer, are a key indicator of the status of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and are therefore a focal species for the Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Ecosystem Monitoring Program. The ability to monitor the population size of species potentially affected by Southern Ocean fisheries, i.e., the Ad,lie penguin, is critical for effective management of those resources. However, for several reasons, direct estimates of population size are not possible in many locations around Antarctica. In this study, we combine high-resolution (0.6 m) satellite imagery with spectral analysis in a supervised classification to estimate the sizes of Ad,lie penguin breeding colonies along Victoria Land in the Ross Sea and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Using satellite images paired with concurrent ground counts, we fit a generalized linear mixed model with Poisson errors to predict the abundance of breeding pairs as a function of the area of current-year guano staining identified in the satellite imagery. Guano-covered area proved to be an effective proxy for the number of penguins residing within. Our model provides a robust, quantitative mechanism for estimating the breeding population size of colonies captured in imagery and identifies terrain slope as a significant component influencing apparent nesting density. While our high-resolution satellite imagery technique was developed for the Ad,lie penguin, these principles are directly transferrable to other colonially nesting seabirds and other species that aggregate in fixed localities.																	0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2014	37	4					507	517		10.1007/s00300-014-1451-8								WOS:000332770800006

Improved algorithms for accurate retrieval of UV/visible diffuse attenuation coefficients in optically complex, inshore waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Photochemical processes driven by high-energy ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in inshore, estuarine, and coastal waters play an important role in global biogeochemical cycles and biological systems. A key to modeling photochemical processes in these optically complex waters is an accurate description of the vertical distribution of UVR in the water column which can be obtained using the diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance (K-d(lambda)). The SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms (Fichot et al., 2008) can accurately retrieve K-d (lambda = 320, 340, 380, 412, 443 and 490 nm) in oceanic and coastal waters using multispectral remote sensing reflectances (R-rs(lambda), SeaWiFS bands). However, SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms are currently not optimized for use in optically complex, inshore waters, where they tend to severely underestimate K-d(lambda). Here, a new training data set of optical properties collected in optically complex, inshore waters was used to re-parameterize the original SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms, resulting in improved K-d(lambda) retrievals for turbid, estuarine waters. Although the updated SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms perform best in optically complex waters, the original SeaUV/SeaUVc models still perform well in most coastal and oceanic waters. Therefore, we propose a composite set of SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms, optimized for K-d(lambda) retrieval in almost all marine systems, ranging from oceanic to inshore waters. The composite algorithm set can retrieve K-d from ocean color with good accuracy across this wide range of water types (e.g., within a mean relative error of 13% for K-d(340)). A validation step using three independent, in situ data sets indicates that the composite SeaUV/SeaUVc can generate accurate K-d(lambda) values at lambda = 320-490 nm from ocean color on a global scale. Taking advantage of the inherent benefits of our statistical methods, we pooled the validation data with the training set, obtaining an optimized composite model for estimating K-d(lambda) in UV wavelengths for almost all marine waters. This "optimized composite" set of SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms will provide the optical community with improved ability to quantify the role of solar UV radiation in photochemical and photobiological processes in the ocean.

The effect of particulate organic content on the remote sensing of marine suspended sediments	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We report on the relationship between the backscattering coefficient at 665 nm and the cross sectional area of particles in suspension in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and English Channel. A plot of the backscattering coefficient against particle area shows two distinct trends: one for particles with high mineral content and another for particles with low mineral content. Backscattering per unit particle area (effective backscattering efficiency, Q(bb)) shows a continuous non-linear dependence on the ratio of mineral to total suspended solids (MSS/TSS) over the range 0.35 < MSS/TSS < 0.91. The relationship can be represented by an exponential function: Q(bb) = 0.000087 exp(6.9 MSS/TSS), which explains 62% of the observed variance in backscattering efficiency. Changes in particle size have no significant influence on Q(bb). As the MSS/TSS ratio increases, the backscattering ratio (b(b)/b) also increases. The implication for the quantitative remote sensing of marine suspended sediments is that the mass specific backscattering coefficient, b(b)* depends on the particle area per unit mass multiplied by a function which depends on the mineral content of the particles.

Three-dimensional wind profiling of offshore wind energy areas with airborne Doppler lidar	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												A technique has been developed for imaging the wind field over offshore areas being considered for wind farming. This is accomplished with an eye-safe 2-mu m wavelength coherent Doppler lidar installed in an aircraft. By raster scanning the aircraft over the wind energy area (WEA), a three-dimensional map of the wind vector can be made. This technique was evaluated in 11 flights over the Virginia and Maryland offshore WEAs. Heights above the ocean surface planned for wind turbines are shown to be within the marine boundary layer, and the wind vector is seen to show variation across the geographical area of interest at turbine heights. c The Authors.

J	Moore, TS; Dowell, MD; Bradt, S; Verdu, AR				Moore, Timothy S.; Dowell, Mark D.; Bradt, Shane; Ruiz Verdu, Antonio			An optical water type framework for selecting and blending retrievals from bio-optical algorithms in lakes and coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Bio-optical models are based on relationships between the spectral remote sensing reflectance and optical properties of in-water constituents. The wavelength range where this information can be exploited changes depending on the water characteristics. In low chlorophyll-a waters, the blue/green region of the spectrum is more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll-a concentration, whereas the red/NIR region becomes more important in turbid and/or eutrophic waters. In this work we present an approach to manage the shift from blue/green ratios to red/NIR-based chlorophyll-a algorithms for optically complex waters. Based on a combined in situ data set of coastal and inland waters, measures of overall algorithm uncertainty were roughly equal for two chlorophyll-a algorithms the standard NASA OC4 algorithm based on blue/green bands and a MERIS 3-band algorithm based on red/NIR bands-with RMS error of 0.416 and 0.437 for each in log chlorophyll-a units, respectively. However, it is clear that each algorithm performs better at different chlorophyll-a ranges. When a blending approach is used based on an optical water type classification, the overall RMS error was reduced to 0.320. Bias and relative error were also reduced when evaluating the blended chlorophyll-a product compared to either of the single algorithm products. As a demonstration for ocean color applications, the algorithm blending approach was applied to MERIS imagery over Lake Erie. We also examined the use of this approach in several coastal marine environments, and examined the long-term frequency of the OWTs to MODIS-Aqua imagery over Lake Erie. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Mitchell, C; Cunningham, A; McKee, D				Mitchell, Catherine; Cunningham, Alex; McKee, David			Remote sensing of shelf sea optical properties: Evaluation of a quasi-analytical approach for the Irish Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A quasi-analytical approach to deriving the coefficients of absorption, a(lambda), backscattering, b(b)(lambda), and the attenuation of planar irradiance, K-d(lambda), from sub-surface remote sensing reflectance, r(rs) (lambda), was investigated for the optically complex (Case 2) waters of the Irish Sea. The algorithms of Lee et al. (2005b, Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans, 110, C02017) were tuned for this region using radiative transfer calculations which incorporated locally determined specific inherent optical properties and constituent concentrations. The optimised algorithms were then applied to r(rs) spectra derived from profiling radiometry for 145 stations in the Irish Sea and adjacent waters, and their outputs compared with inherent optical property measurements for these stations. For the modelled data, recoveries of, a(lambda), b(b)(lambda) and K-d(lambda) in six wavebands between 412 nm and 667 nm had mean percentage errors below 3% and standard deviations of around 6%. For in situ data, the algorithms tended to over-estimate a(lambda) and under estimate b(b)(lambda) relative to measured values, but a contributing factor could be the difficulty of measuring optical properties accurately in turbid waters. Retrieved values of K-d(lambda) were highly correlated with those measured in situ, with regression slopes in the best-performing bands of 1.05 at 442 nm (r(2) = 0.91) and 0.92 at 488 nm (r(2) = 0.96). Three previously published relationships between satellite-derived optical properties at 490 nm and euphotic depth, z(1%PAR), produced roughly equivalent results with root mean square percentage errors, relative to in situ measurements, of around 20%. On the logarithmic scales usually employed in remote sensing, values of a(488), b(b)(488),K-d(488) and z(1%PAR) recovered using the optimised algorithms bore strong linear relationships to in situ measurements, with least square regression slopes in the range 0.89 to 1.03 and r(2) values from 0.87 to 0.94. Application of these algorithms to a MODIS image of the Irish Sea in early summer (25th May 2013) revealed marked spatial variations in optical properties which were well correlated with known patterns of tidal stirring in the region.

Recent advances in remote-sensing technology allow us to view fishing practices from space and mitigate gaps in catch reporting. Here, we use Google Earth to count intertidal fishing weirs off the coast of six countries in the Persian Gulf, otherwise known as the Arabian Gulf. Although the name of this body of water remains contentious, we use the name used in Google Earth. Combining, in a Monte Carlo procedure, the number of weirs (after correcting for poor resolution and imagery availability) with assumptions about daily catch and fishing season lengths, we estimate that 1900 (79) weirs contribute to a regional catch up to six times higher than the officially reported catches of 5260 t. These results, which speak to the unreliability of officially reported fisheries statistics, provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to validate catch statistics and fisheries operations in general.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				MAR-APR	2014	71	3					450	454		10.1093/icesjms/fst178								WOS:000334694300003						
J	Wang, JJ; Tang, DL				Wang, Jiu-Juan; Tang, Dan Ling			Phytoplankton patchiness during spring intermonsoon in western coast of South China Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Jet-like phytoplankton blooms usually occur off the southwestern coast of the South China Sea (SCS) caused by strong winds during summer monsoons. However a jet-like phytoplankton patch was observed in the western SCS in the spring intermonsoon of 2010 in both field and remote sensing data. The present study investigated the biological processes associated with this spring phytoplankton patchiness. The data showed that chlorophyll a concentrations increased in the surface water, extending out to the SCS, and the depth of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum uplifted from 75 m to 50 m depth; low dissolved oxygen, low pH and nutrient enrichment (nitrate + nitrite and soluble reactive phosphate) were observed in the subsurface water (50 to similar to 200 m depth). Data analysis showed that variations in chlorophyll a, nutrients and temperature in the water column were related to wind-stress curl: the spatial distribution pattern and vertical structure of the phytoplankton patchiness were controlled by vertical flux of nutrients caused by curl-driven upwelling through Ekman pumping. There was a high correlation between chlorophyll a concentration and wind-stress curl where the influence of nutrient influx from the coast was limited. This study shows the importance of wind-stress curl in providing nutrients to support phytoplankton growth during the spring intermonsoon along the western coast of SCS. It may help to better understand the role of wind in marine biological processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel remote condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system for marine diesel engines based on the compressive sensing technology	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING												Diesel engines are the most important equipments in the marine propulsion system. Due to offshore working condition, it is essential to establish remote network to monitor the health status of the diesel engines. Unfortunately, very limited work has been done for remote condition monitoring and fault diagnosis (CMFD) of marine diesel engines. To address this issue, we present a novel remote CMFD system to detect engine combustion fault, which appropriately introduces the compressive sensing technique into the remote data transmission. The instantaneous angular speed (IAS) signal of the engine is transferred remotely from the ship to shoreside data center. Combustion fault detection is achieved by time-frequency spectrum analysis on the decompressed IAS data. The key advantage of our proposed remote CMFD system is that the IAS data has been sampled in a low-speed manner by compressive sensing, thus greatly reducing the computational requirements in the data transmission. We have established our proposed remote CMFD system for a real dredger to demonstrate its efficiency in the engine combustion fault detection.

J	Lyons, Y				Lyons, Youna			Prospects for satellite imagery of insular features and surrounding marine habitats in the South China Sea	MARINE POLICY												This paper investigates the extent to which remote sensing data can contribute to the management of two parallel crises in the South China Sea (SCS); first the ongoing disputes related to islands and related maritime boundaries and second the degradation of the marine environment and the decrease in fish stocks. It demonstrates that remote sensing surveys are the only means to lawfully collect independent and verifiable geographic data on the disputed features without the need to consult all the claimants and thereby add to regional frictions and tensions. These surveys can contribute to the determination of whether these features are submerged or above water at high tide and what their physical characteristics are. This would inform the application of the Law of the Sea and help determine entitlements to maritime zones and thus access to resources. The other category of uses for remote sensing surveys which is explored is the identification and classification of marine habitats and the building of a biogeographic platform. This paper shows the limits created by unavoidable uncertainties in the interpretation of satellite imagery. However, many benefits outweigh the downsides: the potential for national and regional marine spatial planning, for the prioritization of marine environments in need of management, for the implementation by the States bordering the SCS of the international treaties which they have ratified and for ecological monitoring.

J	Miller, PI; Christodoulou, S				Miller, Peter I.; Christodoulou, Stelios			Frequent locations of oceanic fronts as an indicator of pelagic diversity: Application to marine protected areas and renewables	MARINE POLICY												Frequent locations of thermal fronts in UK shelf seas were identified using an archive of 30,000 satellite images acquired between 1999 and 2008, and applied as a proxy for pelagic diversity in the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Networks of MPAs are required for conservation of critical marine habitats within Europe, and there are similar initiatives worldwide. Many pelagic biodiversity hotspots are related to fronts, for example cetaceans and basking sharks around the Isle of Man, Hebrides and Cornwall, and hence remote sensing can address this policy need in regions with insufficient species distribution data. This is the first study of UK Continental Shelf front locations to use a 10-year archive of full-resolution (1.1 km) AVHRR data, revealing new aspects of their spatial and seasonal variability. Frontal locations determined at sea or predicted by ocean models agreed closely with the new frequent front maps, which also identified many additional frontal zones. These front Maps were among the most widely used datasets in the recommendation of UK MPAs, and would be applicable to other geographic regions and to other policy drivers such as facilitating the deployment of offshore renewable energy devices with minimal environmental impact.

The present study employed a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) and used satellite remote-sensing data to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of suitable areas for Japanese scallop aquaculture in the Dalian coastal area from 2003 to 2012. The study area was divided into four marine zones. The results demonstrated that the suitability scores of scallop aquaculture areas were high in May and low in February. The Changhai County (Zone II) and Lushunkou areas (Zone III) exhibited high potential for Japanese scallop aquaculture development. The results of the suitability models were consistent with the existing scallop aquaculture in the study area. These zones, combined with climatic events [the winter East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events], were used to examine the impact of climate variability on scallop aquaculture. Results suggest that the suitability scores in Zone III were more sensitive to changes in environmental factors (e. g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and suspended sediment) and climate changes, whereas the correlations among these factors were not significant in Zone II. Adaptation to these changes should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for scallop aquaculture. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Here we show estimates of melt for the watershed that contains the largest and longest glacier in North America, the Bering Glacier. The procedure combines in situ observations of snow and ice melt acquired by a long-term monitoring program, multispectral satellite observations, and nearby temperature measurements. The estimated melt is 40km(3) per melt season, 3.0km(3), observed over the decadal period, 2002-2012. As a result of climate change, these estimates could increase to 60km(3)/yr by 2050.

However, lack of proper management has resulted in the closure of various fisheries, such as the Calico scallop, Argopecten ventricosus, in 1994. One of the main challenges for the management of coastal resources is the selection of critical habitats for conservation considering the economic activities of the communities associated with them. This study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing to assess the roll of rhodoliths and Sargassum spp. as critical habitats in Bahia Concepcion for endangered and commercial species. Underwater surveys, on 72 randomly selected sites within the bay, were conducted to characterize the shallow benthic habitats, fish and invertebrate species abundance and richness during the spring of 2011. Analyses show that rhodoliths are important for the invertebrate assemblages and for at least 4 species protected under the Mexican law, NOM-059, for threatened species. Sargassum spp. and seagrass beds are also relevant for diversity but their annual life cycle limits the time when these are available as habitat for other species. GIS tools proved an innovative and effective method to provide essential information to protect critical habitats such as rhodoliths, Sargassum spp. and seagrasses, for the recovery and conservation of diversity.																	0181-1568	1776-0984				FEB	2014	35	1					49	65		10.7872/crya.v35.iss1.2014.49								WOS:000338762100005						
J	Chu, VW				Chu, Vena W.			Greenland ice sheet hydrology: A review	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Understanding Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) hydrology is essential for evaluating response of ice dynamics to a warming climate and future contributions to global sea level rise. Recently observed increases in temperature and melt extent over the GrIS have prompted numerous remote sensing, modeling, and field studies gauging the response of the ice sheet and outlet glaciers to increasing meltwater input, providing a quickly growing body of literature describing seasonal and annual development of the GrIS hydrologic system. This system is characterized by supraglacial streams and lakes that drain through moulins, providing an influx of meltwater into englacial and subglacial environments that increases basal sliding speeds of outlet glaciers in the short term. However, englacial and subglacial drainage systems may adjust to efficiently drain increased meltwater without significant changes to ice dynamics over seasonal and annual scales. Both proglacial rivers originating from land-terminating glaciers and subglacial conduits under marine-terminating glaciers represent direct meltwater outputs in the form of fjord sediment plumes, visible in remotely sensed imagery. This review provides the current state of knowledge on GrIS surface water hydrology, following ice sheet surface meltwater production and transport via supra-, en-, sub-, and proglacial processes to final meltwater export to the ocean. With continued efforts targeting both process-level and systems analysis of the hydrologic system, the larger picture of how future changes in Greenland hydrology will affect ice sheet glacier dynamics and ultimately global sea level rise can be advanced.

This mathematical approach eliminates interferences from background aerosols and aerosol variations due to advection and convergences/divergences in wind field and correctly estimates the rate of sea salt aerosol production by winds. To avoid oceanic biogenic sources and transport from other oceanic and land regions, the study is done over ocean sites substantially remote from the continents with low chlorophyll concentrations (< 0.06 mg/m(3)) and restricting to aerosols in the bottom layer (< 0.5 km altitude) of the atmosphere. The surface wind speed is found to correlate better with the estimated aerosol production rate (R-WS = 0.99, p < 0.0001) than with the bottom layer aerosol optical depth (R-WB=0.97, p < 0.0001). Aerosol production is observed at wind speeds even below 4 m/s and the production rate is found to follow a linear relationship with ocean surface wind speed with a slope 0.0053 and an intercept 0.0163 for low as well as high winds.

J	Petrich, C; Tivy, AC; Ward, DH				Petrich, Chris; Tivy, Adrienne C.; Ward, David H.			Reconstruction of historic sea ice conditions in a sub-Arctic lagoon	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Historical sea ice conditions were reconstructed for Izembek Lagoon, Bering Sea, Alaska. This lagoon is a crucial staging area during migration for numerous species of avian migrants and a major eelgrass (Zostera marina) area important to a variety of marine and terrestrial organisms, especially Pacific Flyway black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans). Ice cover is a common feature of the lagoon in winter, but appears to be declining, which has implications for eelgrass distribution and abundance, and its use by wildlife. We evaluated ice conditions from a model based on degree days, calibrated to satellite observations, to estimate distribution and long-term trends in ice conditions in Izembek Lagoon. Model results compared favorably with ground observations and 26 years of satellite data, allowing ice conditions to be reconstructed back to 1943. Specifically, periods of significant (limited access to eelgrass areas) and severe (almost complete ice coverage of the lagoon) ice conditions could be identified. The number of days of severe ice within a single season ranged from 0 (e.g., 2001) to >= 67 (e.g., 2000). We detected a slight long-term negative trend in ice conditions, superimposed on high inter-annual variability in seasonal aggregate ice conditions. Based on reconstructed ice conditions, the seasonally cumulative number of significant or severe ice days correlated linearly with mean air temperature from January until March. Further, air temperature at Izembek Lagoon was correlated with wind direction, suggesting that ice conditions in Izembek lagoon were associated with synoptic-scale weather patterns. Methods employed in this analysis may be transferable to other coastal locations in the Arctic. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the Zsd(Secchi depth) inversion theory, a simple semi-analysis spectra model was established for offshore seawater clarity by analyzing the relationship between vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d (490) and the beam attenuation coefficient c(490) with remote sensing reflectance. This semi-analysis spectra model needed two band reflectance ratios only, while tidal correction was produced for this model to improve the precision of the retrieving results. The semi-analysis spectra model was applied to ASD hyperspectral reflectance data measured in the Pearl River Estuary Ecological Zone (October 21, 23, 2012, November 2, 2012; N=20) and the Xuwen Coral Reef Protection Zone (January 13, 14, 2013, N=25) which covered different water body of tidal times and different pollution sources. The results indicated that the changing tendency of predicted values was consistent with the synchronous measurement values after comparing them. However, water clarity calculated by the ASD hyperspectral reflectance measured in spring tidal time, generated 0.4 m deviation compared with in-situ water clarity, while water clarity calculated by the ASD hyperspectral reflectance measured in neap tidal time is close to the in-situ water clarity. So the tidal correction coefficient of 0.4 was further applied for the model. After modification, the coefficient of determination between the inversed and measured water clarity was 0.663, the average absolute error was 0.14 m and the average relative error was 19.5%. Research demonstrated that this semi-analysis inversion algorithm just needs two band reflectance ratio to complete the inversion of water clarity, which is simple and works relatively well for lower clarity (less than 2 meters) waters compared to He' (2004) and Doron' (2011) algorithms.																	1000-0593					FEB	2014	34	2					477	482		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)02-0477-06								WOS:000331427400038

Application of the coastal and marine ecological classification standard using satellite-derived and modeled data products for pelagic habitats in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The expansive and dynamic nature of the ocean's water column may limit the feasibility of the frequent in situ sampling that would be necessary to monitor these habitats and produce region-wide map products with any regularity. Alternatives to in situ sampling such as remote sensing and classification offer a means of routinely characterizing the environmental forcing functions that shape and determine habitat suitability and distribution. Four products derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-aqua satellite (chlorophyll concentration, salinity, sea-surface temperature, and euphotic depth) and a hydrodynamic modeled product for bottom to surface temperature differences (At) were evaluated to assess the utility of these products as proxies for in situ measurements. MODIS images covering the northern Gulf of Mexico were obtained for a 5-year time period Uanuary 2005 - December 2009; 300 total images) and processed through Automated Processing System. The products were used to classify surface waters in three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico using subcomponents and modifiers from the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) Water Column Component (WC) to determine if CMECS categories could be affectively used to categorize the products into meaningful management units. Products were assessed for each month over the five year period. Sea-surface temperature and salinity were classified into CMECS WC temperature and salinity subcomponent categories, respectively. Three modifiers from the WC were also used for the pelagic classification: water column stability, productivity, and turbidity. At was used to assign classification for water column stability; surface chlorophyll was used to determine phytoplankton productivity; and euphotic depth was used to indicate the level of turbidity. Statistical analyses of the products compared to the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program in situ data indicated that the MODIS and hydrodynamic modeling products were consistently different from the in situ data; however, we believe the potential is strong for use of these standard products to enhance water column information. Use of the CMECS WC with appropriate modifiers captures all the significant pelagic environmental parameters which influence habitat and species distributions. Of the parameters evaluated, the sea-surface salinity and temperature, as expected, were most useful for making comparisons. Further research incorporating different types of data is necessary to explore the full potential of this approach. Specifically, resource managers would like to see the incorporation of sediment and bathymetry data. We believe addition of these data layers would result in more robust habitat maps and provide an innovative tool for resource managers.

A novel method to retrieve oceanic phytoplankton phenology from satellite data in the presence of data gaps	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Phytoplankton phenology is increasingly recognised as a key ecological indicator to characterise marine ecosystems. Existing methods to quantify phenology are often limited by gaps in the data record or by differences between the assumed and actual shapes of the seasonal cycle. A novel method to estimate phytoplankton phenology from satellite chlorophyll-a data is presented here, allowing us to determine the shape of the annual cycle from the data themselves, and to fill data gaps using data from the vicinity at a larger spatial scale. Up to two chlorophyll-a peaks (blooms) per annual cycle can be identified, and their timings and magnitudes estimated. The outputs are a set of time series with no data gaps at a succession of spatial scales, together with information at each scale about the climatological shape of the annual cycle, and the timing and magnitude of the principal and secondary blooms in each year. To illustrate the application of the algorithm we present the results from a 12 year time series of SeaWiFS data from 1998 to 2009 in the North Atlantic; the timings and magnitudes of blooms show strong spatial patterns, and hence are suitable for incorporation into the definitions of ecological provinces. Due to its generic nature, the handling of data gaps and the lack of reliance on a pre-defined seasonal cycle, the method has a wide range of other potential applications including land-based phenology and the study of the timing of seasonal sea ice cover.

Thus, CDOM reduces the radiation energy available to phytoplankton and affects remote-sensing signals. We present data from two cruises transecting the Polar Front from Atlantic to Arctic waters in the Barents Sea, in 2007 and 2008. The latter took place during the spring bloom of phytoplankton in May (0.2<[Chl a]<13 mg m(-3)) and the former during August (max. [Chl a]<2 mg m(-3)). Absorption by CDOM at 443 nm ranged from 0.004 to 0.080 m(-1) during May and from 0.006 to 0.162 m(-1) during August. Surprisingly, CDOM absorption differed little across the Polar Front, but was higher during August than during May (P<0.05). The slope coefficient of the absorption spectra (S) ranged from 0.008 to 0.036 nm(-1) (mean = 0.015 nm(-1)) including both cruises, and varied little across the Front (P>0.05). The CDOM remote sensing product from GlobColour correlated well with sampled data (R-2=0.73) during May. However, during August the satellite product performed poorly (R-2= 0.02) due to extensive scattering caused by coccolithophorids in the Atlantic Water. The CDOM pool was of autochthonous (marine) origin as characterized from its S vs. absorption relationship. Modeling showed that CDOM, on average, contributed equally to the light absorption as did phytoplankton (at 1 mg Chl a m(-3)), and thereby reduces the amount of light available for primary production.

J	He, XQ; Pan, DL; Bai, Y; Wang, DF; Hao, ZZ				He, Xianqiang; Pan, Delu; Bai, Yan; Wang, Difeng; Hao, Zengzhou			A new simple concept for ocean colour remote sensing using parallel polarisation radiance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Ocean colour remote sensing has supported research on subjects ranging from marine ecosystems to climate change for almost 35 years. However, as the framework for ocean colour remote sensing is based on the radiation intensity at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA), the polarisation of the radiation, which contains additional information on atmospheric and water optical properties, has largely been neglected. In this study, we propose a new simple concept to ocean colour remote sensing that uses parallel polarisation radiance (PPR) instead of the traditional radiation intensity. Weuse vector radiative transfer simulation and polarimetric satellite sensing data to demonstrate that using PPR has two significant advantages in that it effectively diminishes the sun glint contamination and enhances the ocean colour signal at the TOA. This concept may open new doors for ocean colour remote sensing. We suggest that the next generation of ocean colour sensors should measure PPR to enhance observational capability.

Conventional satellite remote sensing methods via spectra radiometers do not work in cloud-covered areas, and therefore cannot meet these demands for operational applications. We present a methodology for green macroalgae bloom detection based on RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Green macroalgae patches exhibit different polarimetric characteristics compared to the open ocean surface, in both the amplitude and phase domains of SAR-measured complex radar backscatter returns. In this study, new index factors are defined which have opposite signs in green macroalgae-covered areas, compared to the open water surface. These index factors enable unsupervised detection from SAR images, providing a high-resolution new tool for detection of green macroalgae blooms, which can potentially contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms related to outbreaks of green macroalgae blooms in coastal areas throughout the world ocean.

Since the 1960s, remote sensing has played an important role in characterizing the marine environment, with particular emphasis on sea surface features, temperature, and salinity; mapping of shorelines, wetlands, and coral reefs; local fisheries and species movements; tracking hurricanes, earthquakes, and coastal flooding; and changes in coastal upwelling and marine productivity. This chapter reviews marine applications of remote sensing worldwide, exploring contemporary satellite systems, research themes, and analytical methods. In the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, marine remote sensing has been limited to the use of large-scale daily image-gathering systems, such as CZCS, MODIS, SeaWiFS, and AVHRR, due to persistent cloud cover and constrained research budgets. Recent advances in satellite technology and availability, however, offer new opportunities for remote sensing in the Galapagos archipelago and beyond. Moderate-resolution sensors like SPOT and Landsat continue to be relevant for regional-scale evaluations of marine and coastal environments, identifying hotspots or focal areas for the use of more fine-grained imagery like QuickBird, WorldView-2, and aerial photographs. Radar systems like Aquarius and SAR show promise in new lines of oceanographic research, including sea surface salinity and the differentiation of mangrove subspecies. The use of ancillary or in situ data for calibration and validation of remotely-sensed image analysis can overcome the limitations of sensors used in bathymetric applications, while advances in cellular and GPS technology facilitate real-time reporting from citizen scientists for integrated monitoring of environmental and social change.																	2195-1055		978-3-319-02769-2; 978-3-319-02768-5				2014							109	136		10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2_6	10.1007/978-3-319-02769-2							WOS:000364124700008

This may form the baseline against which future changes can be measured. Measurements of SST also serve as an entry point to characterize the water dynamics along the African coast and to understand where and when changes have taken place, such that possible short-to medium term scenarios can be developed and used as management tools for precautionary measures. Significant advances in TIR technology have been achieved to build the necessary confidence in satellite-based SST measurements for research, as well as for operational and commercial purposes. An effective dissemination of these EO value added products to African institutions and policy-makers is a key condition for long-term sustainability of coastal and marine resources. The chapter presents a variety of applications using TIR images and SST data that have contributed to develop the necessary knowledge and competences that are critical for the implementation of conservation and management strategies at continental, regional and national scales.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							55	73		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_3	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100004

While radar altimeter data are mainly used as input for general ocean circulation models and for wind and global wave forecast, scatterometer and SAR data are well suited to investigate singular events in the marine boundary layer and in the ocean. Examples of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena observed by scatterometers and SARs over African coastal waters are presented. Concerning atmospheric phenomena, first near-surface wind fields derived from scatterometer data acquired over a cylone in the Mozambique Channel and over a wind front west of Morocco are presented. Then SAR images showing sea surface signatures of an atmospheric front, atmospheric gravity waves and a wind jet are presented. Quantitative information on the near-surface wind field is derived from two of the four SAR images shown. Concerning oceanic phenomena, three SAR images are presented. The first two SAR images show sea surface signatures of internal waves generated in the Strait of Gibraltar and at the Atlantic shelf west of Morocco and the third one shows sea surface signatures of biogenic surface films in the upwelling region off the coast of Senegal.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							75	94		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_4	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100005						
B	Ohde, T; Siegel, H		Barale, V; Gade, M		Ohde, Thomas; Siegel, Herbert			Impacts of Saharan Dust on the Marine Environment in the Area off Northwest Africa	REMOTE SENSING OF THE AFRICAN SEAS												The main sources of nutrient supply in the area off Northwest Africa are upwelling and Saharan dust deposition. Their influence on phytoplankton development was evaluated by different methods. Statistical analyses showed that along shore wind stress and induced upwelling were most significantly responsible for surface Chl-a variability mainly in winter and spring with delay of up to 16 days. Only 5% of the Chl-a variability was related to the dust input. All strong Saharan dust storms between 2000 and 2008 were identified by remote sensed dust aerosol optical depth. Only some of the events caused a biological response expressed by an increase of surface chlorophyll-a. Time lags between dust deposition and enhancement of chlorophyll-a between 8 and 16 days were determined. The chlorophyll-a concentration was increased up to 2.4 mg m(-3). Atmospheric dust modifies the amount and spectral distribution of the water light field. In the applied optical model the dust effect on incident solar radiation was parameterized by radiation measurements. The photosynthetically active radiation was reduced up to 19.3% in the upper water column. The impacts of spectral effects on photosynthetically active radiation were different in oceanic and coastal regions. A compensation of the spectral effects at water depths of about 7 m was only observed in ocean regions because of different light attenuation in coastal areas. Saharan dust also impacts satellite derived ocean surface wind speeds. The influence depended mainly on the strength of dust storms, the microwave frequency and the wind speed. The impact was higher for stronger dust storms, higher frequencies and lower wind speeds.

A 5-year (2003-2007) series of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) images was chosen to identify (spectrally) the major constituents of coastal waters under the influence of river discharges. The percent contributions of yellow substance, i.e. coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-like pigments of phytoplankton (CHL) and suspended detritus (DET) to the total reflectance (approximated by the sum of reflectances at 443, 555 and 670 nm) were calculated. Ternary plots of these percentages provided some general indications about the relative proportions of CDOM, CHL and DET, according to the impact attributed to each water constituent. The analysis showed that water constituents follow trends linked to the "marine" seasons of the area. The CHL and DET contributions seem to correlate with the timing of cooler (upwelling) periods, while CDOM seems to correlate better with that of warmer periods. The relationship with the Sassandra river runoff is not as evident, even though CDOM increased contributions appear to mirror the weakening of upwelling and the discharge of local rivers. This broad ecosystem outline should be extended to the entire Cote d'Ivoire coastline, to better classify marine waters impacted by upwelling processes or anthropogenic pollution due to river runoff.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							135	148		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_7	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100008

In regions that include both developed and developing countries, coral reefs and the services they provide are critical for the livelihoods, economies and well being of local communities, while they are at risk due to both anthropogenic and natural threats. Coral reefs also offer to scientific research a unique array of ecological and geological processes specific to these regions. Both applied and fundamental aspects motivate conservation and management projects. Satellite and airborne remote sensing has contributed to scientific and management projects with a variety of sensors and products, including some of the earliest coral reef applications worldwide 30 years ago. High spatial resolution geomorphology, bathymetry and habitat maps provide a biophysical description of the reefs themselves. Oceanic fields, such as sea surface temperature regime and their anomalies, quantify how coral reefs are exposed to weather and climate forcing. The combined local and large scale spatial information help understand how coral reefs status and processes vary across space and time. In particular, data products are increasingly combined to map the resilience of coral reef and associated habitats, and to design conservation plans at different spatial scales. However, both high-tech state-of-the-art and user-friendly remote sensing are still not used as systematically as it could be, while most countries still need basic spatial information consistent at national and international scales, such as habitat maps. Future applied developments will need to address these gaps in priority products. At the same time, on-going research will continue to refine local and regional products relevant for the science and the management of the Red Sea and the Western Indian Ocean coral reefs and their environments.																			978-94-017-8008-7; 978-94-017-8007-0				2014							317	335		10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7_16	10.1007/978-94-017-8008-7							WOS:000362071100017

The annual winter sea ice in the Bohai Bay has become a natural disaster which affects the port manipulation, shipping transportation severely. At present, the remote sensing technology has been very mature in sea ice monitoring. As one of the most important multispectral data source in China, HJ satellite data is commonly used in every aspect of marine, resources and environment. In this paper, we takes the HJ-1A/B CCD data as the data source to monitor the sea ice happened on Bohai bay west coast along Tianjin City in early 2010. By a standard technology method composed of data preprocessing, unsupervised classification, object-oriented classification, post-classification etc., we get the sea ice extraction results rapidly and accurately. By analyzing and contrasting the different period's results, we monitor and trend the sea ice growth which is accordant with the actual situation. The remote sensing image of HJ-1A/B data with high time-space resolution can provide powerful technical support for the analysis of the real-time sea ice monitoring and it's meaningful for port construction and shipping transportation.																			978-1-4799-5835-1				2014							558	562										WOS:000361018900104						
S	Sinha, R		Kale, VS		Sinha, Rajiv			The Sambhar Lake: The Largest Saline Lake in Northwestern India	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF INDIA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											The Sambhar Lake is a playa (seasonal lake with a flat bottom) located at the eastern fringe of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan. For more than four decades, this lake has attracted enormous attention due to its hypersalinity. The hypotheses to explain the geological evolution of the Sambhar have ranged from marine connection, river blockage by dunes and tectonics. This chapter presents the current understanding of the evolution of the Sambhar based on modern tools such as remote sensing and GIS and geochemical data such as evaporite mineralogy, elemental chemistry and stable isotopes. Available data suggest that the Sambhar Lake basin evolved as a pull-apart (extensional) basin and was further extended by geomorphic processes such as deflation. The hypersalinity of the Sambhar brine is related to progressive evaporation of fresh water in a semi-arid climate and the necessary chemical inputs for a hypersaline brine are derived from the catchment rocks.

All of the positive and negative drivers of change of both natural and anthropogenic, within watershed and political boundaries play a role in the health and function of mangroves. As a result, they are among the most rapidly changing landscapes in the Americas; yet, the landscape scale dynamics are not well understood, difficult to measure in cloudy regions, and not operationally monitored at the global scale.

J	Ozsoy-Cicek, B				Ozsoy-Cicek, Burcu			OIL SPILL DETECTION FROM RADARSAT-1 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR IMAGERY AT NORTHERN ENTRY OF BOSPORUS STRAIT, TURKEY	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Shipping and maritime activities may cause a great amount of oil pollution on the sea surface; such as ship transportation, oil platforms and ports. There are some deterrent applications to provide cleaner and safer seas. Timely identification of extent and source of oil pollution is mandatory for mitigation of its impact and prosecution of the originator. One of the preferred instruments to detect and monitor oil pollution by maritime activities is space-borne active microwave remote sensing at a few 10 m spatial resolution as enabled independent of cloud cover and daylight conditions by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). It allows us to detect oil pollution at the sea surface over a region of a few 100 kilometers at a glance. It is possible to monitor near-real time, continuously or periodically for the region of interest. This and its cost effectiveness is a great advantage over air-borne surveillance activities. Prerequisites for successful oil-spill identification by SAR imagery is a sufficiently high wind speed (above 2 m/s), proper application of SAR image processing techniques, and a careful consideration of SAR imaging geometry and hydrodynamic modulation of the sea surface by oceanic phenomena. This study provides evidence about the widespread occurrence of oil spills in the Black Sea north of Bosporus Strait, Turkey. The preliminary results of an analysis of 12 RADARSAT-1 SAR ScanSAR Narrow images acquired during late summer and fall 2010 and 2012 underline the usefulness of SAR imagery for oil spill detection. Simple image enhancement techniques can permit to obtain information about the character of the oil spill. Application of such techniques is however limited by the environmental conditions and in particular the discrimination of oil spills from natural surface slicks requires additional data and/or more advanced techniques in accordance with published knowledge.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	11A					2909	2918										WOS:000349805500020

The sea ice in the Bohai Sea is a solid, liquid and gas-phase mixture composed of pure ice, brine pockets and bubbles, the density of which is mainly affected by the amount of brine pockets and bubbles. The more the contained brine pockets, the greater the sea ice density; the more the contained bubbles, the smaller the sea ice density. The reflectance spectrum in 350 similar to 2500 nm and density of sea ice of different thickness and ages were measured in the Liaodong Bay of the Bohai Sea during the glacial maximum in the winter of 2012-2013. According to the measured sea ice density and reflectance spectrum, the characteristic bands that can reflect the sea ice density variation were found, and the sea ice density spectrum index (SIDSI) of the sea ice in the Bohai Sea was constructed. The inversion model of sea ice density in the Bohai Sea which refers to the layer from surface to the depth of penetration by the light was proposed at last. The sea ice density in the Bohai Sea was estimated using the proposed model from Hyperion image which is a hyperspectral image. The results show that the error of the sea ice density inversion model is about 0.0004 g.cm(-3). The sea ice density can be estimated through hyperspectral remote sensing images, which provide the data support to the related marine science research and application.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-330-4				2014	9263								92632T	10.1117/12.2069159								WOS:000349892800057

The concentration of chlorophyll-a is a widely used indicator of phytoplankton abundance and eutrophication in marine aquatic systems. It is important to monitor the dynamic variation in the chlorophyll-a concentration of large areas and take effective measurements in a timely manner. The impact of the construction of the Dalian offshore airport artificial island on water quality was investigated by using HJ-1A/B-CCD satellite data regarding chlorophyll-a concentration at different time intervals. This study developed a satisfying regression model between the spectral reflection ratio and chlorophyll-a concentration based on HJ-1A/B-CCD satellite data and field data gathered from the Dalian offshore artificial island in China. The retrieval precision of the linear retrieval model for the third and fourth bands of the HJ-1A/B-CCD sensor was enough to objectively reveal the marine chlorophyll-a concentration distribution and its variation characteristics during the construction. The feasibility and effectiveness of using remote sensing to track and monitor marine environments affected by large-scale offshore artificial island construction were proved.																	2352-5401		978-94-62520-42-4				2014	5						1473	1476										WOS:000349473500332

In addition, from the marine environment elements of sea surface temperature(SST) and sea surface wind field, the growth and drift characteristic of U. Prolifera were studied based on MODIS thermal infrared channel SST data and Windsat wind field data. In May 2014, U. Prolifera accumulation areas were first found in central YS north of Subei Bank. With summer arrival, seawater temperature of ocean surface gradually increased in YS, It provided a more suitable environment for the growth of U. Prolifera. Due to the prevailing northerly winds in central and western YS, U. Prolifera advected to the coastal waters of Shandong Peninsula, and spread to the northeastward. In late June, it had a massive bloom and reached the maximum coverage in the northern YS. The U. Prolifera drift characteristic was confirmed by the analysis on SST and sea surface wind field, and the result shows that under the environment of suitable sea surface temperature, the driving force of the prevailing sea surface wind field might be the main reason of YS U.

REMOTELY SENSED TIME SERIES OF CHLOROPHYLL-alpha, TOTAL SUSPENDED MATTER AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE FOR MONITORING WATER QUALITY OF THERMAIKOS GULF (GREECE)	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												During the last decades, remote sensing has been accepted as a useful tool for monitoring marine and coastal environments. The most notable advantages of using satellite imagery are the detailed coverage of large areas at low cost, the ability to collect data repeatedly and nonintrusively, and the multispectral nature of the observations. The aim of this work was to assess the use of satellite images for creating a time series of water quality parameters in Thermaikos Gulf (Greece), a dynamic aquatic ecosystem. The specific objectives included the evaluation of the spatial and temporal distributions of the produced maps, and the evaluation of the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Using ENVISAT MERIS and Aqua MODIS satellite images, a time series of two hydrological years was put together for chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha), total suspended matter (TSM) and sea surface temperature (SST). The results show that the satellite images covered the study Site with some data gaps due to cloud coverage and orbit shift of the ENVISAT satellite. Comparisons show a very good correlation with measurements of samples taken in the field. The produced maps illustrate the spatial distribution of Chl-alpha and TSM, specifically, the maxima were observed on the plumes of the three major rivers and the minima in the open sea. The time series produced by the temporal interpolation may be adequate for monitoring the water quality parameters of the area on an operational basis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	10A					2636	2644										WOS:000349805300015

In addition to local rivers, a large proportion of the marine debris that washes up along the coastline of the Sea of Japan originates in neighboring countries. It is considered important to understand the flow of marine debris in the Sea of Japan for environmental research purposes and for international relations. This study describes the results of monitoring marine debris flows using multi-spectral satellite images. The small size of most marine debris means that it cannot be confirmed directly, even when using high spatial resolution satellite imagery. Thus, to extract candidate pixels containing possible marine debris, pixels with spectra that differ from those of the surrounding ocean and the wave crests were identified. As a first step towards monitoring marine debris, a method for identifying marine debris floating on the Sea of Japan has been proposed using two-dimensional scatter diagrams of satellite spectral bands.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								92611E	10.1117/12.2068835								WOS:000348837900034

The marine reflectance is then retrieved by subtraction. Variants and improvements have been made over the years to deal with non-null reflectance in the red and near infrared, a general situation in estuaries and the coastal zone, but the solutions proposed so far still suffer some limitations, due to uncertainties in marine reflectance modeling in the near infrared or difficulty to extrapolate the aerosol signal to the blue when using observations in the shortwave infrared (SWIR), a spectral range far from the ocean-color wavelengths. To estimate the marine signal (i. e., the product of marine reflectance and atmospheric transmittance) in the near infrared, the proposed approach is to decompose the aerosol reflectance in the near infrared to shortwave infrared into principal components. Since aerosol scattering is smooth spectrally, a few components are generally sufficient to represent the perturbing signal, i.e., the aerosol reflectance in the near infrared can be determined from measurements in the shortwave infrared where the ocean is black. This gives access to the marine signal in the near infrared, which can then be used in the classic atmospheric correction algorithm. The methodology is evaluated theoretically from simulations of the top-of-atmosphere reflectance for a wide range of geophysical conditions and angular geometries and applied to actual MODIS imagery acquired over the Gulf of Mexico. The number of discarded pixels is reduced by over 80% using the PC modeling to determine the marine signal in the near infrared prior to applying the classic atmospheric correction algorithm.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								926117	10.1117/12.2074009								WOS:000348837900027

The New Caledonia lagoon lies in the Southwestern Tropical Pacific around 21 degrees 30' S and 166 degrees 30' E, with a great marine biodiversity in UNESCO Heritage coral reefs, benthic sea grass, and benthic communities. They are largely connected to the open ocean in the southern and eastern parts, but only by narrow passes in the southwest part. The trophic state is linked to spatial variations in flushing times. High run offs due to rain carrying abundant chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and particle loads may greatly impact the functioning of ecosystems while rivers and sewage effluents may induce localized impacts. Two oceanographic cruises (CALIOPE 1 in 2011 and CALIOPE 2 in 2014) were carried out off the Eastern Coast of New Caledonia during a calm dry period and during high winds, respectively. Multi-and hyper-spectral marine reflectance was measured with a SIMBADA instrument and a TRIOS radiometer system, together with inherent optical properties (total and CDOM absorption coefficients with a PSICAM, in situ absorption and scattering with an AC9, backscattering with a Hydroscat-6). Fluorescence of CDOM (EEM/PARAFAC) was measured on collected 0.2 mu m filtered samples. In 2014, Satlantic and FieldSpec hyper-spectral radiometers were available for in-water profiling of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance and above-water reflectance measurements, respectively. Inherent and apparent optical data from the two cruises are compared and used to estimate ocean color algorithms performance and evaluate a Linear Matrix Inversion method, providing tools for remote sensing on this highly under-sampled coastal region of New Caledonia.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 92610M	10.1117/12.2073309								WOS:000348837900014

The atmospheric "path" reflectance, due to scattering by molecules, aerosols, and droplets, absorption by aerosols, and reflection by the surface, including coupling terms, is modeled by a polynomial with three terms, i.e., three unknown coefficients. The marine reflectance is modeled as a function of chlorophyll concentration and a backscattering coefficient that accounts for scattering by non-algal particles (or deviation from the backscattering coefficient specified for typical phytoplankton), i.e., two additional unknown variables. The cloud transmittance, assumed constant spectrally, is estimated separately from top-of-atmosphere reflectance in the near infrared. The five unknowns are retrieved by an iterative, spectral matching scheme. The methodology, including the decomposition of the top-of-atmosphere signal and the modeling of the path reflectance, is evaluated theoretically and applied to actual MODIS imagery acquired over relatively thin clouds. Chlorophyll concentration is retrieved adequately under the clouds, and continuity is good between the cloudy and adjacent clear regions. Values are similar to those obtained with the SeaDAS algorithm in clear sky conditions, but cloud coverage is increased considerably. The algorithm is applicable operationally, but needs to be further evaluated in varied cloudy situations.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 926108	10.1117/12.2074008								WOS:000348837900007

Automatic Detection of Marine Surfactants by MODIS Sunglint Imagery: A Study Case of Biogenic Films off the Southeastern Coast of Brazil	OCEAN REMOTE SENSING AND MONITORING FROM SPACE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Ocean Remote Sensing and Monitoring from Space	OCT 15-16, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	SPIE, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm, Minist Earth Sci				Global monitoring of marine surfactants is important for understanding the heat, particle, momentum, and gas exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere. Observing the sunglint, i.e., the specular reflection between Sun, sea surface, and sensor, which intensity depends on the geometry of acquisition, has the potential to improve surfactants detection. The basis of the approach is that surfactants modify surface roughness, therefore the probability distribution of observing reflection by wave facets in the sensor field-of-view. An automatic method to detect surfactants from optical imagery under Sun glint conditions is presented. The method consists in comparing modeled normalized radiance (for clean water and surfactant contaminated water) with observed values. Application to MODIS imagery acquired off the Southwest Coast of Brazil in January 2003 demonstrates the method's feasibility, revealing the presence of biogenic films formed by Trichodesmium colonies. The presence of the N-2 fixing cyanobacteria was verified independently from in-situ measurements and ocean color remote sensing. An advantage of the glint-based method over detection methods using SAR imagery is the good spatial resolution (250 m) and the capability to detect surfactants at low wind speeds (< 2 m/s), impractical to SAR sensors due to the absence of Bragg scattering. Discriminating the type of surfactant, i.e., biogenic versus mineral, requires additional information, such as spectral marine reflectance.

Monitoring of the Ulva prolifera by remote sensing technology has the advantages of wide coverage, rapidness, low cost and dynamic monitoring over a long period of time. The GF-1 satellite was launched in April 2013, which provides a new suitable remote sensing data source for monitoring the Ulva prolifera. At present, segmenting image with a threshold is the most widely used method in Ulva prolifera extraction by remote sensing data, because it is simple and easy to operate. However, the threshold value is obtained through visual analysis or using a fixed statistical value, and could not be got automatically. Facing this problem, we proposed a new method, which can obtain the segmentation threshold automatically based on the local maximum gradient value. This method adopted the average NDVI value of local maximum gradient points as the threshold, and could get an appropriate segmentation threshold automatically for each image. The preliminary results showed that this method works well in monitoring Ulva prolifera by GF-1 WFV data.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								UNSP 926104	10.1117/12.2068619								WOS:000348837900003

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi NPP, which has 22 spectral bands (from visible to infrared) similar to the NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), is a multi-disciplinary sensor providing observations for the Earth's atmosphere, land, and ocean properties. In this paper, we provide some evaluations and assessments of VIIRS ocean color data products, or ocean color Environmental Data Records (EDR), including normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda) at VIIRS five spectral bands, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm K-d(490). Specifically, VIIRS ocean color products derived from the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (NOAA-MSL12) ocean color data processing system are evaluated and compared with MODIS ocean color products and in situ measurements. MSL12 is now NOAA's official ocean color data processing system for VIIRS. In addition, VIIRS Sensor Data Records (SDR or Level-1B data) have been evaluated. In particular, VIIRS SDR and ocean color EDR have been compared with a series of in situ data from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) in the waters off Hawaii. A notable discrepancy of global deep water Chl-a derived from MODIS and VIIRS between 2012 and 2013 is observed. This discrepancy is attributed to the SDR (or Level-1B data) calibration issue and particularly related to VIIRS green band at 551 nm. To resolve this calibration issue, we have worked on our own sensor calibration by combining the lunar calibration effect into the current calibration method. The ocean color products derived from our new calibrated SDR in the South Pacific Gyre show that the Chl-a differences between 2012 and 2013 are significantly reduced. Although there are still some issues, our results show that VIIRS is capable of providing high-quality global ocean color products in support of science research and operational applications.

NOAA-SeaDAS inherited all the original functionalities of SeaDAS 6.4 and was upgraded with many new functions and new sensor supports, particularly the support of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP). The main goal of the NOAA-SeaDAS development is primarily in support of NOAA ocean color team's calibration and validation activities. The current version of NOAA-SeaDAS can visualize, analyze, and process VIIRS Sensor Data Records (SDR or Level-1B data) produced by the NOAA Interface Data Processing System (IDPS), ocean color Environmental Data Records (EDR or Level-2 data) produced by the NOAA Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, and Level-3 data binned or mapped from Level-2 data produced by NOAA-MSL12. NOAA-SeaDAS is currently serving an active IDL user group at NOAA and will serve other institutions and universities in the future. The goal is to allow various scientific users to visualize, analyze, and process VIIRS data from Level-1B through Level-2 and Level-3. In addition, NOAA-SeaDAS can also visualize satellite images from the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), as well as many other satellite ocean color sensors, e. g., SeaWiFS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), etc. NOAA-SeaDAS is under constant development to create new system functionalities and enhance user experience. With constantly increasing volume in the global ocean color data archive, NOAA-SeaDAS will play an important role in support of global marine environment data analysis and various scientific applications.

The traditional sampling method is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but also limited in terms of temporal and spatial coverage, while remote sensing technology can deal with these limitations. In this study, models estimating SDD have been proposed based on the regression analysis between the HJ-1 satellite CCD image and synchronous in situ water quality measurements. The results illustrate the band ratio model of B3/B1 of CCD could be used to estimate Secchi depth in this region, with the mean relative error (MRE) of 8.6% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1 m, respectively. This model has been applied to one image of HJ-1 satellite CCD, generating water transparency on June 23, 2009, which will be of immense value for environmental monitoring. In addition, SDD was deeper in offshore waters than in inshore waters. River runoffs, hydrodynamic environments, and marine aquaculture are the main factors influencing SDD in this area.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-328-1				2014	9261								92611A	10.1117/12.2066806								WOS:000348837900030

In recent years, along with the changing of global climate, the sea ice situation becomes too critical. The monitoring of sea ice is playing a very important role in keeping human life and properties in safety, and undertaking of marine scientific research. The methods to monitor sea ice mainly include: first, shore observation; second, icebreaker monitoring; third, satellite remote sensing; and then aerial remote sensing monitoring. The marine station staffs use relevant equipments to monitor the sea ice in the shore observation. The icebreaker monitoring means: the workers complete the test of the properties of sea ice, such as density, salinity and mechanical properties. MODIS data and NOAA data are processed to get sea ice charts in the satellite remote sensing means. Besides, artificial visual monitoring method and some airborne remote sensors are adopted in the aerial remote sensing to monitor sea ice. Aerial remote sensing is an important means in sea ice monitoring because of its strong maneuverability, wide watching scale, and high resolution. In this paper, several methods in the sea ice monitoring using aerial remote sensing technology are discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-385-4				2014	9299								UNSP 929903	10.1117/12.2066434								WOS:000349376400003

Spring bloom community change modifies carbon pathways and C: N: P : Chl a stoichiometry of coastal material fluxes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Diatoms and dinoflagellates are major bloomforming phytoplankton groups competing for resources in the oceans and coastal seas. Recent evidence suggests that their competition is significantly affected by climatic factors under ongoing change, modifying especially the conditions for cold-water, spring bloom communities in temperate and Arctic regions. We investigated the effects of phytoplankton community composition on spring bloom carbon flows and nutrient stoichiometry in multiyear mesocosm experiments. Comparison of differing communities showed that community structure significantly affected C accumulation parameters, with highest particulate organic carbon (POC) buildup and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release in diatom-dominated communities. In terms of inorganic nutrient drawdown and bloom accumulation phase, the dominating groups behaved as functional surrogates. Dominance patterns, however, significantly affected C : N: P : Chl a ratios over the whole bloom event: when diatoms were dominant, these ratios increased compared to dinoflagellate dominance or mixed communities. Diatom-dominated communities sequestered carbon up to 3.6-fold higher than the expectation based on the Redfield ratio, and 2-fold higher compared to dinoflagellate dominance. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental report of consequences of climatically driven shifts in phytoplankton dominance patterns for carbon sequestration and related biogeochemical cycles in coastal seas. Our results also highlight the need for remote sensing technologies with taxonomical resolution, as the C : Chl a ratio was strongly dependent on community composition and bloom stage. Climate-driven changes in phytoplankton dominance patterns will have far-reaching consequences for major biogeochemical cycles and need to be considered in climate change scenarios for marine systems.

The vicarious calibration coefficients are obtained by comparing measured and predicted top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance sampled under "favorable" scene conditions, i.e., oceanic areas with stable water optical properties, where situations of clear sky, low wind speed, and low aerosol content are frequent. In such situations, and under suitable geometry, the dominant contribution to the satellite signal in the visible is due to molecular (Rayleigh) scattering, which can be computed accurately. A sensitivity study performed for suitable calibration sites indicates that, using thresholds of 7 m/s for wind speed, 0.1 for aerosol optical thickness, 0.0005 for Sun glint reflectance, and 60 degrees for Sun and view zenith angles, the error on the TOA reflectance is 2.3% at 410.5 nm (M1), increasing to 4.5% at 671.4 nm (M5). The error budget is dominated by the effect of uncertainty on aerosol optical thickness at the longer wavelengths and on marine reflectance at the shorter wavelengths. Two methods are developed to compute the VIIRS reflectance. The first method (Method 1) consists in using for the region of interest environmental conditions obtained from ancillary data or climatology. The second method (Method 2) addresses the uncertainty in aerosol model and optical thickness by accounting for the aerosol content of the scene. Application of Method 1 to VIIRS data yields calibration coefficients that are site and air mass dependent, which is not satisfactory. This results from using climatology data to specify aerosol parameters. Method 2, which utilizes the measured VIIRS reflectance in the near infrared to estimate the aerosol reflectance, reduces substantially the site and angular geometry dependence of the calibration coefficients. Accuracy can be improved by better specifying the marine reflectance, estimating the aerosol model, and further stratifying the calibration data. The large number of realizations allows for absolute calibration of individual detectors, studies of angular dependence, linearity, and polarization sensitivity, which is not possible using vicarious techniques based on (too few) in situ measurements.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-245-1				2014	9218								UNSP 921806	10.1117/12.2069433								WOS:000348319500004						
J	Zheng, DS; Xiang, XQ; Tao, JH				Zheng Dongsheng; Xiang Xianquan; Tao Jianhua			Optimising the modelling of eutrophication for Bohai Bay based on the cellular automata - support vector machine method	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												With the development of marine economy, eutrophication has become one of the key issues in the marine environment. In this paper, a eutrophication model for Bohai Bay based on the cellular automata-support vector machine (CA-SVM) has been established by applying the soft computing approach with a large quantity of remote sensing data to the marine environment. In order to optimise the coupled model further, two main tasks have been done in this study. First, to choose reasonable influence factors as the input parameters of the model, nine series of training and simulation exercises were conducted based on nine different types of input parameter combinations. A reasonable input parameter combination was selected, and the eutrophication model (the basic model) was established by the comparative analysis of the simulation results. Second, according to Shelford's Law of Tolerance, an optimised model was developed. It is combined of nine special models and each model corresponds to a stage of sea surface temperature and the chlorophyll-a concentration, respectively. The comparison between the optimised model and the basic model indicated that prediction accuracy was improved by the optimised model. By this study, it can be observed this model could provide a scientific basis for the prediction and management of the aquatic environment of Bohai Bay.																	1464-7141	1465-1734					2014	16	5					1125	1141		10.2166/hydro.2014.098								WOS:000348519600010

Remote sensing and GIS for the modeling of persistent organic pollutant in the marine environment	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2014	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 24-25, 2014	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	SPIE				The characterization of the marine environment plays an important role in the understanding of the dynamics affecting the transport, fate and persistence (TFP) of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). This work is part of a project funded by the Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca. The aim of the project is the assessment of the TFP of POPs in the Mediterranean sea. The analysis will be carried out at regional-mesoscale (central Mediterranean), and at local spatial scale considering different Italian test sites (the Delta of the Po River, the Venice Lagoon and the estuary of the Rio Nocella). The first step of this work involves the implementation of GIS geodatabases for the definition of the input dataset. The geodatabases were populated with MERIS and MODIS level 2 and level 3 products of Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a), Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient (DAC), Particulate Inorganic Carbon (PIC), Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The spatial scale (central Mediterranean sea) and the reference system (Plate Carree projection) have been imposed as a constraint for the geodatabases. Four geodatabases have been implemented, two for MODIS and two for MERIS products with a monthly, seasonal and climatological temporal scale (2002 -2013). Here, we present a first application of a methodology aimed to identify vulnerable areas to POPs accumulation and persistence. The methodology allowed to assess the spatial distribution of the CHL-a in the central Mediterranean sea. The chlorophyll concentration is related to the amount of nutrients in the water and therefore provides an indicator of the potential presence of POPs. A pilot area of 300 x 200 km located in the North Adriatic sea has been initially considered. The seasonal and climatological MODIS and MERIS CHL-a variability were retrieved and compared with in-situ forcing parameters, i.e. Po River discharge rates and wind data. Study outlooks include a better accuracy of the distribution of the vulnerable areas achieved through the use of additional parameters (CDOM, SST, POC), and an assessment of the contribution of the contaminants by atmospheric dry deposition to the marine environment.

Aircraft surveillance uses predominantly Side-Looking-Airborne-Radar for visualization of the effect of oil to smoothen capillary waves. A set of near range sensors complements the remote sensing data available for the human operator to classify the detected features as "mineral oil", "natural phenomenon", "other substance" or "unknown" pollution. Today, as an add-on to aerial surveillance, the German Central Command of Maritime Emergencies uses the operational satellite service "CleanSeaNet" provided by the European Maritime Safety Agency: Radar satellite data is analyzed in near real time and alerts of potential pollution are sent out. Shortly after receiving the results, aircraft surveillance flights are started by the 3rd Naval Air Wing and the locations of the satellite alerts are checked. Thus, a combined system of satellite and aerial surveillance is in place. The German Federal Institute of Hydrology, BfG, has access to the data of the pollution events detected during these flights and the corresponding meta-data of flights and satellite images. In this work, a period of two years of this data is analyzed. The probability to detect pollutions is evaluated for (A) flight missions associated with satellite scenes, and (B) additional flights performed independently from satellite scenes. Thus, the influence of satellite alerts on the efficiency of aircraft monitoring is investigated. Coverage and coordination of the monitoring by aircraft and satellite are assessed and implications for the operational monitoring are discussed.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								92400B	10.1117/12.2065956								WOS:000348196100008

This work focuses on development of a multiband inversion algorithm that combines remote sensing reflectance measurements at several wavelengths in the blue, green and red for retrievals of the absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, color dissolved organic matter and non-algal particulates at 443nm as well as the particulate backscatter coefficient at 443nm. The algorithm was developed, using neural networks (NN), and was designed to use as input measurements on ocean color bands matching those of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The NN is trained on a simulated data set generated through a bio-optical model for a broad range of typical coastal water parameters. The NN was evaluated using several statistical indicators, initially on the simulated data-set, as well as on field data from the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set, NOMAD, and data from our own field campaigns in the Chesapeake Bay which represent well the range of water optical properties as well as chlorophyll concentrations in coastal regions. The algorithm was also finally applied on a satellite - in situ databases that were assembled for the Chesapeake Bay region using MODIS and VIIRS satellite data. These databases were created using in-situ chlorophyll concentrations routinely measured in different locations throughout Chesapeake Bay and satellite reflectance overpass data that coexist in time with these in-situ measurements. NN application on this data-sets suggests that the blue (412 and 443nm) satellite bands are erroneous. The NN which was assessed for retrievals from VIIRS using only the 486, 551 and 671 bands showed that retrievals that omitted the 671 nm band was the most effective, possibly indicating an inaccuracy in the VIIRS 671 band that needs to be further investigated.

This system is designed for investigating various processes and phenomena in the ocean and marine atmosphere using different types of satellite remotely sensed data. The STS system provides researchers with the possibilities to deal with the satellite remote sensing data as well as with the result of its analysis. The key feature of STS is the ability to work simultaneously with satellite information of different types. STS provides tools for joint analysis of different types of satellite data, as well as data of ground meteorological stations, cartographic data etc. This paper gives an overview of the system and data processing use cases. Some example cases are described including processing and joint analysis of various satellite data. The data from different sensors (obtained by Envisat ASAR, Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, Landsat-5 TM, Terra/Aqua MODIS as well as Hyperion and HICO hyperspectral data) was analyzed jointly for differentiation between different types of coastal waters, and for reconstruction of suspended matter distribution in the test areas of the Azov and Black Seas.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-303-8				2014	9240								92401C	10.1117/12.2067300								WOS:000348196100033

Estimates of iceberg submarine melting from high-resolution digital elevation models: application to Sermilik Fjord, East Greenland	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Observed increases in iceberg discharge from Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers over the past two decades have altered the freshwater flux from glacial fjords into surrounding ocean basins. Although variations in freshwater flux due to ice-sheet discharge change have been investigated on a broad scale, the distribution of the freshwater flux due to melting of calved glacier ice (i.e. icebergs) has not been examined. Logistical challenges to collecting in situ data in glacial fjords have so far prevented a detailed examination of freshwater fluxes arising from melting beneath the waterline (i.e. submarine melting). Here we demonstrate that submarine melting of icebergs can be quantified using repeat digital elevation models derived from very high-resolution stereo satellite images. Analysis of volume changes for icebergs in Sermilik Fjord, East Greenland, yield area-averaged submarine melt rates of similar to 0.39 m d(-1). These rates are in relatively good agreement with simulated winter melt rates along the submerged portion of the Helheim Glacier terminus, providing independent validation of the applied technique. Further, the volume flux of fresh water from iceberg melting scales with surface and submerged iceberg areas, which suggests that iceberg meltwater may be an important freshwater component in fjords with high iceberg concentrations and/or expansive ice melange.																	0022-1430	1727-5652					2014	60	224					1084	1092		10.3189/2014JoG14J085								WOS:000348275000006

The influence of the Guadalquivir River on the spatio-temporal variability of suspended solids and chlorophyll in the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz	MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE												This study examines the spatio-temporal variability of the turbidity plume and phytoplankton biomass (in terms of chlorophyll) in the marine region influenced by the Guadalquivir estuary using ocean colour images over a period of 11 years (20032013). The area of the turbidity plume was calculated using water-leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw555). Climatologic and monthly averages showed recurrent high nLw555 levels in winter and high chlorophyll in spring. Similar variability was confirmed by Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of 8-day composite images, illustrating the existence of different regions with similar behaviour. The first EOF mode explained 60.7% and 31% of the variability in nLw555 and chlorophyll, respectively, and was associated with enhanced Total Suspended Solids (TSS) in autumn-winter and phytoplankton blooms in winter-spring periods. The results confirmed that the development of the turbidity plume and subsequent phytoplankton blooms were strongly regulated by river discharges and precipitation. Indeed, inter-annual variation in nLw555 was consistent with changes in the large-scale climate index, the North Atlantic Oscillation, a proxy for regional rainfall patterns. In the case of phytoplankton biomass, the second EOF mode revealed differentiation between offshore and near shore areas, the latter characterized by delayed development of phytoplankton blooms due to light limitation by high TSS. This suggests that the stability of the water column, via its influence on phytoplankton light-limitation, also influenced the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton bloom events. The dynamics of the Guadalquivir estuary turbidity plume is a crucial factor for the pelagic ecosystem of the Eastern Gulf of Cadiz, governing phytoplankton productivity.

Search and detection of EFMD using remote sensing are very challenging and are looking for new break-through scientific approaches. Besides, the significant costs associated with these techniques implemented up to now make its worldwide spread prohibitive. The main focus of this Doctorate Thesis in Information Management is to create an automatic detection method for EFMD using distinct remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing techniques for EFMD have important applications to readily monitor illegal dumping and natural disaster outputs, and to improve rescues at sea. Moreover, marine management improvement can be easily attained not only from more efficient cost-effective EFMD detection and collection, but also from better understand the quantitative links between EFMD and marine systems health. Remote sensing technological development is other possible achievement associated with this type of research, principally vising ESA new satellites scheduled to be release in a near future.																	2166-0727						2014																		WOS:000346367800027

To be done accurately this requires clear sky conditions, i.e. all clouds need to be excluded or masked from the data prior to atmospheric correction. The standard cloud mask used routinely in the processing of NASA's global ocean colour data is based on a simple threshold applied to the Rayleigh-corrected top-of-atmosphere radiance. The threshold is kept purposefully low to ensure high quality processing at a global scale. As a consequence, the standard scheme can sometimes inadvertently mask extreme optical events such as intense blue-green algal (cyanobacteria) blooms in the Baltic Sea. These blooms have important ecological and environmental impacts on the basin and require appropriate monitoring. Therefore, an assessment of 5 existing cloud masking schemes that could provide valuable alternatives for the Baltic Sea was carried out by systematically testing their application to time series of SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS data. By applying them to a number of years of satellite data, temporal and spatial implications were analyzed and a new hybrid cloud mask was developed and similarly tested. The results indicate that, by replacing the standard cloud mask, an increase of an average of 22% in ocean coverage over the course of a seasonal cycle in the Baltic Sea may be possible. Major occurrences of intense blooms can be recovered whilst at the same time not introducing any significant extra cloud into the processing. The full inclusion of the cyanobacteria blooms, even their most intense manifestations, into Baltic data series allows a more comprehensive analysis of their spectral characteristics with powerful implications for their detection, monitoring, and interannual evolution.																			978-1-4799-5707-1				2014																		WOS:000346649800007

Sustainable use of marine resources requires effective monitoring and management of the world's fish stocks. Remote sensing techniques are being used to help manage fisheries at sustainable levels, while also guiding fishing fleets to locate fish schools more efficiently. Fish tend to aggregate in ocean areas that exhibit conditions favored by specific fish species. Some of the relevant oceanographic conditions, such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (productivity) and oceanic fronts, which strongly influence natural fluctuations of fish stocks, can be observed and measured by remote sensors on satellites and aircraft. The remotely sensed data are provided in near-real time to help fishermen save fuel and ship time during their search for fish; to modelers who produce fisheries forecasts; and to scientists who help develop strategies for sustainable fisheries management. This article describes how acoustic, optical and radar sensors on ships, satellites and aircraft are used with forecast models to improve the management and harvesting of fisheries resources.																			978-1-4799-5707-1				2014																		WOS:000346649800010

Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for investigating the absorption and backscattering coefficients in coastal waters. A simple semi-analytical algorithm (SAABS) was developed for estimating a(560) and b(b)(550) in the Bohai Sea from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images. Using field measurements, the SAABS model attained root-mean-square (RMS) values of 13.25% and 12.75% for a(560) and b(b)(550), respectively. The SAABS model was also used to retrieve a(560) and b(b)(550) from the MERIS image. The match-up analysis results indicate that the RMS values of a (560) and b(b)(550) retrievals are 18.75% and 17%, respectively. These findings suggested that if the atmospheric correction scheme is available, the SAABS model may be used for the quantitative monitoring of the absorption and backscattering coefficients in the Bohai Sea from the MERIS images.

The proposed and applied methodology includes four levels: data acquisition, dark spots detection, features extraction and dark spots classification for discrimination between oil spills and look-alikes. Level 1 contains the ENVISAT-ASAR wide swath mode data acquisition. Level 2 begins with a visual interpretation based on experience and a priori information concerning location, external information about weather conditions, differences in shape, and contrast to surroundings between oil spills and look-alikes, then filtering and segmentation. Level 3 contains extraction of features from the detected dark spots. Level 4 aim is to discriminate oil spills from look-alikes using the features extracted by means of object-based fuzzy classification. As a result, oil slicks are discriminated from look-alikes with an overall accuracy classification of 91% for oil slicks and 86% for look-alikes. Finally, to validate our results, the method has been tested by comparing the areas of the automatically detected oil spills (object-based fuzzy classification) with the areas of the manually detected oil spills (region of interest), by means of area ratios.																	0078-5466	1899-7015					2014	44	3					433	449		10.5277/oa140308								WOS:000345883500008

However, due to their predictable nature, these aggregations have always been vulnerable to overexploitation. This problem leads to the importance of identifying the exact time and location for reef fish spawning aggregation. Thus, this paper review a little bit about spawning aggregation of reef fish as well as their characteristics, and problems regarding this phenomena. The use of remote sensing in marine applications is also described here in order to discuss how remote sensing can be utilize to predict reef fish spawning aggregation. Based on the unique geomorphological characteristics of the spawning aggregation, remote sensing seems to be a powerful tool to determine their exact times and locations. It has been proved that satellite imagery was able to delineate specific reef geomorphologies such as shelf edges and reef promontories. Despite of the widely use of remote sensing in marine applications, in fact there are still lack of studies had been carried out regarding spawning aggregations of reef fish due to the skeptical point-of-view by certain researchers over the capability of this technique. However, there is actually no doubt that the use of remote sensing will provide a better hand to the authorities in order to establish a more effective monitoring and conservation plan for these spawning aggregations.																	1755-1307						2014	18								UNSP 012115	10.1088/1755-1315/18/1/012115								WOS:000345268900115

On direct passive microwave remote sensing of sea spray aerosol production	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study addresses and attempts to mitigate persistent uncertainty and scatter among existing approaches for determining the rate of sea spray aerosol production by breaking waves in the open ocean. The new approach proposed here utilizes passive microwave emissions from the ocean surface, which are known to be sensitive to surface roughness and foam. Direct, simultaneous, and collocated measurements of the aerosol production and microwave emissions were collected aboard the FLoating Instrument Platform (FLIP) in deep water similar to 150 km off the coast of California over a period of similar to 4 days. Vertical profiles of coarse-mode aerosol (0.25-23.5 mu m) concentrations were measured with a forward-scattering spectrometer and converted to surface flux using dry deposition and vertical gradient methods. Back-trajectory analysis of eastern North Pacific meteorology verified the clean marine origin of the sampled air mass over at least 5 days prior to measurements. Vertical and horizontal polarization surface brightness temperature were measured with a microwave radiometer at 10.7 GHz frequency. Data analysis revealed a strong sensitivity of the brightness temperature polarization difference to the rate of aerosol production. An existing model of microwave emission from the ocean surface was used to determine the empirical relationship and to attribute its underlying physical basis to microwave emissions from surface roughness and foam within active and passive phases of breaking waves. A possibility of and initial steps towards satellite retrievals of the sea spray aerosol production are briefly discussed in concluding remarks.

In this paper, the significant wave height (SWH) data measured by HY-2A satellite altimeter were compared with the data observed by Jason-1/2 satellite altimeter as well as the data measured by buoys. It was found that there was a standard deviation of 0.3-0.4 m between SWH obtained from HY-2A and buoys. The comparison indicated that there was a linear relationship between the data of HY-2A and buoys, which could be used to calibrate SWH measured by HY-2A to better reflect the real situation. Comparisons between calibrated HY-2A SWH data and Jason-1/2 SWH data show that the standard deviation reduced and HY-2A data work well with Jason-1/2 data.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-248-2				2014	9221								UNSP 92210B	10.1117/12.2060607								WOS:000344548600006

A mechanistic particle flux model applied to the oceanic phosphorus cycle	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The sinking and decomposition of particulate organic matter are critical processes in the ocean's biological pump, but are poorly understood and crudely represented in biogeochemical models. Here we present a mechanistic particle remineralization and sinking model (PRiSM) that solves the evolution of the particle size distribution with depth. The model can represent a wide range of particle flux profiles, depending on the surface particle size distribution, the relationships between particle size, mass and sinking velocity, and the rate of particle mass loss during decomposition. The particle flux model is embedded in a data-constrained ocean circulation and biogeochemical model with a simple P cycle. Surface particle size distributions are derived from satellite remote sensing, and the remaining uncertain parameters governing particle dynamics are tuned to achieve an optimal fit to the global distribution of phosphate. The resolution of spatially variable particle sizes has a significant effect on modeled organic matter production rates, increasing production in oligotrophic regions and decreasing production in eutrophic regions compared to a model that assumes spatially uniform particle sizes and sinking speeds. The mechanistic particle model can reproduce global nutrient distributions better than, and sediment trap fluxes as well as, other commonly used empirical formulas. However, these two independent data constraints cannot be simultaneously matched in a closed P budget commonly assumed in ocean models. Through a systematic addition of model processes, we show that the apparent discrepancy between particle flux and nutrient data can be resolved through P burial, but only if that burial is associated with a slowly decaying component of organic matter such as might be achieved through protection by ballast minerals. Moreover, the model solution that best matches both data sets requires a larger rate of P burial (and compensating inputs) than have been previously estimated. Our results imply a marine P inventory with a residence time of a few thousand years, similar to that of the dynamic N cycle.

By relaxing the constraints of the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) methodology for vicarious calibration of ocean color satellites and utilizing the Aerosol Robotic Network Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) system to provide in situ data, we investigated differences between remotely sensed water leaving radiance and the expected in situ response in coastal areas and compare the results to traditional Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) calibration/validation activities. An evaluation of the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP)-VIIRS ocean color products was performed in coastal waters using the time series data obtained from the Northern Gulf of Mexico AERONET-OC site, WaveCIS. The coastal site provides different water types with varying complexity of CDOM, sedimentary, and chlorophyll components. Time series data sets were used to develop a vicarious gain adjustment (VGA) at this site, which provides a regional top of the atmospheric (TOA) spectral offset to compare the standard MOBY spectral calibration gain in open ocean waters.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-048-8				2014	9111								UNSP 911114	10.1117/12.2053187								WOS:000343862700027

Especially, calibration and validation of ocean color satellite data relies on high quality in situ data. In addition, objective evaluation of satellite ocean color products need well quality controlled in situ data from various bio-optical environments covering diverse aquatic waters. The goal of ocean color satellite sensors is to remotely derive accurate normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nL(w)(lambda)), therefore other water biological and biogeochemical property data can be obtained using satellite-measured nL(w)(lambda) spectra. In this paper, we show results from analyzing in situ data processing procedure from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and NASA SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) used for satellite ocean color calibration and validation purposes. Various issues in determining final product of in situ radiometric data processing such as convolving nL(w)(lambda) with respect to satellite sensor spectral response functions, sensor effective band center wavelengths, and effects of Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are analyzed and discussed. Performance of satellite-derived nL(w)(lambda) taking into consideration of various issues in the in situ data processing is also assessed.

The site is of great archaeological importance since cape So-union served as a navigational landmark and a naval fortress protecting the sea-lanes towards the metropolis of Athens and the silver mines of Lavreotiki during the Classical and Hellenistic periods. Parts of the coastal ancient installations are now submerged. The results of the collected geophysical data include the examination of the seafloor texture and stratigraphy. Therefore a geomorphological map of the gulf was constructed based on the configuration of the substrate and the seafloor stratigraphy. Archaeological remains lying on the seafloor have been detected on the sonographs and have been correlated with the results of previous studies. The development and the evolution of the gulf during the prehistoric period were evaluated via the sea floor stratigraphy and the prediction of sea level change in the area based on the eustatic and glacio-hydro-isostatic response. The sea level change during the historic period was examined and a relative sea level rise of at least 2,5-3,0 m was suggested for the last 2500 years based on the marine geophysical survey results.

Remote sensing of cloud top pressure/height from SEVIRI: analysis of ten current retrieval algorithms	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The role of clouds remains the largest uncertainty in climate projections. They influence solar and thermal radiative transfer and the earth's water cycle. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate cloud observations to validate climate models and to monitor climate change. Passive satellite imagers measuring radiation at visible to thermal infrared (IR) wavelengths provide a wealth of information on cloud properties. Among others, the cloud top height (CTH) - a crucial parameter to estimate the thermal cloud radiative forcing - can be retrieved. In this paper we investigate the skill of ten current retrieval algorithms to estimate the CTH using observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). In the first part we compare ten SEVIRI cloud top pressure (CTP) data sets with each other. The SEVIRI algorithms catch the latitudinal variation of the CTP in a similar way. The agreement is better in the extratropics than in the tropics. In the tropics multi-layer clouds and thin cirrus layers complicate the CTP retrieval, whereas a good agreement among the algorithms is found for trade wind cumulus, marine stratocumulus and the optically thick cores of the deep convective system. In the second part of the paper the SEVIRI retrievals are compared to CTH observations from the Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) instruments. It is important to note that the different measurement techniques cause differences in the retrieved CTH data. SEVIRI measures a radiatively effective CTH, while the CTH of the active instruments is derived from the return time of the emitted radar or lidar signal. Therefore, some systematic differences are expected. On average the CTHs detected by the SEVIRI algorithms are 1.0 to 2.5 km lower than CALIOP observations, and the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the CALIOP data sets range between 0.77 and 0.90. The average CTHs derived by the SEVIRI algorithms are closer to the CPR measurements than to CALIOP measurements. The biases between SEVIRI and CPR retrievals range from -0.8 km to 0.6 km. The correlation coefficients of CPR and SEVIRI observations vary between 0.82 and 0.89. To discuss the origin of the CTH deviation, we investigate three cloud categories: optically thin and thick single layer as well as multi-layer clouds. For optically thick clouds the correlation coefficients between the SEVIRI and the reference data sets are usually above 0.95. For optically thin single layer clouds the correlation coefficients are still above 0.92. For this cloud category the SEVIRI algorithms yield CTHs that are lower than CALIOP and similar to CPR observations. Most challenging are the multi-layer clouds, where the correlation coefficients are for most algorithms between 0.6 and 0.8. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the SEVIRI retrievals for boundary layer clouds. While the CTH retrieval for this cloud type is relatively accurate, there are still considerable differences between the algorithms. These are related to the uncertainties and limited vertical resolution of the assumed temperature profiles in combination with the presence of temperature inversions, which lead to ambiguities in the CTH retrieval. Alternative approaches for the CTH retrieval of low clouds are discussed.

Cloud properties were drawn from data acquired both from in situ measurements with state of the art airborne instrumentation and from satellite products of the MODIS06 System. The used aircraft was ATMOSLAB - Airborne Laboratory for Environmental Atmospheric Research, property of the National Institute for Aerospace Research "Elie Carafoli" (INCAS), Bucharest, Romania, which is specially equipped for this kind of research. The main tool of the airborne laboratory is a Cloud, Aerosol and Precipitation Spectrometer-CAPS (30 bins, 0.51-50 mu m). The data was recorded during two flights during the winter 2013-2014, over a flat region in the south-eastern part of Romania (between Bucharest and Constanta). The analysis of cloud particle size variations and cloud liquid water content provided by CAPS can explain cloud processes, and can also indicate the extent of aerosols effects on clouds. The results, such as cloud coverage and/or cloud types, microphysical parameters of aerosols on the one side and the cloud microphysics parameters obtained from aircraft flights on the other side, was used to illustrate the importance of microphysics cloud properties for including the radiative effects of clouds in the regional climate models.

Typhoon can induce the increase of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in the up water, and introduce phytoplankton blooms in the different regions of the oceans in world. Typhoons can also have important contribution to the marine primary production. Many studies suggested that typhoons indeed contribute to local primary production and carbon fixation through nutrient pumping to the surface. Phytoplankton blooms in response to typhoons are closely related to their speeds and intensities, which must be considered when estimating primary production. Different classification of typhoons may have different influence on the marine ecology. The mechanisms of typhoon impacts on phytoplankton blooms and primary production were summarized at the end of the chapter.																			978-3-642-40695-9; 978-3-642-40694-2				2014	40						205	218		10.1007/978-3-642-40695-9_9	10.1007/978-3-642-40695-9							WOS:000338255800010

Advances in understanding and parameterization of small-scale physical processes in the marine Arctic climate system: a review	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Arctic climate system includes numerous highly interactive small-scale physical processes in the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. During and since the International Polar Year 2007-2009, significant advances have been made in understanding these processes. Here, these recent advances are reviewed, synthesized, and discussed. In atmospheric physics, the primary advances have been in cloud physics, radiative transfer, mesoscale cyclones, coastal, and fjordic processes as well as in boundary layer processes and surface fluxes. In sea ice and its snow cover, advances have been made in understanding of the surface albedo and its relationships with snow properties, the internal structure of sea ice, the heat and salt transfer in ice, the formation of superimposed ice and snow ice, and the small-scale dynamics of sea ice. For the ocean, significant advances have been related to exchange processes at the ice-ocean interface, diapycnal mixing, double-diffusive convection, tidal currents and diurnal resonance. Despite this recent progress, some of these small-scale physical processes are still not sufficiently understood: these include wave-turbulence interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the exchange of heat and salt at the ice-ocean interface, and the mechanical weakening of sea ice. Many other processes are reasonably well understood as stand-alone processes but the challenge is to understand their interactions with and impacts and feedbacks on other processes. Uncertainty in the parameterization of small-scale processes continues to be among the greatest challenges facing climate modelling, particularly in high latitudes. Further improvements in parameterization require new year-round field campaigns on the Arctic sea ice, closely combined with satellite remote sensing studies and numerical model experiments.

One year of ground-based aerosol remote sensing observations were carried out using sun-sky radiometer measurements in Zhoushan (122.1897E, 29.9944N), Zhejiang Province, Eastern China. At the same time column Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), asymmetry factor (g), complex refractive index and column aerosol volume spectral distribution were retrieved by mature code as well as some procedures, such as radiometer calibration, cloud screening and data selection strategies. Aerosol size parameters were separated as fine effective radius (r(vf)) and coarse effective radius (r(vc)) due to the column aerosol size distribution is generally bimodal lognormal distribution. The relationship between these parameters and effective radius was shown and analyzed. It is shown that aerosol in Zhoushan is urban-industrial type dominate, mixed with marine aerosol and mineral dust aerosol. As a result, this study showed a part of aerosol comes from mainland industrial areas by using the backward trajectory model.				li, zhengqiang/C-5678-2013; LI, Kaitao/O-2945-2015	li, zhengqiang/0000-0002-7795-3630; LI, Kaitao/0000-0002-2610-0064												1755-1307						2014	17								UNSP 012030	10.1088/1755-1315/17/1/012030								WOS:000341299300030

Extinction coefficient and normalized reflectance of oil are two important parts in this model. Extinction coefficient is an important inherent optical property and will not vary with the background reflectance changed. Normalized reflectance can be used to eliminate the background differences between in situ measured spectra and remotely sensing image. Therefore, marine oil slick thickness and area can be estimated and mapped based on optical remotely sensing image and extinction coefficient.																	1755-1307						2014	17								UNSP 012122	10.1088/1755-1315/17/1/012122								WOS:000341299300122

These stores are continually added to by new information, ideas and data, which are frequently revised. The geoscience record is in restrained by human thought and technology for handling information. Conventional methods strive, with limited success, to maintain geoscience records which are readily susceptible and renewable. The information system must adapt to the diversity of ideas and data in geoscience and their changes through time. In China, more than 400,000 types of important geological data are collected and produced in geological work during the last two decades, including oil, natural gas and marine data, mine exploration, geophysical, geochemical, remote sensing and important local geological survey and research reports. Numerous geospatial databases are formed and stored in National Geological Archives (NGA) with available formats of MapGIS, ArcGIS, ArcINFO, Metalfile, Raster, SQL Server, Access and JPEG. But there is no effective way to warrant that the quality of information is adequate in theory and practice for decision making The need for fast, reliable, accurate and up-to-date information by providing the Geographic Information System (GIS) communities are becoming insistent for all geoinformation producers and users in China Since 2010, a series of geoinformation projects have been carried out under the leadership of the Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR), including (1) Integration, update and maintenance of geoinformation databases; (2) Standards research on clusterization and industrialization of information services; (3) Platform construction of geological data sharing; (4) Construction of key borehole databases; (5) Product development of information services. "Nine-System" of the basic framework has been proposed for the development and improvement of the geospatial data infrastructure, which are focused on the construction of the cluster organization, cluster service, convergence, database, product, policy, technology, standard and infrastructure systems.

Object-oriented spatial-temporal association rules mining on ocean remote sensing imagery	35TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT (ISRSE35)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				35th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment (ISRSE35)	APR 22-26, 2013	Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chinese Acad Sci, Int Ctr Remote Sensing Environm, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Grp Earth Observat, Int Soc Digital Earth, Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Remote Sensing Ctr China, LDE, REIS, LIESMARS, State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science	Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth			Using the long term marine remote sensing imagery, we develop an object-oriented spatial-temporal association rules mining framework to explore the association rules mining among marine environmental elements. Within the framework, two key issues are addressed. They are how to effectively deal with the related lattices and how to reduce the related dimensions? To deal with the first key issues, this paper develops an object-oriented method for abstracting marine sensitive objects from raster pixels and for representing them with a quadruple. To deal with the second key issues, by embedding the mutual information theory, we construct the direct association pattern tree to reduce the related elements at the first step, and then the Apriori algorithm is used to discover the spatio-temporal associated rules. Finally, Pacific Ocean is taken as a research area and multi-marine remote sensing imagery in recent three decades is used as a case study. The results show that the object-oriented spatio-temporal association rules mining can acquire the associated relationships not only among marine environmental elements in same region, also among the different regions. In addition, the information from association rules mining is much more expressive and informative in space and time than traditional spatio-temporal analysis.																	1755-1307						2014	17								012109	10.1088/1755-1315/17/1/012109								WOS:000341299300109

Based on canonical correlation analysis, this method takes the multiple correlation coefficient as a standard to measure the correlation of three factors, separates the linear correlation mode according to the principle of maximum correlation. This method is applied to a 144-month ocean remote sensing data in North Pacific, the first canonical correlation mode indicates sea surface wind over 0-10 degrees N, 160 degrees E-180 degrees E, precipitation over 0 degrees N-5 degrees N and SST over 0 degrees-15 degrees N, 170 degrees E-150 degrees W have the most significant correlation, and the correlation coefficients are greater than 0.8. Anomalies in these regions are similar to anomalies ENSO caused. This method can reduce calculation times from three to one, and avoid ignoring the influence of the third ocean factor in present conjoint analysis, which makes results of this method closer to the ocean phenomenon.

Ocean colour remote sensing in the southern Laptev Sea: evaluation and applications	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Enhanced permafrost warming and increased Arctic river discharges have heightened concern about the input of terrigenous matter into Arctic coastal waters. We used optical operational satellite data from the ocean colour sensor MERIS (Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) aboard the ENVISAT satellite mission for synoptic monitoring of the pathways of terrigenous matter on the shallow Laptev Sea shelf. Despite the high cloud coverage in summer that is inherent to this Arctic region, time series from MERIS satellite data from 2006 on to 2011 could be acquired and were processed using the Case-2 Regional Processor (C2R) for optically complex surface waters installed in the open-source software ESA BEAM-VISAT. Since optical remote sensing using ocean colour satellite data has seen little application in Siberian Arctic coastal and shelf waters, we assess the applicability of the calculated MERIS C2R parameters with surface water sampling data from the Russian-German ship expeditions LENA2008, LENA2010 and TRANSDRIFT-XVII taking place in August 2008 and August and September 2010 in the southern Laptev Sea. The shallow Siberian shelf waters are optically not comparable to the deeper, more transparent waters of the Arctic Ocean. The inner-shelf waters are characterized by low transparencies, due to turbid river water input, terrestrial input by coastal erosion, resuspension events and, therefore, high background concentrations of suspended particulate matter and coloured dissolved organic matter. We compared the field-based measurements with the satellite data that are closest in time. The match-up analyses related to LENA2008 and LENA2010 expedition data show the technical limits of matching in optically highly heterogeneous and dynamic shallow inner-shelf waters. The matchup analyses using the data from the marine TRANSDRIFT expedition were constrained by several days' difference between a match-up pair of satellite-derived and in situ parameters but are also based on the more stable hydrodynamic conditions of the deeper inner-and the outer-shelf waters. The relationship of satellite-derived turbidity-related parameters versus in situ suspended matter from TRANSDRIFT data shows that the backscattering coefficient C2R_bb_spm can be used to derive a Laptev-Sea-adapted SPM algorithm. Satellite-derived Chl a estimates are highly overestimated by a minimum factor of 10 if applied to the inner-shelf region due to elevated concentrations of terrestrial organic matter. To evaluate the applicability of ocean colour remote sensing, we include the visual analysis of lateral hydrographical features. The mapped turbidity-related MERIS C2R parameters show that the Laptev Sea is dominated by resuspension above submarine shallow banks and by frontal instabilities such as frontal meanders with amplitudes up to 30 km and eddies and filaments with horizontal scales up to 100 km that prevail throughout the sea-ice-free season. The widespread turbidity above submarine shallow banks indicates inner-shelf vertical mixing that seems frequently to reach down to submarine depths of a minimum of 10 m. The resuspension events and the frontal meanders, filaments and eddies indicate enhanced vertical mixing being widespread on the inner shelf. It is a new finding for the Laptev Sea that numerous frontal instabilities are made visible, and how highly time-dependent and turbulent the Laptev Sea shelf is. The meanders, filaments and eddies revealed by the ocean colour parameters indicate the lateral transportation pathways of terrestrial and living biological material in surface waters.

There were five classes in the study site: natural forest, Melaleuca forest, agriculture, peat and built-up areas. Agricultural land and Melaleuca forest changing into built-up areas constituted approximately 51.13% of the total area changing. The benthic seagrass habitat increased dramatically from 2001 to the end of 2010. Besides, marine culture has been concerned to cage culture which is one of the sources directly affecting aquatic life and water quality in coastal environment. Cage culture locations were detected using high-resolution imagery as THEOS data for image fusion and Object-based Image Analysis methods. Water quality criteria including nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined by interpolation method, and the spatial distribution of these parameters showed a concentration in the study area in the range from 0.17 to 0.49 mg/L, 0.012 to 0.073 mg/L and 0.26 to 1.046 g/L, respectively.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2014	29	5					486	506		10.1080/10106049.2013.798358								WOS:000340104200003						
J	Narvekar, J; Kumar, SP				Narvekar, J.; Kumar, S. Prasanna			Mixed layer variability and chlorophyll a biomass in the Bay of Bengal	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The mixed layer is the most variable and dynamically active part of the marine environment that couples the underlying ocean to the atmosphere and plays an important role in determining the oceanic primary productivity. We examined the basin-scale processes controlling the seasonal variability of mixed layer depth in the Bay of Bengal and its association with chlorophyll using a suite of in situ as well as remote sensing data. A coupling between mixed layer depth and chlorophyll was seen during spring intermonsoon and summer monsoon, but for different reasons. In spring intermonsoon the temperature-dominated stratification and associated shallow mixed layer makes the upper waters of the Bay of Bengal nutrient depleted and oligotrophic. In summer, although the salinity-dominated stratification in the northern Bay of Bengal shallows the mixed layer, the nutrient input from adjoining rivers enhance the surface chlorophyll. This enhancement is confined only to the surface layer and with increase in depth, the chlorophyll biomass decreases rapidly due to reduction in sunlight by suspended sediment. In the south, advection of high salinity waters from the Arabian Sea and westward propagating Rossby waves from the eastern Bay of Bengal led to the formation of deep mixed layer. In contrast, in the Indo-Sri Lanka region, the shallow mixed layer and nutrient enrichment driven by upwelling and Ekman pumping resulted in chlorophyll enhancement. The mismatch between the nitrate and chlorophyll indicated the inadequacy of present data to fully unravel its coupling to mixed layer processes.																	1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	14					3819	3843		10.5194/bg-11-3819-2014								WOS:000339895600007

Aerosol light-scattering enhancement due to water uptake during the TCAP campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Aerosol optical properties were measured by the DOE/ARM (US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurements) Program Mobile Facility during the Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP) campaign deployed at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, for a 1-year period (from summer 2012 to summer 2013). Measured optical properties included aerosol light-absorption coefficient (sigma(ap)) at low relative humidity (RH) and aerosol light-scattering coefficient (sigma(sp)) at low and at RH values varying from 30 to 85 %, approximately. Calculated variables included the single scattering albedo (SSA), the scattering Angstrom exponent (SAE) and the scattering enhancement factor (f(RH)). Over the period of measurement, f (RH=80 %) had a mean value of 1.9 +/- 0.3 and 1.8 +/- 0.4 in the PM10 and PM1 fractions, respectively. Higher f (RH=80 %) values were observed for wind directions from 0 to 180 degrees (marine sector) together with high SSA and low SAE values. The wind sector from 225 to 315 degrees was identified as an anthropogenically influenced sector, and it was characterized by smaller, darker and less hygroscopic aerosols. For the marine sector, f (RH=80 %) was 2.2 compared with a value of 1.8 obtained for the anthropogenically influenced sector. The air-mass backward trajectory analysis agreed well with the wind sector analysis. It shows low cluster to cluster variability except for air masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean that showed higher hygroscopicity. Knowledge of the effect of RH on aerosol optical properties is of great importance for climate forcing calculations and for comparison of in situ measurements with satellite and remote sensing retrievals. In this sense, predictive capability of f (RH) for use in climate models would be enhanced if other aerosol parameters could be used as proxies to estimate hygroscopic growth. Toward this goal, we propose an exponential equation that successfully estimates aerosol hygroscopicity as a function of SSA at Cape Cod. Further work is needed to determine if the equation obtained is valid in other environments.

Absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter of the eastern Bering Sea in the summer with special reference to the influence of a cold pool	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The absorption and fluorescence properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are reported for the inner shelf, slope waters and outer shelf regions of the eastern Bering Sea during the summer of 2008, when a warm, thermally stratified surface mixed layer lay over a cold pool (< 2 degrees C) that occupied the entire middle shelf. CDOM absorption at 355 nm (a(g)355) and its spectral slope (S) in conjunction with excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) revealed large variability in the characteristics of CDOM in different regions of the Bering Sea. PARAFAC analysis aided in the identification of three humic-like (components one, two and five) and two protein-like (a tyrosine-like component three, and a tryptophan-like component four) components. In the extensive shelf region, average absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(g)355, m(-1)) and DOC concentrations (mu M) were highest in the inner shelf (0.342 +/- 0.11 m(-1), 92.67 +/- 14.60 mu M) and lower in the middle (0.226 +/- 0.05 m(-1), 78.38 +/- 10.64 mu M) and outer (0.185 +/- 0.05 m(-1), 79.24 +/- 18.01 mu M) shelves, respectively. DOC concentrations, however were not significantly different, suggesting CDOM sources and sinks to be uncoupled from DOC. Mean spectral slopes S were elevated in the middle shelf (24.38 +/- 2.25 mu m(-1)) especially in the surface waters (26.87 +/- 2.39 mu m(-1)) indicating high rates of photodegradation in the highly stratified surface mixed layer, which intensified northwards in the northern middle shelf likely contributing to greater light penetration and to phytoplankton blooms at deeper depths. The fluorescent humic-like components one, two, and five were most elevated in the inner shelf most likely from riverine inputs. Along the productive "green belt" in the outer shelf/slope region, absorption and fluorescence properties indicated the presence of fresh and degraded autochthonous DOM. Near the Unimak Pass region of the Aleutian Islands, low DOC and a(g)355 (mean 66.99 +/- 7.94 mu M; 0.182 +/- 0.05 m(-1)) and a high S (mean 25.95 +/- 1.58 mu m(-1)) suggested substantial photobleaching of the Alaska Coastal Water, but high intensities of humic-like and protein-like fluorescence suggested sources of fluorescent DOM from coastal runoff and glacier meltwaters during the summer. The spectral slope S vs. a(g)355 relationship revealed terrestrial and oceanic end members along with intermediate water masses that were modeled using nonlinear regression equations that could allow water mass differentiation based on CDOM optical properties. Spectral slope S was negatively correlated (r(2) = 0.79) with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) for waters extending from the middle shelf into the deep Bering Sea indicating increasing microbial alteration of CDOM with depth. Although our data show that the CDOM photochemical environment of the Bering Sea is complex, our current information on its optical properties will aid in better understanding of the biogeochemical role of CDOM in carbon budgets in relation to the annual sea ice and phytoplankton dynamics, and to improved algorithms of ocean color remote sensing for this region.

Understanding community-habitat associations of temperate reef fishes using fine-resolution bathymetric measures of physical structure	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Multibeam sonar (MBS) hydro-acoustic technology allows for inexpensive, broad-scale, fine-resolution assessment of marine fish habitats. Parallel advancements in geographic information systems and new analytical techniques are providing researchers with the ability to generate informative surrogate predictors of biodiversity and species responses. The aim of this study was to determine whether fine-scale bathymetric derivatives of MBS survey data could be effectively applied as surrogates to explain spatial patterns in reef fish diversity and species-habitat relationships. In the absence of direct metrics of habitat, these derivatives might prove to be effective tools for marine spatial planning. Species-habitat relationships were examined across a marine reserve on the south-eastern coast of Tasmania at fine spatial scales using boosted regression tree analyses. The most important explanatory variables of community diversity were those describing the degree of reef aspect deviation from east and south (seemingly as a proxy for swell exposure), reef bathymetry (depth), plane and slope. Models could account for up to 30% of the spatial variability in measures of species diversity. Responses in species abundance and occurrence to habitat structure appeared to be largely species-specific at the scales investigated. Models accounted for up to 67% and 58% of the abundance and occurrence, respectively, for the southern hulafish Trachinops caudimaculatus. Our results demonstrate that multibeam-derived metrics of reef habitat structure, employed in combination with modern modelling approaches, have the potential to explain and predict fine-resolution patterns in temperate reef fish community structure. This knowledge is urgently required to effectively manage marine ecosystems and conserve biodiversity and fisheries resources.

Assessment of SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MERIS ocean colour products in the South China Sea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) remote-sensing radiometric and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration products for the South China Sea (SCS) from October 2003 to May 2010 were assessed using in situ data. A strict spatiotemporal match-up method was used to minimize the temporal variability effects of atmosphere and seawater around the measurement site. A comparison of the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) of the three sensors with in situ values from the open waters of the SCS showed that the mean absolute percentage difference varied from 13% to 55% in the 412-560 nm spectral range. Generally, the MERIS radiometric products exhibited higher typical uncertainties and bias than the SeaWiFS and MODIS products. The R-rs(443) to R-rs(555/551/560) band ratios of the satellite data were in good agreement with in situ observations for these sensors. The SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MERIS chl-a products overestimated in situ values by 74%, 42%, and 120%, respectively. MODIS retrieval accuracy was better than those of the other sensors, with MERIS performing the worst. When the match-up criteria were relaxed, the assessment results degraded systematically. Therefore, strict spatiotemporal match-up is recommended to minimize the possible influences of small-scale variation in geophysical properties around the measurement site. Coastal and open-sea areas in the SCS should be assessed separately because their biooptical properties are different and the results suggest different atmospheric correction problems.

Ancillary parameters measured included absorption and scattering coefficients, chlorophyll-a concentration, cell size, and cell concentration. Spectral variability was found in the case of the backscattering coefficients, and the maximum backscattering coefficient was obtained at 488 nm, which deviated from the theory because of pigment absorption. We were unable to detect the effect of chlorophyll fluorescence on the shape of the backscattering coefficient spectra at 700 nm. However, the particulate backscattering coefficient was found to be well correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration at the six chosen wavelengths. At the same time, the backscattering ratio was accurately arranged in the range 0.012 to 0.019 at 442 nm and 0.013 to 0.021 at 620 nm. A positive correlation between particle density and backscattering ratio was established with a nonlinear regression model and the correlation coefficient was as high as 0.96 at 442 nm, this providing a good foundation for improving the accuracy of identifying the red tide alga, P. micans, for water colour remote sensing.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4275	4286		10.1080/01431161.2014.916452								WOS:000337623200022

Recent economic growth with increased import and export demands have stimulated a dredging operation, starting on 26 March 2010, which was paused on 17 June 2010 after numerous reports of mortality of cultured shellfish, such as clam (Ruditapes philippinarum), among other precious marine animals. A lawsuit was filed to settle the dispute between the dredging company and an aquaculture company, yet there was endless debate on whether the mortality was caused by the dredging operations. Here, using multi-sensor remote-sensing data collected by Landsat/ETM+, HJ-1A&1 B/CCD, and Aqua & Terra/MODIS, we addressed the two critical questions of (1) whether there was a significant increase in the suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the aquaculture area during and after the dredging operations; and (2) if the answer is yes, whether such an increase was a direct result of the dredging. After careful selection of the satellite data and algorithms, the results from all three sensors suggested positive answers to both questions. In the 2 km(2) aquaculture zone where significant mortality of cultured clam was reported, SPM derived from all three sensors during the dredging period was found to be at least 20 mg l (1) higher than that during the same period in previous years, far exceeding the 10 mg l (1) threshold value that has been used to gauge water quality degradation.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	11-12			SI		4383	4398		10.1080/01431161.2014.916446								WOS:000337623200028

Japanese scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) culture is economically important for the coastal communities of Dalian, China, and Funka Bay, Japan. In this study, we combined satellite remote-sensing data, in situ observations, and a suitable aquaculture site selection model to explore the interactions between marine environments and climate variability over a recent 10-year period (2003-2012). Our selection of appropriate zones in these two Far Eastern regions and our analyses of climatic event (Arctic Oscillation (AO), winter East Asian monsoon (EAM), and El Nino/La Nina Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) and meteorological (precipitation, temperature, and wind) data allowed us to determine the impacts of climate change on regional coastal environments and prospects for scallop aquaculture. These analyses showed that AO and EAM strongly influenced the aquaculture areas on the Dalian coast through their effects on temperature during winter. We also determined that wind was the main driving force behind regional environmental changes during spring. Conversely, ocean conditions and suitable areas in Funka Bay changed rapidly relative to oceanic and atmospheric circulation. In Funka Bay, areas appropriate for scallop aquaculture and variations in chlorophyll-a concentration (which reflect the availability of algal food for scallops) were strongly correlated with ENSO, precipitation, and air temperature. These correlations demonstrate the influence of oceanic and atmospheric parameters on the productivity of scallop aquaculture in Funka Bay. Adaptation to oceanic and atmospheric changes should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for coastal scallop aquaculture in northeast Asia.

Spatiotemporal association patterns of multiple parameters in the northwestern Pacific Ocean and their relationships with ENSO	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWPO) is a region sensitive to global climate change and regional sea-air interactions. A number of remote-sensing images from the past three decades were used to define sensitive marine regions, which were then applied to determine the spatiotemporal association patterns of abnormal variations in marine environmental parameters using a quantitative association rule-mining method. The NWPO object 1 (NWPO-obj1) region (130 degrees-150 degrees E, 2 degrees-15 degrees N) and NWPO object 2 (NWPO-obj2) region (170 degrees-180 degrees E, 0 degrees-8 degrees N) showed more pronounced changes than elsewhere, and the monthly anomaly of sea-surface temperature (SSTA), monthly anomaly of sea-surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a), monthly anomaly of sea-level anomaly (SLAA), and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events were closely related to one another in these two regions. In NWPO-obj1, the relation between SLAA and chl-a yields a correlation coefficient of -0.79 and the abnormal drop in SLAA was the principal factor controlling the chl-a bloom. In NWPO-obj2, the SSTA is anti-correlated with chl-a (correlation coefficient of -0.83), and the abnormal increase in SSTA might be one of the main factors leading to the extinction of chl-a. Comparing the two regions, abnormal increases in chl-a and decreases in SSTA in NWPO-obj2 were indicators of abnormal increases in SLAA in NWPO-obj1 (positive and negative correlation coefficients of 0.60 and -0.61, respectively), and the abnormal decrease of SLAA in NWPO-obj1 is correlated with the abnormal decrease of SSTA in NWPO-obj2 (correlation coefficient of 0.86), although ahead by one year. In addition, the abnormal decrease of SLAA in NWPO-obj1 was the only factor influenced by El Nino, while La Nina events had an impact on the abnormal increase of SLAA in NWPO-obj1 and the abnormal decrease of SSTA in NWPO-obj2, and also dominated their interrelationships.

Interannual Variation in Phytoplankton Primary Production at A Global Scale	REMOTE SENSING												We used the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical Model (NOBM) combined with remote sensing data via assimilation to evaluate the contribution of four phytoplankton groups to the total primary production. First, we assessed the contribution of each phytoplankton groups to the total primary production at a global scale for the period 1998-2011. Globally, diatoms contributed the most to the total phytoplankton production (approximate to 50%, the equivalent of approximate to 20 PgCy(-1)). Coccolithophores and chlorophytes each contributed approximate to 20% (approximate to 7 PgCy(-1)) of the total primary production and cyanobacteria represented about 10% (approximate to 4 PgCy(-1)) of the total primary production. Primary production by diatoms was highest in the high latitudes (>40 degrees) and in major upwelling systems (Equatorial Pacific and Benguela system). We then assessed interannual variability of this group-specific primary production over the period 1998-2011. Globally the annual relative contribution of each phytoplankton groups to the total primary production varied by maximum 4% (1-2 PgCy(-1)). We assessed the effects of climate variability on group-specific primary production using global (i.e., Multivariate El Nino Index, MEI) and regional climate indices (e.g., Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)). Most interannual variability occurred in the Equatorial Pacific and was associated with climate variability as indicated by significant correlation (p < 0.05) between the MEI and the group-specific primary production from all groups except coccolithophores. In the Atlantic, climate variability as indicated by NAO was significantly correlated to the primary production of 2 out of the 4 groups in the North Central Atlantic (diatoms/cyanobacteria) and in the North Atlantic (chlorophytes and coccolithophores). We found that climate variability as indicated by SAM had only a limited effect on group-specific primary production in the Southern Ocean. These results provide a modeling and data assimilation perspective to phytoplankton partitioning of primary production and contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of the carbon cycle in the oceans at a global scale.

Phytoplankton absorption and the chlorophyll a-specific absorption coefficient in dynamic Onondaga Lake	INLAND WATERS												Phytoplankton absorption and its dependence on the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), as represented by the Chl-a-specific absorption coefficient (a(phi)*(lambda)), is important to support models of growth and for bio-optical remote sensing algorithms to retrieve Chl-a. The dynamics of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(phi)(lambda)) and a(phi)*(lambda), and their dependencies on Chl-a, are described for Onondaga Lake, New York, over a 6-year period for which major changes in trophic state, Chl-a, and community composition occurred. Strong positive dependencies of a(phi)(lambda) on Chl-a are reported for absorption peaks in both the blue and red spectral regions that are qualitatively similar to relationships for ocean waters but differ quantitatively. Average values of a(phi)* at wavelengths of 440 and 676 nm were 0.0347 and 0.0171 m(2) mg(-1), respectively, with coefficients of variation of 37 and 31%. Significant negative relationships between a(phi)* and Chl-a were observed for blue and green wavelengths that were qualitatively consistent with the influences of pigment packaging and the contribution of accessory pigments to absorption. The operation of these influences is demonstrated through various forms of data analysis that resolved the following significant relationships: (1) negative dependence of the ratio a(phi)(440):a(phi)(676) on Chl-a; (2) flattening of a(phi) spectra in the blue and increases at the red maximum, with increases in Chl-a; and (3) negative dependence of a(phi)(490):a(phi)(676) on Chl-a. Values of a(phi)*(440) and a(phi)*(676) obtained for Onondaga Lake are considered in the context of the limited population reported for other inland waters and selected marine systems.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2014	4	2					133	146		10.5268/IW-4.2.607								WOS:000335927100004

Multi-modal analysis of aerosol robotic network size distributions for remote sensing applications: dominant aerosol type cases	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												To date, size distributions obtained from the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) have been fit with bi-lognormals defined by six secondary microphysical parameters: the volume concentration, effective radius, and the variance of fine and coarse particle modes. However, since the total integrated volume concentration is easily calculated and can be used as an accurate constraint, the problem of fitting the size distribution can be reduced to that of deducing a single free parameter - the mode separation point. We present a method for determining the mode separation point for equivalent-volume bi-lognormal distributions based on optimization of the root mean squared error and the coefficient of determination. The extracted secondary parameters are compared with those provided by AERONET's Level 2.0 Version 2 inversion algorithm for a set of benchmark dominant aerosol types, including desert dust, biomass burning aerosol, urban sulphate and sea salt. The total volume concentration constraint is then also lifted by performing multi-modal fits to the size distribution using nested Gaussian mixture models, and a method is presented for automating the selection of the optimal number of modes using a stopping condition based on Fisher statistics and via the application of statistical hypothesis testing. It is found that the method for optimizing the location of the mode separation point is independent of the shape of the aerosol volume size distribution (AVSD), does not require the existence of a local minimum in the size interval 0.439 mu m < r < 0.992 mu m, and shows some potential for optimizing the bi-lognormal fitting procedure used by AERONET particularly in the case of desert dust aerosol. The AVSD of impure marine aerosol is found to require three modes. In this particular case, bi-lognormals fail to recover key features of the AVSD. Fitting the AVSD more generally with multi-modal models allows automatic detection of a statistically significant number of aerosol modes, is applicable to a very diverse range of aerosol types, and gives access to the secondary microphysical parameters of additional modes currently not available from bi-lognormal fitting methods.

Blending remote sensing data products to estimate photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide in the surface ocean	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its precursor, superoxide (O-2(-)), are well-studied photochemical products that are pivotal in regulating redox transformations of trace metals and organic matter in the surface ocean. In attempts to understand the magnitude of both H2O2 and O-2(-) photoproduction on a global scale, we implemented a model to calculate photochemical fluxes of these products from remotely sensed ocean color and modeled solar irradiances. We generated monthly climatologies for open ocean H2O2 photoproduction rates using an average apparent quantum yield (AQY) spectrum determined from laboratory irradiations of oligotrophic water collected in the Gulf of Alaska. Because the formation of H2O2 depends on secondary thermal reactions involving O-2(-), we also implemented a temperature correction for the H2O2 AQY using remotely sensed sea surface temperature and an Arrhenius relationship for H2O2 photoproduction. Daily photoproduction rates of H2O2 ranged from < 1 to over 100 nM per day, amounting to similar to 30 mu M per year in highly productive regions. When production rates were calculated without the temperature correction, maximum daily rates were underestimated by 1525%, highlighting the importance of including the temperature modification for H2O2 in these models. By making assumptions about the relationship between H2O2 and O(2)(-)photoproduction rates and O-2(-) decay kinetics, we present a method for calculating midday O-2(-) steady-state concentrations ([O-2(-)](ss)) in the open ocean. Estimated [O-2(-)](ss) ranged from 0.1-5 nM assuming biomolecular dismutation was the only sink for O-2(-), but were reduced to 0.1-290 pM when catalytic pathways were included. While the approach presented here provides the first global scale estimates of marine [O-2(-)] ss from remote sensing, the potential of this model to quantify O-2(-) photoproduction rates and [O-2(-)] ss will not be fully realized until the mechanisms controlling O(2)(-)photoproduction and decay are better understood.																	2050-7887	2050-7895					2014	16	4					792	806		10.1039/c3em00617d								WOS:000333565000014	24619198

The area of study was located between two dams, Catalan and Seyhan. The aims of this study were to identify the Main Physiographic Units (MPU) and soil classes (Land Use Capability, LUC) to provide comprehensive data about soils within the area of study. 26 soil profiles have been identified to represent the physiographic units and soil series in the area of study. Based on remote sensing data and GIS, the area of study can be divided into 7 MPU (Bajada: base land-clay deposit; colluvial; foot slope; Terraces-aged, marine, young; ridge/hilly; river bank and terrace) and each of these units takes up 7, 3, 6, 36, 10, 33, and 5% of the area, respectively. Foot slope and ridge/hilly units comprise 36% and 33% of the area, respectively. The remaining physiographic units make up 10% or less of the study area. 7 classes of soils were identified for LUC for studying soils. These classes are I, II, III, IV, VI, VII and VIII, and their percentages are 2, 5, 20, 22, 40, 9 and 2, respectively. The percentage of the first three classes (I, II and III) is 27% and the percentage of the area not suitable for cultivated agriculture is 51%.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2014	23	3A					952	955										WOS:000333445000018						
J	Emerson, S				Emerson, Steven			Annual net community production and the biological carbon flux in the ocean	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The flux of biologically produced organic matter from the surface ocean (the biological pump), over an annual cycle, is equal to the annual net community production (ANCP). Experimental determinations of ANCP at ocean time series sites using a variety of different metabolite mass balances have made it possible to evaluate the accuracy of sediment trap fluxes and satellite-determined ocean carbon export. ANCP values at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT), the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS), Ocean Station Papa (OSP) are 31 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)much less variable than presently suggested by satellite remote sensing measurements and global circulation models. ANCP determined from mass balances at these locations are 3-4 times particulate organic carbon fluxes measured in sediment traps. When the roles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux, zooplankton migration, and depth-dependent respiration are considered these differences are reconciled at HOT and OSP but not at BATS, where measured particulate fluxes are about 3 times lower than expected. Even in the cases where sediment trap fluxes are accurate, it is not possible to scale up these measurements to determine ANCP without independent determinations of geographically variable DOC flux and zooplankton migration. Estimates of ANCP from satellite remote sensing using net primary production determined by the carbon-based productivity model suggests less geographic variability than its predecessor (the vertically generalized productivity model) and brings predictions at HOT and OSP closer to measurements; however, satellite-predicted ANCP at BATS is still 3 times too low.

J	Carr, JR; Stokes, C; Vieli, A				Carr, J. Rachel; Stokes, Chris; Vieli, Andreas			Recent retreat of major outlet glaciers on Novaya Zemlya, Russian Arctic, influenced by fjord geometry and sea-ice conditions	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Substantial ice loss has occurred in the Russian High Arctic during the past decade, predominantly on Novaya Zemlya, yet the region has been studied relatively little. Consequently, the factors forcing mass loss and the relative contribution of ice dynamics versus surface melt are poorly understood. Here we evaluate the influence of atmospheric/oceanic forcing and variations in fjord width on the behaviour of 38 glaciers on the northern ice cap, Novaya Zemlya. We compare retreat rates on land- versus marine-terminating outlets and on the Kara versus Barents Sea coasts. Between 1992 and 2010, 90% of the study glaciers retreated and retreat rates were an order of magnitude higher for marine-terminating outlets (52.1 m a(-1)) than for land-terminating glaciers (4.8 m a(-1)). We identify a post-2000 acceleration in marine-terminating glacier retreat, which corresponded closely to changes in sea-ice concentrations. Retreat rates were higher on the Barents Sea coast, which we partly attribute to lower sea-ice concentrations, but varied dramatically between individual glaciers. We use empirical data to categorize changes in along-flow fjord width, and demonstrate a significant relationship between fjord width variability and retreat rate. Results suggest that variations in fjord width exert a major influence on glacier retreat.

Here we test the applicability of a simple multibeam sonar classification method developed for fjord environments to map the distribution of shelf-depth substrates and gorgonian coral- and sponge-dominated biotopes. The studied area is a shelf-depth feature Learmonth Bank, northern British Columbia, Canada and the method was applied aiming to map primarily non-reef forming coral and sponge biotopes. Aside from producing high-resolution maps (5 m(2) raster grid), biotope-substrate associations were also investigated. A multibeam sonar survey yielded bathymetry, acoustic backscatter strength and slope. From benthic video transects recorded by remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) six primary substrate types and twelve biotope categories were identified, defined by the primary sediment and dominant biological structure, respectively. Substrate and biotope maps were produced using a supervised classification mostly based on the inter-quartile range of the acoustic variables for each substrate type and biotope. Twenty-five percent of the video observations were randomly reserved for testing the classification accuracy. The dominant biotope-defining corals were red tree coral Primnoa pacifica and small styasterids, of which Stylaster parageus was common. Demosponges and hexactinellid sponges were frequently observed but no sponge reefs were observed. The substrate classification readily distinguished fine sediment, Sand and Bedrock from the other substrate types, but had greater difficulty distinguishing Bedrock from Boulders and Cobble. The biotope classification accurately identified Gardens (dense aggregations of sponges and corals) and Primnoa-dominated biotopes (67% accuracy), but most other biotopes had lower accuracies. There was a significant correspondence between Learmonth's biotopes and substrate types, with many biotopes strongly associated with only a single substrate type. This strong correspondence allowed substrate types to function as a surrogate for helping to map biotope distributions. Our results add new information on the distribution of corals and sponges at Learmonth Bank, which can be used to guide management at this location. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, passive microwave remote sensing of sea ice concentration and satellite imagery of ocean color are employed to quantify the magnitude of and variability in open water area and net primary productivity (NPP) in the Larsen embayments between 1997 and 2011. Numerical model output provides context to analyze atmospheric forcing on the coastal ocean. Following ice shelf disintegration the embayments function as coastal, sensible heat polynyas. The Larsen A and B are as productive as other Antarctic shelf regions, with seasonally averaged daily NPP rates reaching 1232 and 1127 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and annual rates reaching 200 and 184 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. A persistent cross-shelf gradient in NPP is present with higher productivity rates offshore, contrasting with patterns observed along the West Antarctic Peninsula. Embayment productivity is intimately tied to sea ice dynamics, with large interannual variability in NPP rates driven by open water area and the timing of embayment opening. Opening of the embayment is linked to periods of positive Southern Annular Mode and stronger westerlies, which lead to the vertical deflection of warm, maritime air over the peninsula and down the leeward side causing increases in surface air temperature and wind velocity. High productivity in these new polynyas is likely to have ramifications for organic matter export and marine ecosystem evolution.

Lidar-based remote sensing of atmospheric boundary layer height over land and ocean	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) processes are important in climate, weather and air quality. A better understanding of the structure and the behavior of the ABL is required for understanding and modeling of the chemistry and dynamics of the atmosphere on all scales. Based on the systematic variations of the ABL structures over different surfaces, different lidar-based methods were developed and evaluated to determine the boundary layer height and mixing layer height over land and ocean. With Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Climate Research Facility (ACRF) micropulse lidar (MPL) and radiosonde measurements, diurnal and season cycles of atmospheric boundary layer depth and the ABL vertical structure over ocean and land are analyzed. The new methods are then applied to satellite lidar measurements. The aerosol-derived global marine boundary layer heights are evaluated with marine ABL stratiform cloud top heights and results show a good agreement between them.

J	Stramska, M; Swirgon, M				Stramska, Malgorzata; Swirgon, Marek			Influence of atmospheric forcing and freshwater discharge on interannual variability of the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm in the Baltic Sea	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Each year, spatial patterns of ocean color in the Baltic Sea differ in temporal evolution and magnitude. We have investigated the interannual variability of the spatially averaged vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) in response to atmospheric forcing and river discharge. Our results indicate that atmospheric forcing does not have a significant influence on interannual anomalies of K-d(490) in the Baltic Sea. This is dissimilar to the North Atlantic at the same latitudes, where interannual variability of phytoplankton blooms (ocean color chlorophyll concentration, Chl,and K-d) is to a large degree controlled by local weather. In contrast, in the Baltic Sea the interannual variability of K-d(490) is significantly influenced by river runoff. Higher values of K-d(490) are observed in years with larger inflow of water from rivers. Without access to more detailed information about the concentrations of various optically significant water components we can only speculate about the possible reasons for this relationship. Most likely a combination of several factors causes the observed positive correlation between K-d(490) and river discharge. These factors include development of more intense phytoplankton blooms in response to a larger supply of nutrients delivered by rivers. This conclusion is supported by satellite Chl data. However, an advection of optically important material with river water most likely also contributes to the bserved variability of K-d(490). The diffuse attenuation coefficient plays a critical role in many oceanographic processes. For example, K-d is essential for quantification of radiative heating of the ocean, in models of primary production and other photoprocesses, and in studies discussing water turbidity and water quality. Better understanding of the variability of K-d in the Baltic Sea can improve our knowledge of this marine environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Investigated quantities are: 1) the algal-2 pigment index, alg2; 2) the composite-absorption coefficient of yellow substance and non-pigmented particles at 442 nm, a(dg); and 3) the concentration of the total suspended matter, TSM. Regional data products are created using ocean color inversion schemes based on MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural nets trained with field measurements from the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (CoASTS) and Bio-Optical mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs. MLP input is the remote sensing reflectance Res at MERIS center-wavelengths specifically selected for different water types in view of minimizing the perturbing effects of inaccurate atmospheric correction on the retrieval of regional data products. A new method is also proposed to define the applicability of regional MLPs to input Res. Results indicate that MERIS alg2 values tend to overestimate the equivalent quantity computed with MLP regional algorithms. The agreement between MERIS and regional TSM data products is significantly better than that reported for alg2 and ad, especially for BLKS. Findings highlight the relevance of using regional inversion schemes to evaluate standard products over extended oceanographic regions as a complement to the analysis of match-ups between marine products measured in situ and derived from space-born data.

For non-interrupted observations, only the Landsat series have the potential to detect major water quality events since the 1980s. However, such ability is hindered by the unknown data quality or consistency through time. Here, using the Florida Keys as a case study, we demonstrate an approach to identify historical water quality events through improved atmospheric correction of Landsat data and cross-validation with concurrent MODIS data. After aggregation of the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) 30-m pixels to 240-m pixels (to increase the signal-to-noise ratio), a MODIS-like atmospheric correction approach using the Landsat shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands was developed and applied to the entire Landsat-5 TM data series between 1985 and 2010. Remote sensing reflectance (Res) anomalies from Landsat (2 standard deviations from a pixel-specific monthly climatology) were found to detect MODIS Res anomalies with over 90% accuracy for all three bands for the same period of 2002-2010. Extending this analysis for the entire Landsat-5 time-series revealed Res anomaly events in the 1980s and 1990s, some of which are corroborated by known ecosystem changes due in part to changes in local freshwater flow. Indeed, TM Res anomalies were shown to be useful in detecting shifts in seagrass density, turbidity increases, black water events, and phytoplankton blooms. These findings have large implications for ongoing and future water quality assessment in the Florida Keys as well as in many other coastal regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Estimation of primary production in the southern Argentine continental shelf and shelf-break regions using field and remote sensing data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Argentine continental shelf and shelf-break regions comprise a large and rich biological area of the ocean. However, field estimations of primary production are scarce, making remote sensing of ocean color a valuable tool to provide synoptic maps of primary production in this ecologically relevant region. Field studies performed during spring 2005, and summer and winter 2006 showed a high spatial and seasonal variability in the daily integrated water column primary production, chlorophyll-a and biomass-normalized photosynthetic parameters. Using field measurements, five different and relatively simple (non-spectral and vertically homogeneous biomass) models were tested: three chlorophyll-, one carbon- and one absorption-based model. The chlorophyll-based 'BIOM' model developed by Platt and Sathyendranath (Science, 241:1613-1620; 1988) provided the closest estimates to the field values, and was selected as the local algorithm. Its performance was assessed using simultaneous satellite-derived products and field photosynthetic parameters as input. Close values compared to the field estimates were obtained using BIOM (Absolute Percent Difference error, APD similar to 10%), even though satellite-derived products used as input to the model (i.e. chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient in the photosynthetically active radiation range - PAR-, and PAR irradiance) showed relative high errors (APD similar to 40%, 20% and 50%, respectively). Provided that an efficient way to assign the physiological parameters in a pixel-by-pixel basis is found, this model seems to be the best to produce primary production maps from remote sensing of ocean color in the southern Argentine shelf and shelf-break regions.

J	De Carolis, G; Adamo, M; Pasquariello, G				De Carolis, Giacomo; Adamo, Maria; Pasquariello, Guido			On the Estimation of Thickness of Marine Oil Slicks From Sun-Glittered, Near-Infrared MERIS and MODIS Imagery: The Lebanon Oil Spill Case Study	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The detection of marine oil slicks using satellite sun-glittered optical imagery has been recently assessed. As the nature of the imaging mechanism involves the altered features of the wind-roughened oil-covered sea surface, it is expected that the radiation reflected from the oil-water system carries information about the physical properties of the floating oil layer. In this paper, we report an investigation on the capability to retrieve the average thickness of thin marine oil slicks by using the sun-glittered component of the solar radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) bands of MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Instrument (MERIS) and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The developed procedure exploits the Cox and Munk model to compute sun glint reflectance at the sea surface level for both clean and oil polluted sea surface as well. It is assumed that the Fresnel reflection coefficient of the oil-water system carries the relevant optical dependence on oil layer thickness and oil type. The expected oil-water system reflectance is computed by taking into account the non-uniform spatial distribution of the oil volume. This is achieved by considering a pdf of oil thicknesses that matches the observations on controlled oil slicks already reported in the scientific literature. MERIS and MODIS images gathered during the Lebanon oil spill occurred on July and August 2006 were selected as case study. When available, co-located SAR imagery was also considered to corroborate NIR-detected oil slicks.				pasquariello, guido/G-9191-2011	pasquariello, guido/0000-0001-8622-2058; ADAMO, MARIA/0000-0002-6042-8565												0196-2892	1558-0644				JAN	2014	52	1	2				559	573		10.1109/TGRS.2013.2242476								WOS:000328939500015

We aim to show that remote sensing (RS), as demonstrated for terrestrial protected areas, has the potential to provide key information to support MPA management. We review existing literature on the use of RS to monitor biodiversity surrogates, e.g. ecological (e.g., primary productivity) and oceanographic (e.g., Sea Surface Temperature) parameters that have been shown to structure marine biodiversity. We then highlight the potential for RS to inform marine habitat mapping and monitoring, and discuss how RS can be used to track anthropogenic activities and its impacts on biodiversity in MPAs. Reasons for low integration of RS in MPA management and current limitations are also presented. This work concludes that RS shows great promise to support wildlife managers in their efforts to protect marine biodiversity around the world, in particular when such information is used in conjunction with data from field surveys.

Based on analyzing and processing IKONOS satellite remote sensing data, a reefs extraction algorithm is proposed in this paper, in which principal components analysis transformation is combined with edge enhancement. The principal component analysis transformation is applied for all the four bands of the IKONOS data, and the edge is enhanced by using the sharpened near-infrared image. Then Gauss Laplace operator is used to extract the edge of the reefs. The results show that the proposed method removes the linear correlated redundant information in the multi-spectral bands, and higher extraction accuracy of reefs edge can be obtained. From the view of computational complexity and computational efficiency, this method is also better than other algorithms.																	2372-1723		978-1-4799-4777-5				2014							14	17		10.1109/BIFE.2013.4								WOS:000393051700004

As traditional spatiotemporal analysis has great challenge to obtain this pattern, we propose a raster-oriented mining framework to address such issue, which consists of three components, i.e. data pretreatment component, mining component and visualization component. Data pretreatment component is to extract the abnormal information and discretize the variations into quantitative levels, and to construct the mining transaction table with space, time, marine elements and their variation types. Mining component is to design an efficient mining algorithm to find the frequent patterns (candidate patterns) and identify the meaningful patterns. Visualization component is to visualize the discovered spatiotemporal association patterns with a group of thematic maps by a recursive strategy from (k-1)-dimension to k dimension. Finally, a case study over Pacific Ocean was shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed mining framework.																	2469-8814		978-1-4799-5151-2				2014							736	741										WOS:000393406200129

Monitoring of seagrass by lightweight AUV: A Posidonia oceanica case study surrounding Murter Island of Croatia	2014 22ND MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND AUTOMATION (MED)	Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation				22nd Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED)	JUN 16-19, 2014	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY		Univ Palermo			Posidonia oceanica (Neptune Grass) is an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. It forms dense and extensive green underwater meadows which provide important ecological functions and services and harbour highly diverse communities; as such it is identified as a priority habitat type for conservation under the EU Habitats Directive (Dir 92/43/CEE). Over the last decades many Posidonia oceanica meadows have disappeared or have been altered. Efficient monitoring is the key of the ecosystem conservation. Monitoring of vast areas covered by Posidonia oceanica is extremely difficult, costly and time consuming and generates pronounced need for new methods and tools. This case study presents potential and promote use of lightweight autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with the remote sensing payload as the environmentally non-destructive monitoring method. The study was performed from 2011 to 2013 on the Croatian island Murter during the "Breaking the Surface" - international interdisciplinary field training of marine robotics and applications. Four AUVs equipped with different payloads were performing the missions in the study area. This paper presents results and analysis of different aspects important for the monitoring such as compliance with the existing monitoring indicators and descriptors used to assess the conservation status of P. oceanica, performance of the AUVs and their sensor sets, cost and time efficiency of the monitoring and geographical-localisation accuracy of the data collected.																	2325-369X		978-1-4799-5901-3				2014							758	763										WOS:000400962700127

JOHN'S	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	SEP 14-19, 2014	St Johns, CANADA					Sea ice is a critical component of the Arctic coastal environment. For northern communities, it is a central part of culture, community, and livelihood. Recent changes in Arctic climate have led to greater unpredictability in sea ice conditions, making travel and hunting more hazardous, particularly during the dynamic freeze-up and break-up periods. If the recent trend of warmer Arctic winters is an indication of future climatic conditions, sea ice will become increasingly more dangerous for travel, especially for inexperienced travellers, and traditional knowledge of safe routes based on past climatic conditions will become less reliable. For northern resource industries (e.g., mining) and maritime shipping, the presence of sea ice represents added operational risk, particularly where shipping routes overlap with community on-ice travel routes, making route planning in these coastal areas less predictable and increasing the potential for delay and additional costs. Furthermore, northern resource extractive industries are expected to grow significantly in the future, leading to increased year-round shipping and greater potential for conflicting sea-ice use. The key to decreasing conflicts and ensuring safe and efficient winter travel for both local communities and industry is the timely availability of information describing sea ice conditions, at the relevant spatial scales, presented in a format that is appropriate for each user group. SmartICE represents a community-government-university-industry collaboration that integrates adapted technology, remote sensing, and Inuit Knowledge to promote safe travel for all stakeholders in northern coastal environments. The main elements of the SmartICE information system are: (i) A network of automated in situ sensors that measure sea-ice thickness and other characteristics; (ii) Repeat satellite imagery from which sea-ice surface conditions (e.g., concentration, roughness, water content) are mapped following user-defined classification systems; and (iii) Information technology that integrates the in situ and remotely sensed sea-ice data to generate raw and processed digital products that match the needs of user groups, from ice navigation managers to Inuit ice experts to recreational ice users. While community participation in SmartICE is key to addressing local needs and conditions, the program is intended to augment and integrate Inuit sea-ice knowledge, not replace it. Development and validation of the SmartICE technology and information system involve a multi-stage approach with simultaneous development of the ice monitoring technology and the Inuit-based ice type classification and remote sensing. The Nunatsiavut Government is a principal partner in SmartICE and our first phase of community sea-ice workshops, sea-ice classification and field truthing, sensor deployment and system validation is taking place in the Nunatsiavut communities of Nain and Rigolet. Nain is located to the north of Vale NL's Voisey's Bay mine site where winter ore shipping cuts a regular track through the coastal sea ice. Rigolet and a third study community, North West River, are located at the mouth and head of Lake Melville, respectively, an 150-km-long estuary that drains major rivers, including the Churchill River, to the Labrador Sea. Lake Melville sea ice is regularly used for subsistence harvesting and travel during winter and spring months. During the 2013/14 sea-ice season, workshops with sea-ice specialists were held in Nain and North West River. Sea-ice types deemed locally important for making decisions about on-ice travel were identified. Categories common to both communities included: rough ice (either due to ice or hard pack snow), smooth ice (again, due to a surface of ice or snow), open water, and water on-ice. Pack ice and the shear zone with landfast ice were only identified in Nain. The Canadian Ice Service (CIS) and C-CORE (through Polarview) provided high-resolution imagery for sea-ice classification. In addition, CIS have given full access to coarse resolution operational images. The sea-ice specialists in Nain and North West River have collected on-ice observations concurrent with image acquisition. Development of the sea-ice classification process is ongoing. SmartICE is developing two in situ sea-ice monitoring device types. Type 1, based on thermistor technology, will be deployed in the ocean prior to freeze-up and left in place until after break-up. Device prototypes were environmentally tested during the 2013-14 sea-ice season. Non-destructive ultrasonic sensor technologies are currently being explored for Type 2 devices, which will be deployed onto the ice surface.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-4918-2				2014																		WOS:000369848800310

JOHN'S	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	SEP 14-19, 2014	St Johns, CANADA					Personnel-based aerial surveys have demonstrated their capability for monitoring marine animal populations. That being said, not many studies have been conducted on smaller shark species in coastal waters, where they can become a threat to beach-goers and possibly be killed by beach protection netting. In this paper we report our findings on real-time, automated detection of great white shark dummy targets using a multispectral imager. 2.5 x 1.2 m plywood shark cutouts were submerged to 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m below the surface in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego, CA. 66 passes were conducted over the course of three days, resulting in an average probability of detection of 84.8%. Automatic detection was mostly limited by water turbidity in this test, but other environmental conditions such as wind, wave speed and period, and sun glint also had an effect on detection. The high probability of detection and low false alarm rate from this study are an indication that using an automated remote sensing system could be an effective alternative to personnel-based aerial surveys.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-4918-2				2014																		WOS:000369848800156

Field Deployments of a Self-Contained Subsea Platform for Acoustic Monitoring of the Environment around Marine Renewable Energy Structures	2014 OCEANS - ST. JOHN'S	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	SEP 14-19, 2014	St Johns, CANADA					The drive towards sustainable energy has seen rapid development of marine renewable energy devices, and current efforts are focusing on wave and tidal stream energy. The NERC/DEFRA collaboration FLOWBEC-4D (Flow, Water column & Benthic Ecology 4D) is addressing the lack of knowledge of the environmental and ecological effects of installing and operating large arrays of wave and tidal energy devices. The FLOWBEC sonar platform combines a number of instruments to record information at a range of physical and multi-trophic levels. Data are recorded at a resolution of several measurements per second, for durations of 2 weeks to capture an entire spring-neap tidal cycle. An upward-facing multifrequency Simrad EK60 echosounder (38, 120 and 200 kHz) is synchronized with an upward-facing Imagenex 837B Delta T multibeam sonar (120 degrees x 20 degrees beamwidth, 260 kHz) aligned with the tidal flow. An ADV is used for local current measurements and a fluorometer is used to measure chlorophyll (as a proxy for plankton) and turbidity. The platform is self-contained with no cables or anchors, facilitating rapid deployment and recovery in highenergy sites and flexibility in allowing baseline data to be gathered. Five 2-week deployments were completed in 2012 and 2013 at wave and tidal energy sites, both in the presence and absence of renewable energy structures. These surveys were conducted at the European Marine Energy Centre, Orkney, UK. Algorithms for noise removal, target detection and target tracking have been written using a combination of LabVIEW, MATLAB and Echoview. Target morphology, behavior and frequency response are used to aid target classification, with concurrent shore-based seabird observations used to ground truth the acoustic data. Using this information, the depth preference and interactions of birds, fish schools and marine mammals with renewable energy structures can be tracked. Seabird and mammal dive profiles, predator-prey interactions and the effect of hydrodynamic processes during foraging events throughout the water column can also be analyzed. These datasets offer insights into how fish, seabirds and marine mammals successfully forage within dynamic marine habitats and also whether individuals face collision risks with tidal stream turbines. Measurements from the subsea platform are complemented by 3D hydrodynamic model data and concurrent shore-based marine X-band radar. This range of concurrent fine-scale information across physical and trophic levels will improve our understanding of how the fine-scale physical influence of currents, waves and turbulence at tidal and wave energy sites affect the behavior of marine wildlife, and how tidal and wave energy devices might alter the behavior of such wildlife. Together, the results from these deployments increase our environmental understanding of the physical and ecological effects of installing and operating marine renewable energy devices. These results can be used to guide marine spatial planning, device design, licensing and operation, as individual devices are scaled up to arrays and new sites are considered. The combination of our current technology and analytical approach can help to de-risk the licensing process by providing a higher level of certainty about the behavior of a range of mobile marine species in high energy environments. It is likely that this approach will lead to greater mechanistic understanding of how and why mobile predators use these high energy areas for foraging. If a fuller understanding and quantification can be achieved at single demonstration scales, and these are found to be similar, then the predictive power of the outcomes might lead to a wider strategic approach to monitoring and possibly lead to a reduction in the level of monitoring required at each commercial site.

The main tasks to execute are remote sensing and monitoring. Grid topology with multihop relaying is very useful, since it allows a wide area coverage as well as long distance data transmission. In this paper, we investigate architectures where sensing and monitoring data are forwarded over multiple lines independently. We are interested in transmission schedules which maximize network throughput. We prove that an optimal schedule is necessarily per-node fair. We also derive the upper bound. Furthermore, we present a low-complexity algorithm to find schedules achieving the upper bound, regardless of the size of the network.																			978-1-4799-7578-5				2014																		WOS:000380433300011

Sensing marine biomolecules: smell, taste, and the evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial life	FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY												The usual definition of smell and taste as distance and contact forms of chemoreception, respectively, has resulted in the belief that, during the shift from aquatic to terrestrial life, odorant receptors (ORs) were selected mainly to recognize airborne hydrophobic ligands, instead of the hydrophilic molecules involved in marine remote-sensing. This post-adaptive evolutionary scenario, however, neglects the fact that marine organisms 1) produce and detect a wide range of small hydrophobic and volatile molecules, especially terpenoids, and 2) contain genes coding for ORs that are able to bind those compounds. These apparent anomalies can be resolved by adopting an alternative, pre-adaptive scenario. Before becoming airborne on land, small molecules, almost insoluble in water, already played a key role in aquatic communication, but acting in "contact" forms of olfaction that did not require major molecular innovations to become effective at a distance in air. Rather, when air was "invaded" by volatile marine terpenoids, an expansion of the spatial range of olfaction was an incidental consequence rather than an adaptation.

Where once extreme environments were inaccessible, Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Mars Rovers now collect large volumes of image data. In addition to image collection techniques, the fields of computer processing and data transfer are also developing rapidly. Computer techniques now allow for much greater statistical investigation of features from images, and for data sets to be remotely accessible via the internet from international institutions simultaneously. Aimed at new PhD students, masters or undergraduates, 'An Introduction to Image Analysis and Spatial Statistics' takes an experimental approach to explore how researchers can best manage, analyse and disseminate these emerging data sets. In this rolling, 10 week, remote learning course we introduce inter-collegiate students from Earth and Planetary science disciplines to three statistical packages of use in image analysis: 'ImageJ' - A versatile program for quantifying point counts and areas of coverage within images. 'PaSSAGE 2' - A program for the analysis of transect data, including co-variance analysis. SPSS - We introduce population analysis with the ANOVA facilities offered by SPSS, with comparable freely available packages also introduced. In all cases, examples are given from both Earth and Planetary science disciplines for use in the work. The course is freely accessible to anyone in a partner institute of the DFG Heimholz ROBEX Alliance for robotic exploration of extreme environments. The course resources will additionally be available via download to any other interested users, though without access to the tutor/student component of the course. Drawing on the experiential learning approach, we introduce image analysis, experimenting with applying spatial statistics in a safe environment, before students begin to utilise their learning and explore wider applications. Housed in Weebly, collaborative learning is promoted through asynchronous discussion, blogs and wiki building, with a unique 'field trip', where work groups dial in to gather real-time data from a deep sea Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). Synchronous Skype tutorials and a-synchronous quizzes scaffold and continually assess learning from key reading materials. Short blocks of methods work guide the (predominately non-native English) participants through applicability and style in write-up requirements, so they can present statistics clearly and engagingly within journal articles. Within the10 week course, we aim to give participants confidence in these statistical toolsets and the aptitude to employ them in their own research work.																	2340-1079		978-84-616-8412-0				2014							1029	1037										WOS:000366835101009

An attempt has been made to study the length of shoreline changes along three provinces in the upper gulf of Thailand. The significant purpose is to investigate coastline length changes and to evaluate those different coastal changes at different times. Two specialties of chosen areas are the outstanding location at mouth of river in curve pattern and ecological important mangrove forest, as nominated and designated area listed in Ramsar convention, international wetlands treaty. In employing the remote sensing will help to investigate the shoreline erosion, stable or construction shoreline. Rapid and drastic shoreline changes have been compared and measured base on satellite image Landsat 5 TM on 1994, 2002 and 2007 at path129 row 051. There were geometrically co-registered and, in the process were resampled to 25m. By composing RGB band, fusion, supervised classification. By apply different theories will give different results but the similarly pattern. Training sites were selected by signature editor, area of interest, evaluate by seperabilitly and contingency. Principle component analysis (PCA) was employed as a method of change detection. This is to conclude that these shoreline areas were in erosion from natural processes and manmade activities, for example, aquaculture and agriculture expansion, such as shrimp farm. These coastal line lost were not just losing the land; it's losing the soul of the cycle of marine life, economically, and environmentally. Moreover, this project, in the future, could benefit to set the recovery buffer zone for mangrove restoration also.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1079	1083		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1079-2014								WOS:000368425300170

Recent use of Polarimetric SAR imagery in near real time oil spill detection systems is associated with attempts towards automatic and unambiguous oil spill detection based on decomposition methods. Such systems integrate remote sensing technology, geo information, communication system, hardware and software systems to provide key information for analysis and decision making. Geographic information systems (GIS) like BHUVAN can significantly contribute to oil spill management based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. India has long coast line from Gujarat to Bengal and hundreds of ports. The increase in shipping also increases the risk of oil spills in our maritime zone. The availability of RISAT-1 SAR images enhances the scope to monitor oil spills and develop GIS on Bhuvan which can be accessed by all the users, such as ships, coast guard, environmentalists etc., The GIS enables realization of oil spill maps based on integration of the geographical, remote sensing, oil & gas production/infrastructure data and slick signatures detected by SAR. SAR and GIS technologies can significantly improve the realization of oil spill footprint distribution maps. Preliminary assessment shows that the Bhuvan promises to be an ideal solution to understand spatial, temporal occurrence of oil spills in the marine atlas of India. The oil spill maps on Bhuvan based GIS facility will help the ONGC and Coast Guard organization.																	2194-9034						2014	40-8						1085	1090		10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-1085-2014								WOS:000368425300171						
S	Liu, YK; Wang, Y			IEEE	Liu, YuKang; Wang, Yong			Low-Frequency Sound Transmission Through Water-Air Interface: A Comparison Between Ray and Wave Theory	OCEANS 2014 - TAIPEI	OCEANS-IEEE				Oceans Conference	APR 07-10, 2014	Taipei, TAIWAN					Studying low frequency sound transmission through water-air interface can help understand airplane-generated sound for acoustic remote sensing and effects of airborne sources on marine life. In this paper ray theory and wave theory are utilized to evaluate the acoustic transparency. Ray theory is first used to calculate the energy of the plane and spherical wave that transmits from water to air. Wave theory is then utilized to study spherical wave transmission through water-air interface. By comparing the results obtained from two theories, it is found that acoustic transparency can be derived using both ray and wave theory. Because acoustic transparency derived using ray theory is slightly smaller than that of the wave theory, it is thus called Enhanced Transparency as opposed to Anomalous Transparency proposed by Godin. By incorporating the inhomogeneous wave, wave theory does provide more significant transparency, especially in low frequencies. The results have been further extended to liquid-gas interface.																	0197-7385		978-1-4799-3646-5				2014																		WOS:000412588000018

First, a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm is employed to extract the image features. Compared with basic features, such as the image spectrum and texture, structuring more targeted oil spill image localization non-negative character fits better for the physical significance of remote sensing images. Furthermore, on the basis of the new features, a new feedforward neural network structure with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed for GF-1 RS image segmentation.

Repeat visits were made to four stations at 2500 m depth on the flanks of the MAR in the years 2007-2010; a pair of northern stations at 54 degrees N in cold water north of the sub-polar front and southern stations at 49 degrees N in warmer water influenced by eddies from the North Atlantic Current. At each station an instrumented mooring was deployed with current meters and sediment traps (100 and 1000 m above the sea floor) to sample downward flux of particulate matter. The patterns of water flow, fronts, primary production and export flux in the region were studied by a combination of remote sensing and in situ measurements. Sonar, tow nets and profilers sampled pelagic fauna over the MAR. Swath bathymetry surveys across the ridge revealed sediment-covered flat terraces parallel to the axis of the MAR with intervening steep rocky slopes. Otter trawls, megacores, baited traps and a suite of tools carried by the R.O.V. Isis including push cores, grabs and a suction device collected benthic fauna. Video and photo surveys were also conducted using the SHRIMP towed vehicle and the R.O.V. Isis. Additional surveying and sampling by landers and R.O.V. focussed on the summit of a seamount (48 degrees 44'N, 28 degrees 10'W) on the western crest of the MAR between the two southern stations.

A thorough understanding of these processes is essential to determining whether distant populations are connected and how to adapt management plans to patterns in connectivity. Managers may erroneously assume that local populations are isolated when they are actually replenished by distant reefs beyond their jurisdiction. Researchers increasingly rely on numerical hydrodynamic models that simulate the spatio-temporal dispersal of larvae by ocean currents to elucidate these connections and guide marine spatial planners, yet relatively little work has been done to validate these models with empirical data. In this study, we tested a dispersal simulation model against in situ observations of young post-larval fish to investigate a whether larvae settling at La Reunion (in the western Indian Ocean) might have originated at Mauritius, 200 km distant. First, we collected post larval specimens of honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra) shortly after an episodic mass settlement that occurred in 2002 at La Reunion. Using sclerochronology, we established the age of the fish from their otoliths. Finally, we simulated dispersal of larvae from La Reunion, Mauritius, and other reefs in the region by ocean currents using a 20 Eulerian advection-diffusion model driven by current velocities derived from satellite remote sensing. The simulation suggested that larvae spawned at la Reunion were carried away from the island while larvae spawned at Mauritius were carried to La Reunion. The otolith-derived ages of the fish were compatible with this hypothesis, when we accounted for the time required for larvae to drift from Mauritius to La Reunion. The combined results suggest a dispersal connection from Mauritius to la Reunion. To best maintain populations of adult reef fish at La Reunion, managers should protect stocks spawning at Mauritius. Although more study is needed to characterize patterns of regional connectivity and account for seasonal and inter-annual variations in these patterns, the example presented here demonstrates the possibility of distant connections in the western Indian Ocean. We urge managers in the region to look beyond their own jurisdictions, view their jurisdictions as part of a connected network, and undertake a collaborative approach to protecting the network as a whole.

J	Roy, S; Sathyendranath, S; Bouman, H; Platt, T				Roy, Shovonlal; Sathyendranath, Shubha; Bouman, Heather; Platt, Trevor			The global distribution of phytoplankton size spectrum and size classes from their light-absorption spectra derived from satellite data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The absorption spectra of phytoplankton in the visible domain hold implicit information on the phytoplankton community structure. Here we use this information to retrieve quantitative information on phytoplankton size structure by developing a novel method to compute the exponent of an assumed power-law for their particle-size spectrum. This quantity, in combination with total chlorophyll-a concentration, can be used to estimate the fractional concentration of chlorophyll in any arbitrarily-defined size class of phytoplankton. We further define and derive expressions for two distinct measures of cell size of mixed. populations, namely, the average spherical diameter of a bio-optically equivalent homogeneous population of cells of equal size, and the average equivalent spherical diameter of a population of cells that follow a power-law particle-size distribution. The method relies on measurements of two quantities of a phytoplankton sample: the concentration of chlorophyll-a, which is an operational index of phytoplankton biomass, and the total absorption coefficient of phytoplankton in the red peak of visible spectrum at 676 nm. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the relative errors in the estimates of the exponent of particle size spectra are reasonably low. The exponents of phytoplankton size spectra, estimated for a large set of in situ data from a variety of oceanic environments (similar to 2400 samples), are within a reasonable range; and the estimated fractions of chlorophyll in pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton are generally consistent with those obtained by an independent, indirect method based on diagnostic pigments determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The estimates of cell size for in situ samples dominated by different phytoplankton types (diatoms, prymnesiophytes, Prochlorococcus, other cyanobacteria and green algae) yield nominal sizes consistent with the taxonomic classification. To estimate the same quantities from satellite-derived ocean-colour data, we combine our method with algorithms for obtaining inherent optical properties from remote sensing. The spatial distribution of the size-spectrum exponent and the chlorophyll fractions of pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton estimated from satellite remote sensing are in agreement with the current understanding of the biogeography of phytoplankton functional types in the global oceans. This study contributes to our understanding of the distribution and time evolution of phytoplankton size structure in the global oceans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Cunningham, S; Guzman, HM; Bates, R				Cunningham, Sarah; Guzman, Hector M.; Bates, Richard			The morphology and structure of the Hannibal Bank fisheries management zone, Pacific Panama using acoustic seabed mapping	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The Hannibal Bank sits within the Coiba UNESCO World Heritage Site in Pacific Panama and is also a fisheries management zone. Despite the protected status of the area and the importance of the Bank for commercial fish species such as snapper and tuna, the seamount has received no detailed survey except some collection of organisms. This study mapped the major topographic features and complexity of the Hannibal Bank seamount using acoustic remote sensing. A survey area of around 125km(2) was defined using existing charts and side-scan sonar data were collected during July 2008. A bathymetric output was imported to ArcGIS where a digital bathymetric model and slope map were created. The Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) extension for ArcGIS was used to calculate bathymetric position index and rugosity, and used to create a map of zones representing the various seabed morphology zones. The Hannibal bank is an elongated, triangular guyot (flat topped seamount), which ranges in depth from 53m to 416m, covers an area of 76km(2) and is 14.4km long and 7.1km wide. Hannibal bank is composed of steep slopes, more gentle slopes, top of the seamount, crests (elevated ridges at the top of the pinnacles), rugose areas (on crests, top of seamount and slope), gullies and pinnacles. The bank is asymmetric in nature with the Northerly side having a relatively gentle slope with gullies across the surface compared to the SouthWest side which is far steeper and more rugose. There are two pinnacles to the North and South East of the bank that range in depth from 180 to 333m. Rocky substrate makes up 22.6km(2) of the bank and sediment 37.8km(2). The bank and its steeply sided, rugose areas and pinnacles provide upright structures which can disrupt and topographically enhance currents, increasing productivity. The rugose areas of Hannibal Bank should be primary targets for further research efforts as they may contain corals and their rugosity indicates that these should be some of the highest faunal diversity areas of the bank. Hannibal Bank is likely to come increasing pressure in the future through climate change and fishing and this study has produced valuable information to assist in the future mapping and management of habitats, associated species and fisheries.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2013	61	4					1967	1979										WOS:000329534400031	24432547

In this study, we evaluated the applicability of hyperspectral imagery collected from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) for benthic habitat mapping in the Florida Keys. An overall accuracy of 84.3% and 86.7% was achieved respectively for a group-level (3-class) and code-level (12-class) classification by integrating object-based image analysis (OBIA), hyperspectral image processing methods, and machine learning algorithms. Accurate and informative object-based benthic habitat maps were produced. Three commonly used image correction procedures (atmospheric, sun-glint, and water-column corrections) were proved unnecessary for small area mapping in the Florida Keys. Inclusion of bathymetry data in the mapping procedure did not increase the classification accuracy. This study indicates that hyperspectral systems are promising in accurate benthic habitat mapping at a fine detail level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Singha, S; Bellerby, TJ; Trieschmann, O				Singha, Suman; Bellerby, Tim J.; Trieschmann, Olaf			Satellite Oil Spill Detection Using Artificial Neural Networks	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Oil spills represent a major threat to ocean ecosystems and their health. Illicit pollution requires continuous monitoring and satellite remote sensing technology represents an attractive option for operational oil spill detection. Previous studies have shown that active microwave satellite sensors, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be effectively used for the detection and classification of oil spills. Oil spills appear as dark spots in SAR images. However, similar dark spots may arise from a range of unrelated meteorological and oceanographic phenomena, resulting in misidentification. A major focus of research in this area is the development of algorithms to distinguish oil spills from 'look-alikes'. This paper describes the development of a new approach to SAR oil spill detection employing two different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), used in sequence. The first ANN segments a SAR image to identify pixels belonging to candidate oil spill features. A set of statistical feature parameters are then extracted and used to drive a second ANN which classifies objects into oil spills or look-alikes. The proposed algorithm was trained using 97 ERS-2 SAR and ENVSAT ASAR images of individual verified oil spills or/and look-alikes. The algorithm was validated using a large dataset comprising full-swath images and correctly identified 91.6% of reported oil spills and 98.3% of look-alike phenomena. The segmentation stage of the new technique outperformed the established edge detection and adaptive thresholding approaches. An analysis of feature descriptors highlighted the importance of image gradient information in the classification stage.																	1939-1404	2151-1535				DEC	2013	6	6					2355	2363		10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2251864								WOS:000327719600004						
J	Sutton, TT				Sutton, T. T.			Vertical ecology of the pelagic ocean: classical patterns and new perspectives	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Applications of acoustic and optical sensing and intensive, discrete-depth sampling, in concert with collaborative international research programmes, have substantially advanced knowledge of pelagic ecosystems in the 17years since the 1996 Deepwater Fishes Symposium of the Fisheries Society of the British Isles. Although the epipelagic habitat is the best-known, and remote sensing and high-resolution modelling allow near-synoptic investigation of upper layer biophysical dynamics, ecological studies within the mesopelagic and deep-demersal habitats have begun to link lower and upper trophic level processes. Bathypelagic taxonomic inventories are far from complete, but recent projects (e.g. MAR-ECO and CMarZ, supported by the Census of Marine Life programme) have quantitatively strengthened distribution patterns previously described for fishes and have provided new perspectives. Synthesis of net and acoustic studies suggests that the biomass of deep-pelagic fishes may be two to three orders of magnitude greater than the total global commercial fisheries landings. Discrete-depth net sampling has revealed relatively high pelagic fish biomass below 1000m in some regions, and that gelatinous zooplankton may be key energy vectors for deep-pelagic fish production. Lastly, perhaps, the most substantive paradigm shift is that vertical connectivity among fishes across classical depth zones is prevalent- suggesting that a whole-water column approach is warranted for deep ocean conservation and management.																	0022-1112	1095-8649				DEC	2013	83	6					1508	1527		10.1111/jfb.12263								WOS:000327713800002	24298949					
J	Barrell, J; Grant, J				Barrell, Jeffrey; Grant, Jon			Detecting hot and cold spots in a seagrass landscape using local indicators of spatial association	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is an important feature of coastal ecosystems in Atlantic Canada, providing a suite of valuable ecosystem services. These services, and its sensitivity to stressors, have prompted efforts to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of eelgrass landscapes in order to facilitate management and monitoring of coastal ecosystem health. Current methods for broad-scale mapping of eelgrass rely on aerial remote sensing and may not be appropriate in certain types of landscapes, particularly in turbid waters and areas lacking distinct boundaries. This study takes a novel approach to the quantification and analysis of seagrass landscape structure at multiple spatial scales using acoustic data and local spatial statistics. Data from a single-beam acoustic survey in Richibucto, New Brunswick, Canada were analyzed with geostatistical techniques and the Getis-Ord G (i) (*) local spatial statistic in order to detect statistically significant zones of high and low cover in an estuarine seagrass bed. Results showed distinct and significant patterns in seagrass cover at multiple spatial scales within a region of apparently continuous spatial cover. Boundaries between areas of high and low cover were also detected. This study demonstrates how acoustic data and local spatial statistics can be used to quantify landscape pattern and to further the application of landscape techniques in the marine environment.

In the United States, such satellites are a cornerstone of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), required to carry out advanced coastal and ocean research, and to implement and sustain sensible resource management policies based on science. Satellite imagery and satellite-derived data are required for mapping vital coastal and marine resources, improving maritime domain awareness, and to better understand the complexities of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice, biological, and social interactions. These data are critical to the strategic planning of in situ observing components and are critical to improving forecasting and numerical modeling. Specifically, there are several stakeholder communities that require periodic, frequent, and sustained synoptic observations. Of particular importance are indicators of ecosystem structure (habitat and species inventories), ecosystem states (health and change) and observations about physical and biogeochemical variables to support the operational and research communities, and industry sectors including mining, fisheries, and transportation. IOOS requires a strategy to coordinate the human capacity, and fund, advance, and maintain the infrastructure that provides improved remote sensing observations and support for the nation and the globe. A partnership between the private, government, and education sectors will enhance remote sensing support and product development for critical coastal and deep-water regions based on infrared, ocean color, and microwave satellite sensors. These partnerships need to include international research, government, and industry sectors in order to facilitate open data access, understanding of calibration and algorithm strategies, and fill gaps in coverage. Such partnerships will define the types of observations required to sustain vibrant coastal economies and to improve the health of our marine and coastal ecosystems. They are required to plan, fund, launch and operate the types of satellite sensors needed in the very near future to maintain continuity of observations.

R.; Lorente, Flavio Lima			The growth of the Doce River Delta in northeastern Brazil indicated by sedimentary facies and diatoms	DIATOM RESEARCH												The combination of diatom analyses with sedimentary facies has been limited in studies aimed at reconstructing paleoenvironments and the history of sea-level fluctuations in coastal settings. The present study integrated facies and diatom analyses, together with C-14 dating and geomorphological information derived from remote sensing, to analyze the Quaternary deposits of a paleoestuary nearby the Doce River Delta in northeastern Brazil. The goal was to demonstrate the potential of diatoms as a paleoenvironmental proxy and improve the history of Holocene sea-level fluctuations in that region. The deposits, ranging from 7425-7509 to 1313-405 cal yr bp, were arranged in an overall regressive succession recorded by the upward superposition of estuarine channel, estuarine central basin, lake/ria and fluvial channel/marsh facies associations. Marine, marine/brackish and freshwater diatoms were found in these deposits. The highest concentration of diatoms was associated with the low-energy estuarine central basin deposits formed when the relative sea level was high. In the mid-Holocene, ca. 5000 cal yr bp, the coastline began its progradation due to a relative drop in sea level. This change in coastal dynamics was marked by a decrease in the concentration of diatoms and the prevalence of freshwater species over marine and marine/brackish water species. As a result of the Doce River Delta progradation, the studied estuarine channel was closed due to the accumulation of sand as beach ridges and barriers at the river mouth, a process that ultimately led to the estuary being replaced by a lake/ria.

These models incorporate the population structure and dynamics of marine organisms at all trophic levels. Satellite remote sensing of ocean colour and direct at-sea measurements provide information on the lower trophic levels of the models, and fisheries studies provide information on top predator species. However, these models suffer from a lack of observations for the so-called mid-trophic levels, which are poorly sampled by conventional methods. This restricts further development, and we argue that acoustic observations from a range of platforms (e.g. buoys, moorings) can be linked to the ecosystem models to provide much-needed information on these trophic levels. To achieve this, the models need to be tailored to incorporate the available acoustic data, and the link from acoustic backscatter to biologically relevant variables (biomass, carbon, etc.) needs attention. Methods to progress this issue are proposed, including the development of observation models and focal areas for ground truthing. To ensure full use of the potential of acoustic techniques, we argue that a systematic and long-term strategy incorporating the following elements is required: development of metadata standards and automated data analysis, inclusion of acoustic sensors in large-scale observatory programmes, improvement of observation-model links, and efficient sampling strategies. Finally, these elements should be tied together in an observation-modelling framework, coordinated by international organizations, to improve our understanding and quantification of open-ocean ecosystem dynamics.

J	Klemas, V				Klemas, Victor			Fisheries applications of remote sensing: An overview	FISHERIES RESEARCH												During the past 40 years the fisheries productivity of the world has been declining due to pressures from overfishing, habitat change, pollution, and climate change. Sustainable use of marine resources requires effective monitoring and management of the world's fish stocks. Remote sensing techniques are being used to help manage fisheries at sustainable levels, while also guiding fishing fleets to locate fish schools more efficiently. Fish tend to aggregate in ocean areas that exhibit conditions favored by specific fish species. Some of the relevant oceanographic conditions, such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (productivity) and oceanic fronts, which strongly influence natural fluctuations of fish stocks, can be observed and measured by remote sensors on satellites and aircraft. The remotely sensed data are provided in near-real time to help fishermen save fuel and ship time during their search for fish; to modelers who produce fisheries forecasts; and to scientists who help develop strategies for sustainable fisheries management. This article describes how acoustic, optical and radar sensors on ships, satellites and aircraft are used with forecast models to improve the management and harvesting of fisheries resources.

The regional benthic habitat map indicates 8844 km(2) of reefs (earlier estimates from remote sensing were around 500 km(2)) and 20,904 km(2) of rhodolith habitat-the world's largest continuous bed. Integration of the regional megahabitat map with spatially explicit data on the distribution of marine protected areas (< 0.2% of each benthic megahabitat area) and economic activities with the highest potential of environmental impact (fishing, mining, oil and gas exploitation and dredging) reveals the need of a regional scale spatial planning process engaging conflicting sectors.

J	Uhl, F; Oppelt, N; Bartsch, I				Uhl, Florian; Oppelt, Natascha; Bartsch, Inka			Spectral mixture of intertidal marine macroalgae around the island of Helgoland (Germany, North Sea)	AQUATIC BOTANY												The monitoring of emersed and submersed aquatic macrophytes using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing is an innovative method to identify and quantify algal populations at a landscape scale. In general, a high spectral resolution means that one has to accept a lower spatial resolution. This is often considered problematic for the mapping of patchily distributed intertidal macroalgal vegetation. Analysis of sub-pixel information of visually dominant algal species and vegetation units and their respective coverage is therefore of great interest. In this context, it is necessary to analyze the spectral and spatial mixture of macroalgae. This paper presents an experimental laboratory approach to analyze the spectral reflectance characteristics as well as the spectral mixture behaviour of common biomass-dominant macroalgae growing at the intertidal rocky shores of Helgoland (North Sea, Germany). It became evident that unmixing of spectral signatures can hardly be performed between species of the same genus or family due to their strong spectral analogies. At a higher taxonomic level, however, red-, green- and brown algae can be distinguished as groups via derivative analysis as well as with spectral slope calculation between specific wavelengths in the 400-680 nm spectral region. Both methods described the spectral mixing behaviour with high accuracy (Pearson's R-2 > 0.8). The newly introduced linear slope unmixing achieved best unmixing results in comparison to two state-of-the-art unmixing approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The eStation, an Earth Observation processing service in support to ecological monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The eStation is a collecting and processing system designed to automatically deal with the reception, processing, analysis and dissemination of key environmental parameters derived from remotely sensed data. Developed mainly at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the eStation has been distributed to 47 sub-Saharan countries in the frame of the AMESD (African Monitoring of Environment for Sustainable Development) project to provide local institutions with the capacity to easily access a large range of remote sensing products on vegetation, precipitation, fires and oceans. These products, derived from the processing of images coming from various instruments including SPOT-Vegetation, MSG-SEVIRI and MODIS are developed to allow end-users to make local and regional assessments of the state of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The products, dispatched to the users through the EUMETSAT data broadcasting system (EUMETCast) or provided by other Earth Observation (EO) data agencies (e.g. NASA), are further processed by the eStation to allow end-users to generate their own environmental, whether terrestrial or marine, assessments and reports. Initially designed as a stand-alone system using an open source development framework, the eStation has recently been further developed as a web processing service to allow a broader range of end-users to access the data and services over the Internet. It is the purpose of this paper to introduce the readers to the eStation and its products, to share the lessons learnt in deploying these services as well as to discuss its more recent use in chained environmental web based modeling services.

Compared with ship surveys, monitoring oil spills through remote sensing has real-time, comprehensive, low-cost advantages, which can effectively guide cleaning and evaluation, and reduce themarine ecological destruction resulting from oil spills. Therefore, studying the remote sensing mechanism used to monitor marine oil spills is of great significance for ecological environmental protection. This paper describes an experiment and corresponding analysis based on the above-water method, using the East China Sea coastal turbid water. The analysis shows that "upward short-wave" in ultraviolet and blue-purple bands and its displacement, along with the changing thickness, are important characteristics for distinguishing between the oil slick and the sea water, and also to differentiate oil slicks of different thicknesses. Fromblue to near-infrared bands, the spectrum of lube oil is flatter than that of diesel, and the diesel spectrum rises faster than the lube spectrum on the right side of the trough at 400 nm. These two features for man important basis for differentiating diesel from lube oil. These analyses will further the development of oil spill remote sensing in the East China Sea.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				NOV	2013	32	11					34	40		10.1007/s13131-013-0375-4								WOS:000327079700005						
J	Shi, W; Wang, MH; Jiang, LD				Shi, Wei; Wang, Menghua; Jiang, Lide			Tidal effects on ecosystem variability in the Chesapeake Bay from MODIS-Aqua	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Eight-year ocean color observations between 2002 and 2009 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the satellite Aqua are used to quantitatively assess the tidal effects on variability of ocean's optical, biological, and biogeochemical properties in the Chesapeake Bay. We demonstrate that tidal variation in the lower Chesapeake Bay is one of the important ocean processes that drive significant changes of the ocean's optical and biogeochemical properties. Normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nL(w)(lambda)), water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), and total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration show significant tidal variations in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Indeed, in the lower Bay region, K-d(490) increases from 0.9 m(-1) under low tidal current conditions at 0.10-0.15 m/s to 1.35 m(-1) under high tidal current conditions at 0.45-0.50 m/s, while chlorophyll-a concentration in the lower Bay region decreases slightly with an increase of the tidal current. Tide-driven variability in K-d(490) and TSS in the lower Bay is similar to and slightly larger than the seasonal variability in the region. On the other hand, different from the variability in the lower Bay, the tidal effects on the ecosystem are small and negligible in the middle and a large part of upper Chesapeake Bay regions.

The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image covers about 400 km x 400 km of a coastal area of the Yellow Sea. The sea surface imprints of AGW show the patterns of both a transverse wave along the coastal plain and a diverging wave in the lee of Mount Laoshan (1133-m peak), which indicate that terrain forcing affects the formation of AGW. The AGW have a wavelength of 8-10 km and extend about 100 km offshore. Model simulation shows that these waves have an amplitude over 3 km. Finer-scale (similar to 2 km) brushlike roughness features perpendicular to the coast are also observed, and they are interpreted as MABL rolls. The FFT analysis shows that the roll wavelengths vary spatially. The two-way interactive, triply nested grid (9-3-1 km) Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulation reproduces AGW-generated wind perturbations that are in phase at all levels, reaching up to the 700-hPa level for the diverging AGW and the 900-hPa level for the transverse AGW. The WRF simulation also reveals that dynamic instability, rather than thermodynamic instability, is the cause for the MABL roll generation. Differences in atmospheric inflection-point level and instability at different locations are reasons why the roll wavelengths vary spatially.

In this study, we added a physical parameter, sea surface nitrate (SSN) estimated from satellite remote sensing data, to develop a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) for hanging cultures of Japanese kelp in southern Hokkaido, Japan. The local algorithm to estimate SSN was developed using satellite measurements of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a. We found a high correlation between satellite-and ship-measured data (r(2) = 0.87, RMSE = 1.39). Multi-criteria evaluation was adapted to the SASSM to rank sites on a scale of 1 (least suitable) to 8 (most suitable). Wefound that 64.4% of the areas were suitable (score above 7). Minamikayabe was identified as the most suitable area, and Funka Bay also contained potential aquaculture sites. In addition, we examined the impact of El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on Japanese kelp aquaculture and site suitability from 2003-2010. During El Nino events, the number of suitable areas (scores 7 and 8) decreased significantly, indicating that climatic conditions should be considered for future development of marine aquaculture.

The global ocean model employed is based upon the ocean general circulation model of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A sequential data assimilation scheme within the framework of 3D variational (3DVar) analysis, called multi-grid 3DVar, is implemented in 3D space for retrieving multiple-scale observational information. Assimilated oceanic observations include sea level anomalies (SLAs) from multi-altimeters, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from remote sensing satellites, and in-situ temperature/salinity profiles. Evaluation showed that compared to the model simulation, the annual mean heat content of the global reanalysis is significantly approaching that of World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA09) data. The quality of the global temperature climatology was found to be comparable with the product of Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA), and the major ENSO events were reconstructed. The global and Atlantic meridional overturning circulations showed some similarity as SODA, although significant differences were found to exist. The analysis of temperature and salinity in the current version has relatively larger errors at high latitudes and improvements are ongoing in an updated version. CORA was found to provide a simulation of the subsurface current in the equatorial Pacific with a correlation coefficient beyond about 0.6 compared with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) mooring data. The mean difference of SLAs between altimetry data and CORA was less than 0.1 m in most years.

Analyzing measurements from radiosondes, in-situ and remote sensing systems, it was found that within the lower part of the stable MABL, intermittent and persistent LLJ events were frequently observed. Evidence is presented implying that the analyzed jet case was induced by the interaction of a slow-moving cyclone over north-eastern U.S.A. and the stationary high pressure system over the Atlantic Ocean, as well as by the sloping inversion of the MABL. Focused on a 5-day period of persistent south-westerly (marine) flow, the analysis of sodar and radiosonde data revealed the presence of a stable layer associated with increased static stability just before the emergence of low-level flow acceleration. As indicated by the Richardson number profiles, the increased stability of the lower MABL suppressed turbulence, allowed the decoupling of LLJ from friction, providing a favourable environment for the development of inertial oscillations. Significant amplitudes of inertial motions, which were confirmed by the application of a Hilbert-Huang transform, are associated with the acceleration at the LLJ's core, due to the frontal events and the subsequent frictional decoupling, both leading to a modification of the large-scale flow structure.

The technique incorporates the enforcement of any given statistical wave law modeling the quasi-Gaussianity of oceanic waves observed in nature. The problem is posed in a variational optimization framework, where the desired waveform is obtained as the minimizer of a cost functional that combines image observations, smoothness priors and a weak statistical constraint. The minimizer is obtained by combining gradient descent and multigrid methods on the necessary optimality equations of the cost functional. Robust photometric error criteria and a spatial intensity compensation model are also developed to improve the performance of the presented image matching strategy. The weak statistical constraint is thoroughly evaluated in combination with other elements presented to reconstruct and enforce constraints on experimental stereo data, demonstrating the improvement in the estimation of the observed ocean surface.

Scientists have managed to study it using various mathematical models with different degrees of complexity. However, these conventional modelling approaches are limited due to the complexity of the processes involved, the scarcity of data and spatial heterogeneity. In this study, hybrid soft computing (SC) algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithms (GA) and cellular automata (CA) are illustrated and then employed to model chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in Bohai Bay, China, with two models. In the first model, SVM tuned by GA (GA-SVM) is developed to model Chl-a for its greater capacity in dealing with nonlinear complex relationships. Then, in order to take into account the spatial heterogeneity and local interaction of the blooms, an integrated model of CA and SVM (CA-SVM) has been developed to model Chl-a in Bohai Bay using remote sensing data. Through this study, it can be observed that the hybrid SC approach is the prefered tool to predict the concentration of Chl-a in Bohai Bay, and capture the non-linear information in ecological processes. This work should be helpful in understanding marine ecological processes, protecting coastal aquatic ecosystem and marine management.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				OCT	2013	15	4					1099	1108		10.2166/hydro.2012.146								WOS:000326902800005

However, the accuracy of numerical models is not always good enough to provide reliable information for oil spill transport. It is necessary to analyze and identify major error sources for the models. A case study was conducted to analyze error sources of a three-dimensional oil spill model that was used operationally for oil spill forecasting in the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC), the State Oceanic Administration, China. On June 4, 2011, oil from sea bed spilled into seawater in Penglai 19-3 region, the largest offshore oil field of China, and polluted an area of thousands of square kilometers in the Bohai Sea. Satellite remote sensing images were collected to locate oil slicks. By performing a series of model sensitivity experiments with different wind and current forcings and comparing the model results with the satellite images, it was identified that the major errors of the long-term simulation for oil spill transport were from the wind fields, and the wind-induced surface currents. An inverse model was developed to estimate the temporal variability of emission intensity at the oil spill source, which revealed the importance of the accuracy in oil spill source emission time function.

Spectral properties of natural and oil polluted Baltic seawater - results of measurements and modelling	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS												Seawater in addition to natural components such as living and non-living organic matter contains also components artificially introduced into the marine environment, such as oil substances. These components, present in the surface layer of the sea, can significantly affect radiative transfer processes. Therefore, taking into account these processes in remote sensing measurements can improve assessment of the environment. To improve local seawater optical models, it is necessary to measure the luminescence properties of all components of seawater as well as the water leaving radiance values. Additionally, substances which form the surface microlayer (surfactants - surface active agents) can affect both the dynamic characteristics of the fluxes (in particular the gas exchange and marine aerosol production) as well as inherent optical properties of surface seawater. This paper contains both the results of research focused on introducing of an efficient method for identifying oils by their fluorescence spectra as well as a marine experiment on the identification of luminescent properties of surfactants - sampled in different regions of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, the aim of the presented study is to assess the impact of the oil emulsion to spectral water leaving signal.

Aerosol size distributions, particle concentrations, and optical properties are examined as a function of altitude and distance from cloud, at ambient relative humidity (RH) and adjusted to a constant RH to isolate effects of humidification from other processes.The cloud humidity halo extended about 1500-2000 m from the cloud edge, with no clear altitude dependence on horizontal extent over an altitude range of 600-1700 m. The combined effects of vertical transport of aerosol by clouds and cloud processing contributed to the modification of aerosol size distributions within the clouds' humidity halos, particularly close to the cloud boundaries. Backscatter at 532 nm, calculated from the aerosol properties, exhibited no distinguishable trend with altitude within 400 m of cloud edges, increased toward lower altitudes beyond 400 m, and decreased away from cloud boundaries at all altitudes. The mean aerosol diameter was found to rapidly decline from 0.8 to 0.4 m from near the cloud boundary to the boundary of the humidity halo. Aerosol optical depth at 532 nm within the layer between 600 and 1700 m increased near exponentially from 0.02 to 0.2 toward the cloud boundaries within the humidity halo. These trends agreed qualitatively with past space-based lidar measurements of trade wind cloud margins, although quantitative differences were noted that likely arose from different sampling strategies and other factors.

This paper focuses on characterizing the source origins, transport processes, and vertical distributions of the Asian continental outflows over the region, using measurements including mass concentration, optical properties, hygroscopicity, and vertical distribution of the aerosol particles, as well as the trace gas composition. Cluster analysis of backward trajectories classified 52% of the air masses arriving at ground level of Dongsha Island as having a continental origin, mainly from northern China to the northern SCS, passing the coastal area and being confined in the marine boundary layer (0-0.5 km). Compared to aerosols of oceanic origin, the fine mode continental aerosols have a higher concentration, extinction coefficient, and single-scattering albedo at 550 nm (i.e., 19 vs. 14 mu g m(-3) in PM2.5; 77 vs. 59 Mm(-1) in beta(e); and 0.94 vs. 0.90 in omega, respectively). These aerosols have a higher hygroscopicity (f at 85% RH = 2.1) than those in the upwind inland regions, suggesting that the aerosols transported to the northern SCS were modified by the marine environment. In addition to the near-surface aerosol transport, a significant upper-layer (3-4 km) transport of biomass-burning aerosols was observed. Our results suggest that emissions from both China and Southeast Asia could have a significant impact on the aerosol loading and other aerosol properties over the SCS. Furthermore, the complex vertical distribution of aerosols-coinciding-with-clouds has implications for remote-sensing observations and aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ISME JOURNAL												Understanding the variability of marine biodiversity is a central issue in microbiology. Current observational programs are based on in situ studies, but their implementation at the global scale is particularly challenging, owing to the ocean extent, its temporal variability and the heterogeneity of the data sources on which compilations are built. Here, we explore the possibility of identifying phytoplanktonic biodiversity hotspots from satellite. We define a Shannon entropy index based on patchiness in ocean color bio-optical anomalies. This index provides a high resolution (1 degree) global coverage. It shows a relation to temperature and mid-latitude maxima in accordance with those previously evidenced in microbiological biodiversity model and observational studies. Regional maxima are in remarkable agreement with several known biodiversity hotspots for plankton organisms and even for higher levels of the marine trophic chain, as well as with some in situ planktonic biodiversity estimates (from Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise). These results encourage to explore marine biodiversity with a coordinated effort of the molecular, ecological and remote sensing communities.

Filling the "white ribbon' - a multisource seamless digital elevation model for Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Hydrographers have traditionally referred to the nearshore area as the white ribbon' area due to the challenges associated with the collection of elevation data (elevation hereafter refers to both topography and bathymetry) in this highly dynamic transitional zone between terrestrial and marine environments. Accordingly, available information in this zone is typically characterized by a range of data sets from disparate sources. In this article, we propose a framework to fill the white ribbon area of a coral reef system by integrating multiple elevation data sets acquired by a suite of remote-sensing technologies into a seamless digital elevation model (DEM). A range of data sets are integrated, including field-collected global positioning system (GPS) elevation points, topographic and bathymetric light detecting and ranging (lidar), single and multibeam echosoundings, nautical charts, and bathymetry derived from optical remote-sensing imagery. The proposed framework ranks data reliability internally, thereby avoiding the requirements to quantify absolute error and results in a high-resolution, seamless product. Nested within this approach is an effective spatially explicit technique for improving the accuracy of bathymetry estimates derived empirically from optical satellite imagery through modelling the spatial structure of residuals. The approach was applied to data collected on and around Lizard Island in northern Australia. Collectively, the framework holds promise for filling the white ribbon zone in coastal areas characterized by similar data availability scenarios.

The semi-automated classification of acoustic imagery for characterizing coral reef ecosystems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Coral reef habitat maps describe the spatial distribution and abundance of tropical marine resources, making them essential for ecosystem-based approaches to planning and management. Typically, these habitat maps have been created from optical and acoustic remotely sensed imagery using manual, pixel- and object-based classification methods. However, past studies have shown that none of these classification methods alone are optimal for characterizing coral reef habitats for multiple management applications because the maps they produce (1) are not synoptic, (2) are time consuming to develop, (3) have low thematic resolutions (i.e. number of classes), or (4) have low overall thematic accuracies. To address these deficiencies, a novel, semi-automated object- and pixel-based technique was applied to multibeam echo sounder imagery to determine its utility for characterizing coral reef ecosystems. This study is not a direct comparison of these different methods but rather, a first attempt at applying a new classification technique to acoustic imagery. This technique used a combination of principal components analysis, edge-based segmentation, and Quick, Unbiased, and Efficient Statistical Trees (QUEST) to successfully partition the acoustic imagery into 35 distinct combinations of (1) major and (2) detailed geomorphological structure, (3) major and (4) detailed biological cover, and (5) live coral cover types. Thematic accuracies for these classes (corrected for proportional bias) were as follows: (1) 95.7%, (2) 88.7%, (3) 95.0%, (4) 74.0%, and (5) 88.3%, respectively. Approximately half of the habitat polygons were manually edited (hence the name semi-automated') due to a combination of mis-classifications by QUEST and noise in the acoustic data. While this method did not generate a map that was entirely reproducible, it does show promise for increasing the amount of automation with which thematically accurate benthic habitat maps can be generated from acoustic imagery.																	0143-1161	1366-5901				SEP 20	2013	34	18			SI		6389	6422		10.1080/01431161.2013.800661								WOS:000321170600007						
J	Goyens, C; Jamet, C; Ruddick, KG				Goyens, C.; Jamet, C.; Ruddick, K. G.			Spectral relationships for atmospheric correction. I. Validation of red and near infra-red marine reflectance relationships	OPTICS EXPRESS												The present study provides an extensive overview of red and near infra-red (NIR) spectral relationships found in the literature and used to constrain red or NIR-modeling schemes in current atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms with the aim to improve water-leaving reflectance retrievals, rho(w)(lambda), in turbid waters. However, most of these spectral relationships have been developed with restricted datasets and, subsequently, may not be globally valid, explaining the need of an accurate validation exercise. Spectral relationships are validated here with turbid in situ data for rho(w)(lambda). Functions estimating rho(w)(lambda) in the red were only valid for moderately turbid waters (rho(w)(lambda(NIR)) < 3.10(-3)). In contrast, bounding equations used to limit rho(w)(667) retrievals according to the water signal at 555 nm, appeared to be valid for all turbidity ranges presented in the in situ dataset. In the NIR region of the spectrum, the constant NIR reflectance ratio suggested by Ruddick et al. (2006) (Limnol. Oceanogr. 51, 1167-1179), was valid for moderately to very turbid waters (rho(w)(lambda(NIR)) < 10(-2)) while the polynomial function, initially developed by Wang et al. (2012) (Opt. Express 20, 741-753) with remote sensing reflectances over the Western Pacific, was also valid for extremely turbid waters (rho(w)(lambda(NIR)) > 10(-2)). The results of this study suggest to use the red bounding equations and the polynomial NIR function to constrain red or NIR-modeling schemes in AC processes with the aim to improve rho(w)(lambda) retrievals where current AC algorithms fail.

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Detection, handling, and selection of prey are key features of suspension-feeding copepods. Using high-speed video, we determined detection distances and durations of all elements of the food gathering process in two small calanoid copepods, Paracalanus parvus and Pseudocalanus sp. Animals were freely swimming and presented with various phytoplankton species with equivalent spherical diameters ranging from 7 mu m to 33 mu m. Prey detection occurred very close-within a few cell radii-to the second antennae (53% of the cases) or the maxilliped (42%). There was no effect of prey size on detection distance, but larger prey caused a significantly longer handling time. Post-detection processing of the cells was exceedingly fast. The time from detection to the cell being placed at the mouth lasted 35 +/- 19 ms and rejection of unwanted cells 61 +/- 21 ms. Grooming of antennules and carapace occurred intermittently and lasted 215-227 ms. The weak feeding current and fast response of the copepods allowed ample time for detection of cells entrained in the feeding current and no distant olfaction was observed. Modeled effect of cell size on cell surface concentration of cue chemicals show that only cells with a radius larger than similar to 15 mu m may be detected chemically and that only very much larger and/or very leaky cells can be detected at distance. Copepods have elaborate and exceedingly fast handling techniques that allow effective prey detection and capture, but there is no evidence of remote chemically mediated sensing when feeding on algal cells up to a size of 35 mu m.

Rocky shore ecosystems comprise a mosaic of habitat types and therefore require good technology to extract fine-scale spatial data on habitat extent and quality. Airborne topographic light detection and ranging data and 0.1-m resolution digital aerial photography were used to map and quantify distinct habitats that influence the distribution of biodiversity on rocky shores. The objectives of this study were to create and test the accuracy of a classification system for the rocky shore habitat, to develop remote sensing techniques useful for the conservation of intertidal rocky shores, and to create detailed digital terrain models for five headlands in the Solitary Island Marine Park, mid-north coast, New South Wales, Australia. The intertidal rocky shore habitats were classified according to tidal heights and substrate type. Ground-truthing of remote sensing data was carried out by visual surveys during low tide. Error assessments using precision analysis and classification accuracy tests confirmed the reliability of the technique with <5% error. The data generated from this research can be used as a platform for spatial analysis of this environment, including modelling changes in biodiversity under different climate change scenarios.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2013	29	5					1184	1190		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00142.1								WOS:000326304800020

Following radiative transfer theory, K-d is a function of angular distribution of incident light and water's absorption and backscattering coefficients. Because these optical products are now generated routinely from satellite measurements, it is logical to evolve the empirical K-d to a semianalytical K-d that is not only spectrally flexible, but also the sun-angle effect is accounted for explicitly. Here, the semianalytical model developed in Lee et al. (2005b) is revised to account for the shift of phase function between molecular and particulate scattering from the short to long wavelengths. Further, using field data collected independently from oligotrophic ocean to coastal waters covering >99% of the K-d range for the global oceans, the semianalytically derived K-d was evaluated and found to agree with measured data within approximate to 7-26%. The updated processing system was applied to MODIS measurements to reveal the penetration of UVA-visible radiation in the global oceans, where an empirical procedure to correct Raman effect was also included. The results indicated that the penetration of the blue-green radiation for most oceanic waters is approximate to 30-40% deeper than the commonly used euphotic zone depth; and confirmed that at a depth of 50-70 m there is still approximate to 10% of the surface UVA radiation (at 360 nm) in most oligotrophic waters. The results suggest a necessity to modify or expand the light attenuation product from satellite ocean-color measurements in order to be more applicable for studies of ocean physics and biogeochemistry.

Investigation of these pollution types is beneficial for oil spill recovery and processing. Optical remote sensing techniques play an important role in marine oil spill monitoring and have the ability to identify different oil spill pollution types. Recently, research on oil spill optical remote sensing has made much progress in detecting targets, identifying spectral response characteristics, and formulating theories. Floating black oil, oil slicks, and oil-water mixture in marine oil spill accidents are the main targets to be investigated by optical remote sensors. The visible spectral response differences of these targets are the base of oil spill optical remote sensing research. Bi-directional reflectance distribution function, light interference, absorption, and scattering of targets produce different spectra. Therefore, oil spill optical remote sensing could be used to identify the main oil spill pollution types and estimate oil spill volume.

This is the first attempt to use remote sensing to study MPB in an ecosystem with a Mediterranean-like climate. Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images were used to map benthic microalgae through the application of a Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI). A significant relationship between in-situ benthic chlorophyll a measurements and SPOT NDVI values was used to derive a map for biomass spatial distribution. At the scale of the whole intertidal area, NDVI time-series from 2003 revealed that MPB showed clear temporal variations, with lower values observed in summer compared to winter. This seasonal trend was found both in the SPOT and MERIS images and may be the result of extreme high temperatures that inhibit MPB growth. The main MPB biofilms were spatially stable through time at a large scale. Maximum NDVI values during the winter were found in the high shore with decreasing NDVI values towards the low shore. MPB light limitation at the lowest bathymetries is likely to occur in winter due to the high turbidity of Tagus estuary. The biomass spatial distribution map, obtained for January 2003, indicated low values ranging from 0 to 20 mg Chl a m(-2) for the lower shores, while in the upper shore biomass varied between 60 and 80 mg Chl a m(-2). This study suggests striking differences in MPB seasonal patterns between the northern and southern European estuaries and stresses the need for ecophysiological approaches to investigate the role of thermo- and photo-inhibition as structuring factors for MPB biomass distribution.

Until now, reports on damages caused by storms and hurricanes on seagrass beds are uncommon and highly variable. The seagrass meadows of the East end of Jardines de la Reina archipelago were surveyed from Nov. 29th to Dec. 5th of 2008, in order to determinate the effects from the passing of Hurricane Paloma: a category three storm on the Saffir-Simpsom scale. A rapid field assessment of the affected areas was carried out using the manta tow technique. In six sites, seagrass was quantitatively evaluated using a 15cm diameter core (four sampling units per site) and shoot density was calculated. Remote sensing techniques were used to estimate seagrass cover. To estimate the percentage of affected areas, a Region of Interest (ROI) was first created over a Landsat image. The percentage of seagrass affected within the ROI was estimated through direct georeferentiation of the contours of the damaged area and with a comparison to the total seagrass extension. To find possible explanations for damages, a false colour image was created using the near infrared band, to highlight the differences between emerged and submerged zones. The direction of winds was estimated using ArcGis 9.2 creating circular buffers, from the centre of the hurricane and generating lines tangent to the buffers. Seagrass in the region was dominated by the angiosperm Thalassia testudinum. Regional mean density was 1 321 +/- 721 shoots/m(2), a value regarded as high for the Caribbean area. Seagrass meadows were partly affected by sediment accumulation on the shoots of T testudinum and uprooting rhizomes. The 7.6km(2) disturbed area represented 1% of the total seagrass area. Other sites, closer to the centre of the hurricane, did not show any damages on the marine vegetation. The keys location with respect to the hurricane track was the most likely cause of the effects. To the North of the affected area there is an opening among the keys where the generation of waves, currents and turbulence could have occurred. Three years after the hurricane event, both vegetation cover loss and silt re-colonization by macroalgae species were observed within the affected area, by showing a patchily-vegetated landscape. This site is currently undergoing a temporal succession whose assessment demands a monitoring scheme, that will provide interesting information to document its future evolution and responsiveness against upcoming natural or anthropogenic events.																	0034-7744					SEP	2013	61	3					1425	1432										WOS:000324509200033	24027933

The destructive impact such phenomena have on marine and freshwater systems threaten aquaculture, agriculture and tourism industries on a global scale (Bernard, 2010, unpublished). An innovative research project, Safe Waters Earth Observation Systems (SWEOS) proposes the use of space-based remote sensing techniques, coupled with in-situ radiometric technology to offer a powerful and potentially cost effective method of addressing algal bloom related hazards. The work presented in this paper focuses on the decision making processes involved in the development of autonomous bio-optical sensors whose purpose includes, but is not limited to; water constituent monitoring, satellite calibration validation and ocean colour satellite product matchups. Several criteria including cost, optical throughput, linearity and spectral sensitivity were examined in an attempt to choose the detector best suited for its intended application. The CMOS based module tested in the laboratory experiments that was found to have produced the best performance-cost ratio was chosen for integration into the in-water radiometric device built and tested at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) (Ramkilowan et al. 2012, unpublished).

Fifty years of changes in reef flat habitats of the Grand R,cif of Toliara (SW Madagascar) and the impact of gleaning	CORAL REEFS												The Grand R,cif of Toliara (GRT) in Madagascar is a large (33 km(2)) barrier reef system of the SW Indian Ocean that had been well investigated in the 1960s and early 1970s. A massive degradation of the reef has been reported since at least the early 1980s, just a few years after research activities ceased in the area. Examination of historical aerial photographs and modern high-resolution remote sensing images confirms a continuous loss of coral habitat on GRT outer reef flats between 1962 and 2011, with an average loss of 65 % and a range of 37-79 % loss during this 50-year period. The usual suspects of coral community declines (cyclones, bleaching and sedimentation) may have contributed to the demise of the GRT. However, an independent study (Salimo 1997) suggests that the chronic pressure of fisherman gleaning on reef flats with destructive tools is the main driver of the observed changes. Salimo's reported level of frequentation (6.8 fishermen per day and per km(-2)) and rates of destruction per fisherman (7.7 m(2) of coral habitat h(-1)) yield a cumulated overall loss in agreement with the image-based rates of habitat loss. The GRT is unlikely to recover because this chronic stress is unlikely to decrease in the near future. Indeed, the GRT daily provides subsistence fishery resources for local Vezo people and to agriculturalist or pastoralist ethnic groups who have turned to exploiting coastal resources due to increasing aridity and dwindling agricultural and livestock production.

J	Caras, T; Karnieli, A				Caras, T.; Karnieli, A.			Ground-level spectroscopy analyses and classification of coral reefs using a hyperspectral camera	CORAL REEFS												With the general aim of classification and mapping of coral reefs, remote sensing has traditionally been more difficult to implement in comparison with terrestrial equivalents. Images used for the marine environment suffer from environmental limitation (water absorption, scattering, and glint); sensor-related limitations (spectral and spatial resolution); and habitat limitation (substrate spectral similarity). Presented here is an advanced approach for ground-level surveying of a coral reef using a hyperspectral camera (400-1,000 nm) that is able to address all of these limitations. Used from the surface, the image includes a white reference plate that offers a solution for correcting the water column effect. The imaging system produces millimeter size pixels and 80 relevant bands. The data collected have the advantages of both a field point spectrometer (hyperspectral resolution) and a digital camera (spatial resolution). Finally, the availability of pure pixel imagery significantly improves the potential for substrate recognition in comparison with traditionally used remote sensing mixed pixels. In this study, an image of a coral reef table in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, was classified, demonstrating the benefits of this technology for the first time. Preprocessing includes testing of two normalization approaches, three spectral resolutions, and two spectral ranges. Trained classification was performed using support vector machine that was manually trained and tested against a digital image that provided empirical verification. For the classification of 5 core classes, the best results were achieved using a combination of a 450-660 nm spectral range, 5 nm wide bands, and the employment of red-band normalization. Overall classification accuracy was improved from 86 % for the original image to 99 % for the normalized image. Spectral resolution and spectral ranges seemed to have a limited effect on the classification accuracy. The proposed methodology and the use of automatic classification procedures can be successfully applied for reef survey and monitoring and even upscaled for a large survey.																	0722-4028	1432-0975				SEP	2013	32	3					825	834		10.1007/s00338-013-1033-1								WOS:000322874500024

Spatial and temporal distribution of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) along the northeast coast of the United States, 1985-1999	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The distribution of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) during their spring migration along the Mid-Atlantic Bight and into the Gulf of Maine has historically been associated with spring warming along the continental shelf. Variations in mackerel distributions based on National Marine Fisheries Service spring surveys were compared with variations in sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite remote sensing for the eastern US continental shelf for the period 1985-1999. The mackerel stock was first analysed as a unit, then separated into three size classes to assess differences in distribution among years and individuals of various lengths. Results showed an across-shelf correlation between catch and March SST in the Mid-Atlantic Bight for both the entire population and each size class. Along-shelf catch variations were correlated with SST for large mackerel, but not total stock or smaller size classes. Finally, the distribution of mackerel length in the Gulf of Maine was negatively correlated with March SST in the Great South Channel. Results suggest surface temperature along the northeast continental shelf may be used to predict certain, but not all, aspects of annual migration along the shelf, and that factors in addition to temperature are also important in controlling distributions of Atlantic mackerel.																	1054-3139					SEP	2013	70	6					1151	1161		10.1093/icesjms/fst029								WOS:000323635600012						
J	Jutla, AS; Akanda, AS; Islam, S				Jutla, Antarpreet S.; Akanda, Ali S.; Islam, Shafiqul			A framework for predicting endemic cholera using satellite derived environmental determinants	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Cholera remains one of the most prevalent water-related infections in many tropical regions of the world. Macro-environmental processes provide a natural ecological niche for Vibrio cholerae and because powerful evidence of new biotypes is emerging, it is unlikely that the bacteria will be fully eradicated. Consequently, to develop effective intervention and mitigation strategies, it is necessary to develop cholera prediction models with several months' lead time. Almost all cholera outbreaks originate near the coastal areas and cholera bacteria exhibit a strong relationship with coastal plankton. Using chlorophyll as a surrogate for plankton bloom in coastal areas, recent studies have postulated a relationship between chlorophyll and cholera incidence. Here, we show that seasonal cholera outbreaks in the Bengal Delta can be predicted two to three months in advance with an overall prediction accuracy of over 75% by using satellite-derived chlorophyll and air temperature data. Such high prediction accuracy is achievable because the two seasonal peaks of cholera are predicted using two separate models representing distinctive macro-scale environmental processes. We have shown that interannual variability of pre-monsoon cholera outbreaks can be satisfactorily explained with coastal plankton blooms and a cascade of hydro-coastal processes. Post-monsoon cholera outbreaks, on the other hand, are related to macro-scale monsoon processes and subsequent breakdown of sanitary conditions. Our results demonstrate that satellite data over a range of space and time scales are effective in developing a cholera prediction model for the Bengal Delta with several months' lead time. We anticipate our modeling framework and findings will provide the impetus to explore the utility of satellite derived macro-scale variables for cholera prediction in other cholera endemic regions.

J	Brewin, RJW; Raitsos, DE; Pradhan, Y; Hoteit, I				Brewin, Robert J. W.; Raitsos, Dionysios E.; Pradhan, Yaswant; Hoteit, Ibrahim			Comparison of chlorophyll in the Red Sea derived from MODIS-Aqua and in vivo fluorescence	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Red Sea is a unique marine environment but relatively unexplored. The only available long-term biological dataset at large spatial and temporal scales is remotely-sensed chlorophyll observations (an index of phytoplankton biomass) derived using satellite measurements of ocean colour. Yet such observations have rarely been compared with in situ data in the Red Sea. In this paper, satellite chlorophyll estimates in the Red Sea from the MODIS instrument onboard the Aqua satellite are compared with three recent cruises of in vivo fluorometric chlorophyll measurements taken in October 2008, March 2010 and September to October 2011. The performance of the standard NASA chlorophyll algorithm, and that of a new band-difference algorithm, is found to be comparable with other oligotrophic regions in the global ocean, supporting the use of satellite ocean colour in the Red Sea. However, given the unique environmental conditions of the study area, regional algorithms are likely to fare better and this is demonstrated through a simple adjustment to the band-difference algorithm.

A model for remote estimation of ultraviolet absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter based on the global distribution of spectral slope	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV, 280-400 nm) by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) precedes a host of light-sensitized surface ocean processes relevant to global climate. These include photo- and biogeochemical cycling of organic material, release of sulfur and carbon-containing gases to the atmosphere, and the photoprotection of marine microorganisms. Synoptic CDOM absorption data in the UV is highly desired yet difficult to estimate by satellite methods as the atmosphere interferes with direct detection of water-leaving UV radiance. The absorption spectrum of CDOM is typically modeled as an exponential function in which a spectral slope parameter, S. describes the rate of decrease in absorption with increase in wavelength. Significant functional relationships are observed in aquatic environments between S and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443). In this paper, we use a large, systematic dataset of spectroscopic CDOM measurements from the U.S. CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Survey to examine the relationship between S and a(CDOM)(443) as a means to model a(CDOM)(lambda) in the UV from ocean color. Our resultant model predicts a(CDOM)(lambda) at wavelengths from 325 to 412 nm from the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved and detrital materials (CDM) at 443 nm, a(CDM)(443), retrieved by an existing semi-analytical ocean color algorithm. Expected agreement (near 1:1) with the training dataset was achieved (r(2) = 0.71-0.85, p = 0, n = 127). Considering inherent satellite data uncertainties as well as the model's limitations in regions with potential terrestrial influence, good correspondence between modeled and in situ values was observed during independent validation with open ocean CDOM data, such as from BIOSOPE (r(2) p < 0.05, n = 29). The model has immediate application in global scale assessments of photochemical rate processes and CDOM cycling in the open ocean due to its simplicity and optimization using a large base of field data (>7500 samples) from diverse Case I waters.

The Intercomparison of Satellite-Derived and In Situ Profiles of Droplet Effective Radii in Marine Stratocumulus Clouds	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												It was found that the satellite spectral measurements can be used not only for the determination of cloud top effective radii but also for retrieving the effective radii vertical profile in some specific cases (e.g., for low marine stratocumulus clouds with negligible effects of horizontal variability). The inversion algorithm was applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiances (at the wavelengths of 0.865, 1.24, 1.6, and 2.1 mu m), and the results were validated against in situ airborne measurements of cloud vertical profiles of the effective radius. We found that the results were more reliable for the cases with large vertical gradients of droplet sizes. The new retrieval method, based on the optimal estimation approach, enabled a higher accuracy of the liquid water path estimate than that produced with the standard MODIS vertically homogeneous algorithm.

Increasing impervious surfaces in the Zhoushan Islands due to new development and increased population have an ecological impact on the runoff and water quality. Based on time-series classification and the complement of vegetation fraction in urban regions, Landsat thematic mapper and other high-resolution satellite images were applied to monitor the dynamics of impervious surface area (ISA) in the Zhoushan Islands from 1986 to 2011. Landsat-derived ISA results were validated by the high-resolution Worldview-2 and aerial photographs. The validation shows that mean relative errors of these ISA maps are < 15%. The results reveal that the ISA in the Zhoushan Islands increased from 19.2 km(2) in 1986 to 86.5 km(2) in 2011, and the period from 2006 to 2011 had the fastest expansion rate of 5.59 km(2) per year. The major land conversions to high densities of ISA were from the tidal zone and arable lands. The expansions of ISA were unevenly distributed and most of them were located along the periphery of these islands. Time-series maps revealed that ISA expansions happened continuously over the last 25 years. Our analysis indicated that the policy and the topography were the dominant factors controlling the spatial patterns of ISA and its expansions in the Zhoushan Islands. With continuous urbanization processes, the rapid ISA expansions may not be stopped in the near feature. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Operational activities show regular occurrence of accidental and deliberate oil spill in European waters. Since the areas covered by oil spills are usually large, satellite remote sensing particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar represents an effective option for operational oil spill detection. This paper describes the development of a fully automated approach for oil spill detection from SAR. Total of 41 feature parameters extracted from each segmented dark spot for oil spill and 'look-alike' classification and ranked according to their importance. The classification algorithm is based on a two-stage processing that combines classification tree analysis and fuzzy logic. An initial evaluation of this methodology on a large dataset has been carried out and degree of agreement between results from proposed algorithm and human analyst was estimated between 85% and 93% respectively for ENVISAT and RADARSAT.

The work presented here, the spatial temporal data framework, is part of a larger study, the NF-UBC Nereus Program, to develop a new approach to model interoperability for closing the gap between marine ecosystem modeling tools via geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The approach we present simplifies interdisciplinary model interoperability by separating technical and scientific challenges into a flexible and modular software approach. To illustrate capabilities of the new framework, we use a remote-sensing derived spatial and temporal time series to drive the primary production dynamics in an existing food web model of the North-Central Adriatic using the Ecospace module of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach. In general, the predictive capabilities of the food web model to hind-cast ecosystem dynamics are enhanced when applying the new framework by better reflecting observed species population trends and distributions. Results show that changes at the phytoplankton level due to changes in primary production are realistically reproduced and cascade up the pelagic food web. The dynamics of zooplankton and small and large pelagic fish are impacted. Highly exploited demersal species such as European hake do, however, not show clear signs of cascading. This may be due to the high fishing pressure on this species and the resulting strong historical decline in the area. In general, the development of the new framework offers ecosystem modelers with unprecedented capabilities to include spatial temporal time series into food web analysis with a minimal set of required steps. It is a promising step toward integrating species distribution models and food web dynamics, and future implementations of interdisciplinary model interoperability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal spectral variation of Zostera noltii and its influence on pigment-based Vegetation Indices	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The influence of phenological variations on the reflectance of the intertidal marine angiosperm Zostera noltii was studied using spectroradiometry and pigment analysis. Leaves were sampled each month from March to November and spectral reflectance was measured in the 400-900 nm wavelength range in the laboratory for increasing biomass. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the pigment composition and concentration of the leaves and their epiphytes. Several vegetation indices (VIs) were tested for their sensitivity to seasonal variations, from NDVI-like ratios to indices based on derivative analysis. Pigment concentration showed a seasonal effect, with the highest concentrations observed in summer, synchronous with the above-ground biomass peak. The seasonal variations were clearly visible in the leaf reflectance spectrum, showing for the same amount of vegetation, lower reflectance in summer for the visible wavelengths and a higher near-infrared (NIR) plateau compared to the other months. Indices based on the difference between the red and NIR reflectance values, typically all the NDVI-like ratios, were the most sensitive to seasonal variations in pigment concentration. In fact, seasonal effects were systematically reduced for VIs including a blue band correction, namely the modified Specific Ratio (mSR((705))), the modified Normalized Difference (mND((705))), the modified NDVIs for Landsat FORMOSAT and narrow band NDVI (mNDVI((673))) as well as the Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI). However, these indices showed a faster saturation for increasing seagrass biomass, except for the mSR((705)), which was the least sensitive to biomass saturation. The interesting properties of this index suggest that it should now be tested for airborne or satellite remote sensing mapping of Z. noltii beds but it requires a high spectral resolution and cannot be applied to multispectral satellite images.

Tectonically, Ras Banas peninsula is considered as a part of Pre-Miocene continental slope. Their sedimentary successions account the sedimentation history from Middle Miocene up to Holocene which in part documents the deformational impacts that accompanied the Red Sea rifling. The Ras Banas sedimentary succession exhibits frequent unconformities and conspicuous lithologic variations comprising mixed siliciclastics/carbonate facies, evaporites, open marine and organic build up limestone as well as coral reefs, continental sandy gravels and beach sands. The carbonate succession at the area documents the highstand status of the Red Sea water from Middle Miocene to Pleistocene in accord to the global sea-level fluctuations. The chemical data of the studied rock units substantiates the field and petrographical results. On silica- lime- magnesia diagram, the syn-rifting mixed siliciclastics/carbonates are scattered between the quartz and dolomite reference points. The post-rifting carbonates are mainly pure dolostone, limestone and sandy limestone. Norm calculations indicate that the evaporites are mainly gypsum and anhydrite with substantial normative dolomite. The tectono-sedimentary evolution of Ras Banas sedimentary sequence in relation to Red Sea rifling phases and sea level fluctuations is discussed. New mapping was undertaken for the Ras Banas Peninsula using remote sensing and GIS techniques including band ratioing, principle component analysis and false color composition. Based on mineralogical data, special interest has been paid to the diagnostic spectral features that discriminate between evaporites and carbonates on one hand and between dolomite and calcite on the other.

A statistical method to estimate the wind sea and swell SWHs, respectively, on the basis of wave energy and wind sea/swell probability was proposed. The global distributions of swell/wind sea probability displayed the swell's dominance in the World Ocean. Their seasonal variation showed not only the regions called swell pools with high swell probability throughout the year at low latitudes, which have been found in previous studies, but also the regions with high swell probability only in hemispheric summer, termed seasonal swell pools, located at the midlatitudes of open oceans. The seasonal geographical patterns of the swell SWH were similar to those of the SWH due to the swell's dominance, and the patterns of the wind SWH were similar to those of the wind speed because of their well-coupled nature. The results could be used as a reference for related applications such as ocean engineering, seafaring, validation of wave models, and studies on climate change.

The value of H-top was obtained by applying a formula based on a linear regression of the differences between GOES-10 cloud-top temperature and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) satellite sea surface temperature, with a common 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution. A satellite liquid water path (LWP) climatology complemented this dataset. Southwestward transects of H-top and LWP anomalies reveal a coherent propagating signal from the coast in the afternoon, with a typical phase speed of 25 m s(-1). This pattern is preceded by a subsidence wave that reaches its peak a few hours before the maximum in H-top and LWP anomalies. Coincident increases in LWP and H-top after the subsidence wave passes suggest that the boundary layer deepening promotes cloud thickening and increased LWP, which are likely maintained through a well-mixed boundary layer and sufficient moisture fluxes that can counteract the effect of dry air entrainment. The interference between the radiatively and subsidence wave-driven cycles gives rise to a semidiurnal cycle in H-top along the coast. While the semidiurnal amplitude is near 80 m close to the coast with a fraction of explained variance greater than 0.4, it decreases to 30 m offshore (80 degrees W). Similar to H-top, CF also exhibits contrasting zonal differences, but with a smaller semidiurnal component. The phase of the semidiurnal harmonic resembles the subsidence propagation westward, and the noticeable land-sea breeze circulation at 26 degrees S that extends 200 km offshore.

The large number of people who live close to the coast and rely directly on marine resources for food and income paradoxically increases the value of, but also the threats to, these ecosystems. A key strategy of the Coral Triangle Initiative is to protect shallow coastal ecosystems through the design and implementation of resilient networks of marine protected areas (MPAs). This strategy requires accurate spatial data on the distribution and extent of coastal habitats (coral reef, seagrass and mangrove) at scales which match conservation planning decisions. In the Coral Triangle, seagrass distribution maps are not readily available at ecoregional scales. The Lesser Sunda ecoregion, extending from Bali, Indonesia to Timor-Leste, is one of 11 ecoregions of the Coral Triangle and a high priority for conservation and sustainable management of marine resources. To support the design of a resilient MPA network for the Lesser Sunda ecoregion, a seagrass distribution map was generated based on Landsat imagery, literature review and groundtruth data. Seagrass beds were estimated to cover an area of 273 km(2) at an overall accuracy of 78%. Use of the seagrass distribution map in the MPA design improved the habitat representation and connectivity - key criteria for resilient MPA design. The final MPA design included 80 km(2) of seagrass beds, with more than half the beds adjacent to coral reefs and mangroves. This study demonstrates the effective use of Landsat imagery and remote sensing techniques to derive ecoregional scale seagrass maps supporting MPA network design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, FF; Tang, SL; Chen, CQ				Liu, Fenfen; Tang, Shilin; Chen, Chuqun			Estimation of particulate zinc using MERIS data of the Pearl River Estuary	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												Marine heavy metals in the particulate phase are considered to be undetectable from remote sensing since their minor spectral signal is masked by marine optical constitutes. However, over 80% of heavy metals adsorb to and complex with the suspended sediment and the quantity of adsorbed heavy metals strongly depends on suspended sediment load and size. Thus, the suspended sediment load and size could be useful information to estimate heavy metal levels through remote-sensing techniques. We investigate the potential to derive heavy metal concentration, using zinc as an example. Eight cruises in the Pearl River Estuary were carried out to measure zinc concentrations in the particulate phase (C-zn) and remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) data from 2009 to 2010. The relationship of R-rs ratio in the near infrared bands and the scattering spectral slope (which indicates particle size distribution (PSD)) is first proposed. According to a previously established suspended sediment algorithm for the study area and the newly proposed relationship of remote-sensing reflectance and suspended sediment size, a piecewise algorithm is developed to retrieve C-zn. The accuracies of the algorithm developed here (correlation coefficient (r)=0.88, mean relative error (MRE)=24.7% and root mean square error (RMSE)=5.51) are higher than those algorithms only considering suspended sediment load (r=0.79, MRE=35.3% and RMSE=8.93) or size (r=0.78, MRE=30.0% and RMSE=7.19). The algorithm is applied to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) full resolution data to obtain C-zn distribution in the Pearl River Estuary. The C-zn from image is mainly in the range from 10 to 63g l(-1), which is consistent with the in situ data ranges (5.67-86.62g l(-1)).																	2150-704X	2150-7058				AUG 1	2013	4	8					813	821		10.1080/2150704X.2013.798711								WOS:000320642900010

Analysis of satellite remote sensing observations of low ozone events in the tropical upper troposphere and links with convection	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Satellite observations from three instruments (Microwave Limb Sounder, Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imaging System, and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer) reveal coherent patterns of low ozone events (<20 ppb) in the tropical upper troposphere. Using a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), we find that these events result from deep convective processes that rapidly transport air with low ozone concentrations from the marine boundary layer. These events occur with greater frequency over the tropical South Pacific warm pool, which is consistent with ozonesonde observations. The satellite observations indicate spatial shifts in the frequency of low ozone events that we attribute to changes in convection. As the location of the warm pool shifts eastward during El Nino events, the location of the most frequent low ozone events in the satellite record follows. Mapping of low ozone events over time reveals eastward propagating systems resembling the Madden-Julian Oscillation.

Ningaloo Marine Park (including the Muiron Islands) in north-western Australia (stretching across three degrees of latitude) was mapped to 20 m depth using HyMap airborne hyperspectral imagery (125 bands) at 3.5 m resolution across the 762 km(2) of reef environment between the shoreline and reef slope. The imagery was corrected for atmospheric, air-water interface and water column influences to retrieve bottom reflectance and bathymetry using the physics-based Modular Inversion and Processing System. Using field-validated, image-derived spectra from a representative range of cover types, the classification combined a semi-automated, pixel-based approach with fuzzy logic and derivative techniques. Five thematic classification levels for benthic cover (with probability maps) were generated with varying degrees of detail, ranging from a basic one with three classes (biotic, abiotic and mixed) to the most detailed with 46 classes. The latter consisted of all abiotic and biotic seabed components and hard coral growth forms in dominant or mixed states. The overall accuracy of mapping for the most detailed maps was 70% for the highest classification level. Macro-algal communities formed most of the benthic cover, while hard and soft corals represented only about 7% of the mapped area (58.6 km(2)). Dense tabulate coral was the largest coral mosaic type (37% of all corals) and the rest of the corals were a mix of tabulate, digitate, massive and soft corals. Our results show that for this shallow, fringing reef environment situated in the arid tropics, hyperspectral remote sensing techniques can offer an efficient and cost-effective approach to mapping and monitoring reef habitats over large, remote and inaccessible areas.

Factors Affecting Harp Seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) Strandings in the Northwest Atlantic	PLOS ONE												The effects of climate change on high latitude regions are becoming increasingly evident, particularly in the rapid decline of sea ice cover in the Arctic. Many high latitude species dependent on sea ice are being forced to adapt to changing habitats. Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) are an indicator species for changing high-latitude ecosystems. This study analyzed multiple factors including ice cover, demographics, and genetic diversity, which could affect harp seal stranding rates along the eastern coast of the United States. Ice cover assessments were conducted for the month of February in the Gulf of St. Lawrence whelping region from 1991-2010 using remote sensing data, and harp seal stranding data were collected over the same time period. Genetic diversity, which may affect how quickly species can adapt to changing climates, was assessed using ten microsatellite markers to determine mean d(2) in a subset of stranded and by-caught (presumably healthy) seals sampled along the northeast U. S. coast. Our study found a strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.49) between ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and yearling harp seal strandings, but found no relationship between sea ice conditions and adult strandings. Our analysis revealed that male seals stranded more frequently than females during the study period and that this relationship was strongest during light ice years. In contrast, we found no significant difference in mean d(2) between stranded and by-caught harp seals. The results demonstrate that sea ice cover and demographic factors have a greater influence on harp seal stranding rates than genetic diversity, with only a little of the variance in mean d(2) among stranded seals explained by ice cover. Any changes in these factors could have major implications for harp seals, and these findings should be considered in the development of future management plans for the Arctic that incorporate climate variability.

Spatial Access Priority Mapping (SAPM) with Fishers: A Quantitative GIS Method for Participatory Planning	PLOS ONE												Spatial management tools, such as marine spatial planning and marine protected areas, are playing an increasingly important role in attempts to improve marine management and accommodate conflicting needs. Robust data are needed to inform decisions among different planning options, and early inclusion of stakeholder involvement is widely regarded as vital for success. One of the biggest stakeholder groups, and the most likely to be adversely impacted by spatial restrictions, is the fishing community. In order to take their priorities into account, planners need to understand spatial variation in their perceived value of the sea. Here a readily accessible, novel method for quantitatively mapping fishers' spatial access priorities is presented. Spatial access priority mapping, or SAPM, uses only basic functions of standard spreadsheet and GIS software. Unlike the use of remote-sensing data, SAPM actively engages fishers in participatory mapping, documenting rather than inferring their priorities. By so doing, SAPM also facilitates the gathering of other useful data, such as local ecological knowledge. The method was tested and validated in Northern Ireland, where over 100 fishers participated in a semi-structured questionnaire and mapping exercise. The response rate was excellent, 97%, demonstrating fishers' willingness to be involved. The resultant maps are easily accessible and instantly informative, providing a very clear visual indication of which areas are most important for the fishers. The maps also provide quantitative data, which can be used to analyse the relative impact of different management options on the fishing industry and can be incorporated into planning software, such as MARXAN, to ensure that conservation goals can be met at minimum negative impact to the industry. This research shows how spatial access priority mapping can facilitate the early engagement of fishers and the ready incorporation of their priorities into the decision-making process in a transparent, quantitative way.

J	Guneroglu, A; Karsli, F; Dihkan, M				Guneroglu, Abdulaziz; Karsli, Fevzi; Dihkan, Mustafa			Automatic detection of coastal plumes using Landsat TM/ETM plus images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Riverine fresh water outflows create coastal plumes that are distinguished from surrounding sea water by their specific spectral signature. Coastal waters are unique ecosystems, and they are very important in terms of living resources and oceanographic processes. River plumes and coastal turbid waters have important effects on coastal marine ecosystems, and they also influence marine life cycles, sediment distribution, and pollution. Remote sensing and digital image-processing techniques provide an effective tool to detect and monitor these plume zones over large areas. The primary goal of this study was automatic detection and monitoring of coastal plume zones using multispectral Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) imagery. For that purpose, the proposed algorithm exploits spectral features of the multispectral images by using feature extraction and decision-making steps. The procedure has two main stages: (1) some pre-processing operations were applied to the images in order to extract the plume core reflectance values with maximum turbidity and offshore water mass reflectance values; (2) a k-means algorithm was applied with initial seed values of reflectance computed from the pre-processing stage to classify coastal plume zones. Spatial pattern and variability of optical characteristics of coastal plume zones were then defined following the results of the classification process. The algorithm was automatically applied in three different regions with three multispectral Landsat images acquired on different dates, and yielded a very high classification accuracy in detecting coastal plume zones.																	0143-1161					JUL 10	2013	34	13					4702	4714		10.1080/01431161.2013.782116								WOS:000317840200011						
J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Planes, S				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Philippe; Planes, Serge			Bridging Ridge-to-Reef Patches: Seamless Classification of the Coast Using Very High Resolution Satellite	REMOTE SENSING												The structure and functioning of coral reef coastal zones are currently coping with an increasing variety of threats, thereby altering the coastal spatial patterns at an accelerated pace. Understanding and predicting the evolution of these highly valuable coastal ecosystems require reliable and frequent mapping and monitoring of both inhabited terrestrial and marine areas at the individual tree and coral colony spatial scale. The very high spatial resolution (VHR) mapping that was recently spearheaded by WorldView-2 (WV2) sensor with 2 m and 0.5 m multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (Pan) bands has the potential to address this burning issue. The objective of this study was to classify nine terrestrial and twelve marine patch classes with respect to spatial resolution enhancement and coast integrity using eight bands of the WV2 sensor on a coastal zone of Moorea Island, French Polynesia. The contribution of the novel WV2 spectral bands towards classification accuracy at 2 m and 0.5 m were tested using traditional and innovative Pan-sharpening techniques. The land and water classes were examined both separately and combinedly. All spectral combinations that were built only with the novel WV2 bands systematically increased the overall classification accuracy of the standard four band classification. The overall best contribution was attributed to the coastal-red edge-near infrared (NIR) 2 combination (Kappa(gain) = 0.0287), which significantly increased the fleshy and encrusting algae (User's Accuracy(gain) = 18.18%) class. However, the addition of the yellow-NIR2 combination dramatically impacted the hard coral/algae patches class (Producer's Accuracy(loss) = -20.88%). Enhancement of the spatial resolution reduced the standard classification accuracy, depending on the Pan-sharpening technique. The proposed composite method (local maximum) provided better overall results than the commonly used sensor method (systematic). However, the sensor technique produced the highest contribution to the hard coral thicket (PA(gain) = 30.36%) class with the coastal-red edge-NIR2 combination. Partitioning the coast into its terrestrial and aquatic components lowered the overall standard classification accuracy, while strongly enhancing the hard coral bommie class with the coastal-NIR2 combination (UA(gain) = 40%) and the green-coastal Normalized Difference Ratio (UA(gain) = 11.06%). VHR spaceborne remote sensing has the potential to gain substantial innovative insights into the evolution of tropical coastal ecosystems from local to regional scales, to predict the influence of anthropogenic and climate changes and to help design optimized management and conservation frameworks.

This is true for the complex coastal region of Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the spatial variability in ecosystem fluxes from the Pacific coastal ocean, eutrophic lagoon, mangroves, and desert were studied. The Sky Arrow 650TCN environmental research aircraft proved to be an effective tool in characterizing land-atmosphere fluxes of energy, CO2, and water vapor across a heterogeneous landscape at the scale of 1 km. The aircraft was capable of discriminating fluxes from all ecosystem types, as well as between nearshore and coastal areas a few kilometers distant. Aircraft-derived average midday CO2 fluxes from the desert showed a slight uptake of -1.32 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), the coastal ocean also showed an uptake of -3.48 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and the lagoon mangroves showed the highest uptake of -8.11 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Additional simultaneous measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) allowed simple linear modeling of CO2 flux as a function of NDVI for the mangroves of the Magdalena Bay region. Aircraft approaches can, therefore, be instrumental in determining regional CO2 fluxes and can be pivotal in calculating and verifying ecosystem carbon sequestration regionally when coupled with satellite-derived products and ecosystem models.

These mud banks have an overwhelming impact on the geology, the geomorphology, the ecology and the economy of this coast. Although numerous field investigations and remote sensing studies have considerably enhanced our understanding of the dynamics of this coast over the last three decades, much still remains to be understood of the unique functional mechanisms and processes driving its evolution. Among the themes that we deem as requiring further attention three come out as fundamental. The first concerns the mechanisms of formation of individual mud banks from mud streaming on the shelf off the mouth of the Amazon. An unknown quantity of the fluid mud generated by offshore estuarine front activity is transported shoreward and progressively forms mud banks on the Amapa coast, Brazil. The volume of each mud bank can contain from the equivalent of the annual mud supply of the Amazon to several times this annual sediment discharge. The mechanisms by which individual banks are generated from the Amazon turbidity maximum are still to be elucidated. Areas of research include regional mesoscale oceanographic conditions and mud supply from the Amazon. The second theme is that of variations in rates of migration of mud banks, which influence patterns of coastal accretion. Research emphasis needs to be placed on the analysis of both regional meteorological-hydrodynamic forcing and distant Atlantic forcing, as well as on the hydrology of the large rivers draining the Guyana Shield. The rivers appear to generate significant offshore deflection of mud banks in transit alongshore, through a hydraulic-groyne effect. This may favour both muddy accretion on the updrift coast and downdrift mud liquefaction with probably lessened muddy deposition. The third theme concerns sand supply by the Guiana Shield rivers. The rare sand deposits are important in providing sites for human settlements and routes and for nesting by marine turtles. The limited presence of sand bodies on this coast may reflect 'mud blanketing', a hypothesis that requires verification through high-resolution seismic analyses of shelf deposits and coring operations. The large Guiana Shield rivers, especially in Surinam and Guyana, have supplied sand for the construction of significant bands of cheniers, probably enhanced by the afore-mentioned downdrift hydraulic-groyne effect on hindered mud deposition. In all the three themes of this future research agenda, two central elements are the sediment input of the rivers of the Amazon basin, starting with the massive mud supply from the Amazon catchment itself, followed by sand inputs by the Guiana Shield rivers and their river-mouth effects on mud banks.

Many of these methods rely on interpretation of phytoplankton size or type from pigment data, but independent validation has been difficult due to lack of appropriate in situ data on cell size. This work uses in situ data (photosynthetic pigments concentration and cell abundances) from the north-east Atlantic, along a trophic. gradient, sampled from 2005 to 2010, as well as Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) data for the same region, to test a previously developed conceptual model, which calculates the fractional contributions of pico-, nano- and micro-plankton to total phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass (Brewin et al., 2010). The application of the model proved to be successful, as shown by low mean absolute error between data and model fit. However, regional values obtained for the model parameters had some effect on the relative distribution of size classes as a function of chlorophyll-a, compared with the results according to the original model. The regional parameterisation yielded a dominance of micro-plankton contribution for chlorophyll-a concentrations greater than 0.5 mg m(-3), rather than from 1.3 mg m(-3) in the original model. Intracellular chlorophyll-a (Chla) per cell, for each size class, was computed from the cell enumeration results (microscope counts and flow cytometry) and the chlorophyll-a concentration for that size class given by the model. The median intracellular chlorophyll-a values computed were 0.004, 0.224 and 26.78 pg Chla cell(-1) for pico-, nano-, and micro-plankton respectively. This is generally consistent with the literature, thereby providing an indirect validation of the method based on pigments to assign size classes. Using a satellite-derived composite image of chlorophyll-a for the study area, a map of cell abundance was generated based on the computed intracellular chlorophyll-a for each size-class, thus extending the remote-sensing method for mapping size classes of phytoplankton from chlorophyll-a concentration to mapping cell numbers in each class. The map reveals the ubiquitous presence of pico-plankton, and shows that all size classes are more abundant in more productive areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In previous work we used Hydrolight5 simulations of Rrs with widely varying globally representative constituent physical parameters as a training basis to develop a neural network algorithm, which, using the Rrs at the MODIS visible wavelengths (412, 443, 488, 531, 547 and 667 nm) as input, retrieves the in-water particulate backscattering (b(bp)), phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-phytoplankton (a(dg)) absorption coefficients at 443 nm. In this work, using the same dataset, we develop a NN which takes these same Rrs as input, and produces an output which is used to separate the non-phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(dg)) at 443 nm into dissolved (a(g)) and particulate (a(dm)) components. We then apply this synthetically trained algorithm to the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) Rrs to retrieve IOP at 443 nm, with the measured NOMAD and retrieved IOP values showing good agreement. These retrieved MP along with their related Rrs values are then used to train an additional NN that produces chlorophyll concentration [Chl] as output. It is shown that these [Chl] values are retrieved more accurately when compared with ones retrieved with a similar approach which does not use IOP as input, as well as with those derived using the MODIS OC3 algorithm.

Light absorption properties of southeastern Bering Sea waters: Analysis, parameterization and implications for remote sensing	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The absorption coefficients of phytoplankton (a(PHY)(gimel)), non-algal particles (NAP) (a(NAP)(gimel)) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) (a(CDOM)(gimel)) were investigated and parameterized in the southeastern Bering Sea during July 2008. The absorption coefficients were well structured with respect to hydrographic and biogeochemical characteristics of the shelf. The highest values of a(PHY)(443) were observed offshore and the lowest values of a(PHY)(443) were found in the coastal domain, a low productivity region associated with limited macronutrients. Values of a(DG)(gimel) a(CDOM)(gimel) + a(NAP)(gimel)) revealed an east west gradient pattern with higher values in the coastal domain, and lower values in the outer domain. Lower chlorophyll specific a(PHY)(gimel) (a*(PHY)(gimel)) observed relative to middle and lower latitude waters indicated a change in pigment composition and/or package effect, which was consistent with phytoplankton community structure. a(CDOM)(gimel) was the dominant light absorbing coefficient at all wavelengths examined except at 676 nm. Modeling of remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs(gimel)) and the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(gimel)) from inherent optical properties revealed the strong influence of a(CDOM)(gimel) on R-rs(gimel) and K-d(gimel). Good optical closure was achieved between modeled and radiometer measured R-rs(gimel) and K-d(gimel) with average percent difference of less than 25% and 19% respectively, except at red wavelengths. The a(CDOM)(gimel) accounted for > 50% of K-d(gimel) which was vertically variable. Chlorophyll-a calculated by the NASA standard chlorophyll-a algorithm (OC4.v6) was overestimated due to higher a(CDOM)(gimel) and underestimated due to lower a*(PHY)(X) at low and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a, respectively.

Using Hyperion imagery to monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of colored dissolved organic matter in estuarine and coastal regions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Establishing a link between the optical and biogeochemical properties of near-shore waters continues to be a challenge for both riverine and estuarine areas worldwide due to terrestrial influences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an inversion algorithm for the extraction of riverine and estuarine CDOM properties at global scales. Our CDOM evaluation focused on five aspects: I) the range of worldwide CDOM levels, 2) spatial distribution patterns, (3) climatic influences, (4) influences of land cover change, and (5) seasonal effects. The study locations consisted of the estuarine and coastal regions of 10 major rivers spread across five continents. Our approach was to examine the QAA-CDOM algorithm by extracting CDOM properties from hundreds of EO-1 Hyperion images acquired during the last decade (2001-2011). Preliminary results showed that CDOM absorption coefficients at 440 nm within the 10 selected rivers exhibited a broad range (0.02-72 m(-1)). Spatial CDOM distribution patterns showed many plumes dispersing from source areas (e.g. adjacent terrestrial vegetated areas) along the direction of flow. Seasonal variations in CDOM levels are also evident (i.e. 0.5-4.0 m(-1)) as illustrated by the January, April, August and October images of the Volga River. CDOM levels also appeared to trend upward with the increase in forest coverage (i.e. terrestrial influence) within the watersheds studied over the last decade. Our results strongly suggest that the algorithm is effective in distinguishing riverine and estuarine CDOM levels affected by factors such as global biogeography, climate conditions and regional land surface processes.

J	Lebsock, M; Morrison, H; Gettelman, A				Lebsock, Matthew; Morrison, Hugh; Gettelman, Andrew			Microphysical implications of cloud-precipitation covariance derived from satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Covariance between cloud and precipitation water in shallow marine boundary layer clouds is assessed using collocated satellite observations from CloudSat and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) at spatial scales typical of global models. An analytic construct is presented, which suggests that global models that do not take subgrid scale cloud-precipitation covariance into account in their microphysical parameterizations may significantly underestimate grid mean microphysical process rates in warm clouds. The proposed framework indicates a mean bias in autoconversion rates of 129% when subgrid scale cloud water variability is neglected and bias in accretion rates of 60% when subgrid cloud-precipitation covariability is neglected at a model grid resolution of 141km. The bias in accretion rate is dependent on the significant correlation () found between cloud and precipitation, which in the global mean is found to be =0.44. The regional distribution of the process rate biases is largely governed by the spatial pattern of cloud water variance. Specific areas of low cloud water variance are found in the subtropical eastern ocean basins and the high latitudes, whereas much of the tropics display relatively larger cloud water variance. These regional distinctions in cloud water variance are associated with commensurate regionality in the process rate biases. The magnitude of the bias has a scale dependence that is governed by the spatial scaling behavior of the cloud and precipitation variances, which follow a power law scaling with exponent of 2/3 at scales below about 10km and decreasing exponent above this length scale. While the parametric framework reduces biases in the accretion rate estimated from the grid-mean values of cloud and precipitation water, it is shown that it still undercorrects the accretion rate because it neglects the fact that the precipitation fractional area is less than the cloud fractional area and is preferentially colocated with the highest cloud water concentrations. These results imply that (1) predicting the appropriate balance of autoconversion to accretion in global models requires not only the subgrid scale cloud water variability but also the subgrid scale covariability of cloud and precipitation water and (2) the ability of a global model to calculate the correct regional variation in process rates depends crucially on the fidelity of that model to predict or diagnose the spatial distribution of the variance in cloud water.																	2169-897X					JUN 27	2013	118	12					6521	6533		10.1002/jgrd.50347								WOS:000322129600045

That work is extended here to examine regional differences in conversion rates, including sensitivity to environmental parameters such as atmospheric stability and the presence of different aerosol types defined based on values of aerosol optical depth, fine mode fraction, and angstrom ngstrom Exponent. Among eight subregions examined, the tropical Pacific Ocean is characterized by the highest average conversion rate while subtropical stratocumulus cloud regions (far northeastern Pacific Ocean, far southeastern Pacific Ocean, Western Africa coastal region) exhibit the lowest rates. Conversion rates are generally higher at reduced values of lower tropospheric static stability (LTSS). When examining data in two selected ranges for LTSS, higher conversion rates are coincident with higher LWP and factors covarying or rooted in the presence of aerosol types exhibiting lower aerosol index values.

W.; Stenchikov, Georgiy; Hoteit, Ibrahim			Remote Sensing the Phytoplankton Seasonal Succession of the Red Sea	PLOS ONE												The Red Sea holds one of the most diverse marine ecosystems, primarily due to coral reefs. However, knowledge on large-scale phytoplankton dynamics is limited. Analysis of a 10-year high resolution Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) dataset, along with remotely-sensed sea surface temperature and wind, provided a detailed description of the spatiotemporal seasonal succession of phytoplankton biomass in the Red Sea. Based on MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, four distinct Red Sea provinces and seasons are suggested, covering the major patterns of surface phytoplankton production. The Red Sea Chl-a depicts a distinct seasonality with maximum concentrations seen during the winter time (attributed to vertical mixing in the north and wind-induced horizontal intrusion of nutrient-rich water in the south), and minimum concentrations during the summer (associated with strong seasonal stratification). The initiation of the seasonal succession occurs in autumn and lasts until early spring. However, weekly Chl-a seasonal succession data revealed that during the month of June, consistent anti-cyclonic eddies transfer nutrients and/or Chl-a to the open waters of the central Red Sea. This phenomenon occurs during the stratified nutrient depleted season, and thus could provide an important source of nutrients to the open waters. Remotely-sensed synoptic observations highlight that Chl-a does not increase regularly from north to south as previously thought. The Northern part of the Central Red Sea province appears to be the most oligotrophic area (opposed to southern and northern domains). This is likely due to the absence of strong mixing, which is apparent at the northern end of the Red Sea, and low nutrient intrusion in comparison with the southern end. Although the Red Sea is considered an oligotrophic sea, sporadic blooms occur that reach mesotrophic levels. The water temperature and the prevailing winds control the nutrient concentrations within the euphotic zone and enable the horizontal transportation of nutrients.

If remote sensing methods have been applied with reasonable success in terrestrial environment, their use in aquatic ecosystems still remained challenging. In the present study we combined hyperspectral remote sensing and boosted regression tree modelling (BTR), an ensemble method for statistical techniques and machine learning, in order to test their applicability in predicting macrophyte and invertebrate species cover in the optically complex seawater of the Baltic Sea. The BRT technique combined with remote sensing and traditional spatial modelling succeeded in identifying, constructing and testing functionality of abiotic environmental predictors on the coverage of benthic macrophyte and invertebrate species. Our models easily predicted a large quantity of macrophyte and invertebrate species cover and recaptured multitude of interactions between environment and biota indicating a strong potential of the method in the modelling of aquatic species in the large variety of ecosystems.

J	Xi, HY; Larouche, P; Tang, SL; Michel, C				Xi, Hongyan; Larouche, Pierre; Tang, Shilin; Michel, Christine			Seasonal variability of light absorption properties and water optical constituents in Hudson Bay, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Previous studies have shown that the properties of optically significant water constituents (phytoplankton, suspended matter, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) in Hudson Bay are different from other Arctic regions. A new bio-optical data set collected in summer 2010 shows that this region also presents seasonal variability of the light absorption coefficients by the different constituents, with a higher relative proportion of CDOM absorption in summer than in the fall as a result of decreased phytoplankton absorption in summer. The slope of the exponential function describing nonalgal particles and CDOM spectral absorption shows little variability between fall and summer. Seasonal variability of light absorption coefficients and water optical constituents is more pronounced near the coast, while less variability is observed in the central part of the bay. Very low summertime chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients by phytoplankton, among the lowest reported in the literature, are attributed to the high proportion of large size phytoplankton (microphytoplankton) and important packaging effect. There is also a smaller contribution of accessory pigments to total pigments in the summer than in the fall, resulting in a lower blue-to-red phytoplankton absorption ratio. These results emphasize that it is necessary to take into account the seasonal variability of light absorption properties in bio-optical models for further remote sensing applications in Hudson Bay.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				JUN	2013	118	6					3087	3102		10.1002/jgrc.20237								WOS:000324885500023

Incorporating uncertainty associated with habitat data in marine reserve design	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10-90%) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitat-mapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhu, WN; Yu, Q				Zhu, Weining; Yu, Qian			Inversion of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter From EO-1 Hyperion Imagery for Turbid Estuarine and Coastal Waters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The significant implication of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for water quality and biogeochemical cycle leads to an increasing need of CDOM monitoring in coastal regions. Current ocean-color algorithms are mostly limited to open-sea water and have high uncertainty when directly applied to turbid coastal waters. This paper presents a semianalytical algorithm, quasi-analytical CDOM algorithm (QAA-CDOM), to invert CDOM absorption from Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion satellite images. This algorithm was developed from a widely used ocean-color algorithm QAA and our earlier extension of QAA. The main goal is to improve the algorithm performance for a wide range of water conditions, particularly turbid waters in estuarine and coastal regions. The algorithm development, calibration, and validation were based on our intensive high-resolution underwater measurements, International Ocean Color Coordinating Group synthetic data, and global National Aeronautics and Space Administration Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data Set data. The result shows that retrieved CDOM absorption achieved accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.115 m(-1) and R-2 = 0.73) in the Atchafalaya River plume area. QAA-CDOM is also evaluated for scenarios in three additional study sites, namely, the Mississippi River, Amazon River, and Moreton Bay, where a(g)(440) was in the wide range of 0.01-15 m(-1). It resulted in expected CDOM distribution patterns along the river salinity gradient. This study improves the high-resolution observation of CDOM dynamics in river-dominated coastal margins and other coastal environments for the study of land-ocean interactive processes.

JAMSTEC-IARC international collaboration enhancing understanding of the Arctic climate system	POLAR SCIENCE												Collaborations amongst researchers from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), Japan and the International Arctic research Center (IARC), University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF), U.S., have been on-going since 1998 and resulted in a great number and magnitude of accomplishments that could not have been achieved without this close partnership. The Arctic represents an important region for Japan, the U.S. and the world, and many opportunities and challenges press for immediate understanding to enable wise decisions and policy making. We have many common interests and our countries face many common problems and goals. Addressing the tremendous scientific challenges of the Arctic requires such massive investment of manpower and resources that sharing efforts, data and working together on expeditions are in our mutual best interests. This issue presents a compilation of selected results on recent analyses conducted in the five-year (2009-2014) research term related to observational studies, model development and remote sensing applications of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent marginal seas, and the surrounding terrestrial regions. All of these studies are intended to provide a better understanding of how individual components and processes interact to form a complex and dynamic arctic system. Through these collaborations, Japanese and IJAF Arctic researchers can achieve our goals of developing a quantitative understanding of the Arctic System. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

J	O'Donnell, DM; Effler, SW; Perkins, M; Strait, C				O'Donnell, David M.; Effler, Steven W.; Perkins, MaryGail; Strait, Christopher			Optical characterization of Lake Champlain: Spatial heterogeneity and closure	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A robust optical characterization of the underwater and emergent light fields of Lake Champlain was conducted for sites (n = 11) throughout the lake in August 2011, based on in situ measurements with modem instrumentation and laboratory measurements of optically active constituents (OACs) and components (a(x)) of the absorption coefficient (a). Inherent optical property (IOP) measurements included a, a(x), and the particulate scattering and backscattering coefficients. Metrics of apparent optical properties (AOPs) included Secchi depth, the diffuse attenuation coefficients for downwelling [K-d(lambda)] and scalar (K-0) irradiance and remote sensing reflectance [R-rs(lambda)]. The credibility of the measurements is demonstrated through: (1) consistency of relationships between OACs and IOPs and AOPs, (2) the approach toward equivalence of laboratory and field measurements, and (3) the extent of closure of predictions of K-d(lambda) and R-rs(lambda), based on IOP measurements and radiative transfer expressions, with paired observations of these AOPs (average differences of 9.4 and 19.3%). Wide spatial differences in OACs, and the resulting IOPs and AOPs, are documented throughout the bounds of the lake and are the result of its morphologic complexity and differing external loading. The lake is a complex case 2 system, with uncoupled variations in OACs and a(x) over the bounds of the lake. Both empirical and radiative transfer expressions are used to predict changes in AOPs in response to hypothetical changes in OACs. (C) 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

REMUS100 AUV with an integrated microfluidic system for explosives detection	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Quantitating explosive materials at trace concentrations in real-time on-site within the marine environment may prove critical to protecting civilians, waterways, and military personnel during this era of increased threat of widespread terroristic activity. Presented herein are results from recent field trials that demonstrate detection and quantitation of small nitroaromatic molecules using novel high-throughput microfluidic immunosensors (HTMI) to perform displacement-based immunoassays onboard a HYDROID REMUS100 autonomous underwater vehicle. Missions were conducted 2-3 m above the sea floor, and no HTMI failures were observed due to clogging from biomass infiltration. Additionally, no device leaks were observed during the trials. HTMIs maintained immunoassay functionality during 2 h deployments, while continuously sampling seawater absent without any pretreatment at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. This 20-fold increase in the nominal flow rate of the assay resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in both lag and assay times. Contaminated seawater that contained 20-175 ppb trinitrotoluene was analyzed.

The observed similar to 2% smoke depolarization ratio comes primarily from the nonspherical habits of particles in the smoke at certain particle sizes. In this study, the depolarization of linearly polarized light by small sphere aggregates and irregular Gaussian-shaped particles is studied, to reveal the physics between the depolarization of linearly polarized light and smoke aerosol shape and size. It is found that the depolarization ratio curves of Gaussian-deformed spheres are very similar to sphere aggregates in terms of scattering-angle dependence and particle size parameters when particle size parameter is smaller than 1.0 pi. This demonstrates that small randomly oriented nonspherical particles have some common depolarization properties as functions of scattering angle and size parameter. This may be very useful information for characterization and active remote sensing of smoke particles using polarized light. We also show that the depolarization ratio from the CALIPSO measurements could be used to derive smoke aerosol particle size. From the calculation results for light depolarization ratio by Gaussian-shaped smoke particles and the CALIPSO-measured light depolarization ratio of similar to 2% for smoke, the mean particle size of South-African smoke is estimated to be about half of the 532 nm wavelength of the CALIPSO lidar.

J	Meyer, K; Platnick, S; Oreopoulos, L; Lee, DM				Meyer, Kerry; Platnick, Steven; Oreopoulos, Lazaros; Lee, Dongmin			Estimating the direct radiative effect of absorbing aerosols overlying marine boundary layer clouds in the southeast Atlantic using MODIS and CALIOP	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Absorbing aerosols such as smoke strongly absorb solar radiation, particularly at ultraviolet and visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) wavelengths, and their presence above clouds can have considerable implications. It has been previously shown that they have a positive (i.e., warming) direct aerosol radiative effect (DARE) when overlying bright clouds. Additionally, they can cause biased passive instrument satellite retrievals in techniques that rely on VIS/NIR wavelengths for inferring the cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective radius (r(e)) of underlying clouds, which can in turn yield biased above-cloud DARE estimates. Here we investigate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud optical property retrieval biases due to overlying absorbing aerosols observed by Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and examine the impact of these biases on above-cloud DARE estimates. The investigation focuses on a region in the southeast Atlantic Ocean during August and September (2006-2011), where smoke from biomass burning in southern Africa overlies persistent marine boundary layer stratocumulus clouds. Adjusting for above-cloud aerosol attenuation yields increases in the regional mean liquid COT (averaged over all ocean-only liquid clouds) by roughly 6%; mean r(e) increases by roughly 2.6%, almost exclusively due to the COT adjustment in the non-orthogonal retrieval space. It is found that these two biases lead to an underestimate of DARE. For liquid cloud Aqua MODIS pixels with CALIOP-observed above-cloud smoke, the regional mean above-cloud radiative forcing efficiency (DARE per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)) at time of observation (near local noon for Aqua overpass) increases from 50.9Wm(-2)AOD(-1) to 65.1Wm(-2)AOD(-1) when using bias-adjusted instead of nonadjusted MODIS cloud retrievals.

Rapid climatic driven shifts of diatoms at high latitudes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The composition of marine ecosystems is determined by spatial and temporal patterns of global biogeochemical cycles. Shifts in marine ecosystem composition driven by changes in climate can in turn affect biogeochemical cycles, especially through their impact on air-sea fluxes of CO2 and trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere. However, the response of marine ecosystems to climate is difficult to assess at global scale due to the scarcity of large-scale in-situ biological monitoring programmes. Here, we combine and analyse remote-sensing observations, in-situ observations, and a global ocean biogeochemistry model to gain insight into interactions between marine ecosystem composition and climate variability over the last decade, in the North Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. Our results show large-scale shifts in the dominance of diatoms, with mean anomalies 63.3% higher during extreme positive phases of North Atlantic Oscillation index compared to its extreme negative phases and with mean anomalies 134% higher during extreme positive phases of Southern Annular Mode in the Southern Ocean over the period 1998-2008. Significant changes in the frequency of diatom dominance are detected concurrently in the three data sources studied. Model outputs indicate that this increase is driven by nutrient supply from deep waters during windier and more turbulent climate conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A comparison of methods to determine phytoplankton bloom initiation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Phytoplankton bloom phenology has important consequences for marine ecosystems and fisheries. Recent studies have used remotely sensed ocean color data to calculate metrics associated with the phenological cycle, such as the phytoplankton bloom initiation date, on regional and global scales. These metrics are often linked to physical or biological forcings. Most studies choose one of several common methods for calculating bloom initiation, leading to questions about whether bloom initiation dates calculated with different methods yield comparable results. Here we compare three methods for finding the date of phytoplankton bloom initiation in the North Atlantic: a biomass-based threshold method, a rate of change method, and a cumulative biomass-based threshold method. We use these methods to examine whether the onset of positive ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes coincides with subpolar bloom initiation. In several coherent locations, we find differences in the patterns of bloom initiation created by each method and differences in the synchrony between bloom initiation and positive heat fluxes, which likely indicate various physical processes at play in the study region. We also assess the effect of missing data on the chosen methods.

J	Vahtmae, E; Kutser, T				Vahtmaee, Ele; Kutser, Tiit			Classifying the Baltic Sea Shallow Water Habitats Using Image-Based and Spectral Library Methods	REMOTE SENSING												The structure of benthic macrophyte habitats is known to indicate the quality of coastal water. Thus, a large-scale analysis of the spatial patterns of coastal marine habitats enables us to adequately estimate the status of valuable coastal marine habitats, provide better evidence for environmental changes and describe processes that are behind the changes. Knowing the spatial distribution of benthic habitats is also important from the coastal management point of view. A big challenge in remote sensing mapping of benthic habitats is to define appropriate mapping classes that are also meaningful from the ecological point of view. In this study, the benthic habitat classification scheme was defined for the study areas in the relatively turbid north-eastern Baltic Sea coastal environment. Two different classification methods-image-based and the spectral library-method were used for image classification. The image-based classification method can provide benthic habitat maps from coastal areas, but requires extensive field studies. An alternative approach in image classification is to use measured and/or modelled spectral libraries. This method does not require fieldwork at the time of image collection if preliminary information about the potential benthic habitats and their spectral properties, as well as variability in optical water properties exists from earlier studies. A spectral library was generated through radiative transfer model HydroLight computations using measured reflectance spectra from representative benthic substrates and water quality measurements. Our previous results have shown that benthic habitat mapping should be done at high spatial resolution, owing to the small-scale heterogeneity of such habitats in the Estonian coastal waters. In this study, the capability of high spatial resolution hyperspectral airborne a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) sensor and a high spatial resolution multispectral WorldView-2 satellite sensor were tested for mapping benthic habitats. Initial evaluations of habitat maps indicate that image-based classification provides higher quality benthic maps compared to the spectral library method.

Accuracy of IKONOS for mapping benthic coral-reef habitats: a case study from the Puerto Morelos Reef National Park, Mexico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Reefs are being threatened by global warming, natural disasters, and the increased pressure of the global population. These habitats are in urgent need of mapping at high resolution so that these threats can be quantified. Remote sensing can potentially provide such quantitative data. In this article, we attempt to map benthic coral-reef habitats at the Puerto Morelos Reef National Park in Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) and to assess the accuracy of the technique in providing a baseline data for future monitoring of changes and evolution of the reef system. An IKONOS image was used in combination with checkpoint ground sampling and classified using a supervised maximum likelihood classifier (ENVI 4.5). We show that it is possible to map the reef with acceptable accuracy for the lagoon and discriminate the main habitat types, including vegetation, corals, and bare substrate. But, in areas close to the shore and in the front-reef zone, there were significant misclassifications as well as a failure to delineate spatial structures evident on the ground and in aerial imagery. These difficulties and failures occurred either in the areas deeper than 58 m where depth limits light transmission (particularly in the red channel) or when the spectral response of habitats were too close to be discriminated. This highlights the need to combine these data with other methods, such as acoustic mapping, in order to provide more accurate representations of the benthic habitats of entire reef systems.

Variability in the sub-surface light climate at ecohydrodynamically distinct sites in the North Sea	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												This paper shows that the sub-surface light regime in the offshore North Sea varies spatially and seasonally between different ecohydrodynamic regions, which is likely to have important implications for primary production and carbon and nutrient fluxes in different areas of the North Sea. Measurements of downward irradiance were collected using different instruments (i.e. water column-profiling instruments, semi-autonomous moorings, and remote sensing) at three ecohydrodynamically distinct sites in the North Sea: in the southern Bight (SB), at the Oyster Grounds (OG) and north of the Dogger Bank (ND). The ND site was the deepest, and had the lowest and least variable light attenuation coefficients (mean K-d(PAR) = 0.11 m(-1)). The onset of the phytoplankton spring bloom was earlier than at the other two sites. In summer, ND had low K-d(PAR) 0.07 m(-1) and light penetration was shifted towards blue-green wavelengths (490-560 nm), with water itself being one of the strongest contributors to overall attenuation. In contrast, the SB site was characterised by the highest and most variable values of K-d(PAR) (mean = 0.54 m(-1)), comparable to near-coastal waters, and the spring bloom started almost a month later than at the ND site. The vertical variability of the attenuation coefficient and the strong PAR attenuation in the blue region of the spectrum were the result of higher concentrations of phytoplankton, CDOM and SPM, due to riverine inputs, shallow depth and strong tidal mixing. The OG site showed intermediate conditions between the ND and SB sites with a mean K-d(PAR) = 0.23 m(-1), and deepest penetration of irradiance in the green region of the spectrum at 560 nm. The implications of these results for phytoplankton growth and ecosystem modelling are discussed.

Golam; Banu, Mehmuna R.; Seker, Dursun Zafer			Monitoring the drastic growth of ship breaking yards in Sitakunda: a threat to the coastal environment of Bangladesh	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The vast coastal and marine resources that occur along the southern edge of Bangladesh make it one of the most productive areas of the world. However, due to growing anthropogenic impacts, this area is under considerable environmental pressure from both physical and chemical stress factors. Ship breaking, or the dismantling and demolition of out-of-service ocean-going vessels, has become increasingly common in many coastal areas. To investigate the extent of ship breaking activities in Bangladesh along the Sitakunda coast, various spatial and non-spatial data were obtained, including remote sensing imagery, statistical records and published reports. Impacts to coastal and marine life were documented. Available data show that ship breaking activities cause significant physical disturbance and release toxic materials into the environment, resulting in adverse effects to numerous marine taxonomic groups such as fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Landsat imagery illustrates that the negatively impacted coastal area has grown 308.7 % from 367 ha in 1989 to 1,133 ha in 2010. Physicochemical and biological properties of coastal soil and water indicate substantially elevated pollution that poses a risk of local, regional and even global contamination through sea water and atmospheric transport. While damage to the coastal environment of Bangladesh is a recognized hazard that must be addressed, the economic benefits of ship breaking through job creation and fulfilling the domestic demand for recycled steel must be considered. Rather than an outright ban on beach breaking of ships, the enterprise must be recognized as a true and influential industry that should be held responsible for developing an economically viable and environmentally proactive growth strategy. Evolution of the industry toward a sustainable system can be aided through reasonable and enforceable legislative and judicial action that takes a balanced approach, but does not diminish the value of coastal conservation.

Seasonal variability of chlorophyll-a and oceanographic conditions in Sabah waters in relation to Asian monsoon-a remote sensing study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study was conducted to investigate the influence of Asian monsoon on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content in Sabah waters and to identify the related oceanographic conditions that caused phytoplankton blooms at the eastern and western coasts of Sabah, Malaysia. A series of remote sensing measurements including surface Chl-a, sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomaly, wind speed, wind stress curl, and Ekman pumping were analyzed to study the oceanographic conditions that lead to large-scale nutrients enrichment in the surface layer. The results showed that the Chl-a content increased at the northwest coast from December to April due to strong northeasterly wind and coastal upwelling in Kota Kinabalu water. The southwest coast (Labuan water) maintained high concentrations throughout the year due to the effect of Padas River discharge during the rainy season and the changing direction of Baram River plume during the northeast monsoon (NEM). However, with the continuous supply of nutrients from the upwelling area, the high Chl-a batches were maintained at the offshore water off Labuan for a longer time during NEM. On the other side, the northeast coast illustrated a high Chl-a in Sandakan water during NEM, whereas the northern tip off Kudat did not show a pronounced change throughout the year. The southeast coast (Tawau water) was highly influenced by the direction of the surface water transport between the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas and the prevailing surface currents. The study demonstrates the presence of seasonal phytoplankton blooms in Sabah waters which will aid in forecasting the possible biological response and could further assist in marine resource managements.

An Innovative Technique for Postprocessing Descalloping	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												ScanSAR is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition mode particularly suitable to several environmental applications due to its very large swath. This mode, once operated by virtual or real constellations, is able to remarkably reduce the revisit time, and this is of great relevance in all marine applications. Unfortunately, this particular kind of acquisition is affected by an intrinsic phenomenon, called scalloping, that hampers image interpretation, particularly in the case of data acquired over the sea. In this letter, an innovative and computationally efficient postprocessing procedure is presented in order to get rid of scalloping in ScanSAR data. Experiments accomplished over multilook ground-detected SAR COSMO-SkyMed data confirm the physical soundness of the proposed technique.					migliaccio, maurizio/0000-0002-8363-3502; Sorrentino, Antonio/0000-0002-4578-6612												1545-598X					MAY	2013	10	3					424	427		10.1109/LGRS.2012.2207879								WOS:000311802900002

Identifying the affected marine areas and the scale of influence on ecosystems is critical to assess the impacts of degraded water quality and to inform planning for catchment management and marine conservation. Studies using remotely-sensed data have contributed to our understanding of the occurrence and influence of river plumes, and to our ability to assess exposure of marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. However, refinement of plume modeling techniques is required to improve risk assessments. We developed a novel, complementary, approach to model exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to land-based pollutants. We used supervised classification of MODIS-Aqua true-color satellite imagery to map the extent of plumes and to qualitatively assess the dispersal of pollutants in plumes. We used the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest coral reef system, to test our approach. We combined frequency of plume occurrence with spatially distributed loads (based on a cost-distance function) to create maps of exposure to suspended sediment and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We then compared annual exposure maps (2007-2011) to assess inter-annual variability in the exposure of coral reefs and seagrass beds to these pollutants. We found this method useful to map plumes and qualitatively assess exposure to land-based pollutants. We observed inter-annual variation in exposure of ecosystems to pollutants in the GBR, stressing the need to incorporate a temporal component into plume exposure/risk models. Our study contributes to our understanding of plume spatial-temporal dynamics of the GBR and offers a method that can also be applied to monitor exposure of coastal-marine ecosystems to plumes and explore their ecological influences.

Those deposits are part of very important sediment reservoirs on the coast that feed and protect sandy beaches, and are key habitat for several benthic species. On the coast of Yucatan (Mexico) there are conspicuous sedimentary deposits forming well structured and outstanding submarine dune swarms, close to the shoreline at the localities of Dzilam de Bravo, San Felipe and El Cuyo. The objective of this research was to assess the spatial disposition and inter-decadal movements of these dune fields. We used standardized satellite images analyses, validated with seismic profiles and a basic sedimentological description of the identified structures in the field. The dunes showed different magnitude position changes, with estimated net annual movement rates between 2.94 m year(-1) and 10.83 m year(-1), heading mainly northwest. The spatial disposition of these dunes was confirmed by the field data, the smallest dunes detected with the satellite images were 0.31 m high, conformed by medium, conformed by medium and fine sand sediments. It is suggested that the orientation of the shore line and wave incidence, jointly with the dominant currents in the zone, determine the formation of these sediment accumulations in the region. This evaluation presents an innovative and confident approach for the study of submarine dunes in shallow waters, using remote sensing incomes and standardized spatial analyses. These findings set basis for a systematic monitoring of these marine systems, and contributes with original information on the study and understanding of the coastal marine processes in Mexico.				euan-avila, jorge /D-4717-2016													0717-3326	0718-1957				APR	2013	48	1					99	113		10.4067/S0718-19572013000100009								WOS:000319327100009						
J	Hamilton, S				Hamilton, Stuart			ASSESSING THE ROLE OF COMMERCIAL AQUACULTURE IN DISPLACING MANGROVE FOREST	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE												To fill a gap in the marine science literature, I calculated the amount of mangrove deforestation in tropical estuaries that is attributable to commercial aquaculture. The eight countries analyzed were Indonesia, Brazil,. India, Bangladesh, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Ecuador. Together these countries contain approximately 36% of the world's remaining mangrove forest. One precommercial aquaculture remote sensing survey and one current remote sensing survey were undertaken in the major mangrove holding estuaries in each nation. The time period of the analysis varied by country based on the first arrival of large-scale commercial aquaculture, with the majority of initial surveys occurring in the early to mid-1970s and all the current surveys occurring post-2004. The surveys classified the land cover of 110,557 randomly located estuarine point locations and examined the land-cover change over time for each of these discreet locations. Among the largest and most representative account of global mangrove to aquaculture conversion, this study revealed that mangrove forests have lost 51.9% of their aerial extent during the analysis period. Of the mangrove loss during this period, I estimate that commercial aquaculture accounted for 28% of total mangrove loss across all nations resulting in approximately 544,000 ha of mangrove forest converted to aquaculture. There were significant differences in mangrove loss and mangrove to aquaculture conversion from nation to nation and even within nations.

Tropospheric aerosols: Size-differentiated chemistry and large-scale spatial distributions	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												Worldwide interest in atmospheric aerosols has emerged since the late 20th century as a part of concerns for air pollution and radiative forcing of the earth's climate. The use of aircraft and balloons for sampling and the use of remote sensing have dramatically expanded knowledge about tropospheric aerosols. Our survey gives an overview of contemporary tropospheric aerosol chemistry based mainly on in situ measurements. It focuses on fine particles less than 12.5 mu m in diameter. The physical properties of particles by region and altitude are exemplified by particle size distributions, total number and volume concentration, and optical parameters such as extinction coefficient and aerosol optical depth. Particle chemical characterization is size dependent, differentiated by ubiquitous sulfate, and carbon, partially from anthropogenic activity. Large-scale particle distributions extend to intra- and intercontinental proportions involving plumes from population centers to natural disturbances such as dust storms and vegetation fires. In the marine environment, sea salt adds an important component to aerosols. Generally, aerosol components, most of whose sources are at the earth's surface, tend to dilute and decrease in concentration with height, but often show different (layered) profiles depending on meteorological conditions. Key microscopic processes include new particle formation aloft and cloud interactions, both cloud initiation and cloud evaporation. Measurement campaigns aloft are short term, giving snapshots of inherently transient phenomena in the troposphere. Nevertheless, these data, combined with long-term data at the surface and optical depth and transmission observations, yield a unique picture of global tropospheric particle chemistry.																	1096-2247	2162-2906				APR 1	2013	63	4					377	404		10.1080/10962247.2012.760499								WOS:000318148200001	23687724

An image obtained by the GeoEye satellite within the FEAC project was used for the analysis. The image covers Herald Island and adjacent waters, which are a part of the Wrangel Island Reserve, during the seasonal thaw (June 2009). It is shown that marine mammals (polar bears, walruses, and whales) can be identified on such images. The absence of synchronous ground truth observations reduces the reliability of the results.																	1062-3590					APR	2013	40	2					197	205		10.1134/S1062359013020106								WOS:000316567200010

Fracture zones have variable influence on uplift of the Kamchatka Cape Peninsula. Relevant morphologic indicators of neotectonic activity are multilevel, highly uplifted marine terraces and terraces displaced along active faults. Recent uplift rates of coastal sediments are determined by remote sensing via ASTER and SRTM DEM combined with optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL). On the Kamchatka Cape Peninsula, terraces from the same generation are mapped at different elevations by remote sensing methods. After defining different areas of uplifted terraces, four neotectonic blocks are identified. According to apatite fission track data, the mean differential exhumation rates range from 0.2 to 1.2 mm year(-1) across the blocks since Late Miocene. The OSL data presented point to significant higher uplift rates of up to 3 +/- A 0.5 and 4.3 +/- A 1 mm year(-1), which indicates an acceleration of the vertical movement along the coast of Kamchatka Cape Peninsula in Upper Pleistocene and Holocene times.
