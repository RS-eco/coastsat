Biomonitoring is an essential tool for the complete implementation of new European Union Directives (e.g., the Water Framework Directive and the related Marine Strategy Framework Directive). In addition, the unique properties of nanoscale materials offer excellent prospects for interfacing biological recognition events with electronic signal transduction and for designing a new generation of bioelectronic devices exhibiting novel functions. Recent technological developments in miniaturizing electronics and wireless-communication technology have led to the emergence of environmental sensor networks, which will greatly enhance monitoring of the natural environment and, in some cases, open up new techniques for taking measurements or allow previously impossible deployments of sensors. This article reviews the principles, the advantages and the limitations of biosensors for screening and diagnosis of organic compounds in the environment with special emphasis in those based on nanomaterials. it also reviews new technologies for remote biosensing.

Data on total particulate matter (PM) as well as POC collected during nine cruises in spring, summer and early winter from 1997-2000 as part of the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico (NEGOM) study were used to test algorithms across a range of environments from low %POC coastal waters to high %POC open-ocean waters. Finding that the remote-sensing reflectance clearly exhibited a peak shift from blue-to-green wavelengths with increasing POC concentration, we developed a Maximum Normalized Difference Carbon Index (MNDCI) algorithm which uses the maximum band ratio of all available blue-to-green wavelengths, and provides a very robust estimate over a wide range of POC and PM concentrations (R(2)=0.99, N=58). The algorithm can be extrapolated throughout the region of shipboard sampling for more detailed coverage and analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Krishna			Validation of MODIS derived aerosol optical depth and an investigation on aerosol transport over the South East Arabian Sea during ARMEX-II	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The influence of wind and humidity on aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Arabian sea is being investigated using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Level 3 (Collection-5) and NCEP (National Centres for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data for the second phase of the Arabian Sea Monsoon Experiment (ARMEX-II) over the South East Arabian Sea (SEAS) in the pre-monsoon period (14 March-10 April 2003). In order to qualify MODIS data for this study, MODIS aerosol parameters were first compared with ship borne Microtops measurements. This showed correlations 0.96-0.97 in the case of spectral AODs and a correlation 0.72 for the angstrom exponents. The daily AOD data from MODIS and winds from NCEP reveal that the ship observed episodic enhancement and decay of AOD at the TSL (Time Series Location) during 23 March-6 April 2003 was caused by the southward drift of an aerosol pocket driven by an intensification and reduction of surface pressure in the North Western Arabian Sea with a low altitude convergence prevailing over SEAS. The AOD increase coincided with a decrease in the Angstrom exponent and the fine mode fraction suggesting the pocket being dominated by coarse mode particles. A partial correlation analysis reveals that the lower altitude wind convergence is the most influential atmospheric variable in modulating AOD over the ARMEX-II domain during the TSL period. However, surface winds at a distant zone in the north/north west upwind direction also had a moderate influence, though with a lag of two days. But this effect was minor since the winds were not strong enough to produce marine aerosols matching with the high AODs over the ARMEX-II domain. These findings and the similarity between MODIS column mass concentration and the ship borne QCM (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) measured coarse mode mass concentration, suggest that the aerosol pocket was mostly composed of coarse mode mineral dust in the lower atmospheric altitudes transported from the Arabian deserts.

J	Lan, TD				Lan, Tran Dinh			Assessment of some marine ecosystems using sustainable utilization indicators in Hai Phong-Quang Ninh coastal area, Vietnam	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												This study is aimed at analyzing key indicators for the evaluation of changes and tendencies of sustainable utilization and management in some marine ecosystems in the coastal waters of Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area. To complete this study, the methods employed consisted of the application of remote sensing data and geographic information systems to extract information on spatial distribution of mangrove and tidal flat ecosystems, as well as on the reclamation area for human development and indicator investigation and analysis, using remote sensing extracted and field survey monitored data with Microsoft Excel (MS Excel). Applying indicators for sustainable utilization and management of marine ecosystems, developed in recent studies for the Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area, demonstrated changes and trends in significant ecosystems, such as coral reefs and mangroves. The outcomes showed that from 1998 to 2003, living coral cover was reduced by 20% on average in the Ha Long Bay area and by 13% in Cat Ba (Hang Trai - Dau Be), and projected that living coral cover would be reduced by a further 10% to 50% by 2010. The number of coral species was much reduced by 15% to 72% in the Ha Long - Cat Ba area. Mangrove area also decreased between 1995 and 2004, particularly after 2000, and is projected to be only 10,000 ha in 2010 in Quang Ninh. Marine ecosystems in the coastal waters of Hai Phong - Quang Ninh area have degraded significantly, particularly coral reefs, mangroves and tidal flats.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2009	12	3					243	248		10.1080/14634980903140364								WOS:000270156100003						
J	Andreae, MO				Andreae, M. O.			Correlation between cloud condensation nuclei concentration and aerosol optical thickness in remote and polluted regions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A large number of published and unpublished measurements of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements have been analyzed. AOT measurements were obtained mostly from the AERONET network, and selected to be collocated as closely as possible to the CCN investigations. In remote marine regions, CCN0.4 (CCN at a supersaturation of 0.4%) are around 110 cm(-3) and the mean AOT(500) (AOT at 500 nm) is 0.057. Over remote continental areas, CCN are almost twice as abundant, while the mean AOT500 is ca. 0.075. (Sites dominated by desert dust plumes were excluded from this analysis.) Some, or maybe even most of this difference must be because even remote continental sites are in closer proximity to pollution sources than remote marine sites. This suggests that the difference between marine and continental levels must have been smaller before the advent of anthropogenic pollution. Over polluted marine and continental regions, the CCN concentrations are about one order of magnitude higher than over their remote counterparts, while AOT is about five times higher over polluted than over clean regions. The average CCN concentrations from all studies show a remarkable correlation to the corresponding AOT values, which can be expressed as a power law. This can be very useful for the parameterization of CCN concentrations in modeling studies, as it provides an easily measured proxy for this variable, which is difficult to measure directly. It also implies that, at least at large scales, the radiative and microphysical effects of aerosols on cloud physics are correlated and not free to vary fully independently. While the observed strong empirical correlation is remarkable, it must still be noted that there is about a factor-of-four range of CCN concentrations at a given AOT, and that there remains considerable room for improvement in remote sensing techniques for CCN abundance.

Because larval dispersion takes place on different spatial scales, global operational satellite data can be successfully used to investigate the connectivity of marine populations on different spatial and temporal scales. In fact, satellite data have long been used for the study of the large and mesoscale biological processes associated with ocean dynamics. This paper presents simulations of spiny lobster larvae transport in the Tropical Atlantic using the geostrophic currents, generated by altimetry that feeds an advection/diffusion model. Simulations were conducted over the Tropical Atlantic ( 20 degrees N to 15 degrees S), considering four larvae release areas: the Cape Verde Archipelago, the Ivory Coast, Ascension Island and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago. We used mean geostrophic current ( MGC) calculated from 2001 to 2005 to represent the mean circulation of the Tropical Atlantic. We also ran the model for the El Nino geostrophic current regime (ENGC) using part of the MGC data, representing the El Nino 2002/2003 event. Results suggest that the intensification of the mesoscale ocean processes associated with El Nino events promotes the connectivity between populations, increasing the chances of a genetic flux among different stocks. We concluded that the altimetry geostrophic current data together with a relatively simple advection/diffusion model can provide useful information about the physical dynamics necessary to conduct studies on larval dispersion.

Pros and cons of using seabirds as ecological indicators	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Climate change and overfishing are increasingly causing unanticipated changes in marine ecosystems (e.g. shifts in species dominance). In order to understand and anticipate these changes, there is a crucial need for indicators that summarise large quantities of information into a few relevant and accessible signals. Seabirds have been suggested as good candidates for ecological indicators of the marine environment; however, few studies have critically evaluated their value as such. We review the role of seabirds as ecological indicators, and discuss their limitations and drawbacks, as compared to other types of indicators. In addition, we highlight the statistical consequences of inverse inference when using seabird data as indicators. We discuss the use of integrated indices and the use of seabirds as autonomous samplers of the marine environment. Finally, we highlight the necessary steps preceding the use of seabirds as indicators. We conclude that, in order to use seabird time series properly, the use of recent advances both in statistics and in remote sensing is a way to move forward. This, along with the assessment of their usefulness, should enable us to use seabird indicators appropriately for managing urgent conservation problems.

In order to implement a countermeasure in case of oil spills, it is necessary to monitor oil spills using remote sensing techniques. Spectral measurements were undertaken for five oil types in 2007. Based on oil spectral characteristics, this study demonstrates how moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) can monitor oil spills in the Jeyeh storage tank-leaking event in Lebanon. With finer spectral resolutions and more spectral bands, MODIS provides the capability for the identification of oil spills.																	1527-5922						2009	10	4					317	323	PII 917901300	10.1080/15275920903347024								WOS:000272899700008

A multi-interdisciplinary study, including two UK freshwaters with a history of toxic cyanobacterial blooms, was undertaken to explore different approaches for the identification, monitoring and management of potentially-toxic cyanobacteria and their associated risks. The results demonstrate that (i) cyanobacterial bloom occurrence can be predicted at a local-and national-scale using process-based and statistical models; (ii) cyanobacterial concentration and distribution in waterbodies can be monitored using remote sensing, but minimum detection limits need to be evaluated; (iii) cyanotoxins may be transferred to spray-irrigated root crops; and (iv) attitudes and perceptions towards risks influence the public's preferences and willingness-to-pay for cyanobacterial health risk reductions in recreational waters.

Self-similar distribution of oil spills in European coastal waters	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Marine pollution has been highlighted thanks to the advances in detection techniques as well as increasing coverage of catastrophes (e. g. the oil tankers Amoco Cadiz, Exxon Valdez, Erika, and Prestige) and of smaller oil spills from ships. The new satellite based sensors SAR and ASAR and new methods of oil spill detection and analysis coupled with self-similar statistical techniques allow surveys of environmental pollution monitoring large areas of the ocean. We present a statistical analysis of more than 700 SAR images obtained during 1996-2000, also comparing the detected small pollution events with the historical databases of great marine accidents during 1966-2004 in European coastal waters. We show that the statistical distribution of the number of oil spills as a function of their size corresponds to Zipf's law, and that the common small spills are comparable to the large accidents due to the high frequency of the smaller pollution events. Marine pollution from tankers and ships, which has been detected as oil spills between 0.01 and 100 km(2), follows the marine transit routes. Multi-fractal methods are used to distinguish between natural slicks and spills, in order to estimate the oil spill index in European coastal waters, and in particular, the north-western Mediterranean Sea, which, due to the influence of local winds, shows optimal conditions for oil spill detection.				surname, name/A-2183-2010; Redondo, Jose/D-1049-2009	Redondo, Jose/0000-0002-4006-301X												1748-9326					JAN-MAR	2009	4	1							014008	10.1088/1748-9326/4/1/014008								WOS:000265878500009

The spectral characteristics, magnitude and variability of the components of light absorption are documented and contrasted here for the broad range of conditions manifested in the 11 Finger Lakes of New York. The absorption coefficient, a (m(-1)), was partitioned according to the additive components of colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)), non-algal particles (a(NAP)), phytoplankton (a(phi)), and water itself (a(w); known), using laboratory spectrophotometric protocols on near surface samples collected monthly in 2004. Bulk in-situ measurements included Secchi disc depth (SD), irradiance profiles to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d, m(-1)), and the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm [c(660)]. The average exponential slope values for CDOM (0.0175 nm(-1)) and NAP (0.0121 nm(-1)) were nearly equivalent to, and spectral features of a phi were similar to, those reported by Babin et al. (2003b) for coastal marine waters around Europe. Order of magnitude differences in study average values of a(CDOM), a(NAP), and a(phi) were observed amongst the study lakes. The largest component in each of the lakes, for the commonly adopted reference wavelength of 440 nm, was CDOM: it represented from 48 to 68 % of a amongst the study lakes. The a(NAP) and a(phi) components were approximately of equal importance, with a(NAP)(440) exceeding a(phi)(440) in 6 of the lakes. The value of a, from summation of the Measured components, was a strong predictor of K-d differences amongst the lakes, and it had significant relationships with average values of SD and c(660). The ratio of the watershed area to the lake Volume was found to be a strong predictor of the major differences in both a(CDOM)(440) and a(NAP)(440) amongst the lakes indicating the importance of terrigenous inputs of these constituent.																	1863-9135						2009	173	4					305	320		10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0173-0305								WOS:000264204800005

Stratigraphic and structural evolution of the Blue Nile Basin, Northwestern Ethiopian Plateau	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The Blue Nile Basin, situated in the Northwestern Ethiopian Plateau, contains similar to 1400 m thick Mesozoic sedimentary section underlain by Neoproterozoic basement rocks and overlain by Early-Late Oligocene and Quaternary volcanic rocks. This study outlines the stratigaphic and structural evolution of the Blue Nile Basin based on field and remote sensing studies along the Gorge of the Nile. The Blue Nile Basin has evolved in three main phases,: (1) pre-sedimentation phase, include pre-rift peneplanation of the Neoproterozoic basement rocks, possibly during Palaeozoic time (2) sedimentation phase from Triassic to Early Cretaceous, including: (a) Triassic-Early Jurassic fluvial sedimentation (Lower Sandstone, similar to 300 m thick); (b) Early Jurassic marine transgression (glauconitic sandy mudstone, similar to 30 m thick) (c) Early-Middle Jurassic deepening of the basin (Lower Limestone, similar to 450 m thick); (d) desiccation of the basin and deposition of Early-Middle Jurassic gypsum: (e) Middle-Late Jurassic marine transgression (Upper Limestone, similar to 400 in thick) (f) Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous basin-uplilt and marine regression (alluvial/fluvial Upper Sandstone, similar to 280 m thick); (3) the post-sedimentation phase, including Early-Late Oligocene eruption of 500-2000 m thick Lower volcanic rocks, related to the Afar Mantle Plume and emplacement of similar to 300 in thick Quaternary Upper volcanic rocks. The Mesozoic to Cenozoic units were deposited during extension attributed to Triassic-Cretaceous NE-SW-directed extension related to the Mesozoic rifting of Gondwana. The Blue Nile Basin was formed as a NW-trending rift. within which much of the Mesozoic clastic and marine sediments were deposited. This was followed by Late Miocene NW-SE-directed extension related to the Main Ethiopian Rift that formed NE-trending faults. affecting Lower volcanic rocks and the Upper part of the Mesozoic section. The region was subsequently affected by Quaternary E-W and NNE-SSW-directed extensions related to oblique opening of the Main Ethiopian Rift and development of E-trending transverse faults, as well as NE-SW-directed extension in Southern Afar (related to northeastward separation of the Arabian Plate from the African Plate) and E-W-directed extensions in western Afar (related to the stepping of the Red Sea axis into Afar). These Quaternary stress regimes resulted in the development of N-, ESE- and NW-trending extensional structures within the Blue Nile Basin.

The gradient images of both types of sensors show the twin-front structure near Cape Henlopen, which is also captured in a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image. Six consecutive SST images are used to track plume variability due to tidal forcing and the features of the plume front are found to be different between ebb and flood tides. Five consecutive SST images taken during a pronounced upwelling-favourable wind event show the plume widened and separated offshore, while cooler water upwelled onshore of the separated plume.

It is important to monitor the geographic extent and health of mangrove forests and seagrass beds, which serve as an important habitat for juvenile marine species. Remote-sensing data for the Khor A1 Bazam area in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi, UAE, covering the years of 1994, 2000, and 2003, were used to determine the change in mangrove and seagrass cover. Since 1994, there has been an increase in mangrove cover, likely because of plantation activity, the closure of nearby shipyards, and an increase in public awareness regarding mangrove preservation. Although more difficult to determine, a combination of remote sensing and ground-truthing indicates that the seagrass beds within the study area have likely increased in real extent over the same time period.																	0749-0208					JAN	2009	25	1					48	56		10.2112/07-0867.1								WOS:000262698900005

Assessment of Water-Leaving Reflectances of Oceanic and Coastal Waters Using MERIS Satellite Products off the Southwest Coast of Portugal	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Optical properties of oceanic waters have provided an important tool for observing large scale fluctuations in oceanic conditions by remote sensing. However, there are still problems with calibrating the algorithms that link remote sensing data with in situ measurements, particularly, in coastal areas where there are adjacency affects from land on the reflectance data observed by the satellite sensor. As part of a contract with the European Space Agency to validate the marine products of the MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor on the ENVISAT satellite, this study is taking regular measurements with a Satlantic hyperspectral radiometer ranging from inshore to offshore sites, covering both case-1 and case-2 waters off the south west coast of Portugal. Water-leaving reflectances (rho(w)) were estimated from downwelling and upwelling spectral irradiances, and compared with MERIS rho(w) for a period between September and November 2008. The results of the "match-up" analysis showed that there was reasonable agreement between the data sets over the period of study at the offshore site where the land adjacency affect on the satellite data was reduced. The greatest deviation of in situ data from satellite values was at the inshore site and at the lower wavelengths of the visible spectrum, where the p,, for the blue band were most affected by atmospheric corrections. This study suggests that calibration algorithms of MERIS products with in situ data from the south west coast of Portugal could be improved by using, for example, ICOL (Improved Contrast between Ocean and Land) processing.

The 600 km(2) shelf study area included a range of seafloor morphologies. The example of the 60-km long coastal strip in Palm Beach County shows the range of morphological features that includes rock ridges, drowned beach ridges, ridge and valley topography, ridge fields, nearshore rock, structural troughs, shelf-edge coral reefs, sand flats, sand waves, diabathic channel fields, and upper slope marine terraces. Geomorphological interpretation of airborne laser bathymetry shows an orderly spatial distribution of shelf features that was heretofore unappreciated from conventional bathymetric display.																	0749-0208						2009			2		56		1494	1498										WOS:000266722400120

Analyze of the Inherent Optical Properties of French Guiana Coastal Waters for Remote Sensing Applications	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				The development of bio-optical algorithms to assess the spatio-temporal variability of Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) and biogeochemical related components from space, is conditioned by our knowledge on these IOPs. The objective of this study is to characterize the IOPs and their relationships with biogeochemical parameters for the development of a future algorithm dedicated to the observation of the nearshore and offshore waters of the French Guiana from usual ocean color remote sensors. For that purpose, a set of IOPs and biogeochemical parameters was gathered from field measurements performed during a cruise achieved in the coastal waters of Cayenne in July 2006. The mean values of the mass specific non-algal absorption, (a(nap)(443)/SPM = 0.023 +/- 0.018 m(2)g(-1)), particulate scattering (b(p)(650)/SPM = 0.36 +/- 0.23 m(2)g(-1)) and backscattering (b(bp)(532)/SPM = 0.0065 +/- 0.0025 m(2)g(-1)) coefficients, as well as the a(nap)(lambda) spectral behaviors, are in good agreement with the fact the investigated waters are dominated by mineral particles. The relatively low particulate backscattering to scattering ratio value for such waters (0.014 +/- 0.004) could be explained by the presence of relatively large particles or aggregates with lower refractive index than pure mineral particles. This study shows that the chlorophyll concentration is largely overestimated with the standard OC4v4 algorithm.

Hydrodynamically Induced or Modified Patterns Derived from Satellite Images in the Coastal Waters of Estonia	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					10th International Coastal Symposium (ICS 2009)	APR 13-18, 2009	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Coastal Educ Res Fdn, Ctr Estud Geograf Planeament Reg, Univ Nova Lisbon, Fac Cienc Soc Humanas				Due to a complex coastline, water column properties show large temporal and spatial variability in the coastal waters of Estonia. Therefore, as an addition to relatively coarse traditional monitoring, analysis of satellite images has became an increasingly popular method. The present study focuses on the identification of some hydrodynamically induced or modified patterns, recognizable from satellite images, such as river and dredging plumes, frontal zones between water masses of different origin, upwellings and coastal jets. The main aim was to match the patterns either with in situ measurement data or hydrodynamic hindcast modelling results. We used satellite imagery (MODIS, ALI), measurements of currents, waves and water column properties obtained in 2005-2008, as well as 2D hydrodynamic modelling of the coastal waters. The results show that dredging plumes in the shallow coastal waters are often overshadowed by storm induced resuspension; upwellings along straight sections of the coast are quite frequent and well visible from sea surface temperature images, while products for chlorophyll do not reveal straightforward results; river plumes and hydrochemical fronts between marine sub-basins can be monitored both by turbidity and coloured dissolved organic matter products.

Combining vessel-based surveys and tracking data to identify key marine areas for seabirds	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												An understanding of the distribution and habitat associations of far-ranging marine predators is being increasingly applied to protect these species from anthropogenic threats at sea (e.g. oil spills and fisheries bycatch). Within this framework, this research on Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea integrates vessel-based survey and tracking data to provide 2 distinct, yet complementary, perspectives of the habitats of this species in the western Mediterranean during incubation in June and chick rearing in August of 2007. We used a hierarchical modelling approach to (1) delineate the foraging habitat of the species using vessel-based surveys and (2) identify its feeding habitat based on tracking data within the Information-Theoretic framework. Our habitat modelling analyses suggest that shearwaters respond to complex bio-physical coupling, illustrated by their association with frontal features and elevated ocean productivity. Our models yielded moderate predictions of Cory's shearwater habitats within 2 distinct spatial scales. At the mesoscale, the foraging range of the species comprised the continental and insular shelf-slope waters of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, between the Gulf of Lions to the north and Cape Palos to the south. At the coarse scale, the tracking data highlighted important feeding areas within this larger foraging range: 3 continental shelf-slope 'hotspots'-(1) Gulf of Lions, (2) Cape Creus-Barcelona-Ebro Delta and (3) Cape La Nao-Cape Palos; from north to south-as well as the insular shelf-slope areas around the Balearic Islands. These results match previous observations of the foraging range and feeding patterns of the species, and are consistent with the interpretation of the regional oceanography. This study highlights how the integration of tracking and vessel-based survey data can provide a wider understanding of the predictability of aggregation (i.e. hotspots) and the key oceanographic habitats of far-ranging seabirds at multiple spatial scales. Thus, complementary data integration is a step forward in conservation studies of far-ranging marine top predators.

Rugosity-based regional modeling of hard-bottom habitat	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Systematic conservation planning is most often directed at the representation and protection of marine biodiversity. However, direct observation and sampling of marine biodiversity is extremely time consuming and expensive. Due to these constraints, marine conservation planners have sought proxies for marine biodiversity to use in their models, Hard-bottom habitats support high levels of biodiversity and are frequently used as a surrogate for it in marine spatial planning. Rugosity (i.e. the roughness of the seafloor) is an indicator of hard-bottom habitat. In the present study, we expand on previous analyses of the relationship between rugosity and hard-bottom and create the first data-driven regional rugosity model to predict hard-bottom habitat. We used logistic regression to create an empirical model and compare it to other pre-formulated definitions of rugosity with receiver operator characteristic curves. Our model performed better than all other models and was able to correctly predict the presence or absence of hard-bottom habitat with similar to 70 % accuracy. This model offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to more traditional survey methods, and should be of value to regional conservation planners and fisheries managers as an initial predictor of hard-bottom habitat. By testing this model with low-resolution (90 m) bathymetry data, we demonstrate that this type of information may be used in marine conservation plans in regions such as developing countries, where high-resolution data is not currently available. Further, our model offers a proxy for marine habitat diversity in non-coastal areas, an under-represented sector in marine conservation planning.

This quest implies that fish-habitat relationships are characterized across different spatial scales. Remote sensing allows now for a routine description of habitats from global-regional to detailed reef scales, thus theoretically offering access to hierarchical spatial analysis at multiple scales. To judge the progress in using remotely sensed habitat variables for reef fish study, existing peer-reviewed papers on the subject are reviewed. We tabulated the significant fish-habitat relationships given the different study sites, fish and habitat variables, statistical analysis, sampling efforts and scales. Studies generally do not corroborate each other. Instead, the exercise provides a diversity of thematic results from which lessons remain equivocal. It is thus justified to recommend more systematic and hierarchical remote-sensing based research in the future. We advocate the use of remote-sensing early in the design of the fish study, as part of a coherent conceptual scheme spanning all spatial scales. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bathymetry data is used to analyze the geography, ecosystem, and health of marine habitats. Current methods for shallow water measurements typically involve large manned vessels that are costly to operate and that may pose a danger to themselves and the environment in shallow, semi-navigable waters. Small vessels, however, are prone to disturbances by shallow water waves, tides, and currents, thereby requiring more instrumentation and computation to accurately process bathymetric data. The SCU/MBARI autonomous surface vessel, SeaWASP, is designed to operate safely and stably in waters as shallow as 1 m without significant manned support in order to produce cost-effective and high-quality bathymetric maps. The SeaWASP design introduces several key design innovations in order to provide high-quality maps with a platform that is safe, stable, and inexpensive. A small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) design features a submerged dual hull, a small waterplane area, and a high mass-to-damping ratio, thereby making the craft less prone to disturbances. Precision sensing, autonomous control, and platform-level configuration planning and control algorithms are used to navigate the boat along desirable trajectories in support of efficient map generation and to implement low-cost unpiloted operations. Bathymetry is measured with multibeam sonar in concert with Doppler Velocity Logger and GPS sensors. The vessel has been operated successfully in several open water test environments, including Elkhorn Slough, Steven's Creek Reservoir, and Lake Tahoe, all in California. It is currently in the final stages of integration and test for its first major science mission at Orcas Island, San Juan Islands, WA, in 2009. Final deployment will be at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Kasitsna Bay Laboratory in Alaska as one element of a mufti-system remote observatory. SeaWASP has been developed in partnership with SCU, MBARI, the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and NOAA's West Coast and Polar Regions Undersea Research Center.

Molecular biology techniques and applications for ocean sensing	OCEAN SCIENCE												The study of marine microorganisms using molecular biological techniques is now widespread in the ocean sciences. These techniques target nucleic acids which record the evolutionary history of microbes, and encode for processes which are active in the ocean today. Molecular techniques can form the basis of remote instrumentation sensing technologies for marine microbial diversity and ecological function. Here we review some of the most commonly used molecular biological techniques. These techniques include the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse-transcriptase PCR, quantitative PCR, whole assemblage "fingerprinting" approaches ( based on nucleic acid sequence or length heterogeneity), oligonucleotide microarrays, and high-throughput shotgun sequencing of whole genomes and gene transcripts, which can be used to answer biological, ecological, evolutionary and biogeochemical questions in the ocean sciences.

Some relevant legislative drivers are listed, as they provide one context in which ecosystem studies are undertaken. In addition to literature cited within the text the paper contains some useful web links to assist the reader in making an informed instrument choice, as the authors feel that the topic is so broad, it is impossible to discuss all relevant systems or to provide appropriate detail for those discussed. It is therefore an introduction to how and why ecosystem status is currently observed, what variables are quantified, from what platforms, using remote sensing or in-situ measurements, and gives examples of useful sensor based tools.

Adaptation and Change with Global Warming Emerging Spatial World Structure and Transportation Impacts	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					88th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 11-15, 2009	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				Today, the governing spatial structure of Earth is that of a ribbon around the globe. Economic activity and habitation are mostly limited to this developed ribbon. As the polar ice retreats and better ships and remote sensing are being developed, the habitable edge of the world is moving ever farther into the Arctic, leading to the emergence of a new spatial structure of Earth: the semiglobe. In a semiglobe system, the Arctic is no longer the most remote area of Earth but is its center. The practical consequences of polar ice retreat are notably Arctic resource development and Arctic shipping routes. The largest impact on global marine transportation occurs as all-year shipping develops in the Arctic, eventually leading to-because of shorter distances-most marine transportation between the North Atlantic and the North Pacific going through the Arctic Ocean. This has important consequences for transportation, security, and natural resource use. The Arctic sea routes also hold geopolitical importance as alternative routes, for example, if conflicts at the Panama or Suez Canal interrupt intercontinental shipping. This gives added importance to the gates to the Arctic Ocean and surrounding nations.

We use an empirical approach that removes the first order effects of [ChI] from satellite ocean color, thus allowing us to quantify the impact on the ocean color signal of optical anomalies that vary independently of the global mean trends with remotely sensed [ChI]. We then present statistical and modeling analyses to interpret the observed anomalies in terms of their optical sources (i.e. absorption and backscattering coefficients). We identify two main sources of second order variability for a given [ChI]: 1) the amount of non-algal absorption, especially due to colored dissolved organic matter; and 2) the amplitude of the backscattering coefficient of particles. The global distribution of the anomalies displays significant regional and seasonal trends, providing important information for characterizing the marine optical environment and for inferring biogeochemical influences. We subsequently use our empirically determined anomalies to estimate the backscattering coefficient of particles and the combined absorption coefficient for colored detrital and dissolved materials. This purely empirical approach provides an independent assessment of second order optical variability for comparison with existing methods that are generally based on semi-analytical models.

The loss is calculated as the difference between the (modelled) rate of photosynthesis and the observed, realized rate of change of phytoplankton biomass. A Monte Carlo procedure is used to recover the loss rates. The (biomass-normalized) total loss rate shows a seasonal cycle with values ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg C (mg Chl)(-1) h(-1) and shows an abrupt shift during the spring bloom. On the other hand, the absolute loss rate increases during blooms, a consequence of the increase in the biomass. The normalized total loss rate can be further expressed as a time-varying fraction of the assimilation number. The fraction lies in the range from 0.2 to 0.8. During the increasing (decreasing) phase of phytoplankton blooming, the ratio of growth to total loss increases (decreases), such that this ratio may have value as an ecological indicator for blooms.																	0094-8276					DEC 5	2008	35	23							L23606	10.1029/2008GL035666								WOS:000261471100003

Using many consecutive images, these observed properties are compared with numerical model results, and through a simple, optimal least-squares estimator approach the estimated bathymetry is adjusted gradually for each image in order to improve the fit between model output and observations. The key advantages of the technique are that it is based on multiple sources of information (i.e., different remote sensors and/or data products), depends on only a few free parameters (to which the model results are insensitive), and shows good skill. Herein, the technique is applied to a synthetic case and two sets of field data from sites at Duck, NC (USA) and Egmond (The Netherlands). The method, which may be extended with observations of other properties from other sources than the three described in this paper, can deliver coastal state information (i.e., simultaneous updates of bathymetry, waves, and currents) with high temporal and spatial resolution and can be used in conjunction with or instead of in-situ measured data.

A statistical correction scheme based on a multilinear regression algorithm is used here to remove systematic differences between in situ and remote-sensing measurements. The application of the correction scheme to Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOINS) primary radiometric products improves the convergence between remote-sensing and in situ measurements, with the largest effects at 412 and 443 nm. Specifically, the scatter and bias of MODIS derived with respect to in situ L(wn) at 412 nm have shown values of 12% and 3% for corrected with respect to values of 34% and -28% for uncorrected data, respectively. Similarly, the scatter and bias for SeaWiFS-derived L(wn) at 412 nm have shown values of 14% and 4% for corrected with respect to 32% and -20% for uncorrected data. Results at 667 nm for MODIS and at 670 nm for SeaWiFS, although displaying a reduction in the scatter of data, have shown a significant residual bias of about 11% and 17% with respect to in situ values. Finally, it was shown the need for restricting the application of the correction scheme to data with atmospheric and marine optical features represented within the reference data set used to define the correction coefficients.

Boundary Layer, Cloud, and Drizzle Variability in the Southeast Pacific Stratocumulus Regime	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The southeast Pacific stratocumulus regime is an important component of the earth's climate system because of its substantial impact on albedo. Observational studies of this cloud regime have been limited, but during the past 5 yr, a series of cruises with research vessels equipped with in situ and remote sensing systems have provided unprecedented observations of boundary layer cloud and drizzle structures. These cruises started with the East Pacific Investigation of Climate (EPIC) 2001 field experiment, followed by cruises in a similar area in 2003 and 2004 [Pan-American Climate Studies (PACS) Stratus cruises]. The sampling from these three cruises provides a sufficient dataset to study the variability occurring over this region. This study compares observations from the 2004 cruise with those obtained during the previous two cruises. Observations from the ship provide information about boundary layer structure, fractional cloudiness, cloud depth, and drizzle characteristics. This study indicates more strongly decoupled boundary layers during the 2004 cruise than the well-mixed conditions that dominated the cloud and boundary layer structures during the EPIC cruise, and the highly variable conditions-sharp transitions from a solid stratus deck to broken-cloud and clear-sky periods-encountered during PACS Stratus 2003. Diurnal forcing and synoptic conditions are considered to be factors affecting these variations. A statistical evaluation of the macrophysical boundary layer, cloud, and drizzle properties is performed using the 5-6-day periods for which the research vessels remained stationed at the location of 20 S, 85 W during each cruise.																	0894-8755					DEC 1	2008	21	23					6191	6214		10.1175/2008JCLI2186.1								WOS:000261754100006

Dust storms originating over the world's arid regions contribute a large fraction of aerosols in the atmosphere. Using remote sensing data, an anomalous enhancement in the biological productivity of sea was observed in the Gulf of Oman which was attributed only to cold sea surface temperature ( SST) eddies ( during November to early December months of 1996-1999), whereas recent study has shown that during dust storms (June-July-August and October-November-December months of 1997-2004), major nutrient supply is from atmospheric dust deposition. We have carried out a study of individual cases of major dust storms over the Arabian Sea during the entire year ( December 2003-December 2006) to quantify role of dust storms and changes in ocean surface due to chlorophyll bloom. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) Aqua, we have found that the deposition of dust along the passage of major dust storms ( aerosol optical depth (AOD) similar to 0.25-0.41) occuring over the Arabian Sea causes chlorophyll blooming ( usually 10-22.43 mg/m(3)) within a period of 1-2 to up to 3-4 days. However, we have also found significant anomalous cooling of the ocean surface ( SST) and relatively higher ocean wind speeds (QuikSCAT) during dust storms that may lead to favorable conditions for blooming. Exact nature and cause of chlorophyll bloom in the semienclosed northern Arabian Sea, surrounded by one of the world's major sources of dust storms ( Africa, Middle East, Iran, and Afghanistan), are very important in understanding the productivity and the biogeochemical cycles of the marine ecosystem. The results have been validated using the Indian Remote Sensing Polar-4 Ocean Color Monitor (IRS P4 OCM) data.

As a result, only optical depths of thinner clouds (< about 3 for GLAS) are retrieved from the reflected lidar signal. This paper presents a comprehensive study of possible retrievals of optical depth of thick clouds using solar background light and treating GLAS as a solar radiometer. To do so one must first calibrate the reflected solar radiation received by the photon-counting detectors of the GLAS 532-nm channel, the primary channel for atmospheric products. Solar background radiation is regarded as a noise to be subtracted in the retrieval process of the lidar products. However, once calibrated, it becomes a signal that can be used in studying the properties of optically thick clouds. In this paper, three calibration methods are presented: (i) calibration with coincident airborne and GLAS observations, (ii) calibration with coincident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and GLAS observations of deep convective clouds, and (iii) calibration from first principles using optical depth of thin water clouds over ocean retrieved by GLAS active remote sensing. Results from the three methods agree well with each other. Cloud optical depth (COD) is retrieved from the calibrated solar background signal using a one-channel retrieval. Comparison with COD retrieved from GOES during GLAS overpasses shows that the average difference between the two retrievals is 24%. As an example, the COD values retrieved from GLAS solar background are illustrated for a marine stratocumulus cloud field that is too thick to be penetrated by the GLAS laser. Based on this study, optical depths for thick clouds will be provided as a supplementary product to the existing operational GLAS cloud products in future GLAS data releases.

As this CO2 is absorbed by seawater, it not only reacts causing a reduction in seawater pH (or acidification) but also decreases the carbonate mineral saturation state (Omega), which plays an important role in calcification for many marine organisms. Ocean acidification could affect some of the most fundamental biological processes of the sea in coming decades. Observations obtained in situ from Volunteer Observing Ships and the multiple geochemical surveys have been extended using satellite remote sensing and modeled environmental parameters to derive estimates of sea-surface alkalinity (A(T)) and carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2,sw)). Pairing estimates of A(T) and pCO(2,sw) have permitted characterisation of the changes in sea-surface Omega, which have transpired over the past decade throughout the Greater Carribean Region as a consequence of ocean acidification. The results reveal considerable spatial and temporal variability throughout the region. Despite this variability, we observe a strong decrease in aragonite saturation state (Omega(arg)) at a rate of approximately -0.012 +/- 0.001 Omega(arg) yr(-1) (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.001).				Eakin, C.

J	Beech, T; Dowd, M; Field, C; Hatcher, B; Andrefouet, S				Beech, Talia; Dowd, Michael; Field, Chris; Hatcher, Bruce; Andrefouet, Serge			A stochastic approach to marine reserve design: Incorporating data uncertainty	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Marine reserves, or protected areas, are used to meet an array of biodiversity and conservation objectives. The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers, The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves. In order to do this, a simplified version of the marine reserve design optimization problem is considered. A Metropolis-Hastings random search procedure is introduced to systematically sample the model solution space and converge on an optimal reserve design. Incorporation of the uncertain input data builds on this process and relies on a parametric bootstrapping procedure. This allows for the solution (i.e, the marine reserve design) to be expressed as the probability of any planning unit being included in the marine reserve network. Spatial plots of this acceptance probability are easily interpretable for decision making under uncertainty. The bootstrapping methodology is also readily adapted to existing comprehensive reserve design algorithms. Here, a preliminary application of the algorithm is made to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (in the Caribbean Sea) based on satellite-derived and mapped conservation features (from Landsat).

Anatomy of a red tide bloom off the southwest coast of Florida	HARMFUL ALGAE												A massive outbreak of Karenia brevis that had been ongoing for several months along the southwestern coast of Florida was sampled in early September 2005 off Sanibel Island to assess the utility of bio-optical features and ataxonomic analysis (quantification of eukaryotic and cyanobacterial picoplankton) by flow cytometry in monitoring red tide blooms. Sea-surface sampling followed aircraft visual location of discolored water. Within the most concentrated area of the bloom, chlorophyll a values exceeded 500 mu g l(-1), and concentrations of nitrate (0.3 mu M +/- 0.0) and ammonium (<0.2 mu M) were depleted compared to high concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus (141 +/- 34 mu M, 16.5 +/- 2.5 mu M, and 6.44 +/- 0.57 mu M, respectively). Low water clarity in the bloom (Secchi depth transparency 0.3 m, K-d estimated at 4.83 m(-1)) was strongly influenced by attenuation from dinoflagellates as well as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The fact that the K. brevis bloom occurred in lower-salinity (30 psu), high-nutrient waters implicates riverine transport of land-based nutrients as a source of nutrient supplies that fueled or sustained the bloom. Throughout ongoing efforts to advance modeling and technological capabilities that presently lack reliable predictive capability, bio-optical remote sensing via aerial flyovers along with in-water sensor data can continue to provide accurate coverage of relatively large temporal and spatial features. Flow cytometry can provide conservative (because of some cell lysis), rapid, near-real-time validation of bloom components. The concentration and position of the organisms, along with water mass scalars, can also help to diagnose factors promoting K. brevis bloom development and dispersion. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on marine species habitat mapping, presenting an overview of work on modelling fish habitat carried out through a European Communities Policy-Support Action, EnviEFH 'Environmental Approach to Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) Designation' (2005-2008). The selection of the appropriate habitat model is dataset-specific and the resulting EFH maps are often similar in spite of using different models.

Therefore, a prediction model of fin whale's (Balaenoptera physalus) summer distribution was developed from data collected between May and August, in the Pelagos Mediterranean Marine Mammals Sanctuary. Explanatory variables were selected by multiple logistic regression, among several physiographic and oceanographic parameters. Depth, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentration, and sea surface temperature (SST) were selected for characterizing fin whale presence. Remote sensing imagery (Chl a and SST) was used at an 8-d resolution to capture short-term environmental variability. With the selection of a presence/absence threshold by the receiver operating characteristic curve, a correct classification of 70% (49% for presence, 85% for absence) was achieved for the initial dataset. Model reliability was also tested on an independent dataset, collected in the northwestern Basin; a correct classification of 71% (41% for presence prediction, 86% for absence prediction) was obtained. This study contributes to an understanding of where fin whales might concentrate to feed in summer. Weekly predictions of their distribution represent a valuable conservation tool in a marine protected area, for example to prevent collisions with ships.

However, the above-water radiometric measurements include surface reflection (L-r) as a significant component along with volume reflection. The L-r carries no information on water quality, and hence it is considered as a major source of error in in situ above-water spectroscopy. Currently, there are no methods to directly measure L-r The common method to estimate L-r assumes a constant water surface reflectance (rho(s)) of 2%, and then subtracts the L-r thus Calculated from the above-water radiance measurements to obtain the volume reflection (L-v). The problem with this method is that the amount of rho(s) varies with environmental conditions. Therefore, a methodology was developed in this study for direct measurement of water volume reflectance above water at nadir view geometry. Other objectives of this study were to analyze the contribution of L-v to the total water reflectance under various environmental conditions in a controlled setup and to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model to estimate rho(s) from environmental conditions. The results showed that L, contributed 20-54% of total upwelling radiance from water at nadir. The p. was highly variable with environmental conditions. Using sun altitude, wind speed, diffuse lighting, and wavelength as inputs, the ANN model was able to accurately simulate rho(s), with a low root mean square error of 0.003. A sensitivity analysis with the ANN model indicated that sun altitude and diffuse light had the highest influence on rho(s), contributing to over 82% of predictability of the ANN model. Therefore, the ANN modeling framework can be an accurate tool for estimating surface reflectance in applications that require volume reflectance of water.																	0003-7028					SEP	2008	62	9					1013	1021		10.1366/000370208785793191								WOS:000259482200014	18801241

Inter-annual sea-ice dynamics and micro-algal biomass in winter pack ice of Marguerite Bay, Antarctica	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												The geographic remoteness, the lack of remote sensing capabilities, and the lack of appropriate environmental sensors make the detection of seasonal trends or inter-annual variations in sea-ice microbial biomass or production processes within the pack ice of the Antarctic extremely rare. The evaluation of their inter-annual variability in the context of ice dynamics and trends in regional climate has not been possible. During the late winters of 2001 (July-August) and 2002 (August-September) we assessed sea-ice dynamics, sea-ice characteristics, and biomass of sea-ice microbiota along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. These two winters were marked by large contrasts in the dates of initial ice formation (late June in 2001 and April in 2002), which resulted in differences in the physical pack-ice characteristics. Chlorophyll a (chl a) content in ice cores differed between the study years, with 2002 having 10-fold higher chl a content. The difference in ice-core chl a content is best explained by the timing of ice formation that leads to less phytoplankton scavenging from the water column and a lack of transfer of solar energy into the pack-ice ecosystem. Such a tractable atmosphere ocean-ice-biota coupling may help in evaluating underlying processes responsible for long-term trends in recruitment cycles of upper trophic levels as well as future projections on the response of the Antarctic marine ecosystems to variability in local climate.

We believe the science of acoustic seabed classification (ASC) is at its nascence. A comprehensive review of ASC science was undertaken by an international group of scientists under the auspices of ICES. The review was prompted by the growing need to classify and map marine ecosystems across a range of spatial scales in support of ecosystem-based science for ocean management. A review of the theory of sound-scattering from seabeds emphasizes the variety of theoretical models currently in use and the ongoing evolution of our understanding. Acoustic-signal conditioning and data quality assurance before classification using objective, repeatable procedures are important technical considerations where standardization of methods is only just beginning. The issue of temporal and spatial scales is reviewed, with emphasis on matching observational scales to those of the natural world. It is emphasized throughout that the seabed is not static but changes over multiple time-scales as a consequence of natural physical and biological processes. A summary of existing commercial ASC systems provides an introduction to existing capabilities. Veri. cation (ground-truthing) methods are reviewed, emphasizing the difficulties of matching observational scales with acoustic-backscatter data. Survey designs for ASC explore methods that extend beyond traditional oceanographic and fisheries survey techniques. Finally, future directions for acoustic seabed classification science were identified in the key areas requiring immediate attention by the international scientific community.

Often a simple 'rough versus smooth' or 'structure versus no structure' characterisation is made. By applying surface analysis theory. developed by terrestrial ecologists. features within a seabed digital terrain model (DTM) can be identified and levels Of uncertainty placed on the classification of individual features. Classification models developed using these techniques have specific advantages over traditional techniques of generating habitat maps in they are non-subjective, scale-independent, are quantifiable and are repeatable. Using habitat classification models, generated at biologically relevant scales, we present examples between movement and habitat utilisation of the southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and prominent features in rocky reef habitats. Incorporating habitat complexity models with fine-scale movement, at an appropriate spatial scale, has specific applications in future marine protected area design and represents the next step in managing the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery with an estimated wealth in excess of AU$ 70 MPa.

The technology, known as the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System, provides remarkably clear, georeferenced imagery that allows visual interpretation of benthic class (substrates, organisms) for mapping coral reef habitats, as intended, Unforeseen, however, are functions new to the initial technologic purpose: interpretable evidence for real-time biogeologic processes and for perception of scaled-up skeletal self-similarity of scleractinian microstructure. Florida reef sea trials lacked the grid structure required to map contiguous habitat and submarine topography. Thus, only general observations could be made relative to times and sites of imagery. Degradation of corals was nearly universal; absence of reef fish was profound. However, similar to 1% of more than 23,600 sea-trial images examined provided visual evidence for local environs and processes. Clarity in many images was so exceptional that small tracks left by organisms traversing fine-grained carbonate sand were visible. Other images revealed a compelling sense, not Yet fully understood, of the microscopic wall structure characteristic of scleractinian Corals. Conclusions drawn from classifiable images are that demersal marine animals, where imaged, are oblivious to the equipment and that the technology has strong capabilities beyond mapping habitat. Imagery acquired along predetermined transects that cross a variety of geomorphic features within depth limits will (1) facilitate construction of accurate contour maps of habitat and bathymetry without need for ground-truthing, (2) contain a strong geologic component of interpreted real-time processes as they relate to imaged topography and regional geomorphology, and (3) allow cost-effective monitoring of regional- an local-scale changes in an ecosystem by use of existing-image global-positioning system coordinates to re-image areas. Details revealed in the modern setting have taphonomic implications for what is often found in the geologic record.																	0749-0208					SEP	2008	24	5					1320	1338		10.2112/08-1049.1								WOS:000259385500021

Optical closure in lakes with contrasting extremes of reflectance	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured inherent and apparent optical properties and computed 'optical closure' in four lakes on the South Island of New Zealand, ranging very widely in reflectance. Optical properties were measured by modern instruments deployed from boats, with supporting laboratory measurements on water samples. The radiative transfer model, Hydrolight, was used with measured inherent optical properties to predict characteristics of the light field for comparison with field measurements. Two glacier-fed lakes were strongly light-scattering and weakly light-absorbing, with optical properties dominated by glacial flour. In marked contrast, two humic-stained wetland lakes were strongly light-absorbing and weakly light-scattering, with optical properties dominated by colored dissolved organic matter. Very good optical 'closure' (i.e., agreement of modeled with measured characteristics of the light field) was obtained for all apparent optical properties examined in all but the most strongly light-scattering lake. Closure was achieved when systematic spectral bias in absorption in this lake, possibly caused by multiple scattering in the field absorption meter, was corrected using laboratory absorption measurements. The highest and lowest measured and modeled water-leaving radiances exceeded the previous range for such studies by a factor of 5. The good optical closure observed over a very wide (200-fold) range of reflectance increases confidence in our ability to specify inputs for radiative transfer modeling while highlighting the enduring challenge of accurately measuring absorption in highly scattering waters and backscattering in highly absorbing waters.

Previous studies based on theoretical calculations and field measurements have demonstrated the importance of the use of the polarized light field in the retrieval of the suspended marine particles properties. However, because of the weakness of the water leaving polarized signal and of the limited number of appropriate spatial sensors, such measurements have never been exploited from space. Here we show that the marine polarized remote sensing reflectance, as detected from the POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) sensor, can be measured from space over bright waters and in absence of aerosols. This feasibility study is carried out over two oceanic areas characterized by different nature of the bulk particulate assemblage: the Barents sea during an intense coccolithophore bloom, and the Rio de la Plata estuary waters dominated by suspended sediments. The retrieved absolute values of the degree of polarization, P, its angular pattern, and its behavior with the scattering level are consistent with theory and field measurements. Radiative transfer simulations confirm the sensitivity of the POLDER-2 P values to the nature of the particulate assemblage. These preliminary results are very promising for the assessment of the bulk particle composition from remote sensing of the polarized signal, at least over highly scattering waters.

In the context of climate change, a major application of the results has been in the modelling of primary production and the ocean carbon cycle. It is now recognised that a partition of the marine autotrophic pool into a suite of phytoplankton functional types, each type having a characteristic role in the biogeochemical cycle of the ocean, would increase our understanding of the role of phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle. At the same time, new methods have been emerging that use visible spectral radiometry to map some of the phytoplankton functional types.

Quantification of two decades of shallow-water coral reef habitat decline in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary using Landsat data (1984-2002)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The loss of coral reef habitats has been witnessed at a global scale including in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. In addition to field surveys that can be spatially limited, remote sensing can provide a synoptic view of the changes occurring on coral reef habitats. Here, we utilize an 18-year time series of Landsat 5/TM and 7/ETM+ images to assess changes in eight coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, namely Carysfort Reef, Grecian Rocks, Molasses Reef, Conch Reef, Sombrero Reef, Looe Key Reef, Western Sambo and Sand Key Reef. Twenty-eight Landsat images (1984-2002) were used, with imagery gathered every 2 years during spring, and every 6 years during fall. The image dataset was georectified, calibrated to remote sensing reflectance and corrected for atmospheric and water-column effects. A Mahalanobis distance classification was trained for four habitat classes ('coral', 'sand', 'bare hardbottom' and 'covered hardbottom') using in situ ground-truthing data collected in 2003-2004 and using the spectral statistics from a 2002 image. The red band was considered useful only for benthic habitats in depths less than 6 m. Overall mean coral habitat loss for all sites classified by Landsat was 61% (3.4%/year), from a percentage habitat cover of 19% (1984) down to 7.6% (2002). The classification results for the eight different sites were critically reviewed. A detailed pixel by pixel examination of the spatial patterns across time suggests that the results range from ecologically plausible to unreliable due to spatial inconsistencies and/or improbable ecological successions. In situ monitoring data acquired by the Coral Reef Evaluation and Monitoring Project (CREMP) for the eight reef sites between 1996 and 2002 showed a loss in coral cover of 52% (8.7%/year), whereas the Landsat-derived coral habitat areas decreased by 37% (6.2%/year). A direct trend comparison between the entire CREMP percent coral cover data set (1996-2004) and the entire Landsat-derived coral habitat areas showed no significant difference between the two time series (ANCOVA; F-test, p = 0.303, n = 32), despite the different scales of measurements.

Modelling habitat preferences for fin whales and striped dolphins in the Pelagos Sanctuary (Western Mediterranean Sea) with physiographic and remote sensing variables	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												One of the needs of the Pelagos Sanctuary for the Conservation of Mediterranean Marine Mammals is information on critical habitats for cetaceans. This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 21 latitude by 21 longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21-24 degrees C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary.

The key element is an objective assignment, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, of the parameters required to implement a primary production model (parameters of the photosynthesis-response function and of the vertical distribution of pigment biomass). In a regional context, the assignment is made by searching the archived data on these parameters according to the (remotely-sensed) chlorophyll concentration and surface temperature. We refer to this approach as the Nearest-Neighbour Method. The procedure is justified on the basis of the known variation of bio-optical properties of phytoplankton with chlorophyll and temperature as well as through consideration of the seasonal variation of watercolumn stratification and its effect on the vertical pigment profile. We illustrate the method, and its justification, using data from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Using data from an oceanographic expedition not included in the archive, we find that the parameters estimated in this way are not significantly different from those obtained by direct measurement. We estimate the error associated with parameter assignment on the calculated phytoplankton production to be about 27%. Some potential limitations of the method are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Regional-scale seagrass habitat mapping in the Wider Caribbean region using Landsat sensors: Applications to conservation and ecology	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seagrass meadows occupy a large proportion of the world's coastal oceans and are some of the most productive systems on Earth. Direct and indirect human-derived impacts have led to significant seagrass declines worldwide and the alteration of services linked to their biodiversity. Effective conservation and the provision of sustainable recovery goals for ecologically significant species are limited by the absence of reliable information on seagrass extent. This is especially true for the Wider Caribbean region (WCR) where many conservation initiatives are under way, but are impaired by the lack Of accurate baseline habitat maps. To assist with such a fundamental conservation need using high-resolution remote sensing data, both environmental and methodological challenges need to be tackled. First, the diversity of environments, the heterogeneity of habitats, and the vast extent of the targeted region mean that local expertise and field data of adequate quality and resolution are seldom available. Second, large-scale high-resolution mapping requires several hundred Landsat 5 and 7 images, which poses substantial processing problems. The main goal of this study was to test the feasibility of achieving Landsat-based large-scale seagrass mapping with limited ground-truth data and acceptable accuracies. We used the following combination of methods to map seagrass throughout the WCR: geomorphological segmentation, contextual editing, and supervised classifications. A total of 40 Landsat scenes (path-row) were processed. Three major classes were derived ('dense seagrass', 'medium-sparse seagrass', and a generic 'other' class). Products' accuracies were assessed against (i) selected in situ data; (ii) patterns detectable with very high-resolution IKONOS images; and (iii) published habitat maps with documented accuracies. Despite variable overall classification accuracies (46-88%), following their critical evaluation, the resulting thematic maps were deemed acceptable to (i) regionally Provide an adequate baseline for further large-scale conservation programs and research actions; and (ii) regionally re-assess carrying capacity estimates for green turtles. They certainly represent a drastic improvement relative to current regional databases. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Coastal residents who use mangroves and their resources may have considerable botanical and ecological knowledgeable about these forests. A wide variety of forest products are harvested in mangroves, especially wood for fuel and construction, tannins and medicines. Although there are exceptions, mangrove forest products are typically harvested in a small-scale and selective manner, with harvesting efforts and impacts concentrated in stands that are closer to settlements and easiest to access (by land or by sea). Mangroves support diverse, local fisheries, and also provide critical nursery habitat and marine productivity which support wider commercial fisheries. These forests also provide valuable ecosystem services that benefit coastal communities, including coastal land stabilization and storm protection. The overlapping of marine and terrestrial resources in mangroves creates tenure ambiguities that complicate management and may induce conflict between competing interests. Mangroves have been cut and cleared extensively to make way for brackish water aquaculture and infrastructure development. More attention is now given to managing remaining forests sustainably and to restoring those degraded from past use. Recent advances in remotely sensed, geo-spatial monitoring provide opportunities for researchers and planners to better understand and improve the management of these unique forested wetlands.

The multiscale/scale-space representation is obtained by solving a nonlinear diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) for vector-valued images. We use algebraic multigrid techniques to obtain a fast and scalable solution of the PDE and to segment the hyperspectral image following the intrinsic multigrid structure. We test our algorithm on four standard hyperspectral images that represent different environments commonly found in remote sensing applications: agricultural, urban, mining, and marine. The experimental results show that the segmented images lead to better classification than using the original data directly, in spite of the use of simple similarity metrics and piecewise constant approximations obtained from the segmentation maps.				anzhi, yue/A-8609-2012	Velez-Reyes, Miguel/0000-0002-6983-7250												0196-2892	1558-0644				AUG	2008	46	8					2418	2434		10.1109/TGRS.2008.916478								WOS:000258494500024

Very-high-resolution mapping of river-immersed topography by remote sensing	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Remote sensing has been used to map river bathymetry for several decades. Non-contact methods are necessary in several cases: inaccessible rivers, large-scale depth mapping, very shallow rivers. The remote sensing techniques used for river bathymetry are reviewed. Frequently, these techniques have been developed for marine environment and have then been transposed to riverine environments. These techniques can be divided into two types: active remote sensing, such as ground penetrating radar and bathymetric lidar; or passive remote sensing, such as through-water photogrammetry and radiometric models. This last technique - which consists of finding a logarithmic relationship between river depth and image values - appears to be the most used. Fewer references exist for the other techniques, but lidar is an emerging technique. For each depth measurement method, we detail the physical principles and then a review of the results obtained in the field. This review shows a lack of data for very shallow rivers, where a very high spatial resolution is needed. Moreover, the cost related to aerial image acquisition is often huge. Hence we propose an application of two techniques, radiometric models and through-water photogrammetry, with very- high-resolution passive optical imagery, light platforms, and off-the-shelf cameras. We show that, in the case of the radiometric models, measurement is possible with a spatial filtering of about I m and a homogeneous river bottom. In contrast, with through-water photogrammetry, fine ground resolution and bottom textures are necessary.

Using satellite data and shipborne data from the East Pacific Investigation of Climate ( EPIC) Stratocumulus Study, this study investigates the cloud re vertical variation for drizzling and nondrizzling clouds. Visible/ near- infrared retrievals from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) are used to estimate the vertical profile of re. MODIS re observations and collocated shipborne scanning C- band precipitation radar data show that re generally increases with height in nondrizzling clouds, consistent with aircraft observations. It is found that in clouds with precipitation rates greater than a few hundredths of a mm h 1 the vertical gradient of re is significantly less than that in nondrizzling clouds and can become negative when the drizzle is heavier than approximately 0.1 mm h 1. High values of re at drizzling cloud base are consistent with estimates of the ratio of liquid water in the drizzle drops to that in the cloud droplets. C- band derived cloud base precipitation rates are found to be better correlated with re at cloud base than with re at cloud top, suggesting that passive remote sensing may be useful for drizzle detection.

Development of chlorophyll-a algorithm for Ocean Colour Monitor onboard OCEANSAT-2 satellite	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS												An empirical chlorophyll algorithm has been developed using the coincident in-situ chlorophyll-a and remote sensing reflectance R(rs) measurements from global ocean waters. The basic data set used for developing the algorithm was obtained by merging the bio-optical data from the global NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data (NOMAD) (similar to 2438 spectra from similar to 3000 stations) and from the waters of the northern Arabian Sea (similar to 159 spectra) collected by the Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, India. The chlorophyll-a concentration ranged from 0.01 to 50.0 mg . m(-3) for the data set used. Regression analysis between chlorophyll-a concentration and remote sensing reflectance in different bands and a combination of band ratios was performed. Algorithms using modified cubic polynomial (MCP) regression of R(rs) ratios with chlorophyll-a concentration showed good estimates of chlorophyll-a in full range of 0.01 to 50.0 mg . m(-3) of the merged data set. However, the best results were obtained by using MCP regression between maximum band ratio (MBR) of R(rs) (443, 490, 510 nm)/R(rs) 555 nm with chlorophyll-a concentration having an r(2) of 0.96 and rms error of 0.12 for log-transformed data. The developed MBR-based algorithm named Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM)-2 chlorophyll algorithm was compared with the OC4v4 algorithm routinely used the for Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data processing. For the used data set, OC4v4 algorithm overestimated chlorophyll-a concentration for > 5.0 mg. m(-3) and yielded an r(2) of 0.90 with rms error of 0.23, when compared to the newly developed OCM-2 chlorophyll algorithm. It is proposed to use this OCM-2 chlorophyll algorithm with OCEANSAT-2 OCM data to be launched in the third quarter of the year 2008 by the Indian Space Research Organisation.																	1545-598X					JUL	2008	5	3					527	531		10.1109/LGRS.2008.923213								WOS:000258144600046						
J	Chang, MH; Lien, RC; Yang, YJ; Tang, TY; Wang, J				Chang, Ming-Huei; Lien, Ren-Chieh; Yang, Yiing Jang; Tang, Tswen Yung; Wang, Joe			A composite view of surface signatures and interior properties of nonlinear internal waves: Observations and applications	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Surface signatures and interior properties of large-amplitude nonlinear internal waves (NLIWs) in the South China Sea (SCS) were measured during a period of weak northeast wind (similar to 2 m s(-1)) using shipboard marine radar, an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiler, and an echo sounder. In the northern SCS, large-amplitude NLIWs propagating principally westward appear at the tidal periodicity, and their magnitudes are modulated at the spring-neap tidal cycle. The surface scattering strength measured by the marine radar is positively correlated with the local wind speed when NLIWs are absent. When NLIWs approach, the surface scattering strength within the convergence zone is enhanced. The sea surface scattering induced by NLIWs is equivalent to that of a similar to 6 m s(-1) surface wind speed (i.e., 3 times greater than the actual surface wind speed). The horizontal spatial structure of the enhanced sea surface scattering strength predicts the horizontal spatial structure of the NLIW. The observed average half-amplitude full width of NLIWs lambda(eta/2) is 1.09 +/- 0.2 km; the average half-amplitude full width of the enhanced scattering strength lambda(I/2) is similar to 0.57 lambda(eta/2). The average half-amplitude full width of the enhanced horizontal velocity convergence of NLIWs lambda(partial derivative xu/2) is approximately equal to lambda(I/2). The peak of the enhanced surface scattering leads the center of NLIWs by similar to 0.46 lambda(eta/2). NLIW horizontal velocity convergence is positively correlated with the enhancement of the surface scattering strength. NLIW amplitude is positively correlated with the spatial integration of the enhancement of the surface scattering strength within the convergence zone of NLIWs. Empirical formulas are obtained for estimating the horizontal velocity convergence and the amplitude of NLIWs using radar measurements of surface scattering strength. The enhancement of the scattering strength exhibits strong asymmetry; the scattering strength observed from behind the propagating NLIW is 24% less than that observed ahead, presumably caused by the skewness and the breaking of surface waves induced by NLIWs. Above the center of NLIWs, the surface scattering strength is enhanced slightly, associated with isotropic surface waves presumably induced or modified by NLIWs. This analysis concludes that in low-wind conditions remote sensing measurements may provide useful predictions of horizontal velocity convergences, amplitudes, and spatial structures of NLIWs. Further applications and modification of the presented empirical formulas in different conditions of wind speed, surface waves, and NLIWs or with other remote sensing methods are encouraged.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Influence of circulation parameters on the AOD variations over the Bay of Bengal during ICARB	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												(Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) level-3 aerosol data, NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis winds and QuikSCAT ocean surface winds were made use of to examine the role of atmospheric circulation in governing aerosol variations over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) during the first phase of the ICARB (Integrated Campaign for Aerosols, gases and Radiation Budget) campaign (March 18-April 12, 2006). An inter-comparison between MODIS level-3 aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and ship-borne MICROTOPS measurements showed good agreement with correlation 0.92 (p 0.0001) and a mean MODIS underestimation by 0.01. During the study period, the AOD over BoB showed high values in the northern/north western regions, which reduced towards the central and southern BoB. The wind patterns in lower atmospheric layers (> 850 hPa) indicated that direct transport of aerosols from central India was inhibited by the presence of a high pressure and a divergence over BoB in the lower altitudes. On the other hand, in the upper atmospheric levels, winds from central and northern India stretched south eastwards and converged over BoB with a negative vorticity indicative of a downdraft. These wind patterns pointed to the possibility of aerosol transport from central India to BoB by upper level winds. This mechanism was further confirmed by the significant correlations that AOD variations over BoB showed with aerosol flux convergence and flux vorticity at upper atmospheric levels (600-500 hPa). AOD in central and southern BoB away from continental influences displayed an exponential dependence on the QuikSCAT measured ocean surface wind speed. This study shows that particles transported from central and northern India by upper atmospheric circulations as well as the marine aerosols generated by ocean surface winds contributed to the AOD over the BoB during the first phase of ICARB.																	0253-4126					JUL	2008	117				1		353	360										WOS:000258534800012

Investigation of droplet size distributions and drizzle formation using a new trajectory ensemble model. Part I: Model description and first results in a nonmixing limit	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A novel trajectory ensemble model of a stratocumulus cloud is described. In this model, the boundary layer (BL) is fully covered by a great number of Lagrangian air parcels that during their motion can contain either wet aerosols or aerosols and droplets. The diffusion growth of aerosols and droplets, as well as drop collisions, is accurately described in each parcel. Droplet sedimentation is taken into account, which allows simulation of precipitation formation. The Lagrangian parcels are advected by the velocity field generated by the turbulent-like flow model obeying turbulent correlation laws. The output of the numerical model includes droplet and aerosol size distributions and their moments, such as droplet concentration, droplet spectrum width, cloud water content, drizzle content, radar reflectivity, etc., calculated in each parcel. Horizontally averaged values are calculated as well. Stratocumulus clouds observed during two research flights (RF01 and RF07) in the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS II) field campaign are simulated. A good agreement between the dynamical and microphysical structures simulated by the model with observations is obtained even in the nonmixing limit. A crucial role of sedimentation for the creation of a realistic cloud microphysical structure is demonstrated. In sensitivity studies, the statistical stability of the model is analyzed. Applications of the model for the investigation of droplet size distribution and drizzle formation are discussed, as is the possible utilization of the model for remote sensing applications.

Evaluation and application of satellite primary production models in Massachusetts Bay	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A variant of the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) was used to expand the spatial and temporal resolution of production estimates and better characterize the phytoplankton variability in Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. Satellite modeled production was used to supplement in situ C-14 primary production measurements, which were spatially limited to two shipboard stations in the northern portion of Massachusetts Bay that were sampled up to 17 times per year. Modifications to the model included a regional parameterization of the euphotic depth (Z(eu).) and an analysis of the maximum chlorophyll specific carbon fixation rate (P-opt(b)), which failed to reveal a correlation between P-opt(b) and temperature as suggested by previous studies. This primary production model successfully captured the seasonal and interannual variations of in situ production that were measured using the C-14 uptake method and significantly enhanced the spatial and temporal resolution of primary production measurements in Massachusetts Bay. The use of satellite data better characterized event, seasonal and interannual variability of ecosystem primary production and revealed a three-fold decrease in production from the nearshore to offshore regions. Daily production ranged from less than 0.25g C m(-2)d(-1) in the offshore regions in January to greater than 2g C m(-2)d(-1) at various times throughout the year in Cape Cod Bay and along the coastline during the summer months. The mean annual production of Massachusetts Bay for the 8-year study period was 220 g C m(-2). The lowest production was estimated in 2004 (174 g cm(-2))and the greatest in 2000(300 g C m(-2)). Comparatively, mean production in Cape Cod Bay was 289 g cm(-2) and ranged from 231 in 1998 to 358 g C m(-2) in 2000. Unlike a number of other temperate continental shelf areas where the maximum production occurs during the summer months corresponding to the greatest PAR and temperature, the highest production and largest fraction of the annual production in Massachusetts Bay accompanied the high phytoplankton biomass during the spring (April-May) and fall blooms (September-October).

Global-scale predictions of community and ecosystem properties from simple ecological theory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												We show how theoretical developments in macroecology, life-history theory and food-web ecology can be combined to formulate a simple model for predicting the potential biomass, production, size and trophic structure of consumer communities. The strength of our approach is that it uses remote sensing data to predict properties of consumer communities in environments that are challenging and expensive to sample directly. An application of the model to the marine environment on a global scale, using primary production and temperature estimates from satellite remote sensing as inputs, suggests that the global biomass of marine animals more than 10(-5) g wet weight is 2.62 x 10(9) t (=8.16 g m(-2) ocean) and production is 1.00 x 10(10) t yr(-1) (31.15 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Based on the life-history theory, we propose and apply an approximation for distinguishing the relative contributions of different animal groups. Fish biomass and production, for example, are estimated as 8.99 x 10(8) t (2.80 g m(-2)) and 7.91 x 10(8) t yr(-1) (2.46 g m(-2) yr(-1)), respectively, and 50% of fish biomass is shown to occur in 17% of the total ocean area (8.22 g m(-2)). The analyses show that emerging ecological theory can be synthesized to set baselines for assessing human and climate impacts on global scales.

J	Andrefouet, S				Andrefouet, S.			Coral reef habitat mapping using remote sensing: A user vs producer perspective. Implications for research, management and capacity building	JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE												Remote sensing is a tool that shows its real power and value for large-scale work. However, published coral reef applications often still focus on spatially limited pilot sites which are investigated for research purposes, while synoptic, reliable and thematically rich habitat maps are in growing demand everywhere around the Planet for a variety of applications. The observed failure in widespread generalization is primarily due to differences in the criteria that scientists (producers) and managers (users) have to obey in their respective professional activities. To enhance the situation and promote mass production of habitat maps, especially in a capacity building context, the traditional producer's habitat mapping flow chart is challenged and compared with a user's flow chart that has been repeatedly applied to high resolution images for a variety of recent management projects. The user's flow chart is a drastic simplification of the producer's chart. It conforms to different principles, in the search for representativity and specificity and thus exhaustivity. The habitat maps done respecting these principles provide a spectacular increase in the ratio habitat complexity/accuracy that was previously the norm. However, in addition to basic knowledge on a limited set of . image processing techniques, the user's chart implies that practitioners in both developed and developing countries also acquire. expertise in recognizing coral reef structures to be able to take advantage of the empirical but efficient a priori contextual editing techniques. The proposed user's flow chart should be promoted by funding agencies for capacity building in order to quickly fill the current gaps in reliable geographical data.																	1449-8596	1836-5655				JUN	2008	53	1					113	129		10.1080/14498596.2008.9635140								WOS:000258303000011

The value of applying commercial fishers' experience to designed surveys for identifying characteristics of essential fish habitat for adult summer flounder	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Identifying the habitat requirements of marine fish is necessary to conserve and manage their populations, but these requirements are poorly understood for many species. One method of screening for important habitat characteristics is to identify differences in habitat features between areas of high and low fish abundance. We tested the association between abundance of adult summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and benthic habitat features at two study areas in the Middle Atlantic Bight in summer 2004. The study included trawl and remote-sensing surveys that were designed and conducted with the assistance of commercial fishers. Within each area, a local commercial fisher designated specific locations a priori as productive or unproductive for fishing. Summer flounder abundance, as measured by mean catch per area swept, was significantly greater at sites designated as productive than at sites designated as unproductive (6.5 times greater in Maryland and 4.7 times greater in Rhode Island). These results indicate that summer flounder were attracted consistently to localized habitats that must have had different characteristics than other nearby locations. Habitat variables associated with the substrate (e.g., particle size, bottom shape, and presence of sessile organisms) were measured along trawl paths using underwater video imagery. The measured variables did not explain abundance well, suggesting that microscale characteristics of the substrate did not affect summer flounder distribution. Summer flounder were most abundant at depths of 10-20 m; however, both high and low catch rates occurred in this depth range, indicating that other factors also were important. These results suggest that additional localized variables merit further investigation to determine their importance to summer flounder. This study demonstrates the importance of combining fishers' knowledge and experience with planned surveys to identify essential habitat features for fish.

On the basis of both remote sensing techniques and detailed field investigations, four fill terraces have been recognized and mapped along the Sauro Valley showing differential cumulative displacements across the fault. These terraces are genetically correlated with four highstand sea level periods. Following stratigraphic and geological age constraints and on the basis of the correlation with a sequence of marine and fluvial terraces characterizing the lower Agri Valley, the Sauro terraces likely formed between 80 (or 100) ka and Present. The inferred long-term slip rate of the Scorciabuoi Fault ranges between 0.5 and 1.0 mm/a. Numerical simulations based on a crustal elastic deformation model also contribute to separate and tentatively quantify the regional uplift rate (similar to 1.0-1.4 mm/a) and to improve the overall reconstruction of the late Quaternary evolution of the area. The synergic but distinct roles played by eustatism, regional uplift, and faulting are eventually appreciated.

Sediments from five cores located in the central part of the Thessaloniki Plain have been studied for their environmental changes using paleontological and sedimentological methods. Chronostratigraphical evidence was obtained from C-14 AMS dating of marine shells, peat and organic sediment samples. During the Holocene marine transgression, this large coastal plain was a shallow marine bay reaching approx. 35 km inland circa the 4th millennium BC, from which the sea subsequently regressed to the east. Around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, strong fluvial deposition of Aliakmon, to the east, and of Axios, to the north, occurred and was responsible of a gradual change to lagoonal and limnic environmental conditions. Around the 5th Century BC, a freshwater lake occupied the westernmost part of the plain. Microfaunal identification, together with magnetic susceptibility measurements, and grain-size analysis reveal three main environments of sediment deposition that reflect combinations of both concentrated and dispersed sources of magnetic/source minerals. Using remote sensing and a combination of spectral bands (LANDSAT TM imagery), we identify former fluvial levees and a freshwater lake, and give a spatial interpretation of the rivers' influences in building this deltaic complex. The mechanisms of edification of the plain as well as the roles played by Aliakmon and Axios sedimentation are described. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An oceanographic context for the foraging ecology of eastern Pacific leatherback turtles: Consequences of ENSO	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												We analyzed some of the primary biological and physical dynamics within the eastern Pacific leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) migration area in relation to ENSO and leatherback nesting ecology at Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PNMB), Costa Rica. We used data from remote sensing to calculate resource availability via a net primary production (NPP) model, and to analyze the physical dynamics of the migration area via sea surface temperature fronts. Within the migration area, NPP north of 15 degrees S was highly governed by interannual variability as indicated by the Multivariate ENSO Index while south of 15 degrees S, production had a more seasonal signal. Nesting peaks of leatherbacks at PNMB were associated with cool, highly productive La Nina events and with large-scale equatorial phytoplankton blooms encompassing 110 degrees W that were induced by iron enrichment following the termination of El Nino events. Resource availability in the northern migration area (eastern equatorial Pacific) appeared to determine the nesting response for the population at PNMB, Costa Rica. We suggest that ENSO significantly influences the nesting ecology of leatherbacks at PNMB because the majority of the population consists of pelagic foragers that strictly rely on the eastern equatorial Pacific for prey consumption prior to the nesting season. Coastal foragers may be a minority in the population because of high mortality rates associated with coastal gillnet fisheries along Central and South America. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Jilantai Salt Lake shorelines in northwestern arid China revealed by remote sensing images	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The existence of a mega-paleolake centered on Jilantai Salt Lake, Inner Mongolia, China, has long been suspected. In the present study, shorelines around Jilantai were identified from astronaut photographs, analyses of Landsat-7 ETM + images, field surveys and differential global positioning system (DGPS) surveys. Here we characterize 1070-1080, 1060, 1050, 1044 and 1035m (a.s.l.) shorelines around Jilantai, which probably correspond to rapid climatic oscillations and tectonic movement and call for further study. Field surveys around Jilantai and in the Hetao Plain located widespread lacustrine deposits and shorelines that provide evidence for a mega-paleolake covering much of the Jilantai and Hetao basins. Based on preliminary Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating, we speculate that a series of paleolakes probably occupied this region from Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) to the Holocene. More detailed investigation is needed for understanding the lake evolution, as well as the environmental impact of Quaternary climatic changes in this region. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rogue waves: Results of the MaxWave project	JOURNAL OF OFFSHORE MECHANICS AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME					25th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2006)	JUN 04-09, 2006	Hamburg, GERMANY	ASME, Ocean, Offshore & Arct Engn Div, ASME, Int Petr Technol Inst				Safety of shipping is an ever growing concern. In a summary, Faulkner investigated the causes of shipping casualties (2002, "Shipping Safety: A Matter of Concern, " Ingenia, The Royal Academy of Engineering, Marine Matters, pp. 13-20) and concluded that the numbers of unexplained accidents are far too high in comparison to other means of transport. From various sources, including insurers data over 30% of the casualties are due to bad weather (a fact that ships should be able to cope with) and a further 25% remain completely unexplained. The European project MaxWave aimed at investigating ship and plaform accidents due to severe weather conditions using different radars and in situ sensors and at suggesting improved design and new safety measures. Heavy sea states and severe weather conditions have caused the loss of more than 200 large cargo vessels within the 20 years between 1981 and 2000 (Table I in Faulkner). In many cases, single "rogue waves" of abnormal height as well as groups of extreme waves have been reported by crew members of such ships. The European Project MaxWave deals with both theoretical aspects of extreme waves and new techniques to observe these waves using different remote sensing techniques. The final goal is to improve the understanding of the physical processes responsible for the generation of extreme waves and to identify geophysical conditions in which such waves are most likely to occur. Two-dimensional sea surface elevation fields are derived from marine radar and space borne synthetic aperture radar data. Individual wave parameters such as maximum to significant wave height ratios and wave steepness, are derived from the sea surface topography. Several ship and offshore platform accidents are analyzed and the impact on ship and offshore design is discussed. Tank experiments are performed to test the impact of designed extreme waves on ships and offshore structures. This article gives an overview of the different work packages on observation of rogue waves, explanations, and consequences for design.																	0892-7219					MAY	2008	130	2							021006	10.1115/1.2918126								WOS:000257586300007

A SAR observation and numerical study on ocean surface imprints of Atmospheric Vortex Streets	SENSORS												The sea surface imprints of Atmospheric Vortex Street (AVS) off Aleutian Volcanic Islands, Alaska were observed in two RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images separated by about 11 hours. In both images, three pairs of distinctive vortices shedding in the lee side of two volcanic mountains can be clearly seen. The length and width of the vortex street are about 60-70 km and 20 km, respectively. Although the AVS's in the two SAR images have similar shapes, the structure of vortices within the AVS is highly asymmetrical. The sea surface wind speed is estimated from the SAR images with wind direction input from Navy NOGAPS model. In this paper we present a complete MM5 model simulation of the observed AVS. The surface wind simulated from the MM5 model is in good agreement with SAR-derived wind. The vortex shedding rate calculated from the model run is about 1 hour and 50 minutes. Other basic characteristics of the AVS including propagation speed of the vortex, Strouhal and Reynolds numbers favorable for AVS generation are also derived. The wind associated with AVS modifies the cloud structure in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. The AVS cloud pattern is also observed on a MODIS visible band image taken between the two RADARSAT SAR images. An ENVISAT advance SAR image taken 4 hours after the second RADARSAT SAR image shows that the AVS has almost vanished.

J	Anderson, CR; Siegel, DA; Brzezinski, MA; Guillocheau, N				Anderson, Clarissa R.; Siegel, David A.; Brzezinski, Mark A.; Guillocheau, Nathalie			Controls on temporal patterns in phytoplankton community structure in the Santa Barbara Channel, California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Characterizing phytoplankton succession in the context of physical and chemical processes is important for understanding the mechanisms driving phytoplankton species composition and succession. An understanding of these processes ultimately influences the ability to predict the contribution of phytoplankton to carbon cycling, the initiation and persistence of harmful algal blooms, and the ability to use satellites for the remote sensing of specific phytoplankton taxa important for biogeochemistry. A statistical analysis of 5 years (1998-2003) of phytoplankton pigment concentrations from the Santa Barbara Channel using empirical orthogonal functions reveals four dominant modes of variability that explain 80% of the variance in the pigment data set. The annual cycle is characterized by a switching from a mixed-phytoplankton assemblage mode to modes dominated by either diatoms, dinoflagellates, or a combination of nano- and pico-phytoplankton. The dominant two modes correspond to a prebloom condition that precedes upwelling conditions, with all identified phytoplankton groups present in low abundance and a diatom-dominated upwelling state that develops following spring upwelling. In 2001, the EOF analysis indicated a transition toward more intense diatom blooms in spring and summer and fewer, large dinoflagellate blooms. This trend was corroborated by analyses of diagnostic pigments and CHEMTAX analysis and may be linked to an increase in local upwelling intensity between 2001 and 2003. Both spring diatom blooms occurring after 2001 were dominated by toxic Pseudo-nitzschia species and led to significant marine mammal deaths in the channel in 2003.

J	Belanger, S; Babin, M; Larouche, P				Belanger, Simon; Babin, Marcel; Larouche, Pierre			An empirical ocean color algorithm for estimating the contribution of chromophoric dissolved organic matter to total light absorption in optically complex waters	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												To estimate the depth-integrated rate of photochemical processes involving chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in coastal waters, the contribution of CDOM to the total absorption coefficient must be known from UV to green. At 307 sites sampled in various coastal marine environments, the ratio between CDOM and the total absorption coefficient ([a(CDOM/)a(t)]) at 412 nm was found to vary over a wide range, from 0.20 to 0.95. An empirical algorithm was developed to retrieve [a(CDOM)/a(t)](412) from satellite remote sensing reflectance. The absolute uncertainty on the [a(CDOM)/a(t)] retrieval was 0.14. As exemplified with the data from the Baltic and North Seas, the algorithm provides a means to distinguish the contribution of CDOM to the absorption coefficient of colored detrital material (i.e., CDM = CDOM + nonalgal particles) at the regional scale. The implications of the variability in the magnitude and spectral shape of [a(CDOM)/a(t)] for the assessment of depth-integrated production of any photoproducts involving CDOM photolysis are discussed in details. We applied the algorithm to a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) image of the Southeastern Beaufort Sea where terrestrial inputs are abundant. The spatial variability in the [a(CDOM)/a(t)] reaches as much as threefold over the continental shelf and beyond. These results clearly show that it is necessary to account for the spatial variability of [a(CDOM)/a(t)] when quantifying CDOM-related photochemical processes in the ocean.

However, the varied optical properties of phytoplankton taxa may present a means to their discrimination via remote sensing data. This paper presents the results of an experimental study in which the spectral dissimilarities of brown, green, blue-green and red algae were examined with a view to establishing a basis upon which broad changes in phytoplankton communities might be monitored through remote sensing. Pseudo phytoplankton communities were simulated in a series of mesocosm experiments from which spectral reflectance measurements were acquired. The results demonstrated that the phytoplankton colour groups examined were indeed spectrally dissimilar. The spectral distinction between colour groups was noted to be greatest at high concentrations of chlorophyll a and between pseudo-communities dominated by a single species; spectral differences were lower in mixed pseudo-communities with co-dominant species. Moreover, it proved possible to quantify the concentration of two potential biomarker pigments, fucoxanthin and C-phycocyanin, through the derivation of simple spectral indices. The coincidental presence of varying concentrations of SPM (SPIM and SPOM) caused significant attenuation of the spectral response of the pseudo-communities and affected the accuracy of biomarker pigment estimation. It is considered that the realisation of a remote sensing technique for the discrimination of phytoplankton taxa in inland waters would be an extremely useful tool for limnological research and water resource management and thus the future application of this research to inland waters is also discussed.

SeaUV and SeaUV(C): Algorithms for the retrieval of UV/Visible diffuse attenuation coefficients from ocean color	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Accurate quantification of photo-induced marine processes requires a realistic description of UV radiation (UVR) penetration in the surface ocean. Remote sensing of ocean color could supply global views of UVR attenuation if reliable algorithms were made available. Although a few models for the retrieval of UV diffuse attenuation coefficients, K-d(lambda), have been proposed in the past, robust and properly validated algorithms are still needed. We have developed and validated two algorithms for the retrieval of K-d(lambda) at lambda = 320, 340, 380, 412, 443, 490 nm from multispectral remote-sensing reflectances, R-rs(lambda) (SeaWiFS wavebands). These algorithms, SeaUV and SeaUV(C), were developed from a large "training dataset" comprising simultaneous in situ measurements of R-rs(lambda) and K-d(lambda) made in a variety of water types ranging from blue oligotrophic to turbid estuarine systems. Four orthogonal dimensions of ocean color defined from the original R-rs(lambda) spectra are used as predictors in multiple linear regressions of K-d(lambda) to develop the algorithms. In the case of SeaUV(C), an optical classification permits the development of water-type specific parameterizations. Validation against an independent synthetic Hydrolight (R) data set and an in sitar data set showed that the algorithms can be used with confidence over the range of water types for which they have been developed. SeaUV and SeaUV(C) will find applicability in the fields of marine photochemistry and photobiology where their performance and inherent simplicity make them suitable for batch implementation on large data sets and at global scales.

J	Xie, XS; Liu, WT; Tang, BY				Xie, Xiaosu; Liu, W. Timothy; Tang, Benyang			Spacebased estimation of moisture transport in marine atmosphere using support vector regression	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An improved algorithm is developed based on support vector regression (SVR) to estimate horizonal water vapor transport integrated through the depth of the atmosphere (Theta) over the global ocean from observations of surface wind-stress vector by QuikSCAT, cloud drift wind vector derived from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and geostationary satellites, and precipitable water from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). The statistical relation is established between the input parameters (the surface wind stress, the 850 mb wind, the precipitable water, time and location) and the target data (Theta calculated from rawinsondes and reanalysis of numerical weather prediction model). The results are validated with independent daily rawinsonde observations, monthly mean reanalysis data, and through regional water balance. This study clearly demonstrates the improvement of Theta derived from satellite data using SVR over previous data sets based on linear regression and neural network. The SVR methodology reduces both mean bias and standard deviation compared with rawinsonde observations. It agrees better with observations from synoptic to seasonal time scales, and compare more favorably with the reanalysis data on seasonal variations. Only the SVR result can achieve the water balance over South America. The rationale of the advantage by SVR method and the impact of adding the upper level wind will also be discussed.

This requires understanding patterns of coral's susceptibility to thermal stress and how coral communities will change with the environmental variables associated with climate change. This study combined surface currents, wind velocity; sea surface temperature (SST), UV radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and chlorophyll-a concentration for the western Indian ocean and known relationships with coral bleaching and mortality to derive predictor variables that correlate with thermal stress. SST variability, W maximum temperature and wind speed had the highest influence on susceptibility estimates. Two susceptibility models were developed using Spatial Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) and cosine amplitude-AHP methods and a fuzzy logic technique for integrating environmental variables into a measure of susceptibility. Susceptibility models identified regional gradients in environmental stress, with the north-western Indian Ocean and some central Indian Ocean islands as high and the southern African coastline and islands east of Madagascar as low vulnerability regions. Half of the strictly no take zones in the region are situated in locations with medium to high susceptibility. Future studies using high-resolution data can better estimate the vulnerability of specific locations and the establishment of marine protected areas where coral reef diversity is more likely to persist through climate change.

Spatial match-mismatch in the Benguela upwelling zone: should we expect chlorophyll and sea-surface temperature to predict marine predator distributions?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Remote-sensing measurements of marine primary productivity are widely used to predict the distribution and movements of marine top predators, despite the fact that predators do not feed directly on phytoplankton but several trophic levels higher up the food chain. 2. To test for potential links between primary productivity and top-predator feeding hotspots, we assessed spatial match-mismatch across four trophic levels of the Benguela upwelling zone (south-east Atlantic). The food chain studied consisted of phytoplankton, zooplankton (copepods), pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines) and two top predators (Cape gannets Morus capensis and human fisheries). 3. Remote-sensing data of sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll_a concentration were used as indices of phytoplankton abundance throughout the study area. Copepod biomass and pelagic fish density were determined during at-sea surveys in the South African section of the Benguela using net tows and hydro-acoustics, respectively. Seabird (Cape gannet) home ranges and foraging zones were assessed from two Namibian breeding colonies (Mercury and Ichaboe) and two South African colonies (Lambert's Bay and Malgas) using global positioning system (GPS) tracking. Industrial fishing for anchovies and sardines was investigated using South African landing statistics and logbooks. 4. Our spatial analyses revealed a strong match of seabird at-sea habitat and zones of high primary productivity throughout the southern Benguela. Conversely, there was a marked spatial mismatch between copepods and pelagic fish, as well as between pelagic fish, seabirds and human fisheries: copepods were present in the southern Benguela but pelagic fish usually feeding upon them were located further east (Indian Ocean), outside of the Benguela sensu stricto. Consequently, the majority of these pelagic fish were out of reach for seabirds and fisheries confined to the southern Benguela. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the impact of an ecosystem shift across one of the world's most productive marine ecosystems and highlights the limitations of using remote-sensed patterns of primary productivity to interpret the foraging behaviour of marine top predators. These findings underline the importance of a better knowledge of food web spatial dynamics to support ecosystem-based fisheries management and the conservation of marine top predators.

Two stations (D1 and D2) were sampled on June 24, and D2 was resampled 6 days later; chlorophyll-a concentration had decreased by about one half. LAC MODIS-Chla images were obtained and showed the spread of the bloom on the day after sampling. The phytoplankton community consisted primarily of dinoflagellate temporary cysts, mainly at the surface and at 5 m in station D1. Two Pseudo-nitzschia species (P. australis, P. seriata) were also very abundant. Samples from the bloom had a specific phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a*(ph)(lambda)) lower than the rest of the samples. Values varied from 0.0186 to 0.0455 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph)(440) and from 0.0092 to 0.0294 m(2) mg(-1) for a*(ph) (675), with ratios a*(ph)(440): a*(ph)(675) ranging from 0.99 to 2.20. These low ratios were associated with the combined effect of packaging, and with the relatively high ratios of fucoxanthin, peridinin, diadinoxanthin and chlorophyll-c2 to TChla. Samples from the surface and 5 m depth at station D1 had higher ratios of Perid:TChla (0.12-0.32) than the rest of the samples, suggesting that cysts have similar Perid:TChla as free-living dinoflagellates. An unusual absorption spectrum with a broad maximum around 480-500 nm was associated with the high proportion of cysts and diatoms. The slope of the spectra between 443 and 488 nm was a good index to differentiate bloom samples containing high proportions of dinoflagellate temporary cysts. Further investigation of the absorption properties of dinoflagellate cysts is needed in order to detect these waters by remote sensing. Although much work is still necessary to understand and explain the bio-optical properties of a bloom, the present study is the first assessment off the Baja California coast to simultaneously consider aspects such as absorption properties, pigment composition and to include a spatial evaluation of the extension of a bloom with satellite images.

Pelagic habitat characterization of loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, in the North Pacific Ocean (1997-2006): Insights from satellite tag tracking and remotely sensed data	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												We analyzed satellite track data for 186 loggerhead sea turtles in the North Pacific Ocean using remotely sensed environmental data to characterize pelagic habitat. A large number of candidate habitat variables were merged to the satellite track data and statistically compared to background values over a large spatiotemporal grid which bounded overall occupancy. Five statistically significant variables were identified out of the 16 environmental variables examined. Two of these variables have strong seasonal, interannual, and spatial patterns (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration), while three others were primarily spatial (earth magnetic force, earth magnetic declination, and earth magnetic inclination). Habitat selectivity for these variables was quantified using preference curve methodology established in the foraging literature. The output from the selectivity curves was used to predict a multivariate loggerhead sea turtle habitat index across the pelagic North Pacific. This predicted habitat was ground-truthed with newly available satellite track data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Its huge freshwater and sediment load impacts the Canadian Beaufort Shelf, transporting large quantities of sediment and associated organic carbon into the Arctic Ocean. The majority of this sediment transport occurs during the freshet peak flow season (May to June). Mackenzie River-Arctic Ocean coupling has been widely studied during open water seasons, but has rarely been investigated in shallow water under landfast ice in Kugmallit Bay with field-based surveys, except for those using remote sensing. We observed and measured sedimentation rates (51 g m(-2) d(-1)) and the concentrations of chlorophyll a (rnean 2.2 mu g L(-1)) and suspended particulate matter (8.5 mg L(-1)) and determined the sediment characteristics during early spring, before the breakup of landfast ice in Kugmallit Bay. We then compared these results with comparable data collected from the same site the previous summer. Comparison of organic quality in seston and trapped material demonstrated substantial seasonal differences. The subtle changes in biological and oceanographic variables beneath landfast ice that we measured using sensors and field sampling techniques suggest the onset of a spring melt occurring hundreds of kilometres farther south in the Mackenzie Basin.

Predictability of reef fish diversity and abundance using remote sensing data in Diego Garcia (Chagos Archipelago)	CORAL REEFS												The diversity, abundance and distribution of reef fish are related to heterogeneity and physical complexity of benthic habitat. However, the field effort required to evaluate these aspects of the benthos in situ, at the scale of entire reefscapes, is greatly constrained by logistical and resource limitations. With moderate ground truthing, both substratum type and seabed topography are amenable to monitoring using satellite data. Here, remote sensing imagery was used to resolve the bathymetry and benthic character of a reef system in Diego Garcia (British Indian Ocean Territory). Replicate fish counts were made at seven measurement stations across the study area using visual census. Monte Carlo simulation revealed that species richness and abundance of several guilds and size groupings of reef fish appraised in situ were correlated with the satellite-derived seabed parameters over areas of seafloor as large as 5,030 m(2). The study suggests that satellite remote sensing is capable of predicting habitat complexity at a scale relevant to fish. Furthermore, as larger size classes of fish were better predicted with the satellite habitat complexity data, this technique could be used to predict fish stocks and identify potential sites for marine protected areas where intensive field surveys are not practical.

Here we present a theory for the threshold reflectivity by relating it to the autoconversion process. This theory not only demonstrates the sharp transition from cloud to rain when the radar reflectivity exceeds some value (threshold reflectivity) but also reveals that the threshold reflectivity is an increasing function of the cloud droplet concentration. The dependence of threshold reflectivity on droplet concentration suggests that the differences in empirically determined threshold reflectivity arise from the differences in droplet concentration. The favorable agreement with measurements collected over a wide range of conditions further provides observational support for the theoretical formulation. The results have many potential applications, especially to remote sensing of cloud properties and studies of the second aerosol indirect effect.

Impact of aerosols from the Asian Continent on the adjoining oceanic environments	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 630 nm wavelength over the oceanic regions adjoining the Asian Continent is examined using a seven-year long data base derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board NOAA satellite to study the mean spatial and temporal variations as well as to understand the impact of aerosols advecting from the continent. Depending on the prevailing meteorological conditions and nature of synoptic circulation, the AOD over the oceanic region shows a systematic annual variation. This annual pattern inturn also shows an inter-annual variability because of the corresponding variations in the meteorological features over the continent as well as small-scale deviations in the nature of synoptic circulation. The annual variation over the oceanic regions also shows a pronounced spatial heterogeneity depending on the influence of continental aerosols. Making use of the wind speed dependence of sea-salt AOD at far-oceanic environments and monthly mean wind speeds at small grids of size 5 degrees x 5 degrees, the annual variation of sea-salt AOD at different locations is studied to understand the spatial heterogeneity of this component. The residual component obtained by subtracting this from the measured AOD is the non-oceanic component due to advection from continent. The source regions for major continental advections are delineated from the analysis of air-mass back trajectories at appropriate locations identified from the annual pattern of non-oceanic component. The long-term effect of the continental impact is examined from the mean trend of AOD over the three major oceanic regions. This study shows that the continental influence is most significant over the Arabian Sea, followed by the Bay of Bengal and is almost insignificant in most of the regions over the Southern Hemispheric Indian Ocean, except for the effect of smoke aerosols over a few locations near Indonesia and Madagascar.																	0253-4126					FEB	2008	117	1					83	102		10.1007/s12040-008-0016-z								WOS:000253545100009

Following the guidelines and general objectives established by GOOS (Global Ocean Observing System) through its coastal ecosystems module COOP (Coastal Ocean Observations Panel), this paper describes the design, first development stages and some derived results of a monitoring network named Red ACOMAR Canarias (Red de Alerta, Control y Observacion MARina de Canarias, or Network for Marine Surveillance, Control and Observation in the Canaries) developed in the Macaronesia region. Established in 1999, Red ACOMAR is based on a core project supported through several programmes focused on the coastal and open-ocean areas around the Canary Islands archipelago. The network integrates a wide range of devices and monitoring systems (moored and drifting buoys, gliders, remote sensing, turtles, land-based meteorological stations and research vessels) working in real-time. The network has a control centre that manages communications and data processing, and provides real-time information with utility for end-users from socio-economically important sectors that make use of the coastal area in the region, Access to the information is provided via a web portal, Red ACOMAR is directly linked with other scientific projects in the Azores and Madeira archipelagos, as well as with projects from other European countries, with a common goal of providing a regional operational oceanographic contribution meeting end-user requirements.

Conventional classification of phytoplankton by size may seem arbitrary, but there appears clear links between size and environmental characteristics (availability of essential nutrients and light) that regulate photosynthesis, phytoplankton selection and succession. Taking a minimalist approach, small phytoplankton (picoplankton) survive in permanently stratified systems with low nutrients, high surface light and low light in deep clines, whereas large phytoplankton (microplankton) thrive in high nutrient, turbulent, high light, near surface systems. Nutrient-light environmental conditions are characteristic properties of globally, latitudinal-dispersed biogeochemical provinces. These contrasting nutrient-light regimes define the extreme ends of the bio-energetic scale of photosynthesis and set the end points of the primary range of phytoplankton functional processes. To determine PFTs from remotely sensed ocean colour data, there must be a specific bio-optical trait (BOT) that can be associated with the phytoplankton species or taxa. We investigate the connection of the bio-energetic scale to phytoplankton types and their BOTs, which is the first, but crucial step for classifying PFTs on the basis of functional processes, from which refinements and further partitioning can be developed.

The study considers the fluvial, coastal, and oceanographic contributions to changes in delta morphology and uses different approaches, including (1) remote sensing techniques; (2) time series analysis of river discharge, sea level, wave climate and tidal variability; (3) analysis of the relationship between monthly mean sea level anomalies near the deltas related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO); (4) development of a database of key physical variables; (5) series of correlation calculations to examine which environmental factors control delta morphology; (6) analysis of shoreline changes for the 1986-2000 yr-period; and (7) classification of each delta system based on the relationship between water and sediment discharges and wave and tidal energies. Overall, Colombian deltas are built under destructive physical conditions. The Pacific deltas, San Juan, Mira, and Patia, are tide-influenced deltas although they exhibit definite characteristics of wave-dominated systems such as the presence of barriers and beach ridges. Also, these deltas exhibit the highest marine energy conditions of all Colombian deltas (marine power values between 9.1 and 11.6) due to the interplay of (1) moderate wave conditions as a result of the effect of swells from the SW with a significant height varying from 1.7 in the San Juan delta to 3.0 m and 3.1 m in the Mira and Patia deltas, respectively; (2) meso-tidal ranges; (3) steep subaqueous profiles; (4) low attenuation indexes of deep-water waves; and (5) strong oceanographic manifestations associated with the ENSO, causing regional sea level rises of 20-44 cm during El Nino events. The Caribbean deltas, Magdalena, Sinu and to a lesser extent, the Atrato, are wave-influenced deltas. The Magdalena, with deep and nearshore wave power values of 45 x 10(6) erg s(-1) and 35 x 10(6) erg s(-1) , respectively, and the lowest attenuation index of deep-water waves, is the most wave-influenced delta of Colombia. Statistical relationships show that the area of Colombian deltas is best predicted from average discharge and bank-full width of river entering the delta. The number of distributary channels is explained by the marine power index and the gradient of the delta plain. The average and total width of distributary channels are largely controlled by the tidal range. Further analysis of shoreline changes indicate that the retreating behavior of the western part of the Magdalena delta has been due to anthropogenic causes, including the construction of jetties in 1936. By contrast, processes of rapid erosion in the San Juan delta have been the result of 2.6 mm yr(-1) long-term relative sea level rise due to tectonic induced subsidence coupled with a eustatic rise of sea level. Overall, the other deltas are experiencing prograding phases with rates of accretion of 100 m yr(-1) in the artificial delta of the Canal del Dique. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A last glacial ice sheet on the Pacific Russian coast and catastrophic change arising from coupled ice-volcanic interaction	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Controversy exists over the extent of glaciation in Eastern Asia at the Last Glacial Maximum: complete ice sheet cover vs. restricted mountain icefields (an area discrepancy equivalent to 3.7 Greenland Ice Sheets). Current arguments favour the latter. However, significant last glacial ice-rafted debris (IRD) exists in NW Pacific ocean cores, which must have been sourced from a major ice sheet somewhere bordering the North Pacific. The origin of this IRD is addressed through a combination of marine core analysis, iceberg trajectory modelling and remote sensing of glacial geomorphology. We find compelling evidence for two stages of glaciation centred on the Kamchatka area of maritime southeast Russia during the last glacial, with ice extent intermediate in size between previous maximum and minimum reconstructions. Furthermore, a significant increase in iceberg flux precedes, and accompanies, a substantial marine core ash deposit at around 40 ka BR We speculate that rapid decay of the first stage of the ice sheet may have triggered substantial volcanic activity.

In recent years, attention has focused on using high spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery to map and monitor wetland plant communities in the NERRs, particularly invasive plant species. The utility of this technology for that purpose has yet to be assessed in detail. To that end, a specific high spatial resolution satellite imagery, QuickBird, was used to map plant communities and monitor invasive plants within the Hudson River NERR (HRNERR). The HRNERR contains four diverse tidal wetlands (Stockport Flats, Tivoli Bays, Iona Island, and Piermont), each with unique water chemistry (i.e., brackish, oligotrophic and fresh) and, consequently, unique assemblages of plant communities, including three invasive plants (Trapa natans, Phragmites australis, and Lythrum salicaria). A maximum-likelihood classification was used to produce 20-class land cover maps for each of the four marshes within the HRNERR. Conventional contingency tables and a fuzzy set analysis served as a basis for an accuracy assessment of these maps. The overall accuracies, as assessed by the contingency tables, were 73.6%, 68.4%, 67.9%, and 64.9% for Tivoli Bays, Stockport Flats, Piermont, and Iona Island, respectively. Fuzzy assessment tables lead to higher estimates of map accuracies of 83%, 75%, 76%, and 76%, respectively. In general, the open water/tidal channel class was the most accurately mapped class and Scirpus sp. was the least accurately mapped. These encouraging accuracies suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery offers significant potential for the mapping of invasive plant species in estuarine environments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This methodology was developed in order to identify the reference landscape and to define areas within that landscape that possess different degrees of potential for restoration purposes in a cultural landscape. We utilized retrospective data to compare former ecosystem arrangements, taking into account ecological, spatial and temporal issues, such as historical information on changes in land use, in addition to diachronically analyzed aerial photos taken between 1954 and 2002, using an object-based approach. The test area is a Nature Reserve in Tuscany (Italy) that preserves the cultural landscape of biancane badlands - erosion forms generated on Plio-Pleistocene marine clay outcrops - which is characterized by a high erosion rate. In the first step, a land cover map was obtained by image segmentation on the 1954 photographs and the patches classified as "target habitats" were used as a selection mask on the 2002 image. As a second step, a more detailed land cover map was created for the areas selected as masks in the previous step. Hence, the target habitats that showed stability (persistence) between the two dates were excluded from the analysis, as well as the land cover classes not suitable for restoration (broad-leaved forests, arable land, artificial and other agricultural areas). The selected sites, covered by four vegetation types in the 2002 land cover map, accounted for approximately 91 ha. The method focuses on selecting sites for restoration in order to reduce efforts and negative impact and to maximize the restoration results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the aim of operational service, several kinds of ocean color remote sensing application systems have been developed and realized the long-term marine environmental monitoring utilizing the real-time or near real-time satellite and airborne remote sensing data. New progresses in the technology and application of ocean color remote sensing in China are described, including the research of key techniques and the development of various application systems.

J	Wang, H; Jin, QH; Gao, S				Wang Hui; Jin Qihua; Gao Shan			A preliminary study on the response of marine primary production to monsoon variations in the South China Sea	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Seasonal, interannual and interdecadal variations of monsoon over the South China Sea (SCS) directly influence the ocean circulation and the mass transport process, etc., especially the changes of horizontal circulation pattern and upwelling area. These changes directly influence the nutrient transport and the photosynthesis of phytoplankton, which induce the change of the marine ecosystem in the SCS, including the change of marine primary production in this sea area. On the basis of climatic data for long-time series and primary production estimated by remote sensing, the multi-time scale variations of monsoon, seasonal and interannual variations of primary production, and the response of primary production to monsoon variations were analyzed. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal variations of primary producdon in different sea areas of the SCS and their relations to the monsoon variations were given. The results showed that the strong southwesterly prevailed over the SCS in summer whereas the vigorous northeasterly in winter. The seasonal primary production in the entire sea area of the SCS also produced a strong peak in winter and a subpeak in summer. And the seasonal primary production distributions displayed different characteristics in every typical sea area. The variations of the annual and summer averaged primary production in the entire sea area of the SCS showed almost the same rising trend as the intensity of the summer monsoon, Especially for 1998, the summer monsoon reached almost the minimum in the past 54 a when the primary production was also found much lower than any other year (1999-2005). The responses of annual primary production to monsoon variation were displayed to different extent in different sea areas of the SCS; especially it was better in the deep sea basin. Such research activities could be very important for revealing the response of marine ecosystem to the monsoon variations in the SCS.																	0253-505X						2008	27	5					21	35										WOS:000262684100002

On the basis of the current technology and features of applications, an open three-layer integration framework is designed. At the data layer, a two-level three-base integration mechanism based on the plug-in technology is applied; At the function layer, an integration mode based on API, DLL, EXE and COM is discussed; and at the application layer, a sharing mechanism based on the clients/service is adopted.

J	Wei, GF; Tang, DL; Wang, SF				Wei, GuiFeng; Tang, DanLing; Wang, Sufen			Distribution of chlorophyll and harmful algal blooms (HABs): A review on space based studies in the coastal environments of Chinese marginal seas	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Monitoring of spatial and temporal distribution of chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentrations in the aquatic milieu is always challenging and often interesting. However, the recent advancements in satellite digital data play a significant role in providing outstanding results for the marine environmental investigations. The present paper is aimed to review 'remote sensing research in Chinese seas' within the period of 24 years from 1978 to 2002. Owing to generalized distributional pattern, the Chl-a concentrations are recognized high towards northern Chinese seas than the southern. Moreover, the coastal waters, estuaries, and upwelling zones always exhibit relatively high Chl-a concentrations compared with offshore waters. On the basis of marine Chl-a estimates obtained from satellite and other field measured environmental parameters, we have further discussed on the applications of satellite remote sensing in the fields of harmful algal blooms (HABs), primary production and physical oceanographic currents of the regional seas. Concerned with studies of HABs, satellite remote sensing proved more advantageous than any other conventional methods for large-scale applications. Probably, it may be the only source of authentic information responsible for the evaluation of new research methodologies to detect HABs. At present, studies using remote sensing methods are mostly confined to observe algal bloom occurrences, hence, it is essential to coordinate the mechanism of marine ecological and oceanographic dynamic processes of HABs using satellite remote sensing data with in situ measurements of marine environmental parameters. The satellite remote sensing on marine environment and HABs is believed to have a great improvement with popular application of technology. (C) 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered pilot sites useful to define innovative tools for the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). Their management however requires acquaintance with the relationships between the protected site and the status of the coastal neighbouring areas in order to assess mutual effects and influences. There is the need of monitoring systems capable of highlighting physical and biological phenomena, and possible oceanographic anomalies at local scale, to assess possible existing differences between MPAs and their neighbouring unprotected zones. The present study proposes an integrated analysis of data sets coming from in situ and remote-sensing data to evaluate the reliability of satellite sensors for coastal zone monitoring and to better understand the short-term environmental dynamics on a coastal area centred on the Portofino MPA (Ligurian Sea).

Wayne			Relationships among water column toxins, cell abundance and chlorophyll concentrations during Karenia brevis blooms	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The assumptions that Karenia brevis cell abundance and brevetoxin concentrations are proportional and that cell abundance and chlorophyll are related were tested in a 3-year field study off the west coast of Florida. The relationship between K. brevis cell abundance and brevetoxins (PbTx-2+PbTx-3) in whole water samples was strong (R-2 = 0.92). There was no significant difference between the brevetoxin concentrations in whole water and the > 0.7 mu m particulate fraction. Only 7% of the total brevetoxin concentration was measured in the < 0.7 mu m (cell free) filtrate. The relationship of K. brevis cell abundance > 5000 cells L-1 with chlorophyll for all cruises and at all depths was robust (R-2 = 0.78). These data substantiate the use of chlorophyll as a proxy for K. brevis cell abundance and K. brevis cell abundance as a proxy for brevetoxins during blooms. The ratios of the brevetoxins, PbTx-2:PbTx-3, was significantly higher in surface water than in bottom water. This information in conjunction with K. brevis growth rates may provide a useful indicator for determining the physiological state of the bloom over time. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It mainly affects the coastal zone adjacent to areas of dense population. To detect the sources of pollution along this zone as well as to identify their characteristics, remote sensing data was used. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images, which have high spatial resolution, were analyzed using different types of software for discriminating polluted water in the marine environment. Different optical and digital advantages in these programs were applied to reveal anomalous features on satellite images. Subsequently, the identified features of pollution were verified in the field with bacterial analysis conducted at selected sites. Results showed 82 major, permanent sources of pollution (termed hotspots) along the Lebanese coast. More than 73% of these sources are attributed to discharges from wastewater, chemicals, and oil residues.																	1527-5922						2008	9	2-3					205	214		10.1080/15275920802122296								WOS:000257013900012

The dataset covers in situ measurements carried out in Izmir Bay for the period of 1996-1998 and corresponding cloud free AVHRR (NOAA-14) images. Stumpf's (1992) algorithm is used to remove atmospheric effects from the images and retrieve the water leaving reflectances. Insitu optical water quality data and reflectance imagery on 18 different days were used to derive a local empirical equation relating at satellite reflectance at 630 nm (R(d)) to chl-a, suspended sediments and diffuse attenuation coefficient which is derived as a function of secchi depth. The study showed that the atmospherically corrected red band of AVHRR provides significant information on chl-a amounts for concentrations greater than 4 mg.m(-3). The empirical models with high correlation coefficients for sea surface reflectance derived from AVHRR and diffuse attenuation coefficient are also established for this study.																	1018-4619						2008	17	12B					2152	2158										WOS:000264011400002

Multispectral and hyperspectral analysis and modelling of the absorbance characteristics of marine algal pigments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The techniques of remote sensing in spectral bands and hyperspectral remote sensing were modelled with laboratory experiments on marine algal pigments obtained from four species of green micro-algae of the eastern coast of India. The spectral absorbance was measured within the visible range of wavelength for chlorophyll mixtures of different concentrations and also for chromatographically separated pigments. The intention was to simulate and compare the expected nature of results obtained with remote sensing in wavebands and hyperspectral sensing involving a fine resolution in wavelength. Therefore, the absorbance was measured both with filters of three different visible spectral bands, viz. blue, green, and red, and with a continuous scan of wavelength. The algal species were distinguishable with both types of measurements. However, the hyperspectral technique was found to be more suitable in revealing the individual contribution of pigments. Based on the experimental results, a computational model was developed with Gaussian variation of absorbance as a function of wavelength. The experimental results were simulated with that model explaining the comparative spectroscopic results obtained from band and hyperspectral sensing.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2008	29	3					787	799		10.1080/01431160701311275								WOS:000252346800010

Phytoplankton size-structure on the western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula: a remote-sensing approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Remote-sensing models based on total (b(b)) and particle (b(bp)) backscattering are proposed for estimating phytoplankton size-structure characteristics over the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) waters. It is hypothesized that phytoplankton assemblages with larger cells will have lower spectral b(b) and b(bp) slopes (gamma). Likewise, a higher concentrations of total chlorophyll a (chl(T)) will coincide with larger phytoplankton cells. Values of gamma(bbp), derived from satellite and in situ remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) measurements were matched up with field determinations of chlorophyll a concentration fractions (chl((>20 mu m)) and chl((0.45-20 mu m))) collected between 1997 and 2006 as part of the Palmer-LTER project. Functionalities between in situ measurements of gamma(bb) and chlorophyll a fractions were also investigated. A consistent inverse relationship between chl((>20 mu m))/chlT and gamma (b(b) and b(bp)) values was found and verified with two approaches: spatial matchup of satellite monthly composites and time-space matchup of photosynthetic pigment markers. Based on satellite data, a gamma(bbp) value of 1.668 was a fair predictor to differentiate WAP waters dominated by 'large' (chl((>20 mu m))/chl(T)>= 0.5, gamma(bbp)<= 1.668) vs 'small' (chl((>20 mu m))/chl(T)<0.5, gamma(bbp)>1.668) phytoplankton cells. A significant negative linear relationship between 19'-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, fucoxanthin, and gamma(bbp) values suggest that Phaeocystis aggregates and large diatoms (>20 mu m) would explain most of the chl((>20 mu m))/chl(T)-gamma variability. No relationships were evident between chl(T) values and gamma values. Although our results cannot be generalized to other oceanic regions, this work is the first to provide evidence about the significant influence of phytoplankton size distributions on spectral backscattering of WAP waters. Furthermore, and based on chlorophyll a fraction analysis, it was the >20 mu m phytoplankton cells that were responsible for such gamma variations seen on satellite and in situ values.																	0143-1161						2008	29	3					801	829		10.1080/01431160701297615								WOS:000252346800011

The role of digital bathymetry in mapping shallow marine vegetation from hyperspectral image data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Hyperspectral remote sensing is a proven technology for measurement of coastal ocean colour, including sea-bed mapping in optically shallow waters. Using hyperspectral imagery of shallow (<15m deep) sea bed acquired with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-550), we examined how changes in the spatial resolution of bathymetric grids, created from sonar data (echosounding) and input to conventional image classifiers, affected the accuracy of distributional maps of invasive (Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides) and native (kelp) seaweeds off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. The addition of a low-resolution bathymetric grid, interpolated from soundings by the Canadian Hydrographic Service, improved the overall classification accuracies by up to similar to 10%. However, increasing the bathymetric resolution did not increase the accuracy of classification maps produced with the supervised (Maximum Likelihood) classifier as shown by a slightly lower accuracy (2%) when using an intermediate-resolution bathymetric grid interpolated from soundings with a recreational fish finder. Supervised classifications using the first three eigenvectors from a principal-components analysis were consistently more accurate (by at least 27%) than unsupervised (K-means classifier) schemes with similar data compression. With an overall accuracy of 76%, the most reliable scheme was a supervised classification with low-resolution bathymetry. However, the supervised approach was particularly sensitive, and variations in accuracy of 2% resulted in overestimations of up to 53% in the extent of C. fragile and kelp. The use of a passive optical bathymetric algorithm to derive a high-resolution bathymetric grid from the CASI data showed promise, although fundamental differences between this grid and those created with the sonar data limited the conclusions. The bathymetry (at any spatial resolution) appeared to improve the accuracy of the classifications both by reducing the confusion among the spectral classes and by removing noise in the image data. Variations in the accuracy of depth estimates and inescapable positional inaccuracies in the imagery and ground data largely accounted for the observed differences in the classification accuracies. This study provides the first detailed demonstration of the advantages and limitations of integrating digital bathymetry with hyperspectral data for the mapping of benthic assemblages in optically shallow waters.

Column aerosol characterization in a semi-arid region around Marrakech during the WATERMED 2003 campaign	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING					2nd International Symposium on Recent Advances in Quantitative Remote Sensing	SEP 25-29, 2006	Torrent, SPAIN	Univ Valencia, Global Change Unit, City Council Torrent, European Space Agcy, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm, European Commiss, Spanish Minist Educ & Sci, Univ Sci Council Generalitat Valencian				In the framework of the WATERMED (WATer use efficiency in natural vegetation and agricultural areas by Remote sensing in the MEDiterranean basin) project, an experimental field campaign was carried out in a semi-arid region near Marrakech, Morocco, during March 2003. This work focused on the columnar aerosol characterization from spectroradiometric and photometric measurements of direct solar irradiance and sky radiance at ground level. The results show a high dependence of the aerosol optical properties on the air masses present in the area. Two periods with different aerosol loads were observed in the campaign. In the first, Atlantic-origin aerosols showed a marine particle accumulation mode combined with a dominant mode corresponding to coarse particles of local origin. In the second period the synoptic situation changed towards a Saharan+Atlantic origin, the Atlantic influence persisting at altitude while at lower levels the presence of air masses proceeding from the Saharan desert was observed. This dry air carried a large quantity of mineral particles that increased the area's turbidity, leading to a substantial increase in the volume of the whole distribution, a displacement of the accumulation mode radius towards higher values and an increasingly evident spread of the coarse particle mode, although the radius remained the same as that in the first period of the campaign.

A GIS approach to mapping oil spills in a marine environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												A geographic information system (GIS) can contribute significantly to the correct interpretation of the slick signatures visible on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Initially, GIS has proven to be an excellent management tool for resource assessment, oil spill response and planning, and damage assessment. The GIS approach to the problem of oil spill mapping includes integration of the geographical, remote sensing, oil and gas production/infrastructure data and slick signatures, detected by SAR, in GIS. Compiled from data from several sources including nautical maps, geodatabases, ground truth and remote sensing data, GIS allows the retrieval of key information, such as predicting oil spill locations, revealing offshore/onshore sources, and estimating the intensity of oil pollution. SAR and GIS technologies can improve the identification and classification of oil spills, leading to construction of the final product, an oil spill distribution map. This approach has been applied to oil spill mapping in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. We conclude that the combination of GIS and SAR technologies provides an ideal solution for understanding the spatial/temporal distribution of oil spills in the marine environment and is considered as the core of the oil spill monitoring system.				surname, name/A-2183-2010; Ivanov, Andrei/G-1022-2014	Ivanov, Andrei/0000-0001-6008-0020												0143-1161						2008	29	21					6297	6313		10.1080/01431160802175587								WOS:000260326200017

Oil spill mapping in the western part of the East China Sea using synthetic aperture radar imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Oil spills are one of the major environmental concerns, especially in the coastal zones of the ocean. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from the European Remote Sensing (ERS)-2 and Envisat satellites has proved to be a useful tool for monitoring oil spills in the marine environment due to its all-weather and all-time capability. More than 600 scenes with SAR images acquired over the western part of the East China Sea in 2002-2005 were collected, and of these, 120 scenes containing pronounced oil spills were processed and analysed. To analyse SAR image signatures of the oil spills, a geographic information system (GIS) framework was used. The oil spills were distinguished from look-alike phenomena by using other remote sensing data, and contextual information was incorporated into the GIS to obtain an oil spill distribution map for the western part of the East China Seas. Analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of the oil spills revealed the risk areas and confirmed previous findings that oil spills are mainly distributed along regional shipping routes. This verifies that illegal discharges from ships are the main source of oil pollution in this region. The detailed analysis also revealed different types of oil pollution and showed diurnal and seasonal variations in the amount of oil spills detected by SAR images acquired in the morning/evening time and in the summer/winter.

The composition of the suspended particulate matter transported by these plumes can alter the quality of coastal waters. The survey of marine coastal zones has thus become a major issue for water managers. For several decades, satellite imagery has allowed the daily monitoring of river plumes behavior over large distances. Nevertheless, it fails to provide data on their hourly evolution, which is important to operationally manage coastal waters in tourist areas. This study investigates the possibility of using the Argus video system to continuously survey the evolution of a storm water plume impact region. The system was installed in Anglet, at the Adour River mouth (southwest of France), in February 2005. An image-processing technique, based on pixel intensity clustering, is proposed to delineate river plume fronts along beaches from images collected with the Adour video station. Application of this technique, tested on storm water runoff plume events occurring under different climate conditions, shows promising results.																	0749-0208						2008	24	4C		S			133	140		10.2112/06-0705.1								WOS:000257818400015

Coral reef communities, habitats, and substrates in and near sanctuary zones of Ningaloo Marine Park	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												As Australia's longest fringing reef, Ningaloo Reef lies close to the mainland of northwest Australia in an area of high tourism potential. The establishment of sanctuary zones in and around the northern Ningaloo Marine Park has necessitated improvements in understanding of the biodiversity and distribution of habitats and substrates in the reef lagoon, its seaward barrier, and the adjacent shelf environments. Using a combination of video transects in forereef-to-shelf environments, global positioning system-controlled ground-truthing of colour satellite images, and aerial photography for shallow lagoon settings, 16 habitat types were identified and mapped regionally. Lagoon substrates described in previous reconnaissance were mapped here in greater detail, and some of the first data on poorly known forereef and shelf communities have been analysed from the video transects. There is a strong correlation between reef morphology, inherited substrate type, and coral communities across reef lagoons and their associated barriers, where an energy gradient controlled by wave-driven and tidal circulation in reef flat and lagoon environments is reflected in the distribution and cover of robust to more delicate coral communities. Morphological controls are less distinct in island-associated habitats, where increased turbidity, differing wave energy, and more variable topography result in higher substrate variability and increasing soft coral communities. The data obtained in this study provide a background for management of biodiversity and monitoring of future impacts in some of the sanctuary zones likely to experience increased use in the northern Ningaloo Reef.

Marine and coastal applications in landscape ecology	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Landscape ecology traditionally has been limited to the study of terrestrial systems; however, the questions and methods defining the science are equally relevant for marine and coastal systems. The reciprocal relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes and the overarching effect of scale on this relationship was being explored in some marine and coastal settings as the general discipline of landscape ecology was evolving throughout the latter two decades of the last century. As with all components of the biosphere, an understanding of these relationships is critical for successful management of marine and coastal systems. In these systems, widely dispersed field or ship-based observations and lack of broad scale data have historically precluded quantification of large-scale patterns and processes and hindered management efforts. However, relatively recent advances in geographic information systems, remote sensing and computer technologies have begun to address these issues and are now permitting assessments of pattern and process in oceans. The intent of this special issue is to highlight research that is adapting the tools of landscape ecology to answer ecological questions within marine and coastal systems, to address the unique challenges faced in these landscapes, and to stimulate an exchange of ideas and solutions to common problems. Inspiration for this special issue of Landscape Ecology began with a special session on "Marine and Coastal Applications in Landscape Ecology" that was held at the 19th Annual Symposium of the United States Regional Association of the International Association for Landscape Ecology, March 31-April 2, 2004 in Las Vegas, Nevada.																	0921-2973						2008	23			1			1	5		10.1007/s10980-007-9141-3								WOS:000252922800001

Distribution and dynamics of intertidal macrobenthos predicted from remote sensing: response to microphytobenthos and environment	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												We investigated which variables, including environmental variables and food availability, could predict the spatial distribution and dynamics of benthic macrofauna on an intertidal flat. A time series of macrobenthos and sediment grain size samples was complemented by time series of microphytobenthos and saltmarsh vegetation biomass and sediment grain size from airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, and elevation from laser altimetry. Response models were constructed to predict biomass and species richness of macrobenthos as a function of the environmental variables. Total biomass and species richness was best predicted by a combination of microphytobenthos biomass and sediment characteristics as explanatory variables. Deep deposit feeders and surface deposit feeders also responded best to a combination of variables, with deep deposit feeders responding more strongly to sediment grain size and surface deposit feeders responding more strongly to microphytobenthos biomass. The environmental conditions to reach maximum biomass differed for each macrobenthos species. Application of the response models to the remote sensing-derived maps of the environmental variables enabled significant predictions of the spatial distribution of macrobenthos biomass, demonstrating the differences in distribution of the macrobenthos species. The models also revealed the sensitivity of the macrobenthic community to environmental change. In situ and remote sensing data demonstrated a significant fining of the sediment and a (temporal) increase in average microphytobenthos biomass. Field observations also showed a significant increase in species richness and changes in the relative abundance of species, with a decrease in Bathyporeia pilosa, and an increase in Nereis diversicolor, Pygospio elegans and Heteromastus filiformis. Such changes in macrobenthos biomass and species richness were indeed predicted from the response models. The study demonstrates that the synoptic remote sensing techniques combined with field sampling allow efficient ecological mapping and monitoring.				van der Wal, Daphne/A-8875-2011; rossi, francesca/G-2807-2013; Herman, Peter/A-9018-2011; Ysebaert, Tom/C-6715-2011	van der Wal, Daphne/0000-0002-2319-056X; rossi, francesca/0000-0003-1928-9193; Herman, Peter/0000-0003-2188-6341; Forster, Rodney/0000-0001-6990-1673												0171-8630						2008	367						57	72		10.3354/meps07535								WOS:000260017900006

Ontogenetic patterns of habitat use by reef-fish in a Marine Protected Area network: a multi-scaled remote sensing and in situ approach	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) on the west coast of the island of Hawaii (West Hawaii) has been shown to vary in its effectiveness to replenish depleted aquarium fish stocks. To determine the abundance and distribution of habitats needed to better design and manage MPAs in Hawaii, underwater video transects, remote sensing data and a benthic classification scheme were combined to develop a map of reef habitats previously identified as important to the life history of aquarium fish and other reef species. Using these maps, an assessment was conducted to quantify habitat use by different life history stages of the most commonly live-caught aquarium fish, the yellow tang Zebrasoma flavescens, in existing MPAs. Rugosity, small reef features (i.e. percent cover of dominant reef species) and the abundance and size of fish were quantified in 1 15 circular plots to determine the accuracy of mapping efforts and the distribution of fish life history stages across the reef in 4 MPAs. Visual classification and mapping of habitat types was 93% accurate and consistent with percent cover of substrates quantified at the quadrat level. The different life history stages of yellow tangs were distributed along distinct habitat types in all of the MPAs examined. New recruits and juveniles of the yellow tang showed similar patterns of habitat use among sites and were associating with coral-rich areas and patches of the finger coral Porites compressa. In contrast, the distribution and abundance of adults varied greatly within and among sites. The development of a ground-truthed habitat map allowed a holistic examination of habitat use by yellow tang, including most life history stages, which provides key information for the design of MPAs and the advancement of ecosystem-based management.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2008	365						217	232		10.3354/meps07492								WOS:000259379600019						
J	Underwood, AJ; Murphy, RJ				Underwood, A. J.; Murphy, R. J.			Unexpected patterns of facilitatory grazing revealed by quantitative imaging	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Micro-algae (the principal food of intertidal gastropods) were quantified in areas surrounding mid-shore refuges of the intertidal snail Nerita atramentosa to test the hypothesis that removal of important grazers would lead to more micro-algae. Digital colour-infrared imagery provided independent quantitative measurements of amounts of chlorophyll (as an index of amounts of micro-algae) over small areas through time. To determine the effect of grazing on micro-algal abundance, cages were used to exclude animals from refuges. Other refuges were left uncaged or had partial, control cages. Contrary to predictions, amounts of micro-algae in areas close to refuges from which N. atramentosa had been excluded were smaller than in controls, suggesting facilitatory effects of N, atramentosa on micro-algal growth or survivorship. Facilitation may occur because of decreased grazing by the limpet Cellana tramoserica where N. atramentosa (a competitive dominant) are present or to facilitatory effects of N, atramentosa directly on the micro-algae. To unravel complex ecological interactions involving grazing around refuges and the impact of grazing on ecological structure and function it is necessary to make repeated, independent measurements through time. Remote-sensing provided information on distribution of food that would be difficult or impossible to achieve using conventional methods. This research identified complexities and interactions that have implications for the study of grazing effects across many terrestrial, intertidal and marine habitats.																	0171-8630						2008	358						85	94		10.3354/meps07302								WOS:000256228300008

Influence of environmental settings on the prevalence of Trichodesmium spp. in the Bay of Bengal	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Trichodesmium, an important marine nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, is widespread in tropical waters and contributes substantially to the global chemical cycles by new production. The interesting and intriguing feature of Trichodesmium blooms is the suddenness with which the blooms appear and disappear. A well-defined periodicity and annual rhythm of Trichodesmium blooms in the Indian south central coastal environments of the Arabian Sea between February and May is well documented. However, not much is known for the Bay of Bengal. Analysis of the surface water samples collected from the merchant vessels plying between Chennai and Singapore at regular intervals (February 2000 to September 2002) to study the variations in the micro-phytoplankton community indicated that Trichodesmium persists for a large part of the year in the south-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal. Remotely sensed images from 1997 to 2003 also indicated the prevalence of Trichodesmium in the south-eastern part of the Bay during the winter months and in the west (west Bay of Bengal and east Arabian Sea) during summer. This raises the possible role of physical forcing in the dispersal and seeding of Trichodesmium. The prevalence of stratified conditions in the Bay of Bengal almost throughout the year can be one of the causative factors facilitating the preponderance of Trichodesmium. The inter-annual variations observed indicate that the tracking of Trichodesmium will be useful in understanding the biogeochemistry of the region.																	0171-8630						2008	356						93	101		10.3354/meps07259								WOS:000254963900008

Variance in depth (within a 75 m radius) was the seascape metric that had the strongest relationships with most fish assemblage metrics, followed by depth and slope. Our results demonstrate the potential for using remotely sensed measures of the seascape to support predictive mapping and modeling of fish assemblages.

Multivariate Prediction of Rockfish Habitat Suitability in Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary and Del Monte Shalebeds, California, USA	MARINE GEODESY					104th Annual Meeting of the Association-of-American-Geographers	APR 07, 2008	Boston, MA					Due to the decline of fisheries throughout the world, there is an ever-increasing demand among fisheries managers for more and better data regarding the distribution and abundance of commercially important fishes. Along the Pacific coast of North America, there are insufficient stock data for most rockfish species, which compose one of the most valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in California. One approach being explored for increasing our understanding of fish distribution patterns and potentially generating stock assessment data over large areas is the use of habitat-based assessment. The general hypothesis is that because rockfish are not randomly distributed across habitats, it should be possible to model and predict their distribution and abundance based on habitat maps and biological data. Furthermore, to the extent that these models are robust and portable, they should be applicable across a variety of locations and physical settings. We attempt to test these hypotheses using predictive models created for two species of rockfish [Sebastes flavidus (yellowtail) and S. rosaceus (rosy)] within Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBMNS). These models, created as part of a recent study, were applied to and tested against distribution data from a previous study of the two species in question at Del Monte shalebeds in Monterey Bay, California. The general linear models (GLMs) were created using rugosity, slope, aspect, depth, and topographic position index analyses of bathymetric digital elevation along with presence/absence data for the two species of rockfish. The model for S. flavidus generated at CBNMS proved to be at least as efficient at predicting yellowtail rockfish distribution at Del Monte as in the setting in which it was created, while the model for S. rosaceus failed to predict rosy rockfish distribution at Del Monte with any reliability.

Fishers from Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, visually interpreted a Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) multi-spectral satellite image to identify shallow-water marine environments. Their assessments were used to direct a supervised classification of the image and create habitat maps with indigenously defined habitat classes. Results show that these participatory remote sensing techniques produce,accurate broad-scale marine habitat maps that can be useful to managers and decision makers. Participatory methods that draw from indigenous habitat definitions also have the potential benefit of generating new insights about socio-ecological processes and enhancing local acceptance and understanding of conservation projects by allowing stakeholders to actively contribute in management planning.

Part 1: Mathematical apparatus	OCEANOLOGIA												This article is the first of two papers on the remote sensing methods of monitoring the Baltic ecosystem, developed by our team. Earlier, we had produced a series of detailed mathematical models and statistical regularities describing the transport of solar radiation in the atmosphere-sea. system, the absorption of this radiation in the water and its utilisation in a variety of processes, most importantly in the photosynthesis occurring in phytoplankton cells, as a source of energy for the functioning of marine ecosystems. The, comprehensive DESAMBEM algorithm, presented in this paper, is a synthesis of these models and regularities. This algorithm enables the abiotic properties of the environment as well as the state and the functioning of the Baltic ecosystem to be assessed on the basis of available satellite data,. It can be used to determine a good number of these properties: the sea surface temperature, the natural irradiance of the sea surface, the spectral and spatial distributions of solar radiation energy in the water, the surface concentrations and vertical distributions of chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigments in this sea, the radiation energy absorbed by phytoplankton, the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis and the primary production of organic matter. On the basis of these directly determined properties, other characteristics of processes taking place in the Baltic ecosystem can be estimated indirectly. Part 1 of this series of articles deals with the detailed mathematical apparatus of the DESAMBEM algorithm. Part 2 will discuss its practical applicability in the satellite monitoring of the sea, and will provide an assessment of the accuracy of such remote sensing methods in the monitoring of the Baltic ecosystem (see Darecki et al. 2008 - this issue).

Particular emphasis was laid on analysing the precision of estimates of these and other parameters of the Baltic ecosystem, determined by remote sensing methods. The errors in these estimates turned out to be relatively small: hence, the set, of DESAMBEM algorithms should in the future be utilised as the foundation for the effective satellite monitoring of the state and functioning of the Baltic ecosystem.

USING ACTIVE REMOTE SENSING TO ASSESS THE SEAWATER QUALITY	UNIVERSITY POLITEHNICA OF BUCHAREST SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN-SERIES A-APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS												Laser remote sensing systems can detect the presence in water of fluorescent constituents that are not visible for other types of devices. The paper presents results obtained for the Romanian coastal zone of Black Sea for the first time using an active remote sensing system. The general principle of Lidar (Light Defection and Ranging) detection and applications of a fluorescence ship borne system are discussed. The accuracy of the obtained information is dependent on the technical performances of the device and on the accuracy of the data processing method Comparative analysis of the results obtained in the investigation of various water sources (river water, marine water, clean water, polluted water) is carried out in order to identify the specific fluorescence finger print.

Interannual variability of smoke and warm cloud relationships in the Amazon as inferred from MODIS retrievals	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Aerosol and cloud data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Earth Observing System (EOS) Aqua are used to investigate interannual variability of smoke and warm cloud relationships during the dry-to-wet transition season (August-October) over the Amazon for two years and its association with meteorological conditions. In one year (2003), smoke aerosols are associated with an increase of cloud fraction and a decrease of cloud effective radius. These effects amplify the cooling at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) caused by the aerosol extinction. However, in another year (2002) the cloud fraction decreases with increasing aerosol optical depth. Such a decrease of cloud fraction could offset the effect of increased reflection of solar radiation by the aerosols both at the surface and at TOA. The changes in radiative fluxes between these years would contribute to interannual changes of surface energy fluxes and radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere and influence variability of the wet season onset in the basin. In 2003, the atmosphere was more humid and less stable. These conditions may be relatively favorable for the activation of aerosol particles into cloud condensation nuclei and hence cloud droplets. In 2002, the clouds were less extensive and thinner in a relatively dry atmosphere and presumably dissipated more easily. This study suggests that the aerosol-cloud relation can be influenced by atmospheric structure and convective motions, in addition to changes in aerosols properties. An adequate characterization of aerosol-cloud relationship would require a longer time series of data that includes a variety of climate conditions. The caveat of this analysis is that differences in aerosol absorption and its vertical distribution may have contributed to the observed interannual change of smoke-cloud relationship but could not be determined due to lack of adequate measurements.

J	Frouin, R; Pelletier, B				Frouin, Robert; Pelletier, Bruno			Fields of non-linear regression models for atmospheric correction of satellite ocean-color imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote sensing of ocean color from space, a problem that consists of retrieving spectral marine reflectance from spectral top-of-atmosphere reflectance, is considered as a collection of similar inverse problems continuously indexed by the angular variables influencing the observation process. A general solution is proposed in the form of a field of non-linear regression models over the set T of permitted values for the angular variables, i.e., as a map from T to some function space. Each value of the field is a regression model that performs a direct mapping from the top-of-atmosphere reflectance to the marine reflectance. Since the spectral components of the field take values in the same variable vector space, the retrievals in individual spectral bands are not independent, i.e., the solution is not just a juxtaposition of independent models for each spectral band. A scheme based on ridge functions is developed to approximate this solution to an arbitrary accuracy, and is applied to the retrieval of marine reflectance in Case 1 waters, for which optical properties are only governed by biogenic content. The statistical models are evaluated on synthetic data as well as actual data originating from the SeaWiFS instrument, taking into account noise in the data. Theoretical performance is good in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities, suggesting that the function field methodology might improve atmospheric correction in the presence of absorbing aerosols and provide more accurate estimates of marine reflectance in productive waters. When applied to SeaWiFS imagery acquired off California, the function field methodology gives generally higher estimates of marine reflectance than the standard SeaDAS algorithm, but the values are more realistic.

Remote sensing applications: An overview	CURRENT SCIENCE												Remote Sensing (RS) refers to the science of identification of earth surface features and estimation of their geo-bio-physical properties using electromagnetic radiation as a medium of interaction. Spectral, spatial, temporal and polarization signatures are major characteristics of the sensor/target, which facilitate target discrimination. Earth surface data as seen by the sensors in different wavelengths (reflected, scattered and/or emitted) is radiometrically and geometrically corrected before extraction of spectral information. RS data, with its ability for a synoptic view, repetitive coverage with calibrated sensors to detect changes, observations at different resolutions, provides a better alternative for natural resources management as compared to traditional methods. Indian Earth Observation (EO) programme has been applications-driven and national development has been its prime motivation. From Bhaskara to Cartosat, India's EO capability has increased manifold. Improvements are not only in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric resolutions, but also in their coverage and value-added products. Some of the major operational application themes, in which India has extensively used remote sensing data are agriculture, forestry, water resources, land use, urban sprawl, geology, environment, coastal zone, marine resources, snow and glacier, disaster monitoring and mitigation, infrastructure development, etc. The paper reviews RS techniques and applications carried out using both optical and microwave sensors. It also analyses the gap areas and discusses the future perspectives.																	0011-3891					DEC 25	2007	93	12					1747	1766										WOS:000252249700023

Suspended particulate matter dynamics in coastal waters from ocean color: Application to the northern Gulf of Mexico	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												[1] Suspended particulate matter (SPM) plays an important role in primary production, pollutant transport, and other biogeochemical processes in coastal marine environments. We present an empirical two-band ocean color remote sensing reflectance algorithm (R(rs)670/R(rs)555) for SPM concentrations developed using field measurements obtained in coastal waters influenced by the Mississippi River in 2000, 2002, and 2004. The ratio algorithm was also found to be highly correlated to backscattering coefficient (b(bp)(555), r(2) = 0.96), the backscattering ratio (bbp(555)/b(p)(555), r(2) = 0.82) and the spectral backscattering slope (g, r(2) = 0.72) in March 2002, a period with large hydrographic variability in the study area. Strong correlations between water column b(bp)(555), SPM and nonalgal absorption anap(443) suggest the dominant influence of nonalgal particles on bbp. SeaWiFS derived SPM and g distributions indicated event-based variability linked to energetic disturbances such as frontal passages, resuspension, and river discharge that with b(bp)/b(p) could reveal refractive index and particle size characteristics in the coastal environment.																	0094-8276					DEC 7	2007	34	23							L23611	10.1029/2007GL031192								WOS:000251524800002

Rain in shallow cumulus over the ocean - The RICO campaign	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Shallow, maritime cumuli are ubiquitous over much of the tropical oceans, and characterizing their properties is important to understanding weather and climate. The Rain in Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) field campaign, which took place during November 2004-January 2005 in the trades over the western Atlantic, emphasized measurements of processes related to the formation of rain in shallow cumuli, and how rain subsequently modifies the structure and ensemble statistics of trade wind clouds. Eight weeks of nearly continuous S-band polarimetric radar sampling, 57 flights from three heavily instrumented research aircraft, and a suite of ground- and ship-based instrumentation provided data on trade wind clouds with unprecedented resolution. Observational strategies employed during RICO capitalized on the advances in remote sensing and other instrumentation to provide insight into processes that span a range of scales and that lie at the heart of questions relating to the cause and effects of rain from shallow maritime cumuli.

Although a regional Arctic OC4L algorithm was designed to be applicable to high northern latitudes, its applicability remains uncertain. To examine these issues, we investigated the light absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, non-algal particles (NAP), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), covering most of the western Arctic Ocean. A higher pigment packaging effect was identified relative to that at lower latitudes. The CDOM absorption dominated and accounted for 76% of the total non-water absorption at 443 nm and did not covary with variations in chla. This absorption is significantly higher than those in other marine environments. We also examined the backscattering coefficient of particles obtained from the inversion of R-rs(lambda) and found that it covaried well with variation in NAP absorption. Our evaluation shows that when turbid waters (R-rs(670) > 0.00042 sr(-1)) are excluded, the performance of the OC4L is good and much better than that of the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) OC4V4 and the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) OC3M (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13, 0.21, and 0.22, respectively). The reason why the OC4L performs well despite strong CDOM absorption is discussed.

J	Lahajnar, N; Wiesner, MG; Gaye, B				Lahajnar, Niko; Wiesner, Martin G.; Gaye, Birgit			Fluxes of amino acids and hexosamines to the deep South China Sea	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Settling particles collected by sediment traps deployed between 1987 and 1999 in the northern, central and southwestern South China Sea (SCS) were analysed to study seasonal, interannual and spatial variations in the composition and flux of labile particulate matter. Results were combined with remote-sensing and surface-sediment data in order to describe the factors controlling the preservation of organic matter en route from the upper ocean to the seafloor. Organic carbon, amino acid and hexosamine fluxes generally follow the fluxes of total particulate matter, with maxima during the SW and NE monsoon periods. During non-El Nino conditions spectral amino acid distributions show that degradation of organic matter in the water column decreases as the flux rates increase. This is suggested to be the combined result of enhanced primary productivity, greater input of lithogenics serving as ballast to increase settling rates, and sorption of labile components to clay minerals. During El Nino conditions, in contrast, the degree of organic matter degradation is at very high and comparable levels at all trap sites. Flux component seasonality is strongly reduced except for the coastal upwelling areas, particularly off central Vietnam, which show significantly higher fluxes of organic carbon and lithogenic matter as compared to the open SCS. This suggests that the fluxes are affected by lateral advection of reworked organic matter from riverine sources or resuspended sediments from the nearby shelf/slope. Comparison of the measured organic carbon fluxes in 1200 m depth with those accumulating in surface sediments results in a more than 80% loss of organic matter before final burial in the sediments. The degree of organic matter preservation in the surface sediments of the deep SCS is distinctly lower than in other monsoonal oceans. This may be due to varying lithogenic input and almost complete dissolution of protective biogenic mineral matrices at greater water depth. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zielinski, T; Pflug, B				Zielinski, Tymon; Pflug, Bringfried			Lidar-based studies of aerosol optical properties over coastal areas	SENSORS												Aerosol size distribution and concentration strongly depend on wind speed, direction, and measuring point location in the marine boundary layer over coastal areas. The marine aerosol particles which are found over the sea waves in high wind conditions affect visible and near infrared propagation for paths that pass very close to the surface as well as the remote sensing measurements of the sea surface. These particles are produced by various air sea interactions. This paper presents the results of measurements taken at numerous coastal stations between 1992 and 2006 using an FLS-12 lidar system together with other supporting instrumentation. The investigations demonstrated that near-water layers in coastal areas differ significantly from those over open seas both in terms of structure and physical properties. Taking into consideration the above mentioned factors, aerosol concentrations and optical properties were determined in the marine boundary layer as a function of offshore distance and altitude at various coastal sites in two seasons. The lidar results show that the remote sensing algorithms used currently in coastal areas need verification and are not fully reliable.																	1424-8220					DEC	2007	7	12					3347	3365		10.3390/s7123347								WOS:000252628300023	28903298

To investigate changes of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) caused by environmental situation in the bay area, the present study analyzed the occurrence of HAB and environmental conditions in Daya Bay using in situ and satellite remote sensing data for the period of 1983 - 2004. Only 14 HABs were observed during the first decade (1983 - 1993), while 55 HABs occurred during the second decade (1994 - 2004). The locations of HAB have extended from aquaculture areas to the entire bay area. In addition, the seasonality of HAB has changed from spring and autumn prior to 1994 to all year round post 1994. Changes in HAB frequency and location were found to be associated with variations in nutrients and contaminants in the bay area. Total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) was 0.021 mg l(-1) in 1986, but had reached 0.068 mg l(-1) by 1999 and the ratio of TIN/P increased also, with a peak value (18.28) in 1999. Organic contaminants have also been relatively high in recent years in Daya Bay. The seasonal extension of HAB was found to be connected partially with increased water temperature resulting from the thermal discharge of nuclear power stations. Yearly mean water surface temperature (WST) increased over the past two decades. Monthly mean WST also increased after the Daya Bay nuclear power station commenced operating in 1994, ranging from 0.2 to 2.7 degrees C. There were about 14 algal species recorded to have caused HABs frequently in Daya Bay, such as Scrippsiella trochoidea. The number of HAB species increased in the second decade (1994 - 2004). A warm-water favoring species Peridinium quinquecorne caused a bloom in May 1999. This was the first recorded time of this species blooming in China. These changes are associated with increases in cage aquaculture, contaminants discharged from industrial and agricultural activities, and thermal discharge from the nuclear power stations in Daya Bay.																	1017-0839					DEC	2007	18	5					1011	1027		10.3319/TAO.2007.18.5.1011(Oc)								WOS:000252817900008

River plume patterns and dynamics within the Southern California Bight	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Stormwater river plumes are important vectors of marine contaminants and pathogens in the Southern California Bight. Here we report the results of a multi-institution investigation of the river plumes across eight major river systems of southern California. We use in situ water samples from multi-day cruises in combination with MODIS satellite remote sensing, buoy meteorological observations, drifters, and HF radar current measurements to evaluate the dispersal patterns and dynamics of the freshwater plumes. River discharge was exceptionally episodic, and the majority of storm discharge occurred in a few hours. The combined plume observing techniques revealed that plumes commonly detach from the coast and turn to the left, which is the opposite direction of Coriolis influence. Although initial offshore velocity of the buoyant plumes was similar to 50 cm/s and was influenced by river discharge inertia (i.e., the direct momentum of the river flux) and buoyancy, subsequent advection of the plumes was largely observed in an alongshore direction and dominated by local winds. Due to the multiple day upwelling wind conditions that commonly follow discharge events, plumes were observed to flow from their respective river mouths to down-coast waters at rates of 20-40 km/d. Lastly, we note that suspended-sediment concentration and beam-attenuation were poorly correlated with plume salinity across and within the sampled plumes (mean r(2) = 0.12 and 0.25, respectively), while colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence was well correlated (mean r(2) = 0.56), suggesting that CDOM may serve as a good tracer of the discharged freshwater in subsequent remote sensing and monitoring efforts of plumes.

This study investigates the relationship of at-sea movements of king penguins to mesoscale eddies using oceanographic remote sensing and movement data from 43 individual trips over 4 years. Simultaneous satellite measurements provided information on gradients of sea surface temperature and currents associated with eddies determined from altimetry. Penguins tended to swim rapidly with currents as they travelled towards foraging zones. Swimming speed indicative of foraging occurred within mesoscale fronts and strong currents associated with eddies at the Polar Front. These results demonstrate the importance of mesoscale eddies in directing foraging efforts to allow predators to rapidly get to rich areas where high concentrations of prey are likely to be encountered. When returning to the colony to relieve the incubating partner or to feed the chick, the birds followed a direct and rapid path, seemingly ignoring currents.

J	Cococcioni, M; Lazzerini, B; Marcelloni, F				Cococcioni, Marco; Lazzerini, Beatrice; Marcelloni, Francesco			Estimating the concentration of optically active constituents of sea water by Takagi-Sugeno models with quadratic rule consequents	PATTERN RECOGNITION												Determining the concentrations of chlorophyll, suspended particulate matter and coloured dissolved organic matter in the sea water is basic to support the monitoring of upwelling phenomena, algae blooms, and changes in the marine ecosystem. Since these concentrations affect the spectral distribution of the solar light back-scattered by the water body, their estimation can be computed by using a set of remotely sensed multispectral measurements of the reflected sunlight. In this paper, the relation between the concentrations of interest and the average subsurface reflectances is modelled by means of a set of second-order Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy rules. Unlike first-order TS rules, which adopt linear functions as consequent, second-order TS rules exploit quadratic functions, thus improving the modelling capability of the rule in the subspace determined by the antecedent. First, we show how we can build a second-order TS model through a simple transformation, which allows estimating the consequent parameters using standard linear least-squares algorithms, and by adopting one of the most used methods proposed in the literature to generate first-order TS models. Then, we compare first-order and second-order TS models against mean square error and interpretability of rules. We highlight how second-order TS models allow us to achieve better approximation than first-order TS models though maintaining interpretability of the rules. Finally, we show how second-order TS models perform considerably better (the mean square error is lower by two orders of magnitude) than the specific implementations of radial basis function networks and multi-layer perceptron networks used in previous papers for the same application domain.

With the integration of multi-temporal remote sensing images of 1977, 1978, 1988, 1996, and 2003, GIS spatial analyzing approach and GPS technique, as well as field data and other background data of the region, this research investigated the comprehensive characteristics and the drivers of coastal land use dynamics and shoreline changes in Inner Lingdingyang Bay. The results reveal that the reclaimed coastal land was mainly for agriculture and aquaculture in early years, but now they are used for construction sites of harbors and industries, especially high-tech industry.																	1002-0063					SEP	2007	17	3					222	228		10.1007/s11769-007-0222-7								WOS:000254707900005

Insights into the morphology, geometry, and post-impact erosion of the Araguainha peak-ring structure, central Brazil	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The 40-km-wide Araguainha structure is the largest and best-exposed complex impact crater in South America. It was excavated in flat-lying sediments of the intracratonic Parana Basin, where target rocks are well exposed and have remained undeformed since the impact event ca. 245 Ma. Despite the excellent state of preservation and exposure, information available on the target rock stratigraphy, post-impact erosion, and morphology of the structure is limited. Our combined field observations and remote sensing analysis demonstrate that Araguainha preserves all features of a shallowly eroded peak-ring crater. The interior of the structure exposes a central peak surrounded by a 5-km-wide annular basin and two main ring features 10-12 and 14-18 km from the center. Analysis of the pre-impact stratigraphy, present morphology, and crater dimensions indicates that excavation related to the transient cavity formation was extensive in the annular basin, but minimal to nonexistent beyond the inner ring feature. The formation of the inner ring feature can be reconciled with compressional stresses during outward collapse of the central uplift and inward slumping of the crater walls. Regional stratigraphic data combined with field observations indicate two periods of post-impact erosion associated with exhumation of the Parana Basin. We estimate that 250-350 m of fallback deposits and target rocks have been removed by erosion. Erosion also accounted for removal of the proximal ejecta immediately outside the rim of the structure. In contrast to previous suggestions that the impact took place in a shallow-marine environment, our observations are more consistent with an extremely shallow, brackish to freshwater lacustrine environment, with little effect on the developing impact crater.

Detection and discrimination between oil spills and look-alike phenomena through neural networks	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are extensively used for dark formation detection in the marine environment, as their recording is independent of clouds and weather. Dark formations can be caused by man made actions (e.g. oil spill discharging) or natural ocean phenomena (e.g. natural slicks, wind front areas). Radar backscatter values for oil spills are very similar to backscatter values for very calm sea areas and other ocean phenomena because they damp the capillary and short gravity sea waves. The ability of neural networks to detect dark formations in high resolution SAR images and to discriminate oil spills from look-alike phenomena simultaneously was examined. Two different neural networks are used; one to detect dark formations and the second one to perform a classification to oil spills or look-alikes. The proposed method is very promising in detecting dark formations and discriminating oil spills from look-alikes as it detects with an overall accuracy of 94% the dark formations and discriminate correctly 89% of examined cases.

Relative roles of coastal and oceanic processes in determining physical and chemical characteristics of an intensively sampled nearshore system	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We compared the extent to which offshore and remote-sensing measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), upwelling, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were concordant with in situ measurements of temperature, Chl a, and water nutrients at Tatoosh Island, Washington for the past 8 yr. Offshore SSTs were significantly correlated with water temperatures at Tatoosh, though consistently 2 degrees C to 3 degrees C warmer. Sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor Chl a estimates were poor predictors of Chl a at Tatoosh Island measured with an anchored fluorometer. Nitrate and phosphorus estimates at Tatoosh Island were positively correlated with an upwelling index and negatively correlated with SST, as would be expected from an upwelling source. In contrast, ammonium and nitrite were uncorrelated with the upwelling index or SST and showed elevated levels immediately adjacent to Tatoosh Island, suggesting strong local effects of marine invertebrates, birds, and mammals on nutrient dynamics and cycling in coastal ecosystems.

Conservation management of these precious ecosystems relies on accurate and up-to-date information about ecosystem health and the distribution of species and habitats, but such information can be costly to gather and interpret in the field. Remote sensing has proven capable of collecting information on geomorphologic zones and substrate types for coral reef environments, and is cost-effective when information is needed for large areas. Remote sensing-based mapping of coral habitat variables known to influence biodiversity has only recently been undertaken and new sensors and improved data processing show great potential in this area. This paper reviews coral reef biodiversity, the influence of habitat variables on its local spatial distribution, and the potential for remote sensing to produce maps of these habitat variables, thus indirectly mapping coral reef biodiversity and fulfilling information needs of coral reef managers.

J	Zagolski, F; Santer, R; Aznay, O				Zagolski, Francis; Santer, Richard; Aznay, Ouahid			A new climatology for atmospheric correction based on the aerosol inherent optical properties	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In the aerosol remote sensing algorithms over ocean, the aerosol models are deduced from the spectral dependence of the path radiances in the near-infrared region. In the classical scheme of atmospheric corrections, the key point is the derivation of atmospheric signals in the visible part of the solar spectrum using these aerosol models. The aerosol climatology generally includes the standard aerosol models. Nevertheless, the latter may not be representative enough of the variety of aerosols encountered over coastal areas. One way to extend this climatology is to generate additional aerosol models. The latters will be described by their micro-physical properties and their inherent optical properties (IOPs) can then be computed with the Mie's theory. Coastal and inland stations of CIMEL sun-photometers from the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) offer an extensive and representative data set of aerosol characteristics (i.e., the apparent optical properties from which can be derived the IOPs) in the marine environment through solar extinction and sky radiance measurements. An iterative method, developed at the << Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences de l'Environnement >> (LISE, Wimereux-France), allows to extract the aerosol phase function from these ground-based measurements. CIMEL data, collected over 25 stations during several years, were processed to build-up a database with more than 7000 sequences including single scattering albedos and phase functions at two wavelengths ( 675 nm and 870 nm). Statistical methods have been applied on this data set to discard the wrong sequences and to suggest a classification in aerosol models through their IOPs.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 25	2007	112	D14							D14208	10.1029/2006JD007496								WOS:000248421500001

We quantified concurrent water mass distributions, ocean productivity patterns, and seabird distributions across a heterogeneous pelagic ecosystem from subtropical to sub-Antarctic waters. We surveyed 5155 kin and sighted 15,606 birds from 51 species, and used these data to investigate how seabirds respond to spatial variability in the structure and productivity of the ocean. We addressed two spatial scales: the structure of seabird communities across macro-mega scale (1000 s km) biogeographic domains, and their coarse-scale (10 s km) aggregation at hydrographic and bathymetric gradients. Both seabird density and species composition changed with latitudinal and onshore-offshore gradients in depth, water temperature, and chlorophyll-a concentration. The average seabird density increased across the subtropical convergence (STC) from 2.4 birds km(-2) in subtropical waters to 23.8 birds km(-2) in sub-Antarctic waters. The composition of the avifauna also differed across biogeographic domains. Prions (Pachyptila spp.) accounted for 57% of all sub-Antarctic birds, wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) accounted for 46% of all subtropical birds, and Indian Ocean yellow-nosed albatross (Thallasarche carteri) accounted for 32% of all birds in the STC. While surface feeders were the most abundant foraging guild across the study area, divers were disproportionately more numerous in the sub-Antarctic domain, and plungers were disproportionately more abundant in subtropical waters. Seabird densities were also higher within shallow shelf-slope regions, especially in sub-Antarctic waters, where large numbers of breeding seabirds concentrated. However, we did not find elevated seabird densities along the STC, suggesting that this broad frontal region is not a site of enhanced aggregation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative remote sensing study indicates doubling of coastal erosion rate in past 50 yr along a segment of the Arctic coast of Alaska	GEOLOGY												A new quantitative coastal land gained-and-lost method uses image analysis of topographic maps and Landsat thematic mapper short-wave infrared data to document accelerated coastal land loss and thermokarst lake expansion and drainage. The data span 1955-2005 along the Beaufort Sea coast north of Teshekpuk Lake in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Some areas have undergone as much as 0.9 kin of coastal erosion in the past 50 yr. Land loss attributed to coastal erosion more than doubled, from 0.48 km(2) yr(-1) during 1955-1985 to 1.08 km(2) yr(-1) during 1985-2005. Coastal erosion has breached thermokarst lakes, causing initial draining of the lakes followed by marine flooding. Although inland thermokarst lakes show some uniform expansion, lakes breached by coastal erosion display lake expansion several orders of magnitude greater than inland lakes.																	0091-7613					JUL	2007	35	7					583	586		10.1130/G23672A.1								WOS:000247895900002						
J	Platt, T; Sathyendranath, S; Fuentes-Yaco, C				Platt, Trevor; Sathyendranath, Shubha; Fuentes-Yaco, Cesar			Biological oceanography and fisheries management: perspective after 10 years	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Despite 100 years of research into the relationship between oceanographic factors and fish recruitment, it has proved very difficult to demonstrate causal connections between properties of the marine ecosystem and the success of fisheries. Some authors have been led to conclude that such causal connections, therefore, do not exist: a corollary would be that biological oceanography is of limited relevance to fisheries issues. However, it would be premature to dismiss biological oceanography as a tool in fisheries management. If we have not been able to implicate ecosystem factors as a significant source of variance in fish recruitment, it may be because the search has been conducted at an inappropriate scale, a consequence of the limitations of ships as oceanographic platforms. The advent of remotely sensed data from satellites greatly extends the scales of time and space at which synoptic oceanography can be carried out. Access to such data allows a wider range of hypotheses to be tested, than is possible with ships alone, on the relationship between ecosystem factors and recruitment. Applications in both the Atlantic and Pacific have demonstrated strong fluctuations between years in the timing and the intensity of phytoplankton dynamics, with implications for recruitment and growth of exploited populations of fish and invertebrates. The results provide essential intelligence for those charged with stewardship of the marine environment.																	1054-3139					JUL	2007	64	5					863	869		10.1093/icesjms/fsm072								WOS:000247991500001

In situ and remote-sensing measurements of the mean microphysical and optical properties of industrial pollution aerosol during ADRIEX	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												We present a summary of the principal physical and optical properties of aerosol particles using the FAAM BAE-146 instrumented aircraft during ADRIEX between 27 August and 6 September 2004, augmented by sunphotometer, lidar and satellite retrievals. Observations of anthropogenic aerosol, principally from industrial sources, were concentrated over the northern Adriatic Sea and over the Po Valley close to the aerosol sources. An additional flight was also carried out over the Black Sea to compare east and west European pollution. Measurements show the single-scattering albedo of dry aerosol particles to vary considerably between 0.89 and 0.97 at a wavelength of 0.55 mu m, with a campaign mean within the polluted lower free troposphere of 0.92. Although aerosol concentrations varied significantly from day to day and during individual days, the shape of the aerosol size distribution was relatively consistent through the experiment, with no detectable change observed over land and over sea. There is evidence to suggest that the pollution aerosol within the marine boundary layer was younger than that in the elevated layer. Trends in the aerosol volume distribution show consistency with multiple-site AERONET radiometric observations. The aerosol optical depths derived from aircraft measurements show a consistent bias to lower values than both the AERONET and lidar ground-based radiometric observations, differences which can be explained by local variations in the aerosol column loading and by some aircraft instrumental artefacts. Retrievals of the aerosol optical depth and fine-mode (<0.5 mu m radius) fraction contribution to the optical depth using MODIS data from the Terra and Aqua satellites show a reasonable level of agreement with the AERONET and aircraft measurements.

Three-dimensional variational assimilation of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data into a mesoscale weather-prediction model: A case study	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Assimilation of data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) is performed in order to improve the forecast of a heavy-precipitation case (IOP2b, 20-21 September 1999) of the Mesoscale Alpine Programme 1999. The three-dimensional variational data assimilation technique of the MM5 model is used. Either brightness temperatures or precipitable water and surface wind speed are assimilated. The sensitivity of the model to SSM/I data is also tested by selectively excluding SSM/I frequencies and changing the size of the thinning box. All the experiments are performed using the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) analysis on pressure level. The new initial conditions show considerable underestimation of the surface wind component V, and, even more, of the surface water vapour mixing ratio. This last error is partially corrected by assimilation of precipitable water alone, although these data produce a large increase in the mean error of the other surface variables (U, V and T). However, the forecast with this new set of initial conditions shows a good agreement (high correlation coefficient) with the rain gauge observations for the 1 h accumulated precipitation 3 h after the initial time. With a doubled box size, there is low sensitivity to the density of the observations used. In this case, the effect of the SSM/I data is slight, and the rainfall pattern produced is comparable to that obtained without any data assimilation. The model performance is also degraded if the 22 GHz brightness temperatures are removed from the assimilated measurements: the correlation coefficient for the precipitation is lower than in the case where all the frequencies are assimilated, and it decreases over time. In general, the use of precipitable water and surface wind speed affects the early stages (3 h) of the rainfall forecast, reducing the model spin-up. Brightness temperatures affect the forecast at a longer range (10 h). Copyright (C) 2007 Royal Meteorological Society.

Application of new parameterizations of gas transfer velocity and their impact on regional and global marine CO(2) budgets	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					37th International Liege Colloquium on Ocean Dynamics/5th International Symposium on Gas Transfer at Water Surfaces	MAY 02-06, 2005	Univ Liege, Liege, BELGIUM		Univ Liege			One of the dominant sources of uncertainty in the calculation of air-sea flux of carbon dioxide on a global scale originates from the various parameterizations of the gas transfer velocity, k, that are in use. Whilst it is undisputed that most of these pararneterizations have shortcomings and neglect processes which influence air-sea gas exchange and do not scale with wind speed alone, there is no general agreement about their relative accuracy. The most widely used parameterizations are based on non-linear functions of wind speed and, to a lesser extent, on sea surface temperature and salinity. Processes such as surface film damping and whitecapping are known to have an effect on air-sea exchange. More recently published pararneterizations use friction velocity, sea surface roughness, and significant wave height. These new parameters can account to some extent for processes such as film damping and whitecapping and could potentially explain the spread of wind-speed based transfer velocities published in the literature. We combine some of the principles of two recently published k pararneterizations [Glover, D.M., Frew, N.M., McCue, S.J. and Bock, E.J., 2002. A multiyear time series of global gas transfer velocity from the TOPEX dual frequency, normalized radar backscatter algorithm. In: Donelan, M.A., Drennan, W.M., Saltzman, E.S., and Warminkhof, R. (Eds.), Gas Transfer at Water Surfaces, Geophys. Monograph 127. AGU,Washington, DC, 325-331; Woolf, D.K., 2005. Parameterization of gas transfer velocities and sea-state dependent wave breaking. Tellus, 5713: 87-94] to calculate k as the sum of a linear function of total mean square slope of the sea surface and a wave breaking parameter. This separates contributions from direct and bubble-mediated gas transfer as suggested by Woolf [Woolf, D.K., 2005. Parameterization of gas transfer velocities and sea-state dependent wave breaking. Tellus, 5713: 87-94] and allows us to quantify contributions from these two processes independently. We then apply our parameterization to a monthly TOPEX altimeter gridded 1.5 degrees x 1.5 degrees data set and compare our results to transfer velocities calculated using the popular wind-based k parameterizations by Wanninkhof [Wanninkhof, R., 1992. Relationship between wind speed and gas exchange over the ocean. J. Geophys. Res., 97: 7373-7382.] and Warminkhof and McGillis [Warminkhof R. and McGillis, W., 1999. A cubic relationship between air-sea CO2 exchange and wind speed. Geophys. Res. Lett., 26(13): 1889-1892]. We show that despite good agreement of the globally averaged transfer velocities, global and regional fluxes differ by up to 100%. These discrepancies are a result of different spatio-temporal distributions of the processes involved in the parameterizations of k, indicating the importance of wave field parameters and a need for further validation.

Fog research: A review of past achievements and future perspectives	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The scientific community that includes meteorologists, physical scientists, engineers, medical doctors, biologists, and environmentalists has shown interest in a better understanding of fog for years because of its effects on, directly or indirectly, the daily life of human beings. The total economic losses associated with the impact of the presence of fog on aviation, marine and land transportation can be comparable to those of tornadoes or, in some cases, winter storms and hurricanes. The number of articles including the word "fog'' in Journals of American Meteorological Society alone was found to be about 4700, indicating that there is substantial interest in this subject. In spite of this extensive body of work, our ability to accurately forecast/nowcast fog remains limited due to our incomplete understanding of the fog processes over various time and space scales. Fog processes involve droplet microphysics, aerosol chemistry, radiation, turbulence, large/small-scale dynamics, and surface conditions (e.g., partaining to the presence of ice, snow, liquid, plants, and various types of soil). This review paper summarizes past achievements related to the understanding of fog formation, development and decay, and in this respect, the analysis of observations and the development of forecasting models and remote sensing methods are discussed in detail. Finally, future perspectives for fog-related research are highlighted.

MAX-DOAS instruments can be relatively small, are easy to operate, and allow long-term automated operation. The MAX-DOAS technique also allows derivation of vertical aerosol and trace gas profiles in the troposphere and thus the monitoring of pollution aloft. However, this relatively new technique still requires validation to determine uncertainties, for example, introduced by the radiative transfer modeling needed to derive trace gas concentrations. Here we present MAX-DOAS measurements of NO2 and HCHO performed in the Gulf of Maine during the ICARTT campaign in summer 2004. O-4 measurements were performed to gain information on the vertical distribution of aerosols, which were used in radiative transfer calculations to convert the measured trace gas slant column densities to concentrations. The successful identification of an aerosol layer between 1 and 2 km altitude illustrates the potential for aerosol remote sensing. The comparison with LP DOAS measurements performed simultaneously shows that MAX-DOAS accurately measures trace gases that are well mixed within the boundary layer. MAX-DOAS measurements also provide valuable information on the vertical distribution of pollutants in and above the boundary layer, as demonstrated by the identification of elevated HCHO levels in a layer between 1 km and 2 km altitude. This phenomenon, which is associated with outflow of continental air from the American northeast, was not detected by in situ ground-based instruments.

J	Chami, M; Platel, MD				Chami, Malik; Platel, Michael Defoin			Sensitivity of the retrieval of the inherent optical properties of marine particles in coastal waters to the directional variations and the polarization of the reflectance	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The influences of the directional variations and the polarization of the marine reflectance on the retrieval of the inherent optical properties (IOP) (i.e., absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients) of water constituents in coastal waters are examined. First, an inversion algorithm based on artificial neural network (NN) methodology is developed using a synthetic data set. The simulations were carried out using a radiative transfer model that accounts for the polarization state of light in the ocean. The simulated data included various directional effects of the particles. The data set is also constrained by observations collected in optically representative coastal waters. In particular, the relationships that exist between the IOP were taken into account, thus making the data set realistic. The results showed that the total IOP were correctly retrieved while the performance of the algorithm to derive the IOP of each water component significantly degrades. However, the inclusion of the directional variations and the polarization of the reflectance in the algorithm improved the accuracy of retrieval of the scattering properties by 15% - 60% and 65% - 75%, respectively. The phytoplankton and noncovarying particles (i.e., nonalgal particles) scattering and backscattering coefficients were derived with an accuracy of 25% and 15% respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of using the polarized signal to separate the total IOP into contribution of biogenic and highly refractive particles in coastal waters. Therefore the development of in situ instrumentation able to measure the polarization properties of the particles is recommended.

J	Chami, M				Chami, Malik			Importance of the polarization in the retrieval of oceanic constituents from the remote sensing reflectance	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The influence of marine particles on the polarized radiation exiting the ocean is studied, and the implications for the retrieval of particulate concentration from remotely sensed data are investigated. Simulations were carried out using a vector radiative transfer model. Open ocean and coastal waters conditions were examined separately. In phytoplankton dominated waters, the polarized reflectance is virtually insensitive to the variations in chlorophyll concentration when observing at the top of atmosphere. The polarization effects induced by phytoplankton cells are too weak compared to those induced by the air-water interface and the atmospheric particles ( especially molecules) to significantly contribute to the polarized reflectance at this level of atmosphere. The use of the polarized information at short wavelengths is thus proposed to improve the retrieval of the spectral variation of the aerosol model in atmospheric correction algorithms. In coastal zones, the sensitivity of the polarized signal to the water content is much greater. The analysis demonstrates that the measurement of the polarized reflectance just above the sea surface may not be relevant to reduce the skylight reflection effects when the water mass is mainly dominated by highly refractive particles. It is shown that polarization measurements can be of great interest to separate the fraction of inorganic particles from biogenic cells. This study also highlights that an empirical-based inversion approach relying on the polarized reflectance measured in the green and at longer wavelengths could be efficient to retrieve the concentration of inorganic particles regardless of the phytoplankton content in coastal waters.

Dust absorption over the "Great Indian Desert" inferred using ground-based and satellite remote sensing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Mineral dust is the single largest contributor of natural aerosols over land. Dust aerosols exhibit high variability in their radiative effects because their composition varies locally. This arises because of the regional distinctiveness of the soil characteristics as well as the accumulation of other aerosol species, such as black carbon, on dust while airborne. To accurately estimate the climate impact of dust, spatial and temporal distribution of its radiative properties are essential. However, this is poorly understood over many regions of the world, including the Indian region. In this paper, infrared (IR) radiance (10.5 - 12.5 mu m) acquired from METEOSAT- 5 satellite ( similar to 5-km resolution) is used to retrieve dust aerosol characteristics over the "Great Indian Desert'' and adjacent regions. The infrared radiance depression on account of the presence of dust in the atmosphere has been used as an index of dust load, called the Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI). Simultaneous, ground-based spectral optical depths estimated at visible and near-infrared wavelengths ( using a multiwavelength solar radiometer) are used along with the IDDI to infer the dust absorption. The inferred single scattering albedo of dust was in the range of 0.88 - 0.94. We infer that dust over the Indian desert is of more absorbing nature ( compared with African dust). Seasonally, the absorption is least in summer and most in winter. The large dust absorption leads to lower atmospheric warming of 0.7 - 1.2 K day(-1).					Moorthy, K.

Towards the development of environmental indices for the Namibian shelf, with particular reference to fisheries management	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The Namibian Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources has the task of collecting and providing relevant oceanographic information for management of their fisheries. However, quality information is difficult to provide because of the complexity of the processes involved in the Namibian marine ecosystem. Nonetheless, there are oceanographic data available that can contribute to fisheries management by improving the general understanding of important oceanographic processes related to fisheries. The focus of this paper is on the development of simple environmental indices that can serve as a measurement or proxy of the state or intensity of certain important oceanographic processes or variables for temporal comparison. These indices relate to oceanographic processes such as up-welling, frontal movements, anoxic bottom conditions and biological indicators, which can be updated on a regular basis to provide a long-term perspective of the particular processes to management and marine scientists.																	1814-232X					MAY	2007	29	1					25	35		10.2989/AJMS.2007.29.1.2.67								WOS:000247419800002

Geological and geomorphological evolution of a sedimentary periglacial landscape in Northeast Siberia during the Late Quaternary	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A wide variety of environmental records is necessary for analysing and understanding the complex Late Quaternary dynamics of permafrost-dominated Arctic landscapes. A NE Siberian periglacial key region was studied in detail using sediment records, remote sensing data, and terrain modelling, all incorporated in a geographical information system (GIS). The study area consists of the Bykovsky Peninsula and the adjacent Khorogor Valley in the Kharaulakh Ridge situated a few kilometres southeast of the Lena Delta. In this study a comprehensive cryolithological database containing information from 176 sites was compiled. The information from these sites is based on the review of previously published borehole data, outcrop profiles, surface samples, and our own field data. These archives cover depositional records of three periods: from Pliocene to Early Pleistocene, the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene. The main sediment sequences on the Bykovsky Peninsula consist of up to 50 in thick ice-rich permafrost deposits (Ice Complex) that were accumulated during the Late Pleistocene. They were formed as a result of nival processes around extensive snowfields in the Kharaulakh Ridge, slope processes in these mountains (such as in the Khorogor Valley), and alluvial/proluvial sedimentation in a flat accumulation plain dominated by polygonal tundra in the mountain foreland (Bykovsky Peninsula). During the early to middle Holocene warming, a general landscape transformation occurred from an extensive Late Pleistocene accumulation plain to a strongly thermokarst-dominated relief dissected by numerous depressions. Thermokarst subsidence had an enormous influence on the periglacial hydrological patterns, the sediment deposition, and on the composition and distribution of habitats. Climate deterioration, lake drainage, and talik refreezing occurred during the middle to late Holocene. The investigated region was reached by the post-glacial sea level rise during the middle Holocene, triggering thermo-abrasion of ice-rich coasts and the marine inundation of thermokarst depressions.

Coupling ecology and GIS to evaluate efficacy of marine protected areas in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In order to properly determine the efficacy of marine protected areas ( MPAs), a seascape perspective that integrates ecosystem elements at the appropriate ecological scale is necessary. Over the past four decades, Hawaii has developed a system of 11 Marine Life Conservation Districts ( MLCDs) to conserve and replenish marine resources around the state. Initially established to provide opportunities for public interaction with the marine environment, these MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning MPA design and function using multiple discrete sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the effficacy of existing MLCDs using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Analysis of benthic cover validated the a priori classification of habitat types and provided justification for using these habitat strata to conduct stratified random sampling and analyses of fish habitat utilization patterns. Results showed that a number of. sh assemblage characteristics (e.g., species richness, biomass, diversity) vary among habitat types, but were significantly higher in MLCDs compared with adjacent. shed areas across all habitat types. Overall. sh biomass was 2.6 times greater in the MLCDs compared to open areas. In addition, apex predators and other species were more abundant and larger in the MLCDs, illustrating the effectiveness of these closures in conserving fish populations within their boundaries. Habitat type, protected area size, and level of protection from. shing were all important determinates of MLCD effectiveness with respect to their associated. sh assemblages. Although size of these protected areas was positively correlated with a number of. sh assemblage characteristics, all appear too small to have any measurable influence on the adjacent. shed areas. These protected areas were not designed for biodiversity conservation or. sheries enhancement yet still provide varying degrees of protection for. sh populations within their boundaries. Implementing this type of biogeographic process, using remote sensing technology and sampling across the range of habitats present within the seascape, provides a robust evaluation of existing MPAs and can help to de. ne ecologically relevant boundaries for future MPA design in a range of locations.																	1051-0761					APR	2007	17	3					715	730		10.1890/06-0536								WOS:000245744500008	17494391

Spectral reflectance of the seagrasses: Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme and five marine algae	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Spectral reflectance of three Western Atlantic subtropical/tropical dominant benthic seagrasses (Thalassia testudinum, Halodule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme) measured in the laboratory by UNIspec Spectral Analysis system over 400-1000 nm are compared to five Western Atlantic dominant benthic and intertidal algae (Fucus vesiculosus, Ulva lactuca, Halimeda incrassata, Udotea flabellum and Penicillus capitatus). Thalassia spectra are also compared to previously studied forest species, showing that the spectral reflectance signature of Thalassia was of the same general shape as forest species, but of lesser peak height (18% vs 28-50%) in the 750-759 nm range. For marine plants, near-infrared reflectance of Thalassia, Syringodium and Halodule was intermediate (18%) between the ubiquitous green alga Ulva (15%) and the temperate brown alga, Fucus (27%). The brown alga had a unique spectral signature in the first difference spectrum (three secondary peaks at differing spectral values than the other species' secondary peaks). Comparisons between Halodule, Syringodium and Thalassia near-infrared peaks and Halimeda (58%), Penicillus (29%) and Udotea (42%), subtropical/tropical algae, were also carried out. Halimeda differed most from the other green algae in terms of numerous oscillations from 450 to 700 nm seen in the first difference spectrum. The three seagrasses were similar in spectral reflectance curve shape to one another but differed somewhat in peak height. The first difference spectrum was helpful in pointing out subtle differences among the species and between algae and seagrass. Spectral reflectance data such as those presented here appear potentially useful for remote sensing of shallow habitats, and may additionally be used to monitor their health.

Aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent climatology at El Arenosillo AERONET site (Huelva, Spain)	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Routine aerosol measurements have been carried out at INTA-E1 Arenosillo (Huelva, Spain) since February 2000 with a Cimel sun photometer integrated in the global aerosol monitoring network AERONET. A 5-year aerosol database allows characterization and classification of aerosol properties, which define the local aerosol climatology. In this work two basic parameters for aerosol characterization, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom exponent, a, are used for aerosol analysis. The mean AOD is 0.18 (+/- 0.14) and the mean a is 1.05 (+/- 0.43). The AOD presents two peaks during the year, at the end of the winter and during the summer, which are related to the seasonal patterns of the desert dust aerosols which arrive at the south-western Iberian Peninsula from North Africa. The angstrom ngstrom exponent presents two frequency modes, related to the two main aerosol types present at El Arenosillo: coastal marine aerosols and desert dust. A main aerosol scenario (66% of data) is defined as coastal marine aerosols, with the influence of local sources of continental and polluted aerosols. Continental aerosols are present in 11% of cases, while the desert dust has a very relevant occurrence in around 20% of the data.

J	Borg, LA; Bennartz, R				Borg, Lori A.; Bennartz, Ralf			Vertical structure of stratiform marine boundary layer clouds and its impact on cloud albedo	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												One year of passive microwave as well as near infrared remote sensing observations of cloud liquid water path (LWP) are used to study stratiform marine boundary layer clouds on a large scale. Good agreement between the two different remote sensing estimates of LWP was found for values below 150 g/m(2), if the clouds were assumed to be stratified vertically. For higher values of LWP the near infrared observations show a lower LWP than the passive microwave observations. Theoretical calculations of cloud albedo suggest a potentially significant underestimation of cloud albedo if, for a given LWP, clouds are assumed to be vertically homogeneous. The results presented in this study bear significance especially for climate studies. Of particular relevance is the conclusion that also at the large scale marine boundary layer clouds need to be regarded as being vertically adiabatically or sub-adiabatically stratified.

J	Defoin-Platel, M; Chami, M				Defoin-Platel, Michael; Chami, Malik			How ambiguous is the inverse problem of ocean color in coastal waters?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The inverse problem of ocean color consists in deriving the inherent optical properties (IOP) of marine particles from a reflectance spectrum measured at the sea surface. Such a problem is ill-posed or ambiguous because of the nonuniqueness of the solution; that is, several combinations of IOP values can lead to a unique reflectance spectrum. Currently, great efforts are made in the development of inverse methods to accurately retrieve the IOPs. However, many fewer studies have been devoted to the analysis of the ambiguities, which affect yet the error on the IOPs retrieval. In this paper, the ambiguities related to the ocean color problem in coastal waters are characterized and their implications for inverse modeling are studied. A synthetic data set is created on the basis of radiative transfer modeling. The simulations are constrained using in situ observations and statistical rules to make the data set realistic. The ambiguity rate of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) spectra is around 90%, thus meaning that the ocean color problem is extremely ambiguous. The influence of the ambiguities on the IOPs retrieval is evaluated. It is demonstrated that the error that is ascribed to the occurrence of ambiguity is equal to the dispersion of all the plausible IOPs solutions. The ambiguity error made on the total absorption coefficient is shown to be greater in highly absorbing water mass. On the other hand, the ambiguity error made on the total backscattering coefficient is higher in turbid scattering waters. Finally, different strategies to reduce the effects of ambiguities are discussed.

Globally, bivalves have higher production than any other cultured animal. Large populations of natural, invasive, and cultured bivalves are suggested to cause changes in coastal ecosystem function through suspension-feeding of particles and biodeposition of waste materials. Association of bivalves with particle depletion is a trophic tenet of coastal ecosystems, but there are no previous observations of this process except at small scales. Using airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, we show direct evidence of aquaculture impacts at the ecosystem scale (kilometres), documenting significant depletion of phytoplankton through a blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) farm in eastern Canada, compared with dispersion in circulation model results without mussels. Understanding of factors controlling primary production and ecosystem processes in the coastal zone is critical in light of growing reliance on this region for development and resource extraction worldwide.																	0706-652X					MAR	2007	64	3					387	390		10.1139/F07-021								WOS:000246188700001

Towards remote sensing of sediment thickness and depth to bedrock in shallow seawater using airborne TEM	EXPLORATION GEOPHYSICS					18th ASEG Geophysical Conference and Exhibition	JUL, 2006	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Australian Soc Explorat Geophysicists				Following a successful bathymetric mapping demonstration in a previous study, the potential of airborne EM for seafloor characterisation has been investigated. The sediment thickness inferred from ID inversion of helicopter-borne time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) data has been compared with estimates based on marine seismic studies. Generally, the two estimates of sediment thickness, and hence depth to resistive bedrock, were in reasonable agreement when the seawater was similar to 20 m deep and the sediment was less than similar to 40 m thick,. Inversion of noisy synthetic data showed that recovered models closely resemble the true models, even when the starting model is dissimilar to the true model, in keeping with the uniqueness theorem for EM soundings. The standard deviations associated with shallow seawater depths inferred from noisy synthetic data are about +/- 15% of depth, comparable with the errors of approximately +/- 1 m arising during inversion of real data. The corresponding uncertainty in depth-to-bedrock estimates, based on synthetic data inversion, is of order of +/- 10%. The mean inverted depths of both seawater and sediment inferred from noisy synthetic data are accurate to similar to 1 m, illustrating the improvement in accuracy resulting from stacking. It is concluded that a carefully calibrated airborne TEM system has potential for surveying sediment thickness and bedrock topography, and for characterising seafloor resistivity in shallow coastal waters.																	0812-3985					MAR	2007	38	1					77	88		10.1071/EG07006								WOS:000254873700009

Chief among these is the potential for methane hydrate to serve as a significant new resource to help meet longterm energy demands. To address this and other questions, the Methane Hydrate R&D Act of 2000 was enacted-promoting unprecedented collaboration between six federal agencies and enabling 5 years of government-industry-academia R&D partnerships. This article will discuss significant developments that emerged during the period 2001-2005 that sharpened the focus of R&D into methane hydrate's resource potential, including (1) the improved ability to conduct laboratory studies using samples that more closely replicate in-situ conditions and natural processes; (2) the increased recognition and documentation of the complexity of natural hydrate systems; (3) the increasing ability to directly detect hydrates through remote sensing; (4) the emerging transition from reliance on in-place numbers to more relevant estimates of recoverability; (5) a focus on hydrates within porous and permeable strata, whether in arctic or marine settings, and (6) the emergence of the first validated and publicly-available reservoir simulators.

Extraction of photosynthesis-irradiance parameters from phytoplankton production data: demonstration in various aquatic systems	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A method is presented for extraction of the photognthesis-response Parameters from Profiles of phyloplankton production. The procedure, previously proposed but not tested, is implemented here in various types of aquatic system and a protocol is established for its use. Values of daily primary production integrated over the photic zone were estimated from in situ or simulated in situ incubations in four coastal and open-ocean marine systems, and from photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) curves in the afore-mentioned marine systems, as well as in two freshwater systems. The slope of the measured daily water-column production (normalised to water-column chlorophyll a biomass) plotted against the daily incident irradiance was variable from system to system (0. 09 to 0. 60), showing a broader range than previously reported values. Using an iterative procedure, we estimated the photosynthetic parameters from this linear relationship. Generally, estimated values lie within the 95% confidence interval of the photoynthetic parameters obtained from the P-E curves, showing that the estimates agree well with measurements. The new method, based on the photo-physiological response of the phytoplankton community, provides a way to enhance our ability to compute primary production from remote sensing of ocean colour.																	0142-7873					MAR	2007	29	3					249	262		10.1093/plankt/fbm012								WOS:000246370500003

Michael			Modification of the atmospheric boundary layer by a small island: observations from Nauru	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Nauru, a small island in the tropical Pacific, generates cloud plumes that may grow to over 100-km lengths. This study uses observations to examine the mesoscale disturbance of the marine atmospheric boundary layer by the island that produces these cloud plumes. Observations of the surface layer were made from two ships in the vicinity of Nauru and from instruments on the island. The structure of the atmospheric boundary layer over the island was investigated using aircraft flights. Cloud production over Nauru was examined using remote sensing instruments. The diurnal cycles of surface meteorology and radiation are characterized at a point near the west (downwind) coast of Nauru. The spatial variation of surface meteorology and radiation are also examined using surface and aircraft measurements. During the day, the island surface layer is warmer than the marine surface layer and wind speed is tower than over the ocean. Surface heating forces the growth of a thermal internal boundary layer, within which a plume of cumulus clouds forms. Cloud production begins early in the morning over the ocean near the island's lee shore; as heating intensifies during the day, cloud production moves upwind over Nauru. These clouds form a plume that may extend over 100 km downwind of Nauru. Aircraft observations showed that a plume of warm, dry air develops over the island that extends 15-20 km downwind before dissipating. Limited observations suggest that the cloud plume may be sustained farther downwind of Nauru by a pair of convective rolls. Suggestions for further investigation of the cloud plume are made.																	0027-0644					MAR	2007	135	3					891	905		10.1175/MWR3319.1								WOS:000245214600011

Passive acoustic tomography: new concepts and applications using marine mammals	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												This paper presents the new concept of passive acoustic tomography which allows ocean data collection with a passive acoustic remote sensing process. The originality lies in using acoustic sources of opportunity such as surface noise, radiated ship noise and marine mammal calls. Such use, of passive tomography is a promising way to reduce acoustic emissions in oceans. A review is first presented, including the description of new concepts of covert active, assisted passive and autonomous tomography, followed by applications oil real world data. Under the assumptions of multipath propagation and measurements performed by a sparse network of hydrophones, a time-frequency processor is proposed to simultaueously estimate the source location and the impulse response of the propagation channel for marine mammal calls used as Opportunistic Sources (multipath structure, time delay and attenuation are estimated). Promising results are obtained on real data coming from the Laurentian channel where wideband beluga calls (1 to 3 kHz) are measured by a sparse network of 6 bottom hydrophones.																	0025-3154					FEB	2007	87	1			SI		5	10		10.1017/S0025315407054872								WOS:000245142700002

Recent arena experiments indicated an involvement of magnetic cues in juvenile turtles' homing ability after simulated displacements [4, 5], but the actual role of geomagnetic information in guiding turtles navigating in their natural environment has remained beyond the reach of experimental investigations. In the present experiment, twenty satellite-tracked green turtles (Chelonia mydas) were transported to four open-sea release sites 100-120 km from their nesting beach on Mayotte island in the Mozambique Channel; 13 of them had magnets attached to their head [6] either during the outward journey or during the homing trip. All but one turtle safely returned to Mayotte to complete their egg-laying cycle, albeit with indirect routes, and showed a general inability to take into account the deflecting action of ocean currents as estimated through remote-sensing oceanographic measurements [7]. Magnetically treated turtles displayed a significant lengthening of their homing paths with respect to controls, either when treated during transportation or when treated during homing. These findings represent the first field evidence for the involvement of geomagnetic cues in sea-turtle navigation.

The ecosystem of corals is rich in biodiversity. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for categorizing coral reefs and is the most cost - effective approach for the large - scale reef survey. The Dongsha Atoll, more than 300 km(2) with an average depth of 10 m, is located at the northern continental margin of the South China Sea. It has been abused by destructive fishing during recent decades. Three satellite imageries (Quickbird2, ETM + and SPOT5) are used to evaluate the capabilities of SPOT5 imagery to provide data that are useful for categorizing the current distribution of coral reefs therein. During the data processing, unsupervised classification functions are adopted for ETM + and SPOT5 data, while the supervised classification method is used for Quickbird2. The classes are (or not) merged into coral reef, and then will be operated by vectorization, simplification, and topological analysis. There are 1 331 coral reefs larger than 100 m(2) with a detection limit of 3 x 3 pixels at the multi - band data of Quickbird2, which is taken as the comparison baseline. The results extracted from SPOT5 and ETM images are less in number and area than those from the Quickbird2 image, whereas the results from SPOT5 data are better than those of ETM data at the silty lagoon due to its higher resolution. SPOT5 XS band 2 fails to distinguish the deep substrate inside the atoll compared with ETM data because of its poor penetration capability. Only SPOT XS band 1 cannot be used to differentiate coral reef from sand bottom. Merging the SPOT5 multi - bands data with the spatial resolution of SPOT5 pan - data and referring to ETM imagery are expected to provide an optimal satellite - based approach for mapping of coral reefs.																	0253-505X						2007	26	2					26	35										WOS:000246032600003

Estimation of the oceanic pCO(2) in the North Atlantic from VOS lines in-situ measurements: parameters needed to generate seasonally mean maps	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												Automated instruments on board Volunteer Observing Ships (VOS) have provided high-frequency pCO(2) measurements over basin-wide regions for a decade or so. In order to estimate regional air-sea CO2 fluxes, it is necessary to interpolate between in-situ measurements to obtain maps of the marine pCO(2). Such an interpolation remains, however, a difficult task because VOS lines are too distant from each other to capture the high pCO(2) variability. Relevant physical parameters available at large scale are thus necessary to serve as a guide to estimate the pCO(2) values between the VOS lines. Satellites do not measure pCO(2) but they give access to parameters related to the processes that control its variability, such as sea surface temperature (SST). In this paper we developed a method to compute pCO(2) maps using satellite data (SST and CHL, the chlorophyll concentration), combined with a climatology of the mixed-layer depth (MLD). Using 15 401 measurements of surface pCO(2) acquired in the North Atlantic between UK and Jamaica, between June 1994 and August 1995, we show that the parameterization of pCO(2) as a function of SST, CHL and MLD yields more realistic pCO(2) values than parameterizations that have been widely used in the past, based on SST, latitude, longitude or SST only. This parameterization was then used to generate seasonal maps of pCO(2) over the North Atlantic. Results show that our approach yields the best marine pCO(2) estimates, both in terms of absolute accuracy, when compared with an independent data set, and of geographical patterns, when compared to the climatology of Takahashi et al. (2002). This suggests that monitoring the seasonal variability of pCO(2) over basin-wide regions is possible, provided that sufficient VOS lines are available.																	0992-7689						2007	25	11					2247	2257		10.5194/angeo-25-2247-2007								WOS:000251998900001

Changes in the coastal zone of Abu Dhabi determined using satellite imagery (1972-2003)	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					1st International Conference on the State of the Gulf Ecosystems	MAR 05-07, 2006	Al Ain, U ARAB EMIRATES					The coastal and marine resources of Abu Dhabi have sustained the local inhabitants for thousands of years. However, rapid development following the discovery and exploitation of mineral oil reserves in the second half of the 20th Century changed the intensity and use of the natural resources. Changes in coastal geomorphology, land use and vegetation were documented using remote sensed images covering the period from 1972 to 2003. The study indicated that there have been major geomorphologic and land use changes within the coastal zone of Abu Dhabi as a result of urban and industrial development. Vegetation, both cultivated and intertidal, has increased within the study period. The data collected emphasises the urgency for developing sustain able coastal management strategies in Abu Dhabi and the region.																	1463-4988						2007	10	3					301	308		10.1080/14634980701512988								WOS:000249606800008

A meteorological overview of the MILAGRO field campaigns	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We describe the large-scale meteorological conditions that affected atmospheric chemistry over Mexico during March 2006 when several field campaigns were conducted in the region. In-situ and remote-sensing instrumentation was deployed to obtain measurements of wind, temperature, and humidity profiles in the boundary layer and free atmosphere at four primary sampling sites in central Mexico. Several models were run operationally during the field campaign to provide forecasts of the local, regional, and synoptic meteorology as well as the predicted location of the Mexico City pollutant plume for aircraft flight planning purposes. Field campaign measurements and large-scale analyses are used to define three regimes that characterize the overall meteorological conditions: the first regime prior to 14 March, the second regime between 14 and 23 March, and the third regime after 23 March. Mostly sunny and dry conditions with periods of cirrus and marine stratus along the coast occurred during the first regime. The beginning of the second regime was characterized by a sharp increase in humidity over the central plateau and the development of late afternoon convection associated with the passage of a weak cold surge on 14 March. Over the next several days, the atmosphere over the central plateau became drier so that deep convection gradually diminished. The third regime began with the passage of a strong cold surge that lead to humidity, afternoon convection, and precipitation over the central plateau that was higher than during the second regime. The frequency and intensity of fires, as determined by satellite measurements, also diminished significantly after the third cold surge. The synoptic-scale flow patterns that govern the transport of pollutants in the region are described and compared to previous March periods to put the transport into a climatological context. The complex terrain surrounding Mexico City produces local and regional circulations that govern short-range transport; however, the mean synoptic conditions modulate the thermally-driven circulations and on several days the near-surface flow is coupled to the ambient winds aloft.

J	Guo, W; Li, SH; Mao, L; Yin, Y; Zhu, DK				Guo Wei; Li Shu-heng; Mao Liang; Yin Yong; Zhu Da-kui			A model for environmental impact assessment of land reclamation	CHINA OCEAN ENGINEERING												Land reclamation is a complex marine environmental engineering and has a huge impact on social, economic, and physical environment. Reclamation environmental impact assessment (REIA) is also a complicated project, including the assessment of social economic background, ocean engineering, coastal geomorphology, sediment transportation, marine hydrodynamics and marine ecosystem and so on. Nowadays, a large number of land reclaimed projects have been carried out or in the process of construction along the coastal zone, thus, it is necessary to build up a framework on REM to evaluate and quantify the environmental changes, to contribute to reclamation program, to reduce marine environmental disasters, and to sustain development of coastal zone. This article focuses on the research of RELA framework theory and puts forward a REIA model on land reclaimed evaluation, at the same time, applies this assessment system in Shenzhen City, which is a highly developed coastal city with an expectation of land reclamation. By use of the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, along with the topographic map and in situ survey in reclamation area, it concludes that the area of 2680 hectares in total has been reclaimed in Shenzhen city by the end of the year 2000. Thus, reclamation is usually applied to meet the needs for infrastructure, such as harbors, industries and highways in Shenzhen City. However, some serious negative impacts have been created to the coastal environment shown clearly in the following aspects. Firstly, it caused the dramatic changes of tidal flat and channels along the western coast, made this area more unstable, which is threatening the function of the harbor in this area. Secondly, Tidal prism has decreased rapidly. During the 20 years of reclamation, the tidal prism has been reduced by 20% similar to 30% along the western coast in the Lngdingyang Estuary, and 15.6% in the Shenzhen Bay. As a result, the velocity of the tidal current has also declined, and the direction of the tidal current has changed, which is harmful to the dilution and diffusion process of the contaminants. Thirdly, it has threatened the eco-environment finally., More than 147 hectares of mangrove area along the coast of Shenzhen Bay, accounting for 48.8% of the total mangrove reserve area in this region, has been reclaimed only during the short period from 1988 to 2000. Thus, the biodiversity is decreasing, and more and more plants and animals are disappearing. Based on the above analyses of the environmental impacts, strategies and suggestions for the future reclamation in this area have been put forward in order to support the sustainable development of the coastal zone.																	0890-5487						2007	21	2					343	354										WOS:000247856500014

These high-chlorophyll a waters have lower temperatures than those of surrounding waters, indicating vertical mixing of nutrient-rich subsurface water that is attributable to the topographical features of the Sulu Ridge. Differences in photosynthetic parameters, primary productivity and the phytoplankton community structure between the high-chlorophyll area near the Sulu Archipelago and the oligotrophic basin area in the Philippine, Sulu and Celebes seas were investigated in November 2002 during the R.V. Hakuho-Maru KH-02-4 cruise. Entrainment of subsurface water and vertical mixing by intense tidal flow from the Sulu Archipelago to the Celebes Sea created a low-temperature, high-nutrient condition at the southeastern edge of the Sulu Ridge. Chlorophyll a concentrations greater than 2 mu g l(-1) were observed at stations 5-15 km offshore at the edge of the Sulu Ridge. This high-chlorophyll tongue in the Celebes Sea showed high primary productivity: it was 1.6-18 times higher than those measured in oligotrophic central basin regions of the Philippine, Sulu, and Celebes seas. Microscopic observation of these high-chlorophyll waters showed the dominance of chain-forming large centric diatoms. Extension of high-chlorophyll waters was not observed at the Sulu Sea side, where the surface water salinity was lower than in the Celebes Sea and consequently prevented intrusion of the Celebes Sea water into the surface layer. Occasional extensions of productive, chlorophyll-rich surface water from the archipelagic zone to the surrounding basin area seems to be an important factor causing spatiotemporal variability in the phytoplankton biomass in the southern Sulu Sea and the western Celebes Sea.

They allow precise delineation of bottom habitats, thus limit the number of representative biological sampling sites. the time of expedition and its costs. Remote sensing can be applied to assess the bottom biota resources, e.g.. range of occurrence of underwater meadows or Mussel beds.

Remote sensing methods were used in biodiversity studies on the coastal and open-sea stony reels as well as for elaboration of assessment methods of macrophytes meadows in the Puck Bay. The results proved the efficiency of the method in biodiversity studies; however, selective algorithms for multi-species underwater meadows assessment require further development.																	0324-8828						2007	33	2					193	204										WOS:000255332500021

Wayne			Relationships between reef fish communities and remotely sensed rugosity measurements in Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The realization that coral reef ecosystem management must occur across multiple spatial scales and habitat types has led scientists and resource managers to seek variables that are easily measured over large areas and correlate well with reef resources. Here we investigate the utility of new technology in airborne laser surveying (NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL)) in assessing topographical complexity (rugosity) to predict reef fish community structure on shallow (< 10 m deep) patch reefs. Marine portions of Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, were surveyed remotely using the EAARL, and reef fish populations were visually surveyed on 10 patch reefs at independent, randomly selected stations (n = 10-13 per reef). Rugosity at each station was assessed in situ by divers using the traditional chain-transect method (10-m scale), and remotely using the EAARL submarine topography data at multiple spatial scales (2, 5, and 10 m). The rugosity and biological datasets were analyzed together to elucidate the predictive power of EAARL rugosity in describing the variance in reef fish community variables and to assess the correlation between chain-transect and EAARL rugosity. EAARL rugosity was not well correlated with chain-transect rugosity, or with species richness of fishes (although statistically significant, the amount of variance explained by the model was very low). Variance in reef fish community attributes was better explained in reef-by-reef variability than by physical variables. However, once the reef-by-reef variability was taken into account in a two-way analysis of variance, the importance of rugosity could be seen on individual reefs. Fish species richness and abundance were statistically higher at high rugosity stations compared to medium and low rugosity stations, as predicted by prior ecological research. The EAARL shows promise as an important mapping tool for reef resource managers as they strive to inventory and protect coral reef resources.

Flow-field observations of a tidally driven island wake used by marine mammals in the Bay of Fundy, Canada	FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY												Correlations between fine-scale oceanographic features and aggregations of marine mammals are frequently reported, but the physical forces shaping these relationships are rarely explored. We conducted a series of oceanographic observations and remote sensing surveys of an oceanographic feature near Grand Manan Island known to attract marine mammals on flood tides. We tracked drift drogues from cliff-top with a theodolite and conducted box-type surveys with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) to assess flow patterns within the oceanographic feature. The feature was also visualized with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes. Drift drogues were advected towards a shear line originating near the northern tip of the island and entrained in one or more eddies downstream. ADCP surveys confirmed the presence of the shear line between rapid easterly flow and slower return flow. As the tide progressed, the shear line extended and manifested a single anti-cyclonic eddy at its distal end. As the flood tide progressed, northerly flow along the eastern shore of the island intensified and deflected the shear line northwards, shedding the eddy at slack high water. SAR images confirmed the presence of the shearline and eddy system, illustrating the evolution of a wake behind the island on flood tides. Profiles of flow direction and acoustic backscatter revealed secondary flows within the wake consistent with models and observations of other wakes. Oceanographic and remote sensing observations confirm that an island wake is generated by tidal flow past Grand Manan Island and provide an ecological context for the predictable aggregations of odontocete and mysticete cetaceans observed foraging within this region.																	1054-6006						2007	16	5					422	435		10.1111/j.1365-2419.2007.00444.x								WOS:000248958900003

For both years, field data were used to classify image pixels on a semi-quantitative scale based mainly on coral cover. The resulting substrate maps had overall classification accuracies of 78% and 81%, respectively. Change was estimated for each zone using a post-classification comparison. Results indicated an increase in live coral cover in one zone, a decrease in two other zones, and no change in the remaining six zones. The results show no obvious influence of the MPA's zonation plan on changes in live coral cover in the three year period investigated, and the study demonstrates the use of remote sensing to determine change in live coral cover, to assess zonation effectiveness, and to guide management efforts.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 77 - 81. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 Since 2003, a monitoring network of the dynamics of sandy beaches has been in operation in three tropical sites: Martinique (French West Indies), Tahiti and Moorea (French Polynesia) and Mayotte (Mozambique Channel). The objective of this network is to measure the impact of extreme weather-related marine events (storms, cyclones, strong swells, surges ...) on beaches with varied structural settings and sedimentary environments. The methodology consists in the installation of observatories on the dynamics of sandy beaches in different morphological and sedimentary contexts. A "state zero" is established from a combination of satellite imagery, low altitude digital imagery and topographic and hydrodynamic measurements. These measurements are reiterated after an extreme event in order to apprehend the importance of morphological change, impact dampening and recovery. The monitoring is then continued over regular intervals with the aim of determining rates of morphological and sediment budget recovery until equilibrium is restored. This experimental network design will subsequently be extended to other tropical beaches located on the propagation paths of cyclones.																	0749-0208						2007					50		77	81										WOS:000207860300016

An integrated approach is used, utilizing a GIS database to combine remote sensing techniques such as multi-beam sonar and underwater video capture, with physical sampling of the soft sediments using sediment grab samples and infaunal organism identification. Soft sediment habitats, comprised of fine silty and muddy sediments with low organic contents, are determined to be the most suitable benthic environments above which to site suspended bivalve aquaculture.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50 (Proceedings of the 9th International Coastal Symposium), 427 - 431. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 Wave data are needed in coastal areas to help increase safety of ship navigation and improve coastal protection strategies. In recent years, remote sensing of surface waves and currents became a powerful tool, especially in areas with high spatial and temporal variability. The data discussed in this paper was measured with the wave monitoring system WaMoS II. This system is based on a standard marine X-band radar and can be operated from platforms, coastal buildings and from moving vessels. In contrast to wave buoys, this kind of data covers a rather large area with high temporal and spatial resolution. This paper presents data obtained from the island of Sylt, Germany and from the entrance to Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne, Australia. Both regions are characterised by a complex bottom topography that leads to a highly spatially variable wave field. For the Sylt data, examples of wave transformation such as refraction, shoaling and dissipation are described and quantified. The Melbourne data is described qualitatively showing the abilities of area covering wave measurements over such a complex topography.																	0749-0208						2007					50		427	431										WOS:000207860300082

Computation of primary production from remote sensing of ocean colour at the northwestern Atlantic C-SOLAS Lagrangian site	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												At the C-SOLAS Lagrangian Study site, the phytoplankton community was dominated by diatoms in declining bloom conditions, which were characterised by a decrease in primary production over time. Measurements of primary production were performed using photosynthesis-light experiments and simulated in situ incubations. Several methods were used to assign photosynthetic parameters for estimation of primary production from remote-sensing of ocean colour: (1) the nearest-neighbour method (NNM), (2) a temperature-dependent model, (3) an iterative approach to retrieve photosynthetic parameters from in situ measurements of phytoplankton production, and (4) average values of measured parameters. Owing to the declining status of the diatom population and its patchy distribution, the magnitude of primary production measured from in situ incubations was highly variable. Under bloom conditions, all methods underestimated production compared with results of simulated in situ measurements; however, the NNM provided the closest estimates to the in situ measurements. In the declining bloom phase, the NNM overestimated primary production, whereas the iterative method returned estimates of production in good agreement with the in situ observations. In conditions characterized by mixed-phytoplankton populations, the NNM returned estimates in agreement with the observations. A new method is proposed for classifying image pixels using criteria accessible to remote sensing, according to the phase of the diatom bloom (bloom versus declining conditions) and according to community composition (diatom versus mixed population). Upon separating the database used for parameter assignment into 2 parts, one representing the general phytoplankton community and the other representing declining diatom conditions, estimates of chlorophyll a-normalised water-column production were in good agreement with in situ observations.																	0171-8630						2007	352						27	38		10.3354/meps07223								WOS:000252795600004

Mean annual primary production (PP) derived from an ocean-color based model was highly contrasted among eco-regions, exceeding 500 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Marmara and North Seas but being less than 150 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Faroes, Adriatic-Ionian and Aegean-Levantine Seas. Fisheries production expressed in mean annual yield and primary production required to support catches (PPR) varied greatly among eco-regions, from 0.02 t km(-2) and 0.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for the oceanic northeast Atlantic eco-region to 6 t km(-2) and 130 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the Marmara Sea respectively. Linear regression models showed significant positive relationships between PP and yield as well as between PP and PPR, suggesting a strong linkage between marine productivity and fisheries production in European seas. Moreover, this bottom-up control appeared consistent over time: recent mean annual yield for the period 1998 to 2004 reflected the long-term yield averaged over the last 3 decades. We argue that such large-scale coupling is due to energy transfer along the food web (from phytoplankton to predators) through predation processes, primary productivity driving the production of living marine resources and their exploitation at the scale of eco-regions. Our findings have an important bearing for ecosystem approaches to fisheries, particularly for the estimation of the capacity of eco-regions with regard to sustainable exploitation. This is further relevant in a context of climate change, because variations in PP linked to global warming could strongly modify fisheries production in the future.

Chl a concentration increased in 2 areas after the typhoon: (1) An offshore bloom along Damrey's track exhibited a chl a peak (4 mg m(-3)) 5 d after the typhoon's passage. It was preceded by sea-surface cooling (-5 degrees C), mainly on the right side of the typhoon track, and sea-level decrease (-25 cm) along the typhoon track 1 d post-typhoon. The offshore bloom was due to nutrient increase from mixing and upwelling, (2) A nearshore chl a increase succeeded typhoon rain (> 300 mm on 26 September) on Hainan Island in the northwest SCS. In the bloom region, the water was rich in suspended sediments, phytoplankton, and colored dissolved organic matter, and was entrained by an eddy. This nearshore feature may have resulted from rainwater discharge and seaward advection by a typhoon-induced current. By these 2 mechanisms, both typhoon winds and rain can enhance production of marine phytoplankton.

Based on velocitywave-amplitude, an understanding is gained of the physical condition and structural characteristics of seafloor sediment, which is combined with other geological information of the sedimentary layer to synthetically discriminate the properties of seafloor sediment. Experimental results show that, by using the relationship between sound velocity, wave form envelope, amplitude shape and size, and such parameters as sedimentary structure, microstructure, bedding, grain composition, mineral composition, and physical-mechanics, etc., the basic properties of the shallow surface seafloor sediment in the experimental sea area can be discriminated and the burial depth of traces of ancient marine transgression and regression events in the borehole cores of seafloor sediment can be divided, thus making an attempt of and contribution to the practice of acoustically remote-sensing and telemetering seafloor sediment.																	1064-119X						2007	25	1					53	66		10.1080/10641190601177598								WOS:000244942800004

The monitoring of opportunistic macroalgal blooms for the water framework directive	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Among the various quality elements which the Water Framework Directive requires should be monitored are macroalgae. One aspect of these is the presence, in transitional waters particularly, of large blooms of opportunistic macroalgae, such as Ulva and Enteromorpha. Within the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (RoI) there are currently no set ecological quality objectives or standards for macroalgae. Nor are there standard methods for monitoring macroalgal blooms, although various combinations of aerial photography, remote sensing and measurements on the ground are used. This paper attempts to set a logical framework for the prioritisation of sites for monitoring, the development of a tiered monitoring procedure and the derivation of thresholds for classification. Draft threshold limits for percentage cover and biomass of macroalgae have been derived from the literature. The importance of secondary effects and physico-chemical parameters is discussed.

An experimental case study of the mean and turbulent characteristics of the vertical boundary layer over the sea	METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT												The main characteristics of the mean and turbulent vertical structure of the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) up to the height of 500 m are examined for an experimental case, using both remote and in situ sensing instrumentation. The observations indicate the existence of a very stable surface layer up to the height of 150-200 m followed by slightly stable to neutral conditions at higher levels, while a Low-Level Jet (LLJ) is developed, on the top of the intense surface based inversion. High values of the variance of the vertical wind component are observed at levels above the LLJ core, presumably associated with the shear forcing close to the LLJ. The plausible mechanism for the development of the LLJ is the inertial oscillation due to the frictional decoupling over the sea, which is associated with the strong stability of the MABL lower layer.																	0941-2948						2007	16	4					375	381		10.1127/0941-2948/2007/0215								WOS:000249320500007						
J	Sathyendranath, S; Platt, T				Sathyendranath, Shubha; Platt, Trevor			Spectral effects in bio-optical control on the ocean system	OCEANOLOGIA												The influence of phytoplankton on the spectral structure of the submarine irradiance field is reviewed. The implications for the ocean system of the spectral response by phytoplankton to the ambient light field are discussed. For example, it provides the basis for retrieval of phytoplankton biomass by visible spectral radiometry (ocean-colour remote sensing). In the computation of primary production, the results of spectral models differ in a known and systematic manner from those of non-spectral ones. The bias can be corrected without risk of incurring additional random errors. The models in use for phytoplankton growth, whether based oil available light or absorbed light, whether expressed ill terms of chlorophyll or carbon, are shown all to conform to the same basic formalism with the same parameters. Residual uncertainty lies less with the models than with the parameters required for their implementation. The submarine light field and the spectral characteristics of phytoplankton carry latent information on phytoplankton community structure. Differences in spectral response by different functional types of phytoplankton are small but significant. Optical considerations limit the maximum phytoplankton biomass that can be sustained in a given surface mixed layer. Moreover, the upper bound on the biomass depends on the spectral response of the dominant phytoplankton taxa. As a result, an optical control exists in the mixed layer that tends to resist extreme excursions of the biomass and also to maintain biodiversity in the phytoplankton.																	0078-3234						2007	49	1					5	39										WOS:000245706300001

Part 2: Accessory pigment distribution	OCEANOLOGIA												This is the second in a series of articles, the aim of which is to derive mathematical expressions describing the vertical distributions of the concentrations of different groups of phytoplankton pigments; these expressions are necessary in the Algorithms for the remote sensing of the marine ecosystem. It presents formulas for the vertical profiles of the following groups of accessory phytoplankton pigments: chlorophylls b, chlorophylls c, phycobilins, photosynthetic carotenoids and photoprotecting carotenoids, all for the uppermost layer of water in the Baltic Sea with an optical depth of inverted perpendicular approximate to 5. The mathematical expressions for the first four of these five groups of pigments; classified as photosynthetic pigments, enable their concentrations to be estimated at different optical depths in the sea from known surface concentrations of chlorophyll a. The precision of these estimates is characterised by the following relative statistical errors according to logarithmic statistics sigma(-): approximately 44% for chlorophyll b, approx. 39% for chlorophyll c, approx. 43% for phycobilins and approx. 45% for photosynthetic carotenoids. On the other hand, the mathematical expressions describing the vertical distributions of photoprotecting carotenoid concentrations enable these to be estimated at different depths in the sea also from known surface concentrations of chlorophyll a, but additionally from known values of the irradiance in the PAR spectral range at the sea surface, with a statistical error sigma(-) of approximately 42%.																	0078-3234						2007	49	4					491	511										WOS:000252294800003

The model formula is the product of the theoretical maximum quantum yield Phi(MAX) = 0.125 atomC quantum(-1) and five dimensionless factors f(i) taking values from 0 do l: Phi = Phi(MAX) f(a) f Delta f(c)(C-a(o)) f(c)(PAR(inh)) f E,t. To a sufficiently good approximation, each of these factors fi appears to be dependent on one or at most two environmental factors, such as temperature, underwater irradiance, surface concentration of chlorophyll a, absorption properties of phytoplankton and optical depth. These dependences have been determined for Baltic Case 2 waters. The quantum yield Phi; calculated from known values of these environmental factors, is then applicable in the model algorithm for the remote sensing of Baltic primary production. The statistical error of the approximate quantum yields Phi is 62%.																	0078-3234						2007	49	4					527	542										WOS:000252294800005						
J	Marrari, M; Hu, CM; Daly, K				Marrari, Marina; Hu, Chuanmin; Daly, Kendra			Validation of SeaWiFS chlorophyll a concentrations in the Southern Ocean: A revisit	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Surface chlorophyll a concentrations (C-a, mg m(-3)) in the Southern Ocean estimated from SeaWiFS satellite data have been reported in the literature to be significantly lower than those measured from in situ water samples using fluorometric methods. However, we found that high-resolution (similar to 1 km(2)/pixel) daily SeaWiFS C-a (C-a(SWF)) data (SeaDAS4.8, OC4v4 algorithm) was an accurate measure of in situ C-a during January-February of 1998-2002 if concurrent in situ data measured by HPLC (C-a(HPLC)) instead of fluorometric (C-a(Fluor)) measurements were used as ground truth. Our analyses indicate that C-a(Fluor) is 2.48 +/- 2.23 (n = 647) times greater than C-a(HPLC) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3) and that the percentage overestimation of in situ C, by fluorometric measurements increases with decreasing concentrations. The ratio of C-a(SWF)/C-a(PLC) is 1.12 +/- 0.91 (n = 96), whereas the ratio of C-a(SWF)/Ca-Fluor is 0.55 +/- 0.63 (n = 307). Furthermore, there is no significant bias in C-a(SWF) (12% and -0.07 in linear and log-transformed C-a, respectively) when C-a(HPLC) is used as ground truth instead of C-a(Fluor). The high C-a(Fluor)/C-a(HPLC) ratio may be attributed to the relatively low concentrations of chlorophyll b (C-b/C-a = 0.023 +/- 0.034, n = 482) and relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll c (C-c/C-a = 0.25 +/- 0.59, n = 482) in the phytoplankton pigment composition when compared to values from other regions. Because more than 90% of the waters in the study area, as well as in the entire Southern Ocean (south of 60 degrees S), have C-a(SWF) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3), we consider that the SeaWiFS performance of C-a retrieval is satisfactory and for this C-a range there is no need to further develop a "regional" bio-optical algorithm to account for the previous SeaWiFS "underestimation".

Comparison of radiometric quantities measured in water, above water and derived from seaWiFS imagery in the South Atlantic Bight, North Carolina, USA	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												This paper reports on an ongoing study to better understand the bio-optical properties of a portion of the South Atlantic Bight-the Cape Fear River (CFR) plume area and Onslow Bay (OB). Sampling mid-Onslow Bay provides a contrasting coastal system relatively un-impacted by the high dissolved organic matter-waters of the CFR. Data were obtained during regular research-cruise observations, from October 2001 to September 2003, using two different measurement systems: above-water and in-water radiometers. Measurements were performed in marine and estuarine waters optically classified as Cases I and 2, respectively, and under variable atmospheric conditions. A statistical comparison of both approaches was conducted in support of the validation of remote sensing data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and local algorithm development. Remote sensing reflectance was calculated at four wavelengths 412, 443, 490, and 555 nm, and results from the two in situ approaches and SeaWiFS were compared. The spectrally averaged unbiased percent difference between remote sensing reflectance derived from the two field instruments was greater than, 25%, in the best case. Radiometric quantities derived from field measurements (e.g. diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm and spectral remote sensing reflectance) were compared to available estimates from SeaWiFS images. The random mean square root error (RMSE) between field measurements and SeaWiFS estimates of the remote sensing reflectance ranged from 26.3% (at 555nm) to 52.9% (at 412 nm). The RMSE between field measurement and SeaWiFS estimates of K-d 490 was 34.3%. Because the spatial scale of in situ measurements (meters) differ greatly from that of SeaWiFS (kilometers), sub-pixel variability in field measurements was investigated. Our results suggest that factors other than sub-pixel variability are responsible for observed discrepancies between in situ and satellite-based remote sensing reflectance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In spite of frequent reports of floating weed covering extended areas in different parts of the world's ocean, this appears to be the first observation of Sargassum from space. Satellite observations were made with the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on the Envisat satellite launched by the European Space Agency, and subsequently with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) launched on both the Terra and Aqua satellites by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Both instruments cover wide swaths, providing near-daily images. Both have optical spectral bands in the range 670 to 750 nm, which detect the chlorophyll red-edge characteristic of land and marine vegetation, but only MERIS has a band at 709 nm, which was critical to the initial discovery. The combined satellite data from both sensors show the seasonal cycle of weed density in different areas of the Gulf. A wider ranging study is now needed to map its occurrence in other areas, including the Sargasso Sea (named for the weed, but not so far covered in our survey). The satellite observations suggest that Sargassum biomass is greater than previously estimated, and hence plays a more important part in oceanic productivity.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													0196-2892	1558-0644				DEC	2006	44	12					3619	3625		10.1109/TGRS.2006.882258								WOS:000242390700015

J	Menesguen, A; Gohin, F				Menesguen, Alain; Gohin, Francis			Observation and modelling of natural retention structures in the English Channel	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Accumulation of heat, or dissolved substances (nutrients, pollutants, etc.), or fine suspended particles in a water body is a key process in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and their resistance to perturbations. In complex and wide open environments such as marine ecosystems, net accumulation is not only linked to the local renewal capacity of the water body, but also to the partial recirculation of water due to convective cells of various sizes. The English Channel, which can be considered as mainly dominated by tidal movements, exhibits such a complex quasi-permanent long-term circulation, made of a central "river" bordered with a lot of nested gyres. Here, we show that structures visible on satellite images of SST (Sea Surface Temperature), chlorophyll and SPIM (Suspended Particulate Inorganic Matter) can be explained by steady state distributions of tracers having various half-life durations, which can be computed using a simple technique of regularly distributed micro-injection in the permanent flow field. Gyres induced by capes in open water appear to be retention areas, whereas gyres around islands (Channel Isles) appear to be strong disseminating areas, acting as slings. Moreover, SST satellite maps can be explained by a short-lived tracer during the "transitory" seasons (spring and autumn), and by a long-lived one during the "stable" seasons (summer and winter): long-term accumulation structures become apparent only in August and March. SPIM can be considered as a tracer injected only in muddy areas by the bottom friction caused by the swell, and having a half-life duration linked to the turbulent energy dissipation, which controls the settling rate; this succeeds to explain the observed turbidity in the central Channel essentially, as well as the striking asymmetry visible on images between the large turbid coastal band along the English coasts (materializing a natural long-term retention area), and the rather clear waters along the French coasts. The annual mean chlorophyll distribution in the Channel, as derived from satellite reflectance, can be simulated by a short-lived tracer injected proportionally to the mean light availability along the water column. Computing steady state distributions of various substances or particles in permanent circulation gives a simple and quick tool for understanding their mean stable distribution patterns in the oceans.

These missions will provide our first opportunity to spectroscopically study the global characteristics of those planets, and search for signs of habitability and life. We have used spatially and spectrally-resolved models to explore the observational sensitivity to changes in atmospheric and surface properties, and the detectability of surface biosignatures, in the globally averaged spectra and light-curves of the Earth. Atmospheric signatures of Earth-size exoplanets might be detected, in a near future, by stellar occultation as well. Detectability depends on planet's size, atmospheric composition, cloud cover and stellar type. According to our simulations, Earth's land vegetation signature (red-edge) is potentially visible in the disk-averaged spectra, even with cloud cover, and when the signal is averaged over the daily time scale. Marine vegetation is far more difficult to detect. We explored also the detectability of an exo-vegetation responsible for producing a signature that is red-shifted with respect to the Earth vegetation's one.

The problem is especially severe in the Baltic Sea where cyanobacterial blooms occur every summer covering areas of more than 100 000 km(2). We studied optical properties of several phytoplankton species (including cyanobacteria) present in the Baltic Sea region. The measurements results were used in a bio-optical model together with optical properties of other phytoplankton species from literature. Our results show that cyanobacteria have a characteristic double feature (peak at 650 nm and phycocyanin absorption feature near 630 nm) in their reflectance spectra which can be detected by remote sensing instruments. Our estimation for the open Baltic Sea waters shows that concentration of chlorophyll has to be 8-10 mg m(-3) before the double feature becomes detectable by remote sensing instruments which spectral resolution is 10 nm and signal-to-noise-ratio is 1000:1. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that remote sensing can be used for early warning of emerging potentially harmful blooms as chlorophyll concentrations higher than 4 mg m(-3) qualify as blooms here.

A systematic overestimation of GOME AOD was found, mainly due to the presence of clouds within the GOME field-of-view. In order to take the influence of clouds into account, a model which assumes a linear dependence of AOD on cloud fraction has been tested. This model was validated using independent measurements from different AERONET sites. The monthly averaged maps of corrected AOD show similar spatial behaviour to AVHRR and TOMS maps. The method proposed here produces monthly maps of AOD from GOME data. It is applicable on a statistical analysis (monthly) and is proved to be effective in regions with high AOD, but relatively large uncertainties remain for background marine conditions.

This paper is an illustration of how these measurements can be used to investigate whether 'state-of-the-art' atmospheric models are capable of adequately representing clouds. Here, we focus on shallow low-level clouds with a substantial amount of liquid water. In situ, ground-based and satellite remote sensing measurements were compared with the output of three non-hydrostatic regional models (Lokal-Modell, LM.- M&so-NH: fifth-generation Mesoscale Model, MM5) and two hydrostatic regional climate models (Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2, RACMO2; Rossby Centre Atmospheric Model, RCA). For the two selected days, Meso-NH and MM5 reproduce the measured vertical extent of the shallow clouds, but the liquid water content of the clouds is generally overestimated. In LM and the climate models the inversion is too weak and located at a level too close to the surface resulting in an overestimation of the vertical extent of the clouds. A sensitivity integration with RACM02 shows that the correspondence between model output and measurements can be improved by a doubling of the vertical resolution; this induces an increase in the modelled inversion strenath and cloud top pressure. LM and Meso-NH underestimate the lifetime of clouds. A comparison between model output and cloud cover derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) indicates that this deficiency is not due to advection of too small cloud systems,- it is rather due to an overestimation of the variability in the vertical velocity. All models overestimate the specific humidity near the surface and underestimate it at higher atmospheric levels, indicating that the models underestimate the mixing of moisture in the boundary layer. This deficiency is slightly reduced by inclusion of parameterised shallow convection in the non-hydrostatic models, which enhances the mixing of heat and moisture in the boundary layer. Consequently, the explicitly resolved updrafts weaken resulting in reduced condensation rates and lower liquid water path. The temporal variability of cloud occurrence is hardly affected by inclusion of parameterised shallow convection. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Box counting, horizontal structuring element, variation, and power spectrum algorithms are reviewed and applied to 1-D Takagi, Weierstrass-Mandelbrot, and fractional Brownian motion curves to show that none of them perform consistently with each other or accurately when the correct fractal dimension is known. A better understanding of their limitations is achieved through a sliding window analysis, a procedure that calculates local slopes for linear curve fits. A synergistic approach involving knowledge of algorithm limitations is suggested to make progress toward more reliable estimates of fractal dimension. Implications for cloud studies are considered in lieu of these results. Scale breaks in clouds are investigated to see how well each estimator detects changes from one scaling regime to another. Results are presented to illustrate the importance of correcting errors in the fractal dimension estimation process when modeling cloud radiance fields. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gilbert, A; Andrefouet, S; Yan, L; Remoissenet, G				Gilbert, Antoine; Andrefouet, Serge; Yan, Laurent; Remoissenet, Georges			The giant clam Tridacna maxima communities of three French Polynesia islands: comparison of their population sizes and structures at early stages of their exploitation	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Several lagoons of the atolls of Tuamotu Archipelago and volcanic islands of the Australes Archipelago (French Polynesia) are characterized by enormous populations of the clam Tri-dacna maxima, a species considered as endangered in many locations worldwide. Even if this resource can still be considered as virtually intact, the growing harvesting pressure to feed Tahiti's market (up to 50 t of wet matter y(-1)), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons, will soon call for management action to sustain a fishery that currently targets a large, virtually pristine stock. Hence, we present T maxima population sizes and structures for two atolls (Fangatau and Tatakoto) and one island (Tubuai), where high clam densities and population sizes have promoted a small-scale, but growing, commercial fishery since the late 1990s. We followed an earlier pilot study, in which a combination of remote sensing and in situ data provided an estimate of the Fangatau clam population size (23.6 +/- 5.3 million clams, mean 95% confidence interval, for 4.05 km(2) of mapped lagoon). We obtain 88.3 +/- 10.5 and 47.5 +/- 5.2 million clams for Tatakoto (mapped area of 11.46 km(2)) and Tubuai (mapped area of 16.3 km(2)), respectively. Accounting for contrasted length frequency distribution curves and one common size-weight relationship, the total biomasses are 1485 +/- 177 t, 1162 +/- 272 t, and 2173 +/- 232 t of commercial flesh for Tatakoto, Fangatau, and Tubuai, respectively. In addition, given the legal restriction on collecting clams smaller than 12 cm, the legally harvestable biomasses are 958 +/- 114 t, 1038 +/- 247 t, and 1971 +/- 210 t of flesh for Tatakoto, Fangatau, and Tubuai, respectively. The ratio between legal and total stock is much smaller for Tatakoto because this atoll is dominated by small clams, unlike the other two sites. The differences in population size and structure are discussed in terms of natural environment (habitats, degree of aperture to the ocean, temperature variations), providing insights on the natural variability between two similar systems (Tatakoto and Fangatau), and between different systems (the two atolls and the volcanic island of Tubuai), suggesting that future management schemes will have to be optimized locally.

J	Ramasamy, SM				Ramasamy, S. M.			Remote sensing and active tectonics of South India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The Indian Peninsula in general and its southern part in particular has been thought to be a stable shield area and hence inert to younger earth movements and seismicities. However, in addition to fast relapsing seismicities, the studies carried out by earlier workers during the past three decades indicate possible pulsatory tectonism, at least since the Jurassics. The present study is a newer attempt to identify, analyse, and spatially amalgamate a large number of anomalies visibly displayed by the tectonic, fluvial, coastal, and hydrological systems in remote sensing and ground based datasets/observations, and to finally paint a fair picture on the active tectonic scenario of South India. The study reveals that the phenomena, viz. extensive soil erosion, reservoir siltation, sediment dump into the ocean, preferential migration of rivers, restricted marine regression, shrinkage of back waters, withdrawal of creeks, fall of groundwater table, etc., indicate two E-W trending ongoing tectonic (Cymatogenic) archings along Mangalore-Chennai in the north and Cochin-Ramanathapuram in the south. Intervening these two arches, a cymatogenic deep along Ponnani-Palghat-Manamelkudi exhibiting phenomena opposite to the above is observed. In addition, the characteristic tectonic, geomorphic, and hydrological anomalies observed in 1B satellite FCC data, as well as in the field, indicate N-S trending extensional, NE-SW sinistral, and NW - SE dextral strike slip faults. These anomalies and the tectonic features deduced thereupon, indicate that the southern part of the Indian Peninsula is tectonically active due to the northerly to north-northeasterly directed compressive force related to post collision tectonics. This active tectonic model visualized for South India gives a further clue that the whole Indian plate is whirling like a worm with alternate E-W arching and deepening, along with block and transform faulting from Cape Comorin in the south to the Himalayas in																	0143-1161					OCT 20	2006	27	20					4397	4431		10.1080/01431160500502603								WOS:000241651200002						
J	Hennings, I; Herbers, D				Hennings, Ingo; Herbers, Dagmar			Radar imaging mechanism of marine sand waves at very low grazing angle illumination caused by unique hydrodynamic interactions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The investigations carried out between 2002 and 2004 during six field experiments within the Operational Radar and Optical Mapping in monitoring hydrodynamic, morphodynamic and environmental parameters for coastal management (OROMA) project aimed to improve the effectiveness of new remote sensing monitoring technologies such as shipborne imaging radars in coastal waters. The coastal monitoring radar of the GKSS Research Center, Geesthacht, Germany, is based on a Kelvin Hughes RSR 1000 X band (9.42 GHz) vertical (VV) polarized river radar and was mounted on board the research vessel Ludwig Prandtl during the experiments in the Lister Tief, a tidal inlet of the German Bight in the North Sea. The important progress realized in this investigation is the availability of calibrated X band radar data. Another central point of the study is to demonstrate the applicability of the quasi-specular scattering theory in combination with the weak hydrodynamic interaction theory for the radar imaging mechanism of the seabed. Radar data have been taken at very low grazing angles <= 2.6 degrees of flood and ebb tide-oriented sand wave signatures at the sea surface during ebb tidal current phases. Current speeds perpendicular to the sand wave crest <= 0.6 m s(-1) have been measured at wind speeds <= 4.5 m s(-1) and water depths <= 25 m. The difference between the maximum measured and simulated normalized radar cross section (NRCS) modulation of the ebb tide-oriented sand wave is 27%. For the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a difference of 21% has been calculated. The difference between the minimum measured and simulated NRCS modulation of the ebb tide-oriented sand wave is 10%, and for the flood tide-oriented sand wave, a value of 43% has been derived. Phases of measured and simulated NRCS modulations correspond to asymmetric sand wave slopes. The results of the simulated NRCS modulation show the qualitative trend but do not always quantitatively match the measured NRCS modulation profiles because the quasi-specular scattering theory at very low grazing angle is a first-order theory.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				OCT 20	2006	111	C10							C10008	10.1029/2005JC003302								WOS:000241696000003

Predicting the effects of habitat homogenization on marine biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Seafloor habitats throughout the world's oceans are being homogenized by physical disturbance. Even though seafloor sediments are commonly considered to be simple and unstructured ecosystems, the negative impacts of habitat homogenization are widespread because resident organisms create much of their habitat's structure. We combine the insight gained from remote sensing of seafloor habitats with recently developed analytical techniques to estimate species richness and assess the potential for change with habitat homogenization. Using habitat-dependent species-area relationships we show that realistic scenarios of habitat homogenization predict biodiversity losses when biogenic habitats in soft sediments are homogenized. We develop a simple model that highlights the degree to which the reductions in the number of species and functional diversity are related to the distribution across habitats of habitat-specific and generalist species. Our results suggest that, by using habitat-dependent species-area relationships, we can better predict variation in biodiversity across seafloor landscapes and contribute to improved management and conservation.

David; Arcos, Jose Manuel; Abello, Pere; Gil De Sola, Luis; Oro, Daniel			Oceanographic habitat of an endangered Mediterranean procellariiform: Implications for marine protected areas	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Marine protected areas (MPAs) require ecologically meaningful designs capable of taking into account the particularities of the species under consideration, the dynamic nature of the marine environment, and the multiplicity of anthropogenic impacts. MPAs have been most often designated to protect benthic habitats and their biota. Increasingly, there is a need to account for highly mobile pelagic taxa, such as marine birds, mammals and turtles, and their oceanic habitats. For breeding seabirds foraging from a central place, particular attention should be paid to distant foraging grounds and movement corridors, which can often extend to hundreds of kilometers from breeding colonies. We assessed the habitat use by the most threatened Mediterranean seabird, the Balearic Shearwater, Puffinus mauretanicus, using vessel-based surveys during the chick-rearing period (May June). We used a hierarchical modeling approach to identify those environmental variables that most accurately reflected the oceanographic habitat of this species by (1) delineating its foraging range using presence/absence data and (2) identifying important foraging grounds where it concentrates in dense aggregations. The foraging range comprised the frontal systems along the eastern Iberian continental shelf waters (depth < 200 m) and areas close to the breeding colonies in the Balearic Islands. Shearwater's aggregated in productive shelf areas with elevated chlorophyll a concentrations. Following the model of a core-buffer MPA, we envisioned those areas of dense aggregation (i.e., the area of influence of the Ebro River discharge and Cape La Nao regions) as the core regions deserving elevated protection and more stringent management. More diffuse protective measures would be applied within the larger buffer region, delineated by the foraging range of the species. Marine zoning measures can greatly benefit the conservation of the Balearic Shearwater and other far-ranging seabirds by extending protective measures beyond their breeding colonies during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons.

The resulting three vector fields are compared to the vector fields obtained from the LAC imagery corresponding to the same satellite passages. To quantify the reduction in accuracy inevitable when applying the method to the lower resolution imagery, the LAC vector fields were assumed to be error free. The deviation of the GAC vectors from the LAC vectors is expressed as percentage errors of the signal variance of meridional u and zonal v velocity components, and they are 16%/30%, respectively, for the best case and 62%/117% and 92%/111% for the other two cases. These results indicate that, in its present state, the GAC data do not allow the MCC technique to extract reliable current-vector information from it.																	1545-598X					OCT	2006	3	4					508	511		10.1109/LGRS.2006.878439								WOS:000241478900017

Characterizing observed environmental variability with HF Doppler radar surface current mappers and acoustic Doppler current profilers: Environmental variability in the coastal ocean	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING					4th Radiowave Oceanography Workshop	2004	N Queensland, AUSTRALIA					A network of high-frequency (HF) radars is deployed along the New Jersey coast providing synoptic current maps across the entire shelf. These data serve a variety of user groups from scientific research to Coast Guard search and rescue. In addition, model forecasts have been shown to improve with surface current assimilation. In all applications, there is a need for better definitions and assessment of the measurement uncertainty. During a summer coastal predictive skill experiment in 2001, an array of in situ current profilers was deployed near two HF radar sites, one long-range and one standard-range system. Comparison statistics were calculated between different vertical bins on the same current profiler, between different current profilers, and between the current profilers and the different HF radars. The velocity difference in the vertical and horizontal directions were then characterized using the observed root-mean-square (rms) differences. We further focused on two cases, one with relatively high vertical variability, and the second with relatively low vertical variability. Observed differences between the top bin of the current profiler and the HF radar were influenced by both system accuracy and the environment. Using the in situ current profilers, the environmental variability over scales based on the HF radar sampling was quantified. HF radar comparisons with the current profilers were on the same order as the observed environmental difference over the same scales, indicating that the environment has a significant influence on the observed differences. Velocity variability in the vertical and horizontal directions both contribute to these differences. When the potential effects of the vertical variability could be minimized, the remaining difference between the current profiler and the HF radar was similar to the measured horizontal velocity difference (similar to 2.5 cm/s) and below the resolution of the raw radial data at the time of the deployment.																	0364-9059					OCT	2006	31	4					876	884		10.1109/JOE.2006.886095								WOS:000244319300014

Understanding the variability of clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiation based on ship-based temperature and water vapour measurements	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												High-resolution radiative transfer model calculations with the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) were used to simulate the clear-sky outgoing long-wave radiative flux (OLR) at the top of the atmosphere. The unique set of radiosonde data collected by the research vessel Polarstern of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research during 27 expeditions in the years 1982 to 2003 was used to investigate the sources of clear-sky OLR variability for ocean areas in different climate zones and seasons. For this dataset, tropospheric temperature variations contribute approximately 33 W m(-2) OLR variability. tropospheric relative humidity variations 8.5 W m(-2), and vertical structure 2.3-3.4 W m(-2). Of these, 0.3-1.0 W m(-2) are due to structures on a vertical scale smaller than 4 km, which cannot be resolved by conventional remote-sensing instruments. It was also found that the poor absolute accuracy of current humidity data in the upper troposphere, approximately 40% relative error in relative humidity, leads to a significant uncertainty in OLR of about 3.8 W m(-2) (for a midlatitude summer atmosphere), which should be put in the context of the double CO(2) effect of only 2.6 W m(-2) (for the same atmosphere).

Processing of cloud condensation nuclei by collision-coalescence in a mesoscale model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Naval Research Laboratory's Coupled Ocean- Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System ( COAMPS) is employed to explore the relative importance of source, sink, and transport processes in producing an accurate forecast of the aerosol- cloud- drizzle system. Cloud processing, defined to be the reduction of cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN) via collision- coalescence, is not uniquely related to total particle concentration, a behavior which stems from the roughly inverse dependence on cloud droplet concentration between autoconversion and accretion depletion terms. Instead, the behavior of cloud processing in COAMPS suggests relationships ( scalings) based on cloud base drizzle rate ( R) and cloud droplet concentration ( N-c). Cloud processing is found to be correlated with drizzle, a relationship that can be represented as a power law for drizzle rates less than 0.6 mm d(-1). A scaling for cloud processing based on the product of Nc and R is accurate over a wider range of drizzle rates. Results from large eddy simulation with size-resolved microphysical processes demonstrate reasonable agreement with COAMPS and the two parameter scaling. Entrainment plays an important role in strongly modulating the mean marine boundary layer ( MBL) concentration, both increasing and decreasing CCN, depending upon the entrainment velocity we and the difference between MBL and free tropospheric CCN concentrations. The importance of entrainment suggests that transport processes, especially in the vertical, play a fundamental role in the overall MBL CCN balance. In situ sources rates of CCN, taken to represent heterogeneous chemical processes and sea salt flux of submicron size particles from the ocean surface, must be unrealistically large in order to be of the same magnitude as cloud processing. Because of the prevailing importance of cloud processing and entrainment over timescales of a typical mesoscale forecast, we argue that incorporating accurate vertical aerosol profiles into the model update cycles, either from remote sensing or from global chemistry models, is more important than highly constrained local CCN source rates.																	2169-897X					SEP 26	2006	111	D18							D18204	10.1029/2006JD007183								WOS:000240945300006

We show that this information may be assessed qualitatively from satellite observations of ocean color. Such capability is based on the estimation of spectral dependence, gamma, of particulate backscattering coefficient, b(bp), which is sensitive to particle size distribution. Our results obtained from satellite observations of the global ocean are supported by in situ measurements, and they demonstrate a general decrease of the spectral slope gamma from oligotrophic to eutrophic regimes, although significant regional differences are observed in the relationship between g and the chlorophyll a concentration, Chl. To first approximation, such a decrease in gamma is expected to be accompanied by an increased role of larger particles. This is consistent with our field data that show relatively high concentrations of submicron particles in very clear oceanic waters. Different seasonal patterns are also observed depending on the oceanic regions. The seasonal amplitude of gamma is generally higher than that of Chl and bbp in equatorial and tropical regions, and it is much lower at temperate latitudes. These spatio-temporal patterns are interpreted in terms of processes that modify the composition of particulate assemblages and physiology of phytoplankton in response to environmental forcing. The changes in gamma are clearly related to variations in the mixed layer depth and photosynthetic available radiation.

This paper reports on the results of an intercalibration exercise in which two designs of commercially available instruments were used to measure reflectance spectra across a diverse, intertidal site. The substrates sampled included seagrasses, macroalgae, and sediments which varied in wetness and grain size. Spectra were compared statistically using several measures of similarity, and the results showed a high degree of correlation between the measured reflectance spectra. There were no significant differences between instruments from different manufacturers in the shape of reflectance spectra, but the signal-to-noise ratio varied considerably between individual instruments. Spectra measured by operators with lesser experience in field spectrometry tended to be more variable than those of more experienced operators, indicating that training and adherence to set protocols are important when implementing this method in the field situation. Spatial plots derived from field spectra showed essentially the same trends in surface features as plots created using traditional sampling and remote sensing methods. Furthermore, the use of field spectrometry as a stand-alone, low-cost method for rapidly mapping the distribution of major habitat types was demonstrated by the results of a survey of a large intertidal sandbank.

Real-time monitoring of harmful algal blooms in the southern Benguela	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					11th International Conference on Harmful Algae	NOV 15-19, 2004	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA					The southern Benguela Current region off South Africa is subject to frequent harmful algal blooms (HABs), which can have serious impacts - both through the introduction of toxins into the ecosystem and the collapse of high-biomass blooms leading to anoxia. As part of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme, a bio-optical buoy has been developed for monitoring HABs in the region, providing both real-time and time-series data. Considerations in developing the buoy were that it should be small, cost effective and robust, allowing for field calibration of the sensors and servicing from a small boat. The instrument package on the buoy consists of two hyperspectral radiometers (providing remote sensing reflectance), a thermistor chain, a fluorometer and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. A half-hourly acquisition regime collects data from the instruments, which are transmitted in real time using cellular phone telemetry. A website is updated with these data, when available, along with satellite data and shellfish warnings, to provide near real-time information on conditions in the area. Demonstration data from the buoy, related to observed blooms of dinoflagellates and the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, are presented.																	1814-232X					SEP	2006	28	2					257	260		10.2989/18142320609504158								WOS:000241050000016

Aerosol variability over Thessaloniki using ground based remote sensing observations and the TOMS aerosol index	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The main aim of this work is to assess the performance of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) on board the Earth Probe satellite aerosol index (AI) version 8.0 retrieved from the daily measurements of the TOMS instrument as an indicator of the presence of absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere. The analysis is carried out over the region of Northern Greece, an area exposed to various aerosol types from different sources. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) measured by a Brewer spectroradiometer situated in the centre of the city of Thessaloniki, at 40.6 degrees N, 22.9 degrees E, was employed as a measure of the aerosol loading in the atmosphere during the Earth Probe overpass. Discrete aerosol episodes that affect the area, such as biomass burning and Saharan dust events, have been isolated and studied in order to assess the effectiveness of using the TOMS AI in this highly complex atmospheric environment. The yearly values for the AOD measured at 355 nm range from 0.03 to 1.97 with a mean of 0.58 +/- 0.32 and for the AI from -1.67 to 3.06, with a mean of 0.22 +/- 0.73. This wide range of values results from the co-existence of urban, continental, marine and dust aerosols over Thessaloniki, a fact that makes it complicated to segregate optical effects on the observed radiation depending on different aerosol types. A total of 223 biomass burning events that affected Thessaloniki showed a correlation of 0.67 between the AOD and AI values whereas a correlation of 0.57 was deduced for the 37 cases of Saharan dust loading. A cluster analysis on the back-trajectories was performed in order to study the origins of the air masses over Thessaloniki, which permitted that the optical depth and AI were analysed depending on the possible source of the aerosols. The highest AOD values coupled with the highest AI values were seen for trajectories that transport air from the Saharan desert over Thessaloniki and those that bring polluted air from Eastern Europe and the Balkan regions. Even though some deductions were made vis-A-vis the origin and importance of different aerosol types over the city corroborating the usefulness of the AI in climatological or global climate studies, auxiliary information is essential for studying in detail the effects of the atmospheric aerosol loading over a local point of interest.

Satellite estimation of marine particulate organic carbon in waters dominated by different phytoplankton taxa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The relationship between in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and particulate organic carbon (POC) was assessed for the continental shelf waters of the southwestern Ross Sea, Antarctica. This sector of the Southern Ocean supports two distinct phytoplankton communities, one dominated by diatoms and the other dominated by the haptophyte Phaeocystis antarctica. In both communities, Rrs exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive linear correlation with POC concentration, although the slope of the regression was over twofold higher in waters dominated by P. antarctica. These distinct relationships between POC and Rrs are likely due to differences in the cell size and composition, as well as detrital degradation products, of the dominant taxa within each of these phytoplankton communities. Taxon-specific POC-Rrs relationships were translated into a bio-optical algorithm for estimation of surface POC concentration from remotely sensed estimates of Rrs. Applying this algorithm to satellite-derived Rrs from the Ross Sea, where distributions of P. antarctica and diatoms are reasonably well known, yields distributions of POC and POC: chlorophyll ratios that are in good agreement with field measurements. Performance of the algorithm can be improved by in situ characterization of the detrital contribution to total particle backscatter.																	0148-0227					SEP 1	2006	111	C9							C09003	10.1029/2005JC003137								WOS:000240335600002						
J	Ahn, YH; Shanmugam, P				Ahn, Yu-Hwan; Shanmugam, Palanisamy			Detecting the red tide algal blooms from satellite ocean color observations in optically complex Northeast-Asia Coastal waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Over the last few decades, the coastal regions throughout the world have experienced incidences of algal blooms, which are harmful or otherwise toxic because of their potential threat to humans as well as marine organisms, owing to accelerated eutrophication from human activities and certain oceanic processes. Previous studies have found that correct identification of these blooms remains a great challenge with the standard bio-optical algorithms applied to satellite ocean color data in optically complex coastal waters containing high concentrations of the interfered dissolved organic and particulate inorganic materials. Here a new method called the red tide index (RI) is presented which is capable of identifying potential areas of harmful algal blooms (HABs) from SeaWiFS ocean color measurements representing the typical Case-2 water environments off the Korean and Chinese coasts. The RI method employs the water-leaving radiances (L-w), collected from in-situ radiometric measurements of three SeaWiFS bands centered at 443 nm, 5 10 nm and 555 nm, to achieve derivation of indices that are then related to absorbing characteristics of harmful algae (i.e., Lw at 443 nm) from which a best fit with a cubic polynomial function with correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.91 is obtained providing indices of higher ranges for HABs and lower and slightly reduced ranges for turbid and non-bloom waters. Similar indices derived from the use of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), normalized water-leaving radiance (nL(w)) and combination of both are found rather inadequate to characterize the variability of the encountered bloom. In order to quantify the HABs in terms of chlorophyll (Chl), an empirical relationship is established between the RI and in-situ Chl in surface waters from about 0.4-71 mg m(-3), which yields a Red tide index Chlorophyll Algorithm (RCA) based on an exponential function with correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.92. The established methods were extensively tested and compared with the performances of standard Ocean Chlorophyll 4 (OC4) algorithm and Local Chlorophyll Algorithm (LCA) using SeaWiFS images collected from typical red tide waters of Korean South Sea (KSS), East China Sea (ECS), Yellow Sea (YS) and Bohai Sea (BS) during 1999-2002. The standard spectral ratio algorithms, the OC4 and LCA, yielded large errors in Chl retrievals for coastal areas, besides providing false information about the encountered HABs in KSS, ECS, YS and BS waters. On the contrary, the RI coupled with the standard spectral ratios yielded comprehensive information about various ranges of algal blooms, while RCA Chl showing a good agreement with in-situ data led to enhanced understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of the recent HAB occurrences in high scattering and absorbing waters off the Korean and Chinese coasts.

Satellite-based assessment of top of atmosphere anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing over cloud-free oceans	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Most assessments of the direct climate forcing (DCF) of anthropogenic aerosols are from numerical simulations. However, recent advances in remote sensing techniques allow the separation of fine mode aerosols ( anthropogenic aerosol is mostly fine aerosol) from coarse mode aerosols ( largely marine and dust, which are mostly natural) from satellite data such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer ( MODIS). Here, by combining MODIS narrowband measurements with broadband radiative flux data sets from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), we provide a measurement-based assessment of the global direct climate forcing ( DCF) of anthropogenic aerosols at the top of atmosphere (TOA) only for cloud free oceans. The mean TOA DCF of anthropogenic aerosols over cloud-free oceans [60N - 60S] is - 1.4 +/- 0.9 Wm(-2), which is in excellent agreement ( mean value of - 1.4 Wm(-2)) with a recent observational study by Kaufman et al.

The field measurements have been taken simultaneously to the HyMap campaign with a GER 3700 spectrometer. To compare the two data sets, further calibration and atmospheric correction are made through empirical line corrections. A continuum removal by a modified Gaussian model on reflectance is then performed for each pixel to minimize atmospheric scattering and shadowing effects. Classification from spectral distance is established using field observations and comparisons at full spectral resolution to identify peridotite subunits (harzburgites and dunites) and to distinguish plagioclase-wehrlites from gabbros. Detections of hydrothermal transformations of olivine in serpentines and their alteration in carbonates along fracture networks, characterized by narrow spectral signatures, validate the classification. This demonstrates the utility of the high spectral resolution and the development of appropriate processing methods for geological identifications.																	1525-2027					AUG 1	2006	7								Q08001	10.1029/2005GC001214								WOS:000239595800001

During the 13 years cropland decreased remarkably by nearly 11304.95 ha. The areas of rural-urban construction and water body increased by 10152.24 ha and 848.94 ha, respectively. From 1988 to 2001, 52.5% of the lost cropland was converted into rural-urban industrial land. Rapid urbanization contributed to a great change in the rate of cropland land use during these years. Land-reclamation also contributed to a decrease in water body area as well as marine ecological and environmental destruction. In the study area 1) urbanization and industrialization, 2) infrastructure and agricultural intensification, 3) increased affluence of the farming community, and 4) policy factors have driven the land use changes. Possible sustainable land use measures included construction of a land management system, land planning, development of potential land resources, new technology applications, and marine ecological and environmental protection.																	1002-0160					AUG	2006	16	4					477	488		10.1016/S1002-0160(06)60078-7								WOS:000239446000009

Operational impact of QuikSCAT winds at the NOAA Ocean Prediction Center	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The NASA Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) has revolutionized the analysis and short-term forecasting of winds over the oceans at the NOAA Ocean Prediction Center (OPC). The success of QuikSCAT in OPC operations is due to the wide 1800-km swath width, large retrievable wind speed range ( 0 to in excess of 30 m s(-1)), ability to view QuikSCAT winds in a comprehensive form in operational workstations, and reliable near-real-time delivery of data. Prior to QuikSCAT, marine forecasters at the OPC made warning and forecast decisions over vast ocean areas based on a limited number of conventional observations or on the satellite presentation of a storm system. Today, QuikSCAT winds are a heavily used tool by OPC forecasters. Approximately 10% of all short-term wind warning decisions by the OPC are based on QuikSCAT winds. When QuikSCAT is available, 50%-68% of all weather features on OPC surface analyses are placed using QuikSCAT. QuikSCAT is the first remote sensing instrument that can consistently distinguish extreme hurricane force conditions from less dangerous storm force conditions in extratropical cyclones. During each winter season (October-April) from 2001 to 2004, 15-23 extratropical cyclones reached hurricane force intensity over both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Due to QuikSCAT, OPC forecasters are now more likely to anticipate the onset of hurricane force conditions. QuikSCAT has also revealed significant wind speed gradients in the vicinity of strong sea surface temperature (SST) differences near the Gulf Stream and shelfbreak front of the western North Atlantic. These wind speed gradients are most likely due to changes in low-level stability of the boundary layer across the SST gradients. OPC forecasters now use a variety of numerical guidance based tools to help predict boundary layer stability and the resultant near-surface winds.

J	Zinner, T; Mayer, B				Zinner, T.; Mayer, B.			Remote sensing of stratocumulus clouds: Uncertainties and biases due to inhomogeneity	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[ 1] Standard cloud remote sensing techniques rely on two basic assumptions: First, clouds are assumed to be plane-parallel and homogeneous within each satellite pixel. Second, pixels are assumed independent and the net horizontal radiative transport between pixels is neglected. These assumptions cause considerable uncertainty and bias in the retrieval of cloud properties, which depend on the sensors spatial resolution as well as the illumination and observation geometry. The errors are quantified for several typical sensor settings. The basis of the investigation is a data set of high-resolution three-dimensional cloud property distributions of marine stratocumulus obtained from airborne radiance observations. For this predefined cloud data the sensor signals are simulated using a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer model. Cloud properties ( optical thickness, effective radius) are retrieved for the simulated observations using a two-channel retrieval, which are then compared to the given cloud data. For the retrieval of the optical thickness the main findings are large uncertainty of individual pixel values occurs for a high spatial resolution ( e. g., airborne sensors) due to nonnegligible horizontal photon transport at this pixel size. For the typical polar-orbiting and geostationary sensor settings the neglect of subpixel inhomogeneity takes effect as well. Nonetheless, biases are generally small within +/- 5%, if pixels are overcast. If this is not guaranteed, the bias grows rapidly, for example, to typical underestimations of 20% and more for a geostationary sensor. For the retrieval of effective radius values are generally found to be about 5% larger than expected for idealized homogeneous plane-parallel cloud conditions.

Monitoring turbid freshwater plume characteristics by means of remotely sensed data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Remotely sensed data may provide easy access for monitoring the spatial separation and obtaining the hydrodynamic characteristics of turbid freshwater plumes created by river flow in the marine environment. Traditional methods are time consuming and require great effort to produce sufficient data. In this project, integrated research has been carried out on a river to demonstrate the utility of remote sensing (RS) technology for studying fundamental theoretical properties of turbulent mixtures. The Filyos River mouth, located on the Black Sea coast of Turkey. is the research area. Flow properties, such as the horizontal dispersion coefficient. have been calculated (using Landsat TM sensor images taken on two different dates). The effects of the plume on the morphology of neighbouring beaches are also examined. This study shows the utility of RS technology for generating quantitative data and better defining the hydraulic behaviour of a river with high turbidity.

J	Hwang, BJ; Barber, DG				Hwang, BJ; Barber, DG			Pixel-scale evaluation of SSM/I sea-ice algorithms in the marginal ice zone during early fall freeze-up	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Observed reduction in recent sea ice areal extent and thickness has focused attention on the fact that the Arctic marine system appears to be responding to global-scale climate variability and change. Passive microwave remote-sensing data are the primary source underpinning these reports, yet problems remain in geophysical inversion of information on ice type and concentration. Uncertainty in sea-ice concentration (SIC) retrievals is highest in the summer and fall, when water occurs in liquid phase within the snow-sea-ice system. Of particular scientific interest is the timing and rate of new ice formation due to the control that this form of sea ice has on mass, energy and gas fluxes across the ocean-sea-ice-atmosphere interface. In this paper we examine the critical fall freeze-up period using in situ data from a ship-based and aerial survey programme known as the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange study combined with microwave and optical Earth observations data. Results show that: (1) the overall physical conditions observed from aerial survey photography were well matched with coincident moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data and Radarsat ScanSAR imagery; (2) the shortwave albedo was linearly related to old ice concentration derived from survey photography; (3) the three SSM/I SIC algorithms (NASA Team (NT), NASA Team 2 (NT2), and Bootstrap (BT)) showed considerable discrepancies in pixel-scale comparison with the Radarsat ScanSAR SICs well calibrated by the aerial survey data. The major causes of the discrepancies are attributed to (1) the inherent inability to detect the new thin ice in the NT and BT algorithms, (2) mismatches of the thin-ice tie point of the NT2 algorithm, and (3) sub-pixel ambiguity between the thin ice and the mixture of open water and sea ice. These results suggest the need for finer resolution of passive microwave sensors, such as AMSR-E, to improve the precision of the SSM/I SIC algorithms in the marginal ice zone during early fall freeze-up.

The interpretation of the multitransmitter geophysical data requires numerous three-dimensional (3-D) modelings of the responses of the receivers for different geoelectrical models of complex geological formations. In this paper, we introduce a fast method for 3-D modeling of EM data, based on a modified version of quasilinear approximation, which uses a multigrid approach. This method significantly speeds up the modeling of multitransmitter-multireceiver surveys. The developed algorithm has been applied for the interpretation of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (MCSEM) data.

The wind speed and direction observed by SeaWinds are in good agreement with buoy data with root-mean-squared (rms) differences of approximately 1 m s(-1) and 20 degrees, respectively. No systematic biases depending on wind speed or cross-track wind vector cell location are discernible. The effects of oceanographic and atmospheric environments on the scatterometry are negligible. Though the wind speed observed by AMSR also showed agreement with buoy observations with rms difference of 1.27 m s(-1), the AMSR wind speed is systematically lower than the buoy data for wind speeds lower than 5 m s(-1). The AMSR wind seems to have a discontinuous trend relative to the buoy data at wind speeds of 5-6 m s(-1). Similar results have been obtained in an intercomparison of wind speeds globally observed by SeaWinds and AMSR on the same orbits. A global wind speed histogram of the AMSR wind shows skewed features in comparison with those of SeaWinds and European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses.

The algorithm described is applicable to ocean colour satellite measurements (e.g., SeaWiFS). In situ measurements of inherent and apparent optical properties were made at 19 coastal stations off the north coast of New Zealand's South Island in December 2001. These measurements were used to parameterise a bio-optical model that estimates remote sensing reflectance from concentrations of water constituents. The model generated a large number (5000) of modelled ocean colour reflectance spectra that represented a greater range of biogeochemical conditions than were measured in the study area. These modelled values spanned a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations (0.1-10 mg m(-3)), total suspended particulate material concentrations (0.1-50 g m(-3)), and dissolved yellow substance absorptions (0.01-3m(-1)). The modelled spectra were then used to test the performance of the algorithm. The median ratio of algorithm values to target values was 0.84 (absorption), and 0.80 (backscatter), and the median absolute errors were 33% (absorption) and 36% (backscatter) across two orders of magnitude. The r(2) values between target and algorithm values of inherent optical properties in log-log space were 0.89 for backscatter, and varied with wavelength for absorption from 0.79 (412 nm), 0.72 (443 nm), 0.63 (490 nm), 0.55 (510 nm), and 0.21 (555 nm).				oubelkheir, kadija/H-3843-2011; Boyd, Philip/J-7624-2014	Boyd, Philip/0000-0001-7850-1911; Lavender, Samantha/0000-0002-5181-9425; Moore, Gerald/0000-0001-6170-6646												0028-8330					JUN	2006	40	2					227	247		10.1080/00288330.2006.9517417								WOS:000239326700002

Remote sensing techniques can significantly improve our understanding of the global methane budget. Field and laboratory studies using in situ direct and spectral measurements of methane emissions from natural marine seepage allowed assessment of the feasibility of remote sensing. Methane plume characteristics were estimated by repeated transects of an intense marine seep area with a flame ion detector (FID) and then fit with a Gaussian plume to allow calculation of methane column abundances. These showed values greater than 0.5 g m(-2) to a downwind distance of 70 in. A numerical radiative-transfer calculation showed that in the spectral region between 2200 and 2340 nm, which is sensitive to methane, there is mild sensitivity to water vapor interference, and that methane levels were well above the noise equivalent delta radiance of the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). During a separate field study, FIDs recorded methane concentrations at 2.2, 3.6, and 5-m height while transecting an active seep area and concurrently collecting spectra using a field spectrometer. Several plumes were identified and a peak concentration of 200 ppm was measured. The presence of methane plumes along the incident path, as determined from the FID data, was related to the presence of methane absorption features in spectra above atmospheric background, which were absent outside the plumes.

Sequestration of carbonate shell material in coastal dunes on the Gulf of California (Baja California Sur, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												` Atmospheric and oceanographic conditions stimulate high productivity of marine organisms in the Gulf of California that are bulk producers of calcium carbonate. Due to prevailing winter winds, north-facing beaches receive vast amounts of shell debris derived from offshore clam banks above the 50-m isobath. As shells undergo mechanical abrasion, the smaller particles of carbonate material are transferred from beaches by the wind and sequestered in coastal dunes. This study reports on two dune fields from the midriff zone of the Gulf. Sieve analysis is used to describe the grain size and sorting characteristics of seven samples from dunes at Cerro El Gallo near Mulege and 12 samples from dunes farther south near San Nicolas. Dune sediments also were impregnated with epoxy to simulate rock samples from which thin sections were made to determine composition and relative abundances of constituent grains. The dunes at Cerro El Gallo are carbonate poor (5-15%) compared with those near San Nicolds (26-51%) and possible factors contributing to regional variation are explored. Another part of this study appraises the fecundity necessary to produce any carbonate fraction integrated by coastal dunes from seashells. One of the region's more abundant clams, Megapitaria squalida, was used as a model to estimate the number of individuals of a given size and age class required to generate a cubic meter of pure carbonate sand. Satellite images of the dune fields at El Gallo and San Nicolas were viewed to map surface coverage. With input on the thickness of dune deposits and their composition, it is possible to roughly estimate the number of mature Megapitaria equal to the carbonate fraction of these dunes. The method may be applied to all coastal dunes on the Gulf of California and could be used to assess a part of the region's overall carbon budget heretofore unappreciated.

Remote sensing could provide a tool for mapping bottom vegetation if the substrates are spectrally resolvable. We measured reflectance spectra of green (Cladophora glomerata), red (Furcellaria lumbricalis), and brown (Focus vesiculosus) macroalgae and used a bio-optical model in estimating whether these algae distinguish optically from each other, from sandy bottom or deep water in turbid water conditions of the Baltic Sea. The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (I) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumhricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species.

CDOM peaks (between January and March) and troughs (late summer and fall) followed pigment peaks and troughs by approximately two and four weeks, respectively. This phase shift is additional strong evidence that CDOM in the marine environment is derived from phytoplankton degradation. The common assumption of linear covariation between chloropyll and CDOM is a simplification even in this ocean gyre. Due to the temporal changes in CDOM, chlorophyll concentration estimated based on traditional remote sensing band-ratio algorithms may be overestimated by about 10% during the spring bloom and underestimated by a similar 10% during the fall. These observations are only possible through use of synoptic, precise, accurate, and frequent measurements afforded by space-based sensors because in situ technologies cannot provide the required sensitivity or synoptic coverage to observe these natural phenomena.				hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012													1545-598X					APR	2006	3	2					262	266		10.1109/LGRS.2005.862527								WOS:000237210200017						
J	Pritchard, M; Huntley, DA				Pritchard, M; Huntley, DA			A simplified energy and mixing budget for a small river plume discharge	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The formation and evolution of a tidally modulated river plume that spreads and mixes into English Channel waters is investigated by combining results from two observational studies. Remote sensing imagery showed a near-semicircular plume expansion as its diameter increased linearly during the ebb tide. Subsequent ship surveys made repeated transects across the plume front and showed that regions of mixing and instability (Froude numbers >1) were confined to horizontal length scales <10 m in the region of the bounding plume front. These observations were used to compute the rate of frontal mixing energy, and results were compared to the rate of buoyancy energy input and the mixing rate over the plume area due to wind and tidal flows. Analysis showed mixing at the front, although spatially confined and subject to considerable variability, was the dominant dispersion process. On the basis of these results, a simple continuity model was developed where the ratio of frontal mixing rate to buoyancy input rate, f(b), was estimated for the early stages of plume formation only on the basis of given values of freshwater input and the estuarine tidal prism. During the field experiments, f(b) approximate to 0.44 and suggested that the initial frontal mixing rate was much smaller than the buoyancy input rate, consistent with the formation of a well-defined plume. However, on the basis of river flow statistics, for 65% of the time during spring tidal conditions, the run-off rates are small enough for f(b) >1, suggesting that a plume cannot form.																	0148-0227					MAR 28	2006	111	C3							C03019	10.1029/2005JC002984								WOS:000236731300002						
J	Kutser, T; Metsamaa, L; Strombeck, N; Vahtmae, E				Kutser, T; Metsamaa, L; Strombeck, N; Vahtmae, E			Monitoring cyanobacterial blooms by satellite remote sensing	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Cyanobacterial blooms are attracting the increasing attention of environment agencies, water authorities, and human and animal health organizations, since they can present a range of amenity, water quality ant treatment problems, and hazards to human and animal health. The problem is especially acute in the Baltic Sea where cyanobacterial blooms occur every summer covering areas of more than 100 000 km(2). It has been shown that quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria during bloom conditions is possible with hyperspectral instruments. These sensors, however, cannot provide synoptic spatial coverage and high revisit times needed for near real-time monitoring of potentially harmful blooms. The aim was to estimate whether spectral resolution of multispectral sensors, which can provide needed coverage, is adequate for quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria and whether it is possible to separate potentially harmful blooms of cyanobacteria from waters dominated by algae using ocean colour satellites. The modelling results show that multispectral sensors like ALI, Landsat or MODIS are not capable of separating waters dominated by cyanobacteria from waters dominated by other algae species, as their spectral band configuration does not allow detecting absorption features caused by phycocyanin (present primarily in cyanobacteria) or any other spectral features that are characteristic to cyanobacteria only. MERIS bands 6 and 7 allow detecting phycocyanin absorption feature near 630 nm and a small peak in reflectance spectra near 650 nm characteristic to only cyanobacteria. Thus, MERIS can be used in detecting cyanobacteria if they are present in relatively high quantities. Unfortunately it is not possible to use MERIS for early warning of emerging potentially harmful blooms as the minimum biomass needed to cause features in reflectance spectra typical to cyanobacteria is higher than the biomass already considered as a bloom in the Baltic Sea.

J	Fan, H; Huang, HJ; Zeng, TQ; Wang, KR				Fan, H; Huang, HJ; Zeng, TQ; Wang, KR			River mouth bar formation, riverbed aggradation and channel migration in the modern Huanghe (Yellow) River delta, China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper addresses the recent (1970s-1990s) processes of river mouth bar formation, riverbed aggradation and distributary migration in the Huanghe River mouth area, in the light of station-based monitoring, field measurements and remote sensing interpretation. The results show that the morphological changes of the river mouth bar have been closely associated with the largely reduced fluvial discharge and sediment load. Landforrn development such as bar progradation occurred in two phases, i.e. before and after 1989, which correspond to faster and lower bar growth rates, respectively. Fast riverbed aggradation in the mouth channel was strongly related to river mouth bar progradation. During 1976-1996, about 2.8% of the total sediment loads were deposited in the river channel on the upper to middle delta. Therefore, the river water level rose by a few meters from 1984 to 1996. The frequent distributary channel migration, which switched the radial channel pattern into the SE-directed pattern in the mid-1980s, was linked with mouth bar formation. Marine conditions also constrain seaward bar progradation. Furthermore, the history of river mouth bar formation reflects human impacts, such as dredging and dyking in order to stabilize the coastal area. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Model outputs are compared to long-term meteorological measurements by active (radar and lidar) and passive (infrared and visible fluxes) remote sensing collected at an atmospheric observatory near Paris, France. The goal is to understand which of four microphysical schemes is best suited to simulate midlatitude ice Clouds. The methodology consists of simulating instrument observables from the model Outputs without any profile inversion, which allows the authors to use fewer assumptions on microphysical and optical properties of ice particles. Among the four schemes compared in the current study, the best observation-to-simulations scores are obtained with Reisner et al. provided that the particles' sedimentation velocity from Heymsfield and Dormer is used instead of that originally proposed. For this last scheme, the model gives results close to the measurements for clouds with medium optical depth of typically 1 to 3, whatever the season. In this configuration, MM5 simulates the presence of midlatitude ice clouds in more than 65% of the authors' selection of observed cloud cases. In 35% of the cases, the simulated clouds arc too persistent whatever the microphysical scheme and tend to produce too much solid water (ice and snow) and not enough liquid water.

The sink/source strength of vegetated surfaces at ground sites can now be estimated with reasonable accuracy and micrometeorological techniques are now well established, while difficulties exist in up scaling these figures to the regional and global scales. Airborne measurement of mass, momentum, and energy fluxes for boundary layer research has been available for decades requiring the use of large aircraft to carry instruments and dedicated support facilities. The advent of compact, low-power instruments and high speed, high-capacity digital data acquisition systems has recently allowed small research aircraft to perform such measurements with high accuracy. This paper first describes the Sky Arrow ERA (Environmental Research Aircraft), a small research aircraft that has been recently developed in Italy, in the frame of an international scientific collaboration. This aircraft can be operated to measure fluxes of mass, momentum and energy while flying at low altitude and reduced ground speed. The fluxes are computed with the airborne eddy correlation technique. The basic theory at the basis of the flux measurement technique is also described in the paper, and two application examples are discussed to illustrate the quality and the accuracy of the measurements that can be made using this research platform. Potential applications of those data to parametrize land surface schemes, validate simulation models and provide extensive and reliable ground truthing for satellite remote sensing applications are highlighted.

A turbidity-free function for near-infrared and red signals, alpha(0) = (b(b)((1))/b(b)((2)))(a((2))/ a((1))) based on the first order b(b)(a+b(b)) model deducing equation R-rs((2)-1) = alpha(0) R-rs((1)-1)+ g(-1) (1 - alpha(0)), were selected as a chlorophyll-a related index for detecting algal blooms, and the algal blooms with chlorophyll-a concentration of 64-256 mg/L could be defined by window of 1.6 < alpha(0) < 5.2 and 0.01 < R-rs((2))/g < 0.2. Such turbidity-free two-band method is supported by both sea-truth data and remote sensing experiment for an algal blooms event on the near-shore water off the Minjiang estuary of southeastern China during early June of 2003. Comparisons of this algorithm with other published algorithms, one-band method (i.e. method of bright water) or two-band methods (i.e. method of ratio, method of NDVI, and method of subtracting) have suggested that the turbidity-free function method could be regarded as a standard algorithm in capabilities of AVHRR imagery or other high resolution but wide near-infrared and red band imagery for detecting algal blooms events in coastal waters.

These constitute the Dahar Plateau (which is part of the Ghadames Basin and it is the focus of this study) that was developed in association with regional uplift of the Saharan Platform. Efforts in mapping the details of surface geology in southern Tunisia are hindered by the lack of continuous bedrock outcrops, where some of the formations are buried under the sand of the Sahara Desert. Remote sensing data including multi-spectral optical (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)), radar (RADARSAT), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) extracted from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data are used to trace along strike continuity of different lithological units as well as mapping morphologically defined structures in southern Tunisia. Landsat ETM+ and ASTER Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color combination images (both band and band-ratio images) have been used for the identification of various lithological units when they are exposed on the surface. On the other hand, RADARSAT images have been utilized for tracing geological formations and geological structures that are buried under thin (similar to 1 m) sand. Fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data using Color Normalization Transformation (CNT) has been effectively implemented to further identify lithological units and geological structures. Hill-shading techniques are applied to SRTM DEMs to enhance terrain perspective views and to extract geomorphological features and morphologically defined structures through the means of lineament analysis. Results from remote sensing analysis are in good agreement with results obtained from in situ investigations including geological mapping and seismic exploration. Identifying lithological and structural features using remote sensing studies incorporated with surface and sub-surface geological investigations in southern Tunisia can aid exploration for new oil and gas fields. Such an approach of integrating remote sensing and in situ geological studies can be successfully adopted in other parts of North Africa and arid regions in general. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the feature extraction of oceanic phenomena as a case study, the functions of the MGIS are analyzed, and thus the position of MGIS in the oceanography is defined. Comparing the requirement of MGIS with that of the traditional GIS which has been developed in the terrestrial applications in the past four decades, the frame for the functions of MGIS is constructed.

Investigation of local meteorological events and their relationship with ozone and aerosols during an ESCOMPTE photochemical episode	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE												The international ESCOMPTE campaign, which took place in summer 2001 in the most highly polluted French region, was devoted to validate air pollution prediction models. Surface and remote sensing instruments (Lidar, Radar and Sodar) were deployed over the Marseille area, along the Mediterranean coast, in order to investigate the fine structure of the sea-breeze circulation and its relationship with the pollutant concentrations. The geographical situation of the Marseille region combines a complex coastline and relief which both lead to a peculiar behaviour of the sea-breeze circulation. Several local sea breezes, perpendicular to the nearest coastline, settled in during the morning. In the afternoons, when the thermal gradient between the continental and marine surface grows up, a southerly or a westerly sea breeze may dominate. Their respective importance is then a function of time, space and altitude. Furthermore, an oscillation of the westerly sea breeze with a period of about 3 h is also highlighted. We show that these dynamical characteristics have profound influences on the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) development and on pollutant concentrations. In fact, the direction and intensity of the sea-breeze determine the route and the transit time of the stable marine air flow over the continental surface. Thus, the ABL depth may exhibit several collapses correlated with the westerly sea-breeze pulsation. The ozone and aerosol concentrations are also related to the dynamical features. In the suburbs and parts of the city under pulsed sea breezes, a higher ABL depth and higher ozone concentrations are observed. In the city centre, this relationship between pulsed sea-breeze intensity and ozone concentration is different, emphasising the importance of the transit time and also the build-up of pollutants in the marine air mass along the route. Finally, the variations of aerosol concentration are also described according to the breeze direction.																	0992-7689						2006	24	11					2809	2822		10.5194/angeo-24-2809-2006								WOS:000243431000005

Oceanographic characteristics of biological hot spots in the North Pacific: A remote sensing perspective	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					13th Annual Meeting of the North-Pacific-Marine-Science-Organization (PICES)	OCT 14-24, 2004	Honolulu, HI	N Pacific Marine Sci Org				Biological hot spots in the ocean are likely created by physical processes and have distinct oceanographic signatures. Marine predators, including large pelagic fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and fishing vessels, recognize that prey organisms congregate at ocean fronts, eddies, and other physical features. Here we use remote sensing observations from multiple satellite platforms to characterize physical oceanographic processes in four regions of the North Pacific Ocean that are recognized as biological hot spots. We use data from the central North Pacific, the northeastern tropical Pacific, the California Current System, and the Galapagos Islands to identify and quantify dynamic features in terms of spatial scale, degree of persistence or recurrence, forcing mechanism, and biological impact. The dominant timescales of these processes vary from interannual (Rossby wave interactions in the central North Pacific) to annual (spring-summer intensification of alongshore winds in the California Current System; winter wind outflow events through mountain gaps into the northeastern tropical Pacific), to intraseasonal (high-frequency equatorial waves at the Galapagos). Satellite oceanographic monitoring, combined with data from large-scale electronic tagging experiments, can be used to conduct a census of biological hot spots, to understand behavioral changes and species interactions within hot spots, and to differentiate the preferred pelagic habitats of different species. The identification and monitoring of biological hot spots could constitute an effective approach to marine conservation and resource management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Primary producer and seabird associations with AVHRR-derived sea surface temperatures and gradients in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY					13th Annual Meeting of the North-Pacific-Marine-Science-Organization (PICES)	OCT 14-24, 2004	Honolulu, HI	N Pacific Marine Sci Org				Identification and characterization of critical habitat is an important component of marine conservation. In this study, we compare relative sea-surface temperature (SST) and gradients in SST as derived from advanced very high-resolution radiometry (AVHRR) with primary producer biomass, indexed by remotely sensed Chlorophyll a concentrations (from the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor [SeaWiFS]), and seabird observations collected during replicate surveys along Line P in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska. Because of cloudiness, we used monthly composites for both Sea-WiFS and AVHRR. Sea bird data were collected three times per year ('seasons') starting in 1996, and summarized in 4 x 4 km grids. We divided our analyses into two regions based on oceanography; the outer 'oceanic' region and the 'coastal' region. We calculated SST anomalies as residuals from mean SST calculated per region, season, and year. We calculated maximum SST gradients between AVHRR data pixels (both 4 x 4 km and 9 x 9 km resolution) and defined areas of 'steep' SST gradients. Within each region we found that primary producer biomass varied with SST gradients, but not as expected (i.e. we expected sharp increases in chlorophyll a with steeper SST gradients). There was, however, strong evidence of seabird associations with SST and SST gradients, especially in the coastal region where almost all species were associated with fronts. In the oceanic region, 62% of the species were associated with steep SST gradients. This study demonstrates the importance of mesoscale oceanographic structures on seabird distributions in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska, and illuminates how these relationships can be characterized using remote-sensing of habitats at large spatial scales.

A decade of synthesis and modeling in the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A decade-long Synthesis and Modeling Project (SMP) was conducted as the final element of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). The SNIP goal was to synthesize knowledge gained from field studies into a set of models that reflect our current understanding of the oceanic carbon cycle. Specific, innovative aspects of the project included the close partnership among scientists conducting field, laboratory, remote sensing, and numerical research and the strong emphasis on data management and web-based, public release of models and data products. Several recurrent science themes arose across the SMP effort including: the development of a new generation of ocean ecosystem and biogeochemistry models that include iron limitation, flexible elemental composition, size structure, geochemical functional groups, and particle composition; the application of inverse models and data assimilation techniques to marine food-web data; the creation of whole-ocean synthesis products from the JGOFS global CO2 survey and other studies; and the analysis and modeling of ecosystem and biogeochemical responses to climate and CO2 system perturbations on time-scales ranging from seasonal and inter-annual variability to anthropogenic climate warming and longer.

Annual ecosystem variability in the tropical Indian Ocean: Results of a coupled bio-physical ocean general circulation model	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												A coupled, 3-D bio-physical ocean general circulation model has been employed to study biogeochernical variability in the Indian Ocean. The model's ecosystem includes two size classes each of phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus, and allows iron- and nitrogen-limited phytoplankton growth to develop. Comparison of SeaWiFS and modeled chlorophyll a demonstrates that the model successfully captures seasonal inter-regional contrasts in phytoplankton distribution. Model validation was performed against SeaWiFS ocean color, NODC nitrate, and US JGOFS observations from the Arabian Sea. These data were used to objectively evaluate several ecosystem model modifications that improved the solution. Phytoplankton speciation shifts were generally consistent with those observed in the Arabian Sea. The model shows pronounced basinwide spatio-temporal variability in iron availability; surface waters in the western equatorial and southern tropical regions always tend toward iron limitation, while the Bay of Bengal and the eastern Arabian Sea are largely iron replete. The model also indicates that surface waters in the western Arabian Sea are prone to seasonal iron limitation, despite proximity to regional dust sources. Phytoplankton blooms that manifest as a response to the Somali Current show better agreement with the SeaWiFS data than do previous modeling studies and biogeochernical variability associated with eastward propagation of the semiannual Wyrtki Jet is described for the first time. In the southern tropical region, the model indicates that austral winter Ekman pumping and westward propagating Rossby waves are the primary means of nutrient supply to these iron-limited waters. Finally, inter-regional connections associated with the propagation of the Somali Current and the Wyrtki Jet out of their respective source regions are shown to be a primary influence on seasonal biogeochemical variability in the southern Bay of Bengal. The results presented here establish a need for additional studies that apply such a basinwide approach to further advance our understanding of how bioavailable iron distribution, physical-biological interactions and inter-regional connections affect biogeochemical processes in the Indian Ocean.

J	Roelfsema, CM; Phinn, SR; Dennison, WC; Dekker, AG; Brando, VE				Roelfsema, CM; Phinn, SR; Dennison, WC; Dekker, AG; Brando, VE			Monitoring toxic cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula (Gomont) in Moreton Bay, Australia by integrating satellite image data and field mapping	HARMFUL ALGAE												Large-scale blooms of Lyngbya majuscula (Gomont) have occurred throughout Moreton Bay (south-east Queensland) and have been documented since 1997. L. majuscula is a toxic cyanobacteria which fixes nitrogen and is found attached to: seagrass, algae and coral. The toxic and smothering nature of L. majuscula has affected human and environmental health in sensitive coastal ecosystems. To reduce these impacts, monitoring is an essential component of studying the origins and development of L. majuscula blooms. An accurate and cost effective means to map the extent of a bloom and its biophysical properties is needed. This study presents an operational approach for mapping the extent of L. majuscula blooms in the clear and shallow water regions of Moreton Bay, eastern Australia, from a combination of field and remotely sensed data sets. The ability to discriminate L. majuscula from other substrate types over a range of depths was first examined using detailed field reflectance spectra, measured optical properties of Moreton Bay waters and a radiative transfer model (Hydrolight 4.1). A two-stage process was then used to map L. majuscula. The spatial extent of L. majuscula and other major substrate types was first recorded from a boat-based survey by marine park authorities using point-based GPS measurements. This sampling was timed to coincide with an overpass of the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor. When the results of the boat-based mapping detected more than 25% L. majuscula cover in the study area, a cloud free Landsat 7 ETM+ image was acquired for that date. In the second stage of mapping, selected field survey data provided the basis for a supervised classification of the ETM+ image data to map L. majuscula. Effort and accuracy assessment of both field and image mapping methods indicated a trade-off between areal coverage and mapping accuracy. The Landsat 7 ETM+ based mapping procedure provided 100% areal coverage with 58% accuracy. In contrast, the boat-based field survey method covered only 0.5% of the study area, but with almost 100% mapping accuracy. The approach outlined in this work has been adopted as a standard operating procedure in Moreton Bay. This study illustrates how remote sensing can be combined with field monitoring, to provide marine park authorities with useful information to understand and manage blooms. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the radiometric data have been used to produce surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) by applying a regional algorithm proposed for the northern Adriatic Sea coastal waters. A comparison based on 41 match-ups between these Chla and reference values from high-performance liquid chromatography, has shown an average absolute difference of 32%. The comparison of Chla derived from remote sensing SeaWiFS and in situ above-water radiances has shown an average absolute difference of 21% for 183 match-ups, when the same regional algorithm is applied to both types of radiometric data.																	1545-598X					JAN	2006	3	1					120	124		10.1109/LGRS.2005.858486								WOS:000234898700026

The primary fields used are from the modular ocean data assimilation system (MODAS), developed by Fox et al The system provides global thermohaline and sound speed fields on a daily basis using environmental inputs from the U.S. Navy as well as remote sensing of sea surface temperature and sea surface height. To examine the MODAS fields, the authors also used data from the Southern California Bight collected by the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations as well as high-resolution hydrographic data collected over the continental shelf south of New England as part of the shelfbreak PRIMER experiment. MODAS performs well for features such as large-scale boundary currents and eddies but is more limited in resolving features such as shelfbreak and coastal fronts, which have small spatial and temporal correlation scales. Because of the considerable computational needs of other ESME modules and its use as a planning tool, the authors present a pragmatic approach for future applications.																	0364-9059					JAN	2006	31	1					22	32		10.1109/JOE.2006.872206								WOS:000238710400004						
J	Pulvirenti, L; Pierdicca, N				Pulvirenti, L; Pierdicca, N			Retrieval of atmospheric and surface parameters from satellite microwave radiometers over the Mediterranean Sea	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												A procedure to estimate atmospheric and sea surface parameters in the Mediterranean area from satellite microwave radiometric measurements is described. The method is founded on a simulator of brightness temperatures at the top of the atmosphere. The simulator is based on microwave sea emissivity and scattering model functions, derived from the outputs of the SEAWIND software, which implements a two-scale microwave sea surface model and a radiative transfer scheme in a nonscattering atmosphere. The development of the model functions aims to reduce the SEAWIND computational time, still maintaining its sensitivity to the main geophysical variables. Different adaptations of the simulation model have been performed to better reproduce the radiometric data in the region of interest. A comparison between the simulations and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/1) observations acquired throughout year 2000 over the Mediterranean Sea has permitted us to refine the model functions as well as to assess the whole simulation procedure. As for the inversion problem, a regression analysis has been applied to two different synthetic datasets to retrieve integrated precipitable water vapor, liquid water path and wind speed. The first dataset simulates the observations of SSMA, whilst the second one concerns the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Both have been generated by using the ECMWF atmospheric profiles and the measurements of the SeaWinds scatterometer aboard QuickSCAT. The SSN?I data have been used to carry out a statistical validation of the estimators. AMSR-E observations of a Tramontane-Mistral event, typical of the Mediterranean Sea, have been analyzed to evaluate the benefits of its expanded channel capability.																	0196-2892					JAN	2006	44	1					90	101		10.1109/TGRS.2005.859340								WOS:000234367900009

Quantitative imaging to measure photosynthetic biomass on an intertidal rock-platform	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Conventional methods for measuring amounts of epilithic photosynthetic biomass in intertidal habitats by estimating amounts of chlorophyll in rock samples are imprecise, laborious and destructive. An alternative remote sensing method for quantifying chlorophyll amounts at small spatial scales using field-based digital colour-infrared (CIR) imagery is presented. CIR images were obtained from 4 areas of the emersed rock-platform. Experimental plots were initially scraped to remove any macro- or micro-algae. After different periods of recolonization of micro-algae, images of the plots were acquired under full sunlight or under artificial shade, before and after the rocks were uniformly wetted. Samples of rock were taken for laboratory determination of amount of chlorophyll. Relative absorption by chlorophyll was estimated from CIR data using a ratio of near-infrared (NIR) and red bands. The image ratios were validated by comparing them to data from a field spectrometer. Measurements of the amount of chlorophyll extracted from rock samples were linearly related to estimates from the NIR:red ratio. Ratios derived from images acquired under full sunlight, before and after wetting the surface, had the strongest relationship with chlorophyll (r(2) = 0.84 and 0.83, respectively). Artificial shading of the rock reduced the strength of the relationship between chlorophyll and the NIR:red ratio before and after wetting (r(2) = 0.79 and 0.63, respectively). Micro-algae in scraped areas and micro- and macro-algal mixtures could be estimated using the same equation. The technique enables rapid contiguous in situ measurements of chlorophyll to be made without the microflora being destroyed and will facilitate more comprehensive studies of competitive interactions among intertidal grazing animals.

Northern Florida reef tract benthic metabolism scaled by remote sensing	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Holistic rates of excess organic carbon production (E) and calcification for a 0.5 km(2) segment of the backreef platform of the northern Florida reef tract (NFRT) were estimated by combining biotope mapping using remote sensing with community metabolic rates determined with a benthic incubation system. The use of ASTER multispectral satellite imaging for the spatial scaling of benthic metabolic processes resulted in errors in E and net calcification (G) of 48 and 431% respectively, relative to estimates obtained using AISA hyperspectral airborne scanning. At 19 and 125%, the E and G errors relative to the AISA-based estimates were less pronounced for an analysis that used IKONOS multispectral satellite imagery to spatially extrapolate the chamber process measurements. Our scaling analysis indicates that the holistic calcification rate of the backreef platform of the northern Florida reef tract is negligible at 0.07 g CaCO3 m(-2) d(-1). All of the mapped biotopes in this reef zone are net heterotrophic, resulting in an estimated holistic excess production rate of -0.56 g C m(-2) d(-1), and an overall gross primary production to respiration ratio of 0.85. Based on our finding of ubiquitous heterotrophy, we infer that the backreef platform of the NFRT is a sink for external inputs of suspended particulate organic matter. Further, our results suggest that the inward advection of inorganic nutrients is not a dominant forcing mechanism for benthic biogeochemical function in the NFRT. We suggest that the degradation of the northern Florida reef tract may parallel the community phase shifts documented within other reef systems polluted by organic detritus.

Some HAB occurrences are different to observe because of their high spatial and temporal variability and their advection, once formed, by surface currents. A serious HAB occurred in the Bohai Sea during autumn 1998, causing the largest fisheries economic loss. The present study analyzes the formation, distribution, and advection of HAB using satellite SeaWiFS ocean color data and other oceanographic data. The results show that the bloom originated in the western coastal waters of the Bohai Sea in early September, and developed southeastward when sea surface temperature (SST) increased to 25-26 degrees C. The bloom with a high Chl-a concentration (6.5 mg m(-3)) in center portion covered an area of 60 x 65 km(2). At the end of September, the bloom decayed when SST decreased to 22-23 degrees C. The HAB may have been initiated by a combination of the river discharge nutrients in the west coastal waters and the increase of SST; afterwards it may have been transported eastward by the local circulation that was enhanced by northwesterly winds in late September and early October.

Yamase clouds frequently appear over the western North-Pacific region, off the east coast of the Sanriku district, Japan. They occur during the summer season under cool easterly winds blown from Okhotsk anticyclones. Here we discuss optical and microphysical properties estimated from shipboard experiments and satellite remote sensing for Yamase clouds observed in June 2003. This was the first time we were able to observe time-varying features of the marine boundary-layer accompanied with Yamase clouds from formation to decay. At the ship site, the cloud-base height and liquid-water-path, time-averaged during the June Yamase event, were 270 m and 60 gm(-2), respectively. At the same time it is revealed, from satellite remote sensing using the contemporary AVHRR/3 data on morning orbital NOAA-17, that the Yamase clouds were rather thin, stratiform low-level clouds, and their physical parameters gradually grew with time during the Yamase period. The optical thickness, effective particle radius, and liquid-water-path, averaged over the time and area, were estimated to be about 12, 12 mu m, and 110 gm(-2), respectively.																	1349-6476						2006	2						45	48		10.2151/sola.2006-012								WOS:000208289800012

Distinctive seabed mounds were found in one area; video images from the mounds showed coral reef formation, and grab samples recovered L. pertusa reef framework and rubble. Skeleton samples were dated to 3,800 years BP. Grab samples contained 123 species of fauna. The reef structures, termed the Mingulay Reef Complex, were identified as topographic mound-like structures from the bathymetric data and were also visible on the backscatter images. The location of the reefs coincides with Atlantic bottom waters, close to a primary productivity centre and mixing zone, in an area where currents are likely to be accelerated by rocky seafloor ridges.

Establishing levels of natural variability within and between marine ecosystems is a necessary prerequisite to this process and requires a monitoring programme which takes account of the issues of time, space and scale. In this paper, we argue that an ecosystem approach to managing the marine environment should take direct account of climate change indicators at a regional level if it is to cope with the unprecedented change expected as a result of human impacts on the earth climate system. We discuss the purpose of environmental monitoring and the importance of maintaining long-term time series. Recommendations are made on the use of these data in conjunction with modern extrapolation and integration tools (e.g. ecosystem models, remote sensing) to provide a diagnostic approach to the management of marine ecosystems, based on adaptive indicators and dynamic baselines.

J	Nakaoka, M				Nakaoka, M			Plant-animal interactions in seagrass beds: ongoing and future challenges for understanding population and community dynamics	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Seagrass beds are some of the most productive parts of coastal ecosystems, hosting a wide variety of associated fauna. This paper reviews recent studies of animal-plant interactions in seagrass beds, focusing particularly on studies conducted in Japan and Thailand. Although the positive effect of seagrass habitat structure on animals has been widely acknowledged, the magnitude of this effect varies greatly among studies. A comparative study on epifaunal communities and a manipulative experiment using an infaunal bivalve revealed that behavioral and life-history traits of component species and their interactions influence the observed variation. Some recent studies have challenged the previously accepted view that direct herbivory on seagrasses is rare, and has a minor effect on the seagrass community. A series of studies of dugong herbivory revealed that the marine mammal has great impacts not only on seagrass productivity but also on the infaunal community. Furthermore, it has been found that seed predators have a negative influence on seed production and the subsequent recruitment of seagrass. Recent studies have also demonstrated significant effects of fine-scale landscape patterns in seagrass vegetation on productivity, species interactions and community structure in seagrass beds. Future research integrating new concepts and theories in ecology, such as metapopulation and hierarchy theories, with new research tools, such as molecular-genetic analyses and remote-sensing techniques, may aid in developing a more comprehensive understanding of population and community dynamics in seagrass beds.																	1438-3896					DEC	2005	47	3					167	177		10.1007/s10144-005-0226-z								WOS:000233725100002

These major environment shifts are controlled by the high frequency sea-level changes of the Caspian Sea. The level of the Caspian Sea, now at 27 in below Global Sea Level (GSL), changes at rates of up to a hundred times as fast as global sea level, allowing observation of sedimentary processes on a decadal scale that would take millennia in an oceanic environment. The modem Kura delta is a river-dominated delta with some wave action along its north-eastern flank, and without tidal influence. Morphological and hydrological changes have been monitored for over 150 years, continuing up to the present day using remote sensing imagery. Offshore sparker survey data, onshore and offshore corings, biostratigraphical analysis and radiometric dating enable a reconstruction of the Holocene Kura delta. Four phases of delta progradation alternating with erosional transgressive surfaces have been identified, representing just as many cycles of sea-level fall and rise. The first cycle is represented by lowstand deposits truncated by a transgressive surface (TS1) at ca. 80 in below GSL. TS1 is overlain by several metres of laminated clays and silts, deposited during a Late Holocene forced regression (HI). These deposits are truncated by the prominent reflector (TS2), corresponding to the Derbent lowstand around 1500 yr BP and subsequent transgression. This transgressive surface is overlain by prograding shallowing upwards deposits, H2, in turn truncated by a third transgressive surface (TS3), correlated with a lowstand of ca. 32 in below GSL. The last phase, H3, comprises an onshore progradational unit followed by an aggradational unit with an offshore veneer of clays and silts, corresponding to the formation of the modem Kura delta that started at the beginning of the 19th century.

In an SST lattice data array, data value sinks describe heterogeneous drops in SST distribution as this is compared to more homogeneously distributed SST in the surrounding area. Using Arc/Info GIS, these thermal discontinuities are flagged and applied on SST and CHL imagery for the calculation of differences in SST and CHL patterns ( DSST and DCHL) inside and outside of these flagged areas. Spatially connected sinks that are characterized by simultaneous negative DSST and positive DCHL pattern are mapped as thermal fronts. Results include a time series of monthly front occurrence GIS maps in Eastern Mediterranean waters along with three calculated front characteristics ( DSST, DCHL and bathymetry). Comparisons between the mapped fronts and isobath distributions present clearly visible front-to-isobath spatial and shape associations while spatial analysis between front and wind data explains 66% of the number of mapped fronts.

An initial step in understanding sand accumulation in each of these roles is to identify its areal extent and change through time. Digitized aerial photographs and digital images provide common, inexpensive data sets that are generally underutilized for the purpose of marine substrate classification. Here we use only two bands, blue and green (470 and 550 nm), to demonstrate the utility of simple aerial photography in classifying marine substrate. Although these two are acquired from a hyperspectral data set, they represent blue and green in an RGB image such as commonly available in digitized aerial photographs. We add as a third band the second eigenchannel of a principal components analysis of these bands. Using an artificial neural network classification model, we identify submarine and subaerial sandy substrate in a digital image of a detached reef island in the Red Sea, Gezirat Siyul, Egypt. With careful selection of training and test groups, using small percentages of the total classified image, we create an efficient and accurate classification model. The model, trained to identify two classes, "sand" and "other than sand," produces a classified image that provides sand locations and approximate areal coverage.

The new sounding technique features rapid acquisition of large, high-quality data sets via variable swath widths that are independent of water depth. This advanced ALB system was deployed along the continental shelf of southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties), providing a contiguous data set for 160 km of coast from onshore to 6 km offshore. Image enhancement of the ALB digital data facilitates recognition of numerous seafloor features and bathymetric patterns. Bathymetric analysis of the 600-km(2) survey area on the continental shelf shows inherited lithologic features that are partly covered by surficial sediments. Primary parabathic (shore-parallel) provinces include: (1) nearshore rocky zones dominated by the Anastasia Formation, (2) coral-algal reef systems (Florida Reef Tract [FRT]), and (3) marine platforms (terraces). Sedimentary subprovinces include shoreface sands, interreefal sedimentary infills (coral rubble in basal sequences and near reef gaps), and finer-grained materials seaward of coral reefs. Tertiary topographic features include: (1) longshore bar and trough systems, shoals, sand sheets (flats), and diabathic (cross-shore) channels; (2) reef crests and ledges, forereef spur-and-groove topography, sediment ramps in large reef gaps, and incised paleo-river channels; and (3) drowned karst topography. Hierarchical organization (classification and mapping) of these bathymetric features is now possible for the first time because of the increased accuracy and density of ALB data. These data and related maps allow, for the first time, assessment of links between the influence of seabed morphology on wave transformation patterns and beach morphodynamics in southeast Florida.																	0749-0208					NOV	2005	21	6					1178	1194		10.2112/05A-0021.1								WOS:000233495200012

Satellite remote sensing offers great potential for this scope, although the interpretation of the spectral responses of shallow areas is complicated by the mixed signal coming from the water column and the bottom. This is particularly the case when using satellite data taken in few wide spectral channels, such as those of the Landsat TM and ETM+ sensors, which were not specifically designed for marine applications. Relying on the hypothesis that these data are anyway informative on shallow water conditions, an unsupervised procedure was developed to separate the spectral contributions of seawater and bottom on the basis of simple approximations. The procedure is based on the simulation of different water/bottom multispectral configurations up to find out that which best fits the observed data. The validation of the procedure was carried out by its application first to synthetic images and next to two TM and one ETM+ scenes taken over the Orbetello Lagoon in Central Italy. The outputs produced in the latter case were evaluated by comparison to existing ground references. In particular, correlation analyses were performed between the original and decomposed spectral signatures and the concentrations of optically active water constituents (pigments and yellow substance) measured "in situ" at dates close to those of the satellite data acquisitions. These analyses demonstrated the potential of the methodology, while also highlighting some limitations which could be overcome through the use of imagery taken by sensors with enhanced spectral and radiometric features.

Although such emissions cannot be fully reconciled with the known features of any light-emitting organism, these so-called "milky seas" are hypothesized to be manifestations of unusually strong bioluminescence produced by colonies of bacteria in association with a microalgal bloom in the surface waters. Because of their ephemeral nature and the paucity of scientific observations, an explanation of milky seas has remained elusive. Here, we report the first satellite observations of the phenomenon. An approximate to 15,400-km(2) area of the northwestern Indian Ocean, roughly the size of the state of Connecticut, was observed to glow over 3 consecutive nights, corroborated on the first night by a ship-based account. This unanticipated application of satellite remote-sensing technology provides insights pertaining to the formation and scale of these poorly understood events.

J	Werdell, PJ; Bailey, SW				Werdell, PJ; Bailey, SW			An improved in-situ bio-optical data set for ocean color algorithm development and satellite data product validation	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Global satellite ocean color instruments provide the scientific community a high-resolution means of studying the marine biosphere. Satellite data product validation and algorithm development activities both require the substantial accumulation of high-quality in-situ observations. The NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group maintains a local repository of in-situ marine bio-optical data, the SeaWiFS Biooptical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS), to facilitate their ocean color satellite validation analyses. Data were acquired from SeaBASS and used to compile a large set of coincident radiometric observations and phytoplankton pigment concentrations for use in biooptical algorithm development. This new data set, the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD), includes over 3400 stations of spectral water-leaving radiances, surface irradiances, and diffuse downwelling attenuation coefficients, encompassing chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 0.012 to 72.12 mg m(-3). Metadata, such as the date, time, and location of data collection, and ancillary data, including sea surface temperatures and water depths, accompany each record. This paper describes the assembly and evaluation of NOMAD, and further illustrates the broad geophysical range of stations incorporated into NOMAD. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bagheri, S; Peters, S; Yu, T				Bagheri, S; Peters, S; Yu, T			Retrieval of marine water constituents from AVIRIS data in the Hudson/Raritan Estuary	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper reports on the validation of bio-optical models in estuarine and nearshore (case 2) waters of New Jersey-New York to retrieve accurate water leaving radiance spectra and chlorophyll concentration from the NASA Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data complemented with in situ measurements. The study area-Hudson/Raritan Estuary-is a complex estuarine system where tidal and wind-driven currents are modified by freshwater discharges from the Hudson, Raritan, Hackensack, and Passaic rivers. Over the last century the estuarine water quality has degraded, in part due to eutrophication, which has disrupted the pre-existing natural balance, resulting in phytoplankton blooms of both increased frequency and intensity, increasing oxygen demand and leading to episodes of hypoxia. During 1999-2001 data acquisitions by NASA AVIRIS field measurements were obtained to establish hydrological optical properties of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary: (1) concurrent above- and below-surface spectral irradiance; (2) sampling for laboratory determination of inherent optical properties; and (3) concentrations of optically-important water quality parameters. We used a bio-optical model based on Gordon et al. to predict the sub-surface irradiance reflectance from optically important water constituents. Modelling of reflectance is a prerequisite for processing remote sensing data to desired thematic maps for input into the geographical information system (GIS) for use as a management too] in water quality assessment. A Radiative Transfer Code-MODTRAN-4-was applied to remove the effects of the atmosphere so as to infer the water leaving radiance from the AVIRS data. The results of this procedure were not satisfactory, therefore an alternative approach was tested to directly correct the AVIRIS image using modelled spectra based on measured optical characteristics. The atmospherically corrected AVIRIS ratio image was used to calculate a thematic map of water quality parameters (i.e. chlorophyll-a) concentration, which subsequently were integrated into a GIS for management of water quality purposes.

J	Melin, F; Berthon, JF; Zibordi, G				Melin, F; Berthon, JF; Zibordi, G			Assessment of apparent and inherent optical properties derived from SeaWiFS with field data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The knowledge of the absorption and scattering characteristics of the ocean supports diverse applications for studying biological and physical processes of marine ecosystems. The determination of the related inherent optical properties from remote sensing is addressed for a site located in the northern Adriatic Sea using coincident SeaWiFS images and field measurements. The proposed methodology first combines regional algorithms to determine the spectra of irradiance reflectance and diffuse attenuation coefficient from the normalized water leaving radiance by accounting for the bidirectional structure of the light field. These spectra are then used as inputs to an inverse model that yields the absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients of seawater (considered without the contribution of pure water). The uncertainties associated with the different steps in the sequence of calculations are quantified and discussed. Specifically, the analysis of 48 match-ups comparing in situ irradiance reflectance with that derived from remote sensing water leaving radiance shows mean absolute differences below 20% between 490 and 555 nm and approximately 30% at 443 and 670 nm. Lower discrepancies are obtained if more stringent criteria for the selection of match-ups are implemented (12-15% and 20-22%, respectively). The results obtained with 42 matchups show a reasonable agreement for the absorption coefficient from 412 to 490 nm (approximately 35%), the scattering coefficient from 443 to 555 nm (approximately 30%), and the attenuation coefficient in the spectral range 412-555 nm (approximately 30%). Based on 17 matchups, the comparison for the backscattering coefficient gives mean absolute differences in the range of 31-53%. The comparison between field and derived scattering properties suggests that the particulate scattering phase function inherent to the inverse model is not appropriate for the site considered. Finally, in the framework of the selected inversion scheme, uncertainties associated with the satellite derived irradiance reflectance in the blue and the determination of K-d at 490 tun through an empirical band ratio algorithm appear as the elements where improvements would be particularly needed to derive high quality spectra of inherent optical properties.

This unique resource is virtually intact, until recently being impacted only by local consumption. Increasing exports to Tahiti's market (up to 50 tonnes of wet matter y(-1)), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons (< 50 km(2)), have raised significant concerns for agencies charged with management of lagoonal resources. In order to evaluate whether the current harvesting pressure threatens long-term sustainability of this resource, it is necessary to estimate the total number of individual clams present and also the fraction of that stock that is currently targeted by fishers, who generally collect clams in very shallow waters (< 1 m), walking on the reef edges. Here, we present results for a pilot study evaluating this resource at Fangatau Atoll. Using a combination of data collected in situ and three remotely sensed images with different spatial resolution (1.5, 5.6, and 30 m), we estimate that the shallowest lagoonal areas (4.05 km(2) at depth < 6 m) harbour five classes of benthic habitat with significantly different clam areal covers and densities. Considering the cover/density values for each habitat class, 23.65 +/- 5.33 million clams (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) inhabit these 4.05 km(2). Assuming that current harvesting techniques will be maintained in the future, the commercially available stock represents 44% of the population located on 1.18 km(2) of the shallow lagoon. A comparison of results from the three remote sensing platforms indicates that high resolution, broadband multispectral sensors (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird) should provide the best existing platforms to conduct similar assessments elsewhere.

Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) ranged from 2.7 to 10.1 mg/L with an average of 5.65 +/- 1.70 mg/L. All spectra of CDOM had a common shape with maximal absorption in shorter wavelength and minimal absorption in longer wavelength. CDOM absorption coefficients at 280 nm and 355 nm were in the range 3.52-24.22 m(-1) (aver. age 8.69 +/- 4.76 m(-1)) and 0.53-8.08 m(-1) (average 2.03 +/- 1.65 m(-1)), respectively. The values of the DOC-specific absorption coefficient at 355 nm ranged from 0.09 to 0.80 L(mg org.C)(-1) m(-1). The exponential slope coefficient ranged from 0.015 to 0.023 nm(-1) with a mean value 0.020 +/- 0.002 nm(-1) over the 280-400 nm interval. Fluorescence emission at 450 nm, excited at 355 rim, had a mean value of 0.86 nm(-1). CDOM fluorescence and absorption, were significantly and positively correlated. The coefficient of variation between CDOM absorption and DOC concentration decreased with the increase of wavelength from 280 to 800 nm. The CDOM absorption measurements are of use to study regional distribution of CDOM, contribution of CDOM to light attenuation, and development of regional models for the optical properties of CDOM which allow higher precision in remote sensing applications of water quality monitoring.

Year-to-year variations of the averaged austral winter HIX (July-September), representative of the main upwelling season, were compared with (i) corresponding averages of the geostrophic alongshore component of the south-east trade wind (SET) between St. Helena Island in the south-west and Luanda/Angola in the north-east, (ii) the meridional distribution of surface waters colder than 13 degrees C to characterise intense Benguela upwelling (IBU), and (iii) the meridional position of the Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone (ABFZ) determined by means of sea surface temperature images for offshore distances between 50 and 400 km. Temporal changes of these parameters were investigated and showed that the frequency of consecutive years of strong and relaxed Benguela upwelling is characterised by a quasi-cycle of about 11-14 years. It is proposed that the index of the winter HIX may be used as a 'surveyor's rod' to describe interannual changes in the Benguela upwelling regime as well as those of the embedded marine ecosystem.

They extend for tens of kilometres, forming fracture intensification zones several hundred metres wide. WNW- to NW-oriented faults run parallel to the mountain fronts in the plains adjoining the central Hajar range then obliquely crosscut the mountains in the north. Motion along these faults explains how Quaternary marine terraces became elevated 190m above sea level. A second fault set strikes north to NNE. The associated juvenile topography suggests that they also accommodate recent uplift, subsidiary to the WNW-striking faults, with minor strike-slip and differential movement between various segments of the Hajar Mountains. Both fault systems, and the amount of Quaternary uplift (between 100 and 500 m), are similar to those in other active and ancient forebulge environments. Using the fracture patterns observed, it is proposed here that the Hajar range lies on the active forebulge of a collision zone between the NE margins of the Arabian plate, the Zagros fold belt and the Makran accretionary prism, which resulted in the recent uplift.

However our ability to predict and quantify the consequences of this change is severely limited by the paucity of in situ oceanographic measurements. Marine animals equipped with sophisticated oceanographic data loggers to study their behavior offer one solution to this problem because marine animals range widely across the world's ocean basins and visit remote and often inaccessible locations. However, unlike the information being collected from conventional oceanographic sensing equipment, which has been validated, the data collected from instruments deployed on marine animals over long periods has not. This is the first long-term study to validate in situ oceanographic data collected by animal oceanographers. We compared the ocean temperatures collected by leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic Ocean with the ARGO network of ocean floats and could find no systematic errors that could be ascribed to sensor instability. Animal-borne sensors allowed water temperature to be monitored across a range of depths, over entire ocean basins, and, importantly, over long periods and so will play a key role in assessing global climate change through improved monitoring of global temperatures. This finding is especially pertinent given recent international calls for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Earth observation system ( see http://iwgeo.ssc.nasa.gov/documents.asp?s=review) that includes the use of novel techniques for monitoring and understanding ocean and climate interactions to address strategic environmental and societal needs.

Recent advances in acoustic remote sensing technology have made it possible to obtain high-resolution (meter to sub-meter) digital elevation models (DEMs) of seafloor bathymetry that can rival or surpass those available for the terrestrial environment. The acquisition and processing of these data are expensive, however, requiring specialized equipment, expertise, and large amounts of both field and laboratory effort per unit area mapped. Further, the interpretation and classification of these data into maps of habitat type is typically (and appropriately) performed only by trained experts that are familiar with both seafloor geomorphology and the nature and limitations of the data sources. Because it is done visually, this interpretation can be very time-consuming and may yield subjective results that are not comparable from site-to-site or between individual interpreters. We applied an algorithmic terrain analysis approach to efficiently and objectively classify seafloor habitats using the quantifiable landscape metric Topographic Position Index (TPI). We used high-resolution multibeam bathymetry, together with precisely geolocated (+/- 5 m) ROV observations of fish distribution, to produce a preliminary genus-specific habitat suitability model for eight rockfish (Sebastes) species in the Del Monte shale beds of Monterey Bay, California. A high-resolution (2 m) multibeam bathymetry Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was generated and used to produce a derived TPI surface model using repeatable, algorithmic methods. This data layer, together with the positions and counts by species from 229 rockfish observations (2892 total fish) was then used to create preliminary predictive models of habitat suitability and fish distribution, as well as stock estimates for the study area. A second, independent fish observation data set was used to validate the models.																	0025-3324					FAL	2005	39	3					83	93		10.4031/002533205787442495								WOS:000233660600009

Here we show that remote sensing of internal waves by marine seismic reflection methods can provide quantitative information on internal wave energy and its spatial variability at high lateral resolution and full ocean depth over large volumes of the ocean. Seismic images of the Norwegian Sea water column show reflections that capture snapshots of finestructure displacements due to internal waves. Horizontal wave number spectra derived from digitized reflection horizons in the open ocean compare favorably to the Garrett-Munk tow spectrum of oceanic internal wave displacements. Spectra within 10 km laterally and 200 m vertically of the continental slope show enhanced energy likely associated with internal wave-sloping boundary interactions.

That ice may nucleate as fast ice at the shelf front, by growth at the sea surface within rifts, or by basal accretion. Here, we investigate the role of such ice in the flow of the Brunt Ice Shelf and adjacent Stancomb-Wills ice tongue, along the Caird Coast of Antarctica. Much of the shelf system is severely rifted, with locally derived ice filling the space between rift walls and around ice rafts. A series of numerical experiments that account for thermal properties of the different ices is used to investigate the influence of that mixture of sea and marine ice on the kinematics and dynamics of the shelf system. The simulations are constrained by a variety of satellite remote-sensing data. We find that the locally derived ice forms a dynamic connection between the ice tongue and the Caird Coast, effectively creating an embayment where no coastal embayment exists. This may have implications for the expansion of ice shelves along arctic coasts during past glaciations.

J	Brown, RA				Brown, RA			Comments on the synergism between the analytic planetary boundary-layer model and remote sensing data	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												This paper is adapted from a presentation at the session of the European Geophysical Society meeting in 2002 honouring Joost Businger. It documents the interaction of the non-linear planetary boundary-layer (PBL) model (UW-PBL) and satellite remote sensing of marine surface winds from verification and calibration studies for the sensor model function to the current state of verification of the model by satellite data. It is also a personal history where Joost Businger had seminal input to this research at several critical junctures. The first scatterometer in space was on SeaSat in 1978, while currently in orbit there are the QuikSCAT and ERS-2 scatterometers and the WindSat radiometer. The volume and detail of data from the scatterometers during the past decade are unprecedented, though the value of these data depends on a careful interpretation of the PBL dynamics. The model functions (algorithms) that relate surface wind to sensor signal have evolved from straight empirical correlation with simple surface-layer 10-m winds to satellite sensor model functions for surface pressure fields. A surface stress model function is also available. The validation data for the satellite model functions depended crucially on the PBL solution. The non-linear solution for the flow of fluid in the boundary layer of a rotating coordinate system was completed in 1969. The implications for traditional ways of measuring and modelling the PBL were huge and continue to this day. Unfortunately, this solution replaced an elegant one by Ekman with a stability/finite perturbation equilibrium solution. Consequently, there has been great reluctance to accept this solution. The verification of model predictions has been obtained from the satellite data.																	0006-8314					AUG	2005	116	2					187	199		10.1007/s10546-004-1598-x								WOS:000232204600004

ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Movements of animals provisioning offspring by central place foraging extend from short, highly local trips where food is brought back essentially unchanged from its normal condition to extensive interseasonal inovement where the offspring are nourished from body reserves built up during the adult's absence from the breeding site. Here, appropriate strategies for maximizing lifetime reproductive success depend on the abundance and location of prey in relation to breeding sites and the energetics and speed of travel of the animal. Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus inagellanicus undertake central place movemerits that are particularly variable during the incubation period; trips may last from a single day to over three weeks depending on colony locality. We reasoned that site-specific variability in prey distribution and abundance is responsible for this. Remote-sensing systems attached to 92 penguins from six different colonies over the species distributional range over the Patagonian Shelf were used to determine space use and foraging patterns in an attempt to understand the observed patterns. Birds in the north and south of the latitudinal range were essentially monophagic, feeding primarily oil anchovies Engraulis anchoita and sprats Sprattus fuegensis, respectively, both species that are to be found relatively close to the colonies. Penguins in the center of the distributional range, where these pelagic school fish prey are essentially absent at that time of the year, traveled either north or south, to the same regions utilized by their conspecifics, presumably to exploit the same prey. A simple model is used to clarify patterns and can be used to predict which movement strategy is likely to be best according to colony location. During chick rearing, southerly movement of anchovies and northerly movement of sprats mean that Magellanic Penguins in the center of the distributional range may benefit, although the abundance of these fish is considered to be less than that closer to the Magellanic Penguin range limits. The extensive time involved in the foraging trips during incubation coupled with the postulated poorer prey conditions during the chick-rearing phase may help explain why Magellanic Penguin colony sizes in the center of the range are not elevated.

A dense scallop bed was surveyed in 2002, with a QTC VIEW Series IV acoustic ground-discrimination system (AGDS) connected to a 38 kHz, 7 degrees split-beam SIMRAD EK60 scientific echosounder. In 2003, a 50 kHz, 42 degrees single-beam SUZUKI ES-2025 echosounder was connected to a QTC VIEW Series V AGDS. The QTC VIEW data were analysed with QTC IMPACT following the standard procedures and classified into acoustic classes. Several approaches were tested: unsupervised and supervised survey strategies directed to specific benthic communities. The SIMRAD EK60 seabed volume-backscattering strength (S-v) was submitted to a principal component analysis (PCA), before and after removal of a depth trend, and the scores on the first 10 principal components were classed by a K-means cluster analysis. The same seabed Sv data were submitted to stepwise discriminant analysis whose training data sets were defined with the ground-truth photographs using different groupings: biotope types, community types, and finally scallop-density classes. All the QTC AGDS approaches failed to reveal the scallop bed, community structures, or biotopes. The QTC classifications mimicked the bathymetry with a strong correlation of the acoustic classes with depth. The seabed S, PCA + K-means approach presented similar depth-dependence, but, the PCA + K-means on the S,. residuals revealed the scallop bed. The discriminant analysis was the best solution for the scallop density with a general classification success rate of 75% and up to 91% for the highest density class. The Sv signature of the scallop bed is presented, and the most discriminant part of the acoustic signal is identified.																	1054-3139					AUG	2005	62	5					966	983		10.1016/j.icesjms.2005.03.007								WOS:000230998900013

In this study, phytoplankton is the principal component together with salinity and temperature for describing the water dynamics in the Danish marine waters. A major obstacle for accurate monitoring of phytoplankton (chl-alpha) is the very dynamic nature of phytoplankton and the water masses encompassing the algae. This can be overcome by combining the very coarse temporal resolution data from the traditional monitoring programme to validate hydrodynamic modelling together with remote sensing. DHI Water and Environment's 3D modelling tool MIKE 3, which is a dynamical ecological model, has been applied to the Danish marine waters covering the Baltic sea through the inner Danish straits and extended to the North Sea. MIKE 3 is a commercially available software system that has been used in a wide variety of applications concerning 3D studies of hydrodynamics in the marine environment. MIKE 3 is an operational system with quick, less expensive and easily accessible assessments of the state and development in phytoplankton with appropriate scaling of resolutions. The paper concludes that a combination of traditional monitoring with ship, dynamical modelling of hydrodynamics and eutrophication in combination with remote sensing of chl-alpha concentrations of surface waters offers the ideal tools to enhance the temporal and spatial description of large water bodies. The results presented cover the period January to September 1999. The 3D model is verified and calibrated using in situ measurements from various monitoring stations in the Danish marine waters and validated against satellite images from SeaWiFS. The data basis for this study has been two national programmes both related to the monitoring of the coastal environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bouman, H; Platt, T; Sathyendranath, S; Stuart, V				Bouman, H; Platt, T; Sathyendranath, S; Stuart, V			Dependence of light-saturated photosynthesis on temperature and community structure	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS												Using data collected in the Arabian Sea and on the Nova Scotian Shelf we examined the relationships between temperature, phytoplankton taxonomic composition (indexed by pigment composition) and the size structure (indexed by chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient at 676 nm), Chlorophyll-a biomass and the light-saturated photosynthesis parameter p(m)(B). Our results show that changes in phytoplankton community structure for the Scotian Shelf closely follow changes in temperature. In the Arabian Sea the relationship between phytoplankton community structure and temperature was less striking and fluctuations in phytoplankton pigment composition were strongly related to Chlorophyll-a biomass. The light-saturated photosynthesis parameter p(m)(B) was correlated with temperature for the Scotian Shelf. When we compared data collected on the Scotian Shelf with the temperature-dependent function of Eppley (1972. Fishery Bulletin 70, 1063-1085), the model fitted the data remarkably well. For the Arabian Sea data, however, only a weak temperature dependence in p(m)(B) was observed, which may be a result of a strong negative correlation between ambient nitrate concentration and temperature. Our results also show that for both the Scotian Shelf and the Arabian Sea, diatom-dominated waters had similarly low p(m)(B) values even though the temperatures of the two systems were markedly different. The absorptive characteristics of phytoplankton on the Scotian Shelf were well correlated with p(m)(B), thus providing another potential predictor of p(m)(B) that may, in the future, be routinely accessible by remote sensing. The contrasting relationships among community structure, temperature, and primary production observed in the two study regions suggest that primary production algorithms incorporating such information could be developed and applied on a domain-specific basis. These algorithms should be centred on knowledge of the relationships between physical forcing, community structure and phytoplankton photophysiology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kerbaol, V; Collard, F				Kerbaol, V; Collard, F			SAR-derived coastal and marine applications: From research to operational products	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has now successfully demonstrated its capacity to uniquely provide valuable high-resolution information for coastal applications (oil-spill monitoring, ship detection, shallow-water bathymetry mapping, sea-ice monitoring, high-resolution wind fields, coastal wave fields). However, it appears that the operational use of SAR-derived products still remains limited, particularly in Europe. Although costs and sampling rate are often invoked to explain this limitation, it also appears that the SAR-instrument capabilities are generally poorly known within the operational community. Consequently, no real initiative currently involves the sustainable use of SAR in the main European projects for operational oceanography nor meteorology. Conversely, other countries such as Norway and United States are now moving into the use of SAR on an operational basis for coastal ocean monitoring. Significant efforts are being led by these countries to develop and harmonize such a monitoring system and extend the number of locations. In order to promote the potential of SAR to routinely scrutinize our coastal environment, the objective of this paper is to provide an overview of current SAR-related issues, including a brief technical system description (coverage, revisit time, etc.) and qualitative and quantitative descriptions of operational marine products. The prospects for achieving true operational usage and improving these products will then be considered in terms of requirements (satellite receiving station, revisit time, low data costs).																	0364-9059	1558-1691				JUL	2005	30	3					472	486		10.1109/JOE.2005.857505								WOS:000235420300002						
J	Holland, CW; Dettmer, J; Dosso, SE				Holland, CW; Dettmer, J; Dosso, SE			Remote sensing of sediment density and velocity gradients in the transition layer	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The geoacoustic properties of marine sediments, e.g., bulk density and compressional velocity, commonly exhibit large variations in depth near the water-sediment interface. This layer, termed the transition layer, is typically of 0(10(-1)-10(0)) in in thickness. Depth variations within the transition layer may have important implications for understanding and modeling acoustic interaction with the seabed, including propagation and reverberation. In addition, the variations may contain significant clues about the underlying depositional or erosional processes. Characteristics of the transition layer can be measured directly (e.g., coring) or remotely. Remote measurements have the advantage of sampling without disturbing the sediment properties; they also have the potential to be orders of magnitude faster and less expensive than direct methods. It is shown that broadband seabed reflection data can be exploited to remotely obtain the depth dependent density and velocity profiles in the transition layer to high accuracy. A Bayesian inversion approach, which accounts for correlated data errors, provides estimates and uncertainties for the geoacoustic properties. These properties agree with direct (i.e., core) measurements within the uncertainty estimates. (c) 2005 Acoustical Society of America.

In situ air velocity measurements are used as a basis for the comparison with radar measurements of turbulence energy and dissipation, and integral length-scale, after correcting for the effects of velocity averaging within the pulse resolution volume and random uncorrelated noise. One essential step for this study is to estimate the contribution to the fluctuations in Doppler velocity due to the terminal velocity of hydrometeors. To do this, we use microphysics probe measurements of the spatial distribution of the drop counts in each size bin. We find a small velocity standard deviation (0.05 to 0.1 m s(-1)) contributed by the radar-measured drizzle fall velocity and a substantial negative correlation between air vertical velocity and this fall velocity in the upper part of the cloud. This correlation has an impact on the turbulent energy and dissipation deduced from the Doppler velocity. However, it does not significantly affect the integral scales, which are in good agreement with the in situ measurements. Thus, the radar enables us to obtain the profile of this key variable through the entire cloud-capped boundary layer. We obtain estimates of the dissipation in the lower 2/3 of the boundary layer that are in excellent agreement with the in situ measurements and consistent with the predominant production terms in the turbulent kinetic energy budget.

However, information regarding its spatial and temporal distribution remains sparse. Trichodesmium has unique optical properties that should allow for its spectral signature to be detectable in satellite ocean color data sets. Here, a global data set of concurrent measurements of Trichodesmium abundance and radiometric reflectance was compiled and used to develop bio-optical models for Trichodesmium. The most robust global model related the water-leaving radiance signal to the identification of an occurrence of a Trichodesmium bloom above a threshold value of 3200 trichomes L(-1). Using the in situ data set, this model is trained to successfully predict Trichodesmium blooms (similar to 92%) while minimizing false positive retrievals (similar to 16% of nonbloom observations). A validation of the approach applied to Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor ( SeaWiFS) ocean color imagery shows that the model correctly predicts 76% of the bloom occurrences of an independent validation data set of in situ Trichodesmium observations. Ultimately, maps of Trichodesmium bloom occurrence will provide a means of addressing the ecology of Trichodesmium and its contribution to new production of the world oceans.

The X-band marine radar is an imaging radar that provides instantaneous distributions of wave crests and shorelines along the shore. Time-averaged radar images were analyzed to estimate the horizontal positions of shorelines. Simultaneously, the water surface level was measured at the pier and at the fishery port nearby to determine the elevation of the shoreline. Radar measurements were conducted from high to low tide or vice versa to trace the bottom profile and estimate the foreshore slope in the intertidal range. The horizontal positions of the shoreline were measured within an error of 10 m. The change of shoreline positions and intertidal foreshore slopes after attacks of high waves is depicted to demonstrate the potential of the radar measurements in capturing essential characteristics of coastal morphology.																	0578-5634					JUN-SEP	2005	47	2-3					91	107		10.1142/S0578563405001203								WOS:000232293600002

This estimate agrees well with a model estimate based on nutrient utilisation but is a factor of 2-5 less than published primary production estimates made by remote sensing of this area. The seasonal distribution of particulate primary production in open Greenland Sea waters followed the seasonal distribution of surface irradiance with a peak in June, indicating that light is the primary factor governing primary production in the area. At stations along the ice edge, blooms were recorded in both June and August, suggesting a pattern of repeated blooms during the summer season at the ice edge. Subsurface phytoplankton peaks were a persistent feature in the open Greenland Sea from May to August. These peaks were consisted of actively photosynthesising phytoplankton and up to 90% of total water column particulate primary production was estimated to occur in association with these peaks. Diatoms dominated the phytoplankton community during the spring bloom and in the Polar Water during August. Size distribution analyses of the phytoplankton communities indicated that the relative abundance of large cells compared to small cells was greatest in May as compared to June and August. No significant differences were noted between June and August in the slope of the phytoplankton size distribution spectra. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients were measurable in surface waters on all cruises. Only in August were there some indications (altered Redfield ratios and higher nutrient concentrations in subsurface chlorophyll peaks than at the surface) of nutrient depletion of surface waters. Implications for food web structure and carbon flux of these patterns in phytoplankton activity and distribution are discussed. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bulk density, compressional wave speed and attenuation are fundamental physical properties of these sediments required for predicting the response of the seabed for diverse branches of marine science. The traditional coring approach is time and labor-intensive, with large uncertainties associated with sediment disturbance in the sampling phase. Acoustic methods offer the advantages of remote sensing, i.e., sampling the sediment structure without mechanical disturbance and a significantly larger seabed coverage rate per unit time. Two different acoustic methods are described: one using short-range single-bounce interactions with the seabed, and the second using long-range modal propagation to infer the sediment properties. The relative strengths and sensitivities of each approach are explored through simulations guided by experience with measured data.																	0025-3235					JUN	2005	26	2-4					267	274		10.1007/s11001-005-3723-8								WOS:000233876500016

Moreover, the community structure and the size structure of phytoplankton assemblages also appear to be under physical control. Areas of the ocean with common physical forcing (ecological provinces) may be expected to have phytoplankton communities that respond in a similar fashion to changes in local forcing, and with ecophysiological rate parameters that are predictable from local environmental conditions. In modelling the marine ecosystem, relevant parameters may be assigned according to a partition into ecological provinces. To the extent that physical forcing of the ocean is not constant within or between years, the boundaries of the provinces should be considered as dynamic. The dynamics and the associated changes in taxa can be revealed by remote sensing.																	0214-8358	1886-8134				JUN	2005	69			1			55	73		10.3989/scimar.2005.69s155								WOS:000229942800005

Twelve episodes from the years of 1999 to 2001 are selected corresponding to conditions of overcast, liquid water single-layered cloud. In contrast to previous studies of marine boundary layer clouds, variability in cloud-top height in these clouds is comparable to that of cloud base, and most continental clouds appear to be subadiabatic. In agreement with previous studies of marine boundary layer clouds, variations in LWP are well related to the variations in cloud thickness. LWP variability exhibits significantly negative correlation with the static stability of the inversion near cloud top; larger cloud variability is associated with less stable inversions. A previously developed parameterization of LWP variability is extended to account for the differing conditions of continental clouds. The relationship between fluctuations in LWP and cloud thickness suggests that cloud parameterizations treating variations in LWP at these scales should include the effects of subgrid-scale fluctuations in cloud thickness. One such treatment is proposed within the context of a statistical cloud scheme.

Laser bathymetric survey tools have applicability in clear coastal (Case 11) waters down to -70 meters depth. Deployed along the southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties) coast, an advanced ALB system provided a continuous dataset for 160 kilometers of coast from onshore to 5 kilometers offshore. Digital terrain models developed from this high-density bathymetric data permitted recognition A numerous seafloor features and bathymetric patterns from different image formats. Bathymetric analysis of the 600-km(2) survey area on the narrow continental shelf shows inherited lithologic features that are partly covered by surficial sediments. Primary parabathic provinces include: (1) nearshore rocky zones dominated by the Anastasia Formation, (2) coral-algal reef systems (Florida Reef Tract [FRT]), and (3) marine terraces. Secondary sedimentary subprovinces include shoreface sands, inter-reefial sedimentary infills (coral rubble in basal sequences and near reef gaps), and finer-grained materials seaward of the FRT. Tertiary topographic features include: (1) longshore bar and trough systems, shoals, sand sheets, and diabathic channels; (2) reef crests and ledges, forereef spurs and grooves, sediment ramps in large reef gaps, and incised paleo-river channels; and (3) drowned karst topography. Hierarchical organization of these bathymetric features is now possible for the first time because of the increased accuracy and density of bathymetric data obtained by ALB systems.																	0749-0208					MAY	2005	21	3					501	514		10.2112/05-756A.1								WOS:000229408900011

Near shore marine applications include: mapping breakwaters, piers, navigation structures, pilings, and vessel traffic patterns. The application driving this research is the development of a surveillance system for the Canadian Coast Guard. As a result, a new and innovative application of small target detection techniques is being developed at the Department of Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering, UNB, Canada. This work is being done in support of the development of a strategic decision making toot to be used to predict where in Canadian waters marine incidents are most likely to occur. Previous research in the use of hyperspectral imaging for search and rescue, resulted in the development of fast, nonparametric "spatio-spectral" template subpixel object detection algorithm. The results of this work are being adapted and enhanced for use with the new, commercially available spaceborne high-resolution optical imagery. Research is being performed on the employment of a weighted Euclidean distance metric to enhance the "spatio-spectral" template by exploiting the variance/covariance information surrounding a potential target. The detection results using the new weighted Euclidean distance metric were excellent. The best results were had using a 3 X 3 kernel with all 16 targets being detected.

Continuous land/sea terrain was mapped by merging Digital Elevation Models (DEM) with satellite-derived bathymetry. Benthic habitat characterizations were created by-unsupervised classifications of Landsat imagery clustered using field data, and produced maps with an estimated overall accuracy of > 75% (Tau coefficient > 0.65). These were merged with Geocover-LC (land use/land cover) data to create continuous land/sea cover maps. Image pairs from different dates were analyzed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA) in order to detect areas of change in the marine environment over two different time intervals: 2000 to 2001, and 1991 to 2003. This activity demonstrates the capabilities of Landsat imagery to produce continuous summit-to-sea maps, as well as detect certain changes in the shallow-water marine environment, providing a valuable tool for efficient coastal zone monitoring and effective management and conservation.																	0034-7744					MAY	2005	53			1			185	193										WOS:000230498900021	17465158

This is being met both by the analysis of more samples (to better describe variability and temporal change) and by the deployment of instrumented platforms that gather data over long time periods. To meet these requirements in the hostile conditions at sea, a range of sensors based on physical, chemical and biological responses is being developed. These sensors have applications in laboratory analysis of collected samples, during field studies and directly in situ at remote sites for real-time observations of environmental trends.

The detection technology relies on using a carbon fiber as the working electrode, and applying a rapid and sensitive square-wave voltammogram for scanning. This submersible, pulsed-voltammetric, 3-electrode electrochemical sensor is mounted to a remotely operated surface vehicle with vision detection capability. The use of vision enhances the sensor package by allowing detection of and placement below detection limits. A wireless communication unit provides the ability to monitor and detect in real time. The detection scheme is based upon a stepwise reduction of the nitro aromatic groups on the explosive molecule first to hydroxylamines, and then followed by the conversion of the later to amine groups. The reduction potentials provide the method selectivity for a specific explosive, and the current required per unit time determines the concentration of the targeted explosive in an aqueous media. Successful field test data have been obtained which are comparable to those measured with laboratory instruments. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nobileau, D; Antoine, D				Nobileau, D; Antoine, D			Detection of blue-absorbing aerosols using near infrared and visible (ocean color) remote sensing observations	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												An algorithm is presented, which is designed to identify blue-absorbing aerosols from near infrared and visible remote-sensing observations, as they are in particular collected by satellite ocean color sensors. The technique basically consists in determining an error budget at one wavelength around 5 10 nm, based on a first-guess estimation of the atmospheric path reflectance as if the atmosphere was of a maritime type, and on a reasonable hypothesis about the marine signal at this wavelength. The budget also includes the typical calibration uncertainty and the natural variability in the ocean optical properties. Identification of blue-absorbing aerosols is then achieved when the error budget demonstrates a significant over-correction of the atmospheic signal when using non-absorbing maritime aerosols. Implementation of the algorithm is presented, and its application to real observations by the MERIS and SeaWiFS ocean color sensors is discussed. The results demonstrate the skill of the algorithm in various regions of the ocean where absorbing aerosols are present, and for two different sensors. A validation of the results is also performed against in situ data from the AERONET, and further illustrates the skill of the algorithm and its general applicability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Large variations in the absorption coefficient of phytoplankton are found. The absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 urn ranged from 0.006 m(-1) to 0.484 m(-1), with an average value of 0.067 m(-1). The chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton is also a bio-optical variable, with a spectrally averaged value of 0.025 m(2) (.) mg(-1). The variations of chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient are mainly attributed to pigment composition of phytoplankton and package effect. The chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton decreases with the increasing of chlorophyll a concentration. This relationship can be described by a power law function, with the parameters and the coefficient of determination r(2) as functions of wavelength, but the parameters describing the relationships in present study differed from that in Case 1 waters, thus the regional adjustment of model parameters was of particular significance for improving the accuracy of bio-optical algorithms for estimation of Chl-a concentration and primary production from remotely sensed data. Regression analysis of reflectance (R-D) ratio and absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (a(ph)) indicates a close correlation between them, which means that it is possible to retrieve absorption coefficient of phytoplankton using ocean color remote sensing data in optically complex coastal waters.																	1002-0071	1745-5391				APR	2005	15	4					342	350		10.1080/10020070512331342210								WOS:000229450000009						
J	Etnoyer, P				Etnoyer, P			Seamount resolution in satellite-derived bathymetry	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												I compare satellite-derived global relief data on 13 seamounts in the northeast Pacific Ocean to echosounder-derived multibeam values from the Gulf of Alaska Seamount Expeditions and the West Coast Seamounts and Ridges Multibeam Surveys for peak height, latitude, longitude, and midsection area. I find Smith and Sandwell's (1997) global sea floor topography relatively accurate for peak geoposition but generally deeper than multibeam by 192 m (132 m). Cell size alone can explain 50-90% of peak height variation, suggesting higher-resolution geodetic altimetry could improve the accuracy of these estimates. Nevertheless, midsection areas overlap by 80 +/- 11%. The altimetric technique clearly resolves the presence and general form of numerous unnamed deep seamounts, though predicted seamount peak height estimates for small features may vary from their true depth by up to 50%. These findings support high-end estimates of global seamount abundance since small seamount features (similar to 1200 m relief) revealed by satellite may, in actuality, be quite substantial features (similar to 2500 m relief).

J	Ghosh, S; Osborne, S; Smith, MH				Ghosh, S; Osborne, S; Smith, MH			On the importance of cumulus penetration on the microphysical and optical properties of stratocumulus clouds	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Owing to their extensive spatial coverage, stratocumulus clouds play a crucial role in the radiation budget of the earth. Climate models need an accurate characterisation of stratocumulus in order to provide an accurate forecast. However, remote sensing as well as in-situ observations reveal that on several occasions, cumulus clouds present below the stratocumulus, often have a significant impact on the main stratocumulus microphysical properties. This was observed during the ACE-2 (Aerosol Characterisation Experiment-2) campaign designed to study the impact of polluted continental air on stratocumulus formation. In this paper we used a detailed micro-physical chemical parcel model to quantify the extent of this cumulus-stratocumuls coupling. In addition, we made extensive use of microphysical observations from the C-130 aircraft that was operated during ACE-2. For the ACE-2 case studies considered in this paper, our analysis revealed that the chemical, microphysical and optical characteristics of the main stratocumulus cloud deck had significant contributions from cumulus clouds that often penetrated the stratocumulus deck. The amount of fine mode ionic species, the average droplet number concentrations, the effective radii and the optical depths during the flight A562 (when cumulus clouds interacted with the main stratocumulus) were estimated and model runs that included this effect yielded microphysical and optical properties which compared more favourably with the observations than the runs which did not. This study highlights the importance of including these cumulus effects in stratocumulus related modelling studies.																	1680-7316					MAR 7	2005	5						755	765		10.5194/acp-5-755-2005								WOS:000227485400002

Six sea-breeze events are analyzed with a particular focus on 25 June 2001. Advection of cool and humid marine air over land has a profound influence on the daytime ABL characteristics. This impact decreases rapidly with the inland distance from the sea. Nearby the coast (3 km inland), the mixing height Zi rises up to 750 m and falls down after 15:00 (UT) when the breeze flow reaches its maximum intensity. A more classical evolution of the ABL is observed at only 11-km inland where Zi culminates in the morning and stabilizes in the afternoon at about 1000 m height. Fine inspection of the data revealed an oscillation of the sea-breeze with a period about 2 h 47 min. This feature, clearly discernable for 3 days at least, is present in several atmospheric variables such as wind, temperature, not only at the ground but also aloft in the ABL as observed by sodar/RASS and UHF wind profilers. In particular, the mixing height Zi deduced from UHF profilers observations is affected also by the same periodicity. This pulsated sea-breeze is observed principally above Marseille and, at the northern and eastern shores of the Berre pond. In summary, the periodic intrusion over land of cool marine air modifies the structure of the ABL in the vicinity of the coast from the point of view of stability, turbulent motions and pollutants concentration. An explanation of the source of this pulsated sea-breeze is suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ZONING AND MONITORING DOMINANT MANGROVE COMMUNITIES OF A PART OF THE MARINE NATIONAL PARK, GULF OF KACHCHH	PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Mangroves of the Marine National Park constitute the second largest patch of mangroves in Gujarat, extending up to 11,000 ha, comprising six species of mangroves. Earlier studies carried out using remote sensing data pertained to baseline data generation and mapping and monitoring the mangroves (density-wise) of the Park from 1975 to 1993. Using IRS 1C/1D LISS III data (1998-2001) supported by ground data, the distribution of different mangrove communities in the Park has been attempted. Amongst various image-processing techniques, band ratioing followed by supervised classification gave the best result (classification accuracy was 92%). Avicennia community is the most dominant community accounting for more than 70% of the area. The Rhizophora community occupies the inward margins of the creeks and the Ceriops community is present in the interior regions. The ecotone between the marsh and mangrove communities has been identified as the transitional mangroves (Avicennia alba, Sueada), representing the transition from the less saline mangrove to the highly saline marsh community. The zoning of the mangroves has also helped in assessing the diversity of the region. Based on the richness of species, three areas, namely Bhains Bid, North-east Dide Ka Bet and South-east Chhad Island have been identified as highly diverse (most suitable area for preservation).

This platform is a mini-catamaran with two hulls 1m long and set 0.7m apart, fitted with optical sensors. It can be used far away from an oceanographic ship to avoid its hull influencing the measurement. Reflectance measurements were performed with a TriOS radiance sensor placed +2cm or -2cm from the water surface and a TriOS irradiance sensor. Tests were carried out in calm seas and with cloud cover. The processing to derive marine radiances from raw measurements is detailed. When the radiance sensor is above the interface, it limits the sky reflections on the targeted surface and the radiance is identical to that deduced from measurements below the surface. When the sensor is placed at +3cm above-water or higher, glint affects the measurements. The mini-catamaran shows a good ability to measure marine reflectance with an adapted measurement protocol. Except for very turbid waters, it seems preferable to perform upwelling radiance measurements below the surface. (C) 2005 Optical Society of America.

The relative share of CDOM absorption in the total absorption of blue light can reach 80%. This causes a high correlation between the CDOM absorption coefficient a(y)(400) and irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(412). The seasonal variations of CDOM and particulate absorption have a combined effect on the magnitude and shape of the irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient spectra, which is represented by a shift of the maximum transmission wavelength towards the red part of the spectrum. Such an effect has been observed in the Gulf of Gdansk during recent experiments. CDOM absorption also influences the shape of remote sensing reflectance spectra. Appropriate spectral bands for the construction of a local, empirical, remote sensing algorithm for quantification of CDOM absorption are proposed, based on the seasonal variability of remote sensing reflectance spectra. The empirical relationships between CDOM absorption and downwelling irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient and spectral reflectance are presented and their potential for quantifying CDOM absorption is explored. The CDOM absorption coefficient is highly correlated with downwelling irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient in the blue. The estimation of CDOM absorption using the downwelling irradiance measurements can be achieved with low errors: -4.6% systematic and 25.3% random. The estimation of CDOM absorption from empirical relationships between absorption and remote sensing reflectance suffers lower accuracy: 4% for systematic and 32% for random errors of estimates.

J	Turner, J; Klaus, R				Turner, J; Klaus, R			Coral reefs of the Mascarenes, Western Indian Ocean	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The reefs of the Mascarenes differ in structure and stage of development. Mauritius is the oldest island, bound by a discontinuous fringing reef and small barrier reef, with large lagoon patch reefs. Rodrigues has nearly continuous fringing reefs bounding an extensive lagoon with deep channels and few patch reefs. Reunion, the youngest island, has short stretches of narrow fringing reefs along southwestern coasts. The islets of St Brandon are bound to the east by an extensive arc of fringing reef. Reef mapping of the Mascarenes using satellite imagery provides an estimate of 705 km 2 of shallow reef habitats. These areas have been modified over geological time by changes in sea level, ocean-atmosphere disturbances and biological and chemical forcing. Further modification has resulted from historical changes in land-use patterns. Recent economic development has placed many of these reefs at risk from anthropogenic impact. The reefs of the Mascarenes have escaped mass mortality from bleaching to date, which increases their conservation significance within the wider Indian Ocean. The reefs are poorly protected. A case study shows how a geographic information system incorporating reef-habitat maps can help formulate and demonstrate Marine protected Area boundaries.																	1364-503X					JAN 15	2005	363	1826					229	250		10.1098/rsta.2004.1489								WOS:000225970100021	15598634					
J	Stevens, B				Stevens, B			Atmospheric moist convection	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES	Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences											Various forms of atmospheric moist convection are reviewed through a consideration of three prevalent regimes: stratocumulus; trade-wind; and deep, precipitating, maritime convection. These regimes are chosen because they are structural components of the general circulation of the atmosphere and because they highlight distinguishing features of this polymorphous phenomenon. In particular, the ways in which varied forms of moist convection communicate with remote parts of the flow through mechanisms other than the rearrangement of fluid parcels are emphasized. These include radiative, gravity wave, and/or microphysical (precipitation) processes. For each regime, basic aspects of its phenomenology are presented along with theoretical frameworks that have arisen to help rationalize the phenomenology. Recent developments suggest that the increased capacity for numerical simulation and increasingly refined remote sensing capabilities bodes well for major advances in the coming years.

Response parameters examined were P-turnover time, bacterial production and abundance, chlorophyll a, other phytopigments, abundance of different pico and nanophytoplankton groups, primary production rates, abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates. The addition of fresh Saharan dust (range: 0.2-4.9 mg 1(-1)) and the subsequent nutrient release triggered an increase in phytopigments and primary production, while no response was detected for pre-leached dust particles. Most responses were linearly related to the amount of fresh dust added. Synechococcus and prymnesiophytes increased in abundance along with cellular pigment content while Prochlorococcus disappeared, heterotrophic bacteria increased production rates, and ciliates showed a small increase in cell density. A less clear response was recorded by in situ measurements following a Saharan dust storm during a cruise in the Levantine Basin in May 2001. The calculated amount of nutrients and dust particles delivered by such an event to a 15-m thick mixed surface layer is low (similar to 0.3 nmol P1(-1), similar to 9 nmol N1(-1) and 0.06 mg dust 1(-1)), falling close to the lowest dust addition in our microcosm experiment. Even so, an enhancement of phosphate turnover time, a sharp decline of Prochlorococcus abundance, and slight increases in chlorophyll a and bacterial activity were observed in response to the dust storm. Considering the linear effect of fresh dust concentrations on the bacterial activity, primary production and pigment concentration (total and per cell), and the likely stimulation of grazing, it is not surprising that changes due to moderate strength dust storms are mostly close to detection limit of either field or remote sensing measurements.

For water of the vast ocean, an effective way to get information about this property is through satellite measurements of ocean color. Past and present satellite sensors designed for ocean-color measurements, however, can only provide data in a few spectral bands. A tool is needed to expand these multiband measurements to hyperspectral information. The major contributors to the attenuation coefficient are absorption And backscatteriing coefficients. The spectral backscattering coefficient can generally be well described with a couple of parameters, but not so for the spectral absorption coefficient. In this paper, based on available hyperspectral absorption data, spectral-transfer coefficients are developed to expand multiband absorption coefficients to hyperspectral (400-700 nm with a 16-nm step) absorption spectrum. The derived transfer coefficients are further applied to data from field measurements to test their performance, and it is found that modeled absorption matches measured absorption very well (-5% error). These results indicate that when absorption and backscattering coefficients are available at multiple bands, a hyperspectral attenuation-coefficient spectrum can now be well constructed.																	0196-2892	1558-0644				JAN	2005	43	1					118	124		10.1109/TGRS.2004.839815								WOS:000226295500015

The use of these technologies in identifying mobile targets in a field, emitting acoustic signals, using a network of low-cost narrow band acoustic micro-sensing devices randomly dispersed over the region of interest, presents unique challenges. The effects of wind, turbulence, and temperature gradients and other environmental effects can decrease the signal to noise ratio by introducing random errors that cannot be removed through calibration. This paper presents methods for dynamic distributed signal processing to detect, identify, and track targets in noisy environments with limited resources. Specifically, it evaluates the noise tolerance of adaptive beamforming and compares it to other distributed sensing approaches. Many source localization and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation methods based on beamforming using acoustic sensor array have been proposed. We, use the approximate maximum likelihood parameter estimation method to perforin DOA estimation of the source in the frequency domain. Generally, sensing radii are large and data from the nodes are transmitted over the network to a centralized location where beamforming is done. These methods therefore depict low tolerance to environmental noise. Knowledge based localized distributed processing methods have also been developed for distributed in-situ localization and target tracking in these environments. These methods, due to their reliance only on local sensing, are not significantly affected by spatial perturbations and are robust in tracking targets in low SNR environments. Specifically, Dynamic Space-time Clustering (DSTC)-based localization and tracking algorithm has demonstrated orders of magnitude improvement in noise tolerance with nominal impact on performance. We also propose hybrid algorithms for energy efficient robust performance in very noisy environments. This paper compares the performance of hybrid algorithms with sparse beamforming nodes supported by randomly dispersed DSTC nodes to that of beamforming and DSTC algorithms. Hybrid algorithms achieve relative high accuracy in noisy environments with low energy consumption. Sensor data from afield test in the Marine base at 29 Palms, CA, were analyzed for validating the results in this paper. The results were compared to "ground truth" data obtained from GPS receivers on the vehicles.																	1550-1329						2005	1	1					81	99		10.1080/15501320590901856								WOS:000237336400006

Tiichodesmium erythraeurn Ehrenberg is reported in the Canary Islands Archipelago during August of 2004, the warmest period of a meteorological series recorded by the National Institute of Meteorology (Spain) since 1912. Samples showed massive occurrences of T erythraeurn (1000 filaments ml(-1)) in different sectors of northern and southern waters off the central Canary Islands. Water analyses also showed a relatively low presence of dinoflagellates and diatoms. Quasi-true colour satellite images of dust storms, elevated sea surface temperature (the warmest satellite-derived record), chlorophyll a and geostrophic current fields showed satellite-derived optical positives of Trichodesmium in an African upwelling advective, jet-drifting westward current off the south Canary Islands.

A T. erythraeum bloom such as that observed in August 2004 in the NW African Upwelling does not appear to have been recorded for the area previously.

Analyses revealed reduced variability in habitat use at finer scales. Bathymetry was consistently a statistically significant predictor of the foraging habitat of parent albatrosses tracked during the 2003 chick-brooding period, when they made short trips close to breeding grounds. These brood-stage parents were more active during the day than the night, and nocturnal flight activity was positively correlated with moon phase. All tracked parents travelled to the shallow (< 600 m) quadrant NNW of the breeding colony on Isla Espanola, Galapagos. Corroborating the result of a previous study, 92% of all activity occurred within 100 km of the breeding colony. Foraging activity was similar for males and females. These data provide critical information on habitat use of the breeding component of the waved albatross population within the newly created Galapagos Marine Reserve.																	0171-8630						2005	291						289	300		10.3354/meps291289								WOS:000229699400025

This region has a diversity of metasedimentary rocks, granitic intrusives, felsic to intermediate volcanic rocks, and continental and marine sedimentary deposits. The TM 742 band combination on a RGB false color composite was the most revealing for lithologic discrimination of the main Neogene volcanic, and Quaternary sedimentary units overlying the metamorphic and granitic basement. An enhanced contrast between lithologic units was produced by the selective principal component analysis using the second components for the TM band pairs 5-7, 4-7 and 2-7 on a RGB false color composite. Through the reassignment and generalization of a supervised classification, we obtained 26 lithologic classes; thirteen Cenozoic volcanic rocks and intrusives, three pre-Cretaceous metamorphic units, and ten Plio-Quaternary sedimentary classes. The latter differ among each other by the source rocks and relative age. The resulting lithologic map of the supervised classification was evaluated using the confusion matrix and Kappa index (kappa). The map obtained a 79% confidence level, and kappa = 0.733, indicating that this map meets the evaluation criteria, and allow to us to recommend this methodology for geologic studies in desert areas.

Real-time thermal analysis of particles at near 40degreesC, 150degreesC, and 300degreesC resolved the volatile (mostly sulfate and organic) and refractory (mostly sea salt) size distributions continuously throughout two major aircraft campaigns. The average sea-salt contributions to aerosol optical depths (AOD) in the marine boundary layer over the Southern Ocean and tropical Pacific were 0.037 (63% of the total column AOD) and 0.022 (31%), respectively, while the volatile component contributed 0.011 (19%) and 0.038 (53%), respectively. This shows the large difference in relative importance of sea salt and volatile components for regions with different residence times and source strengths. The total column AOD is estimated to be 0.037, 0.043, and 0.090 for 0-4, 4-8, and 8-12 m s(-1), respectively, over the Southern Ocean, and 0.060, 0.062, and 0.128 for 3-5, 5-7, and 7-9 m s(-1), respectively, over the tropical Pacific. Wind speed was a good indicator of sea-salt concentrations on a campaign average basis but a poor indicator on a case-by-case basis. This highlights the important effect of removal, wind duration, and fetch on sea-salt variability. Variability in the marine aerosol was assessed statistically for 96 circular flight legs of about 60 km diameter. This mesoscale variability increased with altitude and resulted in variations in column AOD of about 25% over these spatial scales. Hence mesoscale variability is an important concern for satellite remote sensing, closure studies, and model validation even for this nominally homogeneous clean marine atmosphere.																	2169-897X					DEC 16	2004	109	D24							D24201	10.1029/2004JD004975								WOS:000225882400003						
J	Gregg, WW; Casey, NW				Gregg, WW; Casey, NW			Global and regional evaluation of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll data set	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll data set was compared to comprehensive archives of in situ chlorophyll data from NASA and NOAA. The global comparison indicated a root mean square (RMS) log error of 31%, with a coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.76, using 4168 data points where in situ and SeaWiFS data were coincident and collocated. RMS log error for open ocean (defined as bottom depth>200 in) was 27.7% with r(2) = 0.72, compared to 33% RMS log error and r(2) = 0.60 on the coasts, indicating a deterioration of quality of the SeaWiFS data set in coastal regions. All of the Pacific oceanographic basins generally showed very good agreement with SeaWiFS, as did the South Atlantic basin. However, poorer agreement was found in the Mediterranean/Black Seas, Equatorial Atlantic, and the Antarctic. Optical complexity arising from riverine inputs, Saharan dust, and anomalous oceanic constituents contributed to the differences observed in the Atlantic, where an overestimation by SeaWiFS occurred. The Antarctic indicated a pronounced negative bias, indicating an underestimation, especially for chlorophyll concentrations greater than about 0.15 mg m(-3). The results provide a comprehensive global and geographic analysis of the SeaWiFS data set, which will assist data users and policy makers in assessing the uncertainty of estimates of global and regional ocean chlorophyll and primary production.

In this study, we assess the ability of remote sensing to contribute to these objectives by (1) describing the underlying radiative transfer processes, drawing upon research conducted in shallow marine environments; (2) modeling the effects of water depth, substrate type, suspended sediment concentration, and surface turbulence; (3) quantifying the limitations imposed by finite detector sensitivity and linear quantization; and (4) evaluating two depth retrieval algorithms using simulated and field-measured spectra and archival imagery. The degree to which variations in depth and substrate can be resolved depends on bottom albedo and water column optical properties, and scattering by suspended sediment obscures substrate spectral features and reduces the resolution of depth estimates. Converting continuous radiance signals to discrete digital numbers implies that depth estimates take the form of contour intervals that become wider as depth increases and as bottom albedo and detector sensitivity decrease. Our results indicate that a simple band ratio can provide an image-derived variable that is strongly linearly related to water depth across a broad range of stream conditions. This technique outperformed the linear transform method used in previous stream studies, most notably for upwelling radiance spectra [R-2=0.79 for the ln(560 nm/690 nm) ratio]. Applied to uncalibrated multispectral and hyperspectral images of a fourth-order stream in Yellowstone National Park, this flexible technique produced hydraulically reasonable maps of relative depth. Although radiometric precision and spatial resolution will impose fundamental limitations in practice, remote mapping of channel morphology and in-stream habitat is feasible and can become a powerful tool for scientists and managers.

The fossils, found primarily at the interface between paragenetic fabrics, suggest a sharp physicochemical gradient. Evidence of these microbial fossils occurs at a variety of scales. In the field, microbialite is found as meter-scale thrombolitic zones and centimeter-scale stromatolitic crusts lining voids inferred to be the sites of ancient methane seepage. Petrographic fabrics suggestive of microbialite include indistinct peloids (0.1-1 mm in diameter) and crusts of authigenic micrite. Primary evidence obtained from scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis comprises pinnate bacteria (0.3 mum in diameter and 1-1.5 mum long), sheaths (2-4 mum in diameter), coccoids (0.5-1 jam in diameter, up to 40 per cluster), and the presence of framboidal pyrite (6-8 mum in diameter). These results are in agreement with studies of other ancient and modern seeps and suggest a morphological conservatism of microbial form that can be incorporated into studies of extraterrestrial environments where it is presumed that reduced gases drive the metabolic activity of prokaryote-like organisms. Target areas that could serve as conduits for reduced gas seeps include tectonic or impact-driven faulting, zones of cryosphere melting, or other disruptions in crustal coherence. Ancient seeps, preserved as localized anomalous evaporite deposits in the sedimentary cover, could be detected by remote sensing.																	1531-1074					WIN	2004	4	4					438	449										WOS:000225797800005	15684725

Multispectral nadir radiance measurements have been conducted which cover the visible and near infrared wavelength range. The observed radiances are transformed into Fourier space where ranges of scale-invariance are identified. Associated slopes and scale breaks are determined and used to characterize the impacts on cloud radiative smoothing. The results reveal that an increase of gas absorption reduces the small scale slope and the scale break due to a decreasing likelihood of horizontal photon transport. Another impact is that the increasing gas absorption reduces the cloud surface interaction, which is indicated by an increase of the large scale slope. An increasing surface albedo results in large scale cloud radiative smoothing and is associated with a decrease of the large scale slope. This effect depends on the cloud height and the cloud morphology. Two layer cloud systems exhibit a similar behaviour in Fourier space as large surface albedos beneath a single cloud deck. It is argued that the impact of two layer cloud systems on large scale cloud radiative smoothing may not be typical for two layer clouds. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The stations were in close geographical proximity to each other, yet very different phytoplankton assemblages were found. The factors that control phytoplankton biodiversity were investigated. Satellite remote sensing was used to map the development of stratification and fronts in spring and this placed the stations within a strong temporal context. Stations with a well-mixed water column had high nutrient concentrations, high rates of production and the phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by diatoms. At those stations with a stratified water column, nutrient concentrations were depleted but the assemblage was dominated by dinoflagellates and microflagellates. The ratios of depth-integrated primary production to depth-integrated chlorophyll concentration (P/B ratio) were higher at those stations with mixed water columns than at those in stratified waters. That is, under the low nutrient/high light conditions at the stratified station, there was less production than might have been expected for the quantity of chlorophyll present. The photosynthetic characteristics of the phytoplankton assemblages were determined at the stratified stations. P-m(B) values varied from 1.43 to 4.79 mg C [mg Ch1](-1) h(-1), while alpha(B) ranged from 0.011 to 0.047 mg C [mg Ch1](-1) h(-1) (mumol photons m(-2) s(-1))(-1). Phytoplankton biodiversity was low at every station and did not appear to influence primary production rates; the highest rate of daily primary production measured (2.4 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was at a station where a single species accounted for > 70% of the phytoplankton biomass.

A new methodology that combines aerosol remote sensing measurements with measured POP aerosol-phase concentrations is presented to derive dry particulate depositional fluxes of POPs to the oceans. These fluxes are compared with those due to diffusive air-water exchange. For all polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and lower chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), air-water exchange dominates the dry deposition mechanism. However, this tendency reverses in some areas, such as in marine aerosol influenced areas and dust outflow regions, consistent with the important variability encountered for the depositional fluxes. Seasonal variability is mainly found in mid-high latitudes, due to the important influence of wind speed enhancing dry deposition fluxes and temperature as a driver of the gas-particle partitioning of POPs. The average dry aerosol deposition flux of SigmaPCBs and SigmaPCDD/Fs to the Atlantic Ocean is calculated to be in the order of 66 ng m(-2) yr(-1) and 9 ng m(-2) yr(-1) respectively. The total dry aerosol deposition of SigmaPCBs and SigmaPCDD/Fs to the Atlantic Ocean is estimated to be 2200 kg yr(-1) and 500 kg yr(-1), respectively, while the net air-water exchange is higher, 22000 kg SigmaPCBs yr(-1) for PCBs and 1300 kg SigmaPCDD/Fs yr(-1). Furthermore, it is suggested that marine aerosol plays an important role in scavenging atmospheric contaminants.

J	Twardowski, MS; Boss, E; Sullivan, JM; Donaghay, PL				Twardowski, MS; Boss, E; Sullivan, JM; Donaghay, PL			Modeling the spectral shape of absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					A single exponential model of the form ag(lambda) alpha e(-s,lambda) was evaluated in the context of its application and interpretation in describing absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a(g), as a function of wavelength, lambda. The spectral slope, s(e), is often used as a proxy for CDOM composition, including the ratio of fulvic to humic acids and molecular weight. About three-quarters of the variability in s(e) values from the literature could be explained by the different spectral ranges used in each study. Dependency on different spectral ranges resulted from the relatively weak performance of the single exponential as a descriptor of a(g)(lambda) in comparison to other models that allow for greater spectral curvature. Consequently, actual variability in the spectral shape of absorption, and thus the composition of CDOM, from widely varying water types appears less than currently thought. The usefulness of five other models in describing CDOM absorption spectra in the visible domain was also evaluated. Six data sets collected with an ac9 in-situ spectrophotometer from around the coastal United States were used in the analysis. All models considered performed better than the conventional single exponential model, with the exception of a double exponential model, where the second exponential term contributed little new information in the fit. Statistically, the most "useful" model (judged by an analysis of variance) in the visible range was a hyperbolic model of the form: a(g)(lambda)alphalambda(-sh). Although the hyperbolic model was less dependent on the spectral range used in the fit, some dependency remained. The most representative model for describing a(g)(lambda) from the six regions considered in this study, with a(g) at 412 nm as input, was: a(g)(lambda)=a(g)(412)(lambda/412)(-6.92). This spectral relationship may be suitable for remote sensing semi-analytical models which must compute a spectrum from a single estimate of CDOM absorption in the blue derived from a remotely sensed water-leaving radiance signal.

J	Wells, ML				Wells, ML			The colloidal size spectrum of CDOM in the coastal region of the Mississippi Plume using flow field-flow fractionation	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Ocean Sciences Meeting 2002	FEB 11-15, 2002	HONOLULU, HI					Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a major component of the total dissolved organic matter in seawater, and it can interfere significantly with oceanographic remote sensing in nearshore waters. Coastal marine CDOM comprises an undefined, likely rapidly changing mixture of terrestrially and marine-derived substances. Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (FIFFF) offers a novel approach for separating the colloidal (high molecular weight) fraction of CDOM into broad size continuums that can offer insights to the characteristics and reactivity of CDOM constituents. FIFFF analyses of seawaters in and around the Mississippi Plume were performed during high and low flow conditions and the results compared to analyses of phytoplankton cultures and waters from a coastal estuary having low freshwater inputs. FIFFF fractograms displayed major differences in the size distribution of CDOM between offshore in the Gulf of Mexico (GOMex) and the Mississippi River plume. Colloidal size distributions in nearshore surface waters out of the immediate influence of the Mississippi Plume contained a mixture of features seen in offshore waters, plume waters, and in phytoplankton cultures. Plume waters had a high abundance of larger colloidal phases but continued dilution with coastal waters led to preferential losses of mid-sized colloidal matter. Colloidal size spectra in offshore waters of the GOMex during spring were similar to that observed in estuarine waters after the spring bloom. These preliminary findings suggest that the colloidal size spectrum of CDOM may provide information on its provenance and the relative mixtures of terrestrial and marine components.

Recent inventories estimate that they contribute significantly to anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides, with a large impact on composition and chemistry of the marine boundary layer. Nevertheless, the number of observational studies is still rather small. Here we present the first detection of ship tracks in NO2 maps derived from satellite data. We have used the congested track connecting Sri Lanka to Indonesia to estimate the corresponding ship emissions of nitrogen oxides to 23 (10-73) Gg[N]/yr. In addition, we were able to derive the mean lifetime of boundary layer NOx to be 3.7 (1.9-6.0) hours in the respective region. Our estimates are in good agreement with ship emission inventories (about 22-54 Gg[N]/yr) as well as the short lifetimes (of down to 2 hours at daytime) as recently modeled for ship plumes.

The purposes of the experiment were to gain an understanding of atmospheric boundary layer structure and transient mixing mechanisms, in addition to their relationships to boundary layer clouds and aerosol production. Using a combination of in situ and remote sensing instruments, with temporal and spatial resolutions previously not deployed in the Arctic, continuous measurements of the lower-troposphere structure and boundary layer turbulence were taken concurrently with atmospheric gas and particulate chemistry, and marine biology measurements. The boundary layer was strongly controlled by ice thermodynamics and local turbulent mixing. Near-surface temperatures mostly remained between near the melting points of the sea- and freshwater, and near-surface relative humidity was high. Low clouds prevailed and fog appeared frequently. Visibility outside of fog was surprisingly good even with very low clouds, probably due to a lack of aerosol particles preventing the formation of haze. The boundary layer was shallow but remained well mixed, capped by an occasionally very strong inversion. Specific humidity often increased with height across the capping inversion. In contrast to the boundary layer, the free troposphere often retained its characteristics from well beyond the Arctic. Elevated intrusions of warm, moist air from open seas to the south were frequent. The picture that the Arctic atmosphere is less affected by transport from lower latitudes in summer than the winter may, thus, be an artifact of analyzing only surface measurements. The transport of air from lower latitudes at heights above the boundary layer has a major impact on the Arctic boundary layer, even very close to the North Pole. During a few week-long periods synoptic-scale weather systems appeared, while weaker and shallower mesoscale fronts were frequent. While frontal passages changed the properties of the free troposphere, changes in the boundary layer were more determined by local effects that often led to changes contrary to those aloft. For example, increasing winds associated with a cold front often led to a warming of the near-surface air by mixing and entrainment.

J	Howari, FM				Howari, FM			Investigation of hydrocarbon pollution in the vicinity of United Arab Emirates coasts using visible and near infrared remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Influx of hydrocarbon contaminants to the coasts of United Arab Emirates is a serious environmental problem that threaten marine habitat. This paper presented two datasets to extract information on hydrocarbon pollution in marine environment utilizing visible to near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The datasets used were Landsat ETM+ images for Dubai and Fujirah coasts, and experimental visible to near infrared spectra of petroleum hydrocarbon in water. The experimental spectra were measured using GER 3700 spectroradiometer. The study applied image analyses techniques and radiance ratios on corrected Landsat ETM+ images in order to detect oil spills from tankers. The reported results demonstrated proper bands or channels with techniques useful for oil spill detection using images of Landsat ETM+. The study found that radiances extracted from visible and near infrared images are useful to assess the thickness of hydrocarbon spills. The study also found that areas of thicker oil are slightly brighter because they suppress the signal from the underlying seawater. The spectra of GER 3700 provide potentials for identification of possible contaminants as well as classification within a particular hydrocarbon category (e.g. aromatics). The presented techniques hold promise for rapid analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons in marine environment.																	0749-0208					FAL	2004	20	4					1089	1095		10.2112/03-0023R.1								WOS:000225276900012

Cruises were undertaken in 2002 and 2003 in phytoplankton dominated open ocean waters of the Celtic Sea and optically complex waters of the Western English Channel (WEC) and North Sea. For all environments, Chla concentrations varied from 0.4 to 7.8 mg m(-3), TSM from 0.2 to 6.0 mg l(-1) and a(CDOM) at 440 nm from 0.02 to 0.30 m(-1). SeaWiFS OC4v4, with the Remote Sensing Data Analysis Service (RSDAS) atmospheric correction for turbid waters, showed the most accurate retrieval of in situ Chla (RMS = 0.24; n = 26), followed by MODIS chlor_a_3 (RMS = 0.40; n = 26). This suggested that improving the atmospheric correction over optically complex waters results in more accurate Chla concentrations compared to those obtained using more complicated Chla algorithms. We found that the SeaWiFS OC4v4 and the MODIS chlor_a_2 switching band ratio algorithms, which mainly use longer wavebands than 443 nm, were less affected by CDOM. They were both more accurate than chlor-MODIS in the higher CDOM waters of the North Sea. Compared to MODIS the absorption model was better at retrieving a(total) (RMS = 0.39; n = 78) and a(CDOM) (RMS 0.79; n = 12) in all study areas and TSM in the WEC (RMS = 0.04; n 10) but it underestimated Chla concentrations (RMS = 0.45; n = 26). The results are discussed in terms of atmospheric correction, sensor characteristics and the functioning and performance of Chla algorithms.

Eighteen short cores were also collected and probed for resistivity-based porosity measurements. The combined data set provides a basis for empirically exploring the relationship among the remotely sensed data, such as backscatter and reflection coefficients, and directly measured seabed properties such as grain size distribution, velocity, attenuation and porosity. We also investigate the spatial variability of these properties through semi-variogram analysis to facilitate acoustic modeling of natural environmental variability. Grain size distributions on the New Jersey shelf are commonly multi-modal, leading us to separately characterize coarse % (>4 mm), fine % (<63 mum) and mean sand grain size to quantify the distribution. We find that the backscatter is dominated by the coarse component (expressed as weight %), typically shell hash and occasionally terrigenous gravel. In sediment types where coarse material is not significant, backscatter correlates with velocity and fine weight %. Mean sand grain size and fine % are partially correlated with each other, and combined represent the primary control on velocity. The fine %, rather than mean grain size as a whole, appears to be the primary control on attenuation, although coarse % may increase attenuation marginally through scattering. Vertical-incidence seismic reflection coefficients, carefully culled of unreliable values, exhibit a strong correlation with the in situ velocity measurements, suggesting that such data may prove more reliable than backscatter at deriving sediment physical properties from remote sensing data. The velocity and mean sand grain size semi-variograms can be fitted with a von Karman statistical model with horizontal scale similar to 12.6 km, which provides a basis for generating synthetic realizations. The backscatter and coarse % semi-variograms exhibit two horizontal scales: one similar to 8 km and the other too small to quantify with available data. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Edson, JB; Zappa, CJ; Ware, JA; McGillis, WR; Hare, JE				Edson, JB; Zappa, CJ; Ware, JA; McGillis, WR; Hare, JE			Scalar flux profile relationships over the open ocean	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The most commonly used flux-profile relationships are based on Monin-Obukhov (MO) similarity theory. These flux-profile relationships are required in indirect methods such as the bulk aerodynamic, profile, and inertial dissipation methods to estimate the fluxes over the ocean. These relationships are almost exclusively derived from previous field experiments conducted over land. However, the use of overland measurements to infer surface fluxes over the ocean remains questionable, particularly close to the ocean surface where wave-induced forcing can affect the flow. This study investigates the flux profile relationships over the open ocean using measurements made during the 2000 Fluxes, Air-Sea Interaction, and Remote Sensing (FAIRS) and 2001 GasEx experiments. These experiments provide direct measurement of the atmospheric fluxes along with profiles of water vapor and temperature. The specific humidity data are used to determine parameterizations of the dimensionless gradients using functional forms of two commonly used relationships. The best fit to the Businger-Dyer relationship [Businger, 1988] is found using an empirical constant of a(q)=13.4+/-1.7. The best fit to a formulation that has the correct form in the limit of local free convection [e.g., Wyngaard, 1973] is found using a(q)=29.8+/-4.6. These values are in good agreement with the consensus values from previous overland experiments and the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) 3.0 bulk algorithm [Fairall et al., 2003]; e g., the COARE algorithm uses empirical constants of 15 and 34.2 for the Businger-Dyer and convective forms, respectively. Although the flux measurements were made at a single elevation and local similarity scaling is applied, the good agreement implies that MO similarity is valid within the marine atmospheric surface layer above the wave boundary layer.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				AUG 14	2004	109	C8							C08S09	10.1029/2003JC001960								WOS:000223344600001

The active controlled flux technique ( ACFT), where the temperature decay of a small patch of water heated by an infrared laser is tracked using an infrared imager, has been proposed as a method for making these fast noninvasive measurements of the heat and gas transfer velocities. Here, we report on ACFT measurements of the transfer velocity of heat, k(H), made in the ocean during the Fluxes, Air-sea Interactions and Remote Sensing ( FAIRS) experiment (September/October, 2000) and GasEx-01 (January/February, 2001). The results for kH from both FAIRS and GasEx-01 compare favorably when plotted versus wind speed. However, when scaled to a Schmidt number of 660, the measured kH values were found to be a factor of two larger than gas transfer velocities measured during GasEx-01. The ACFT-derived k(H) values were combined with direct measurements of the bulk-skin oceanic temperature difference to calculate net air-sea heat fluxes during both experiments. Comparison of these values with heat fluxes determined by direct measurements of the latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes showed that the ACFT measurements are a factor of seven larger than the direct measurements. One possible theory explaining both the overprediction of the gas transfer velocities and the scale factor between the measured and calculated net heat fluxes is that air-sea exchange is best described by surface penetration rather than surface renewal.

J	Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ				Lourie, SA; Vincent, ACJ			Using biogeography to help set priorities in marine conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Biogeographic information has great potential to enhance systematic conservation planning, although it has yet to be routinely incorporated in marine situations. Fundamental differences between marine and terrestrial environments (physical, biological, and sociopolitical) mean that biogeographic data are harder to obtain for marine systems, biogeographic boundaries more difficult to define, and the outcomes of similar conservation approaches may differ Despite these challenges, an understanding of spatial context, connections, and scales of processes is needed to set conservation priorities that ensure the representation and continued persistence of species and habitats within functioning ecosystems. As we discovered in our review, scientific knowledge of marine systems is increasing rapidly thanks to recent advances in genetics, remote sensing, and geographical information systems. Such knowledge and tools have important implications for marine planning. We also reviewed the degree to which biogeography is incorporated into current marine conservation projects at spatial scales ranging from global to local. Overall, initiatives are becoming more regional in scope and incorporating biogeographic data in an increasingly rigorous manner However, initiatives that use few or no data are also on the rise and need to be treated with due caution. We recommend undertaking global and regional reviews within biogeographic frameworks; combining analytical approaches to determine biogeographic classifications and to define a range of potential conservation areas with stakeholder involvement to set priorities; understanding contemporary processes that maintain species distributions; and acquiring knowledge of historical distributions to provide appropriate baselines for current conservation. The urgent need for marine conservation, however, means that planning should proceed with the best currently available biogeographic information even while biogeographic research continues.																	0888-8892					AUG	2004	18	4					1004	1020		10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00137.x								WOS:000222979400022

There are substantial problems in directly transferring remote sensing approaches from terrestrial systems to the subtidal marine environment because of differences in sampling technologies and interpretation. At present, seafloor remote assessments tend to produce habitats predominantly based oil sediment type and textural characteristics, with benthic communities often showing a high level of variability relative to these habitat types. Yet an integration of information on both the physical features of the seafloor and its ecology would be appropriate in many applications. In this study, data collected from a multi-resolution nested survey of side-scan, single-beam sonar and video are used to investigate a bottom-up approach for integrating acoustic data with quantitative assessments of subtidal soft-sediment epibenthic communities. This approach successfully identified aspects of the acoustic data, together with environmental variables, that represented habitats with distinctly different epibenthic communities. The approach can be used, regardless of differences in data resolution, to determine location- and device-specific relationships with the benthos. When such relationships can be successfully determined, marine ecologists have a tool for extrapolating from the more traditional small-scale sampling to the scales more appropriate for broad-scale impact assessment, management, and conservation.

It provides information on the basic ocean-color variables, namely aerosol optical thickness and marine reflectance, in five spectral bands centered at 443, 490, 560, 670, and 870 nm. Aerosol optical thickness is obtained by viewing the Sun disk and measuring the direct atmospheric transmittance. Marine reflectance is obtained by viewing the ocean surface and measuring the upwelling radiance through a vertical polarizer in a geometry that minimizes glitter and reflected sky radiation, i.e., at 45degrees from nadir (near the Brewster angle) and at 135degrees in azimuth from the Sun's principal plane. Relative inaccuracy on marine reflectance, established theoretically, is approximately 6% at 443 and 490 nm, 8% at 560 nm, and 23% at 670 nm for case 1 waters containing 0.1 mg m(-3) of chlorophyll a. Measurements by SIMBAD and other instruments during the Second Aerosol Characterization Experiment, the Aerosols-99 Experiment, and the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations cruises agree within uncertainties. The radiometer is compact, light, and easy to operate at sea. The measurement protocol is simple, allowing en route measurements from ships of opportunity (research vessels and merchant ships) traveling the world's oceans.

It produces a profound affect on tropical climate by shading the underlying ocean and radiatively cooling and stirring up turbulence in the atmosphere. In October 2001, the East Pacific Investigation of Climate undertook an exploratory cruise from the Galapagos Islands to Chile. The cruise gathered an unprecedented dataset, integrating radiosonde, surface, cloud remote sensing, aerosol, and ocean measurements. Scientific objectives included measuring the vertical structure of the ABL in this region, understanding what physical processes are determining the stratocumulus cloud albedo, and understanding the fluxes of heat and water that couple the atmosphere and ocean in this region. An unexpectedly well-mixed stratocumulus-capped boundary layer as a result of a strong inversion was encountered throughout. A strong diurnal cycle was observed, with thicker clouds and substantial drizzle (mainly evaporating above the sea surface) during the late night and early morning. This was driven in part by local diabatic processes, and was reinforced by a surprisingly pronounced diurnal cycle of vertical motion. The vertical motion appears to be an inertia-gravity wave driven by daytime heating over South America that propagates over 1000 km offshore. Much more nocturnal drizzle and pronounced mesoscale cellularity were observed in "clean" conditions when cloud droplet concentrations and aerosol concentrations were low. Entrainment of dry, warm air is inferred to be the primary regulator of cloud thickness in this region, but drizzle also appears to have a large indirect impact by inhibiting and changing the spatial organization of turbulence.

J	Howe, BM; Miller, JH				Howe, BM; Miller, JH			Acoustic sensing for ocean research	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Ocean observatories have the potential to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and geological parameters and processes of the ocean at time and space scale previously unexplored. Acoustics provides an efficient and cost-effective means by which these parameters and processes can be measured and information can be communicated. Integrated acoustics systems providing navigation and communications and conducting acoustic measurements in support of science applications are in concept, analogous to the Global Positioning System, but rely on acoustics because the ocean is opaque to electromagnetic waves and transparent to sound. A series of nested systems is envisioned, from small- to regional- to basin-scale. A small number of acoustic sources sending coded, low power signals can service unlimited numbers of inexpensive receivers. Drifting and fixed receivers can be tracked accurately while collecting ocean circulation and heat content data (both point and integral data), as well as ambient sound data about wind, rain, marine mammals, seismic T-phases, and anthropogenic activity. The sources can also transmit control data from users to remote instruments, and if paired with receivers enable two-way acoutsic communications links. Acoustic instrumentation that shares the acoustic spectrum completes the concept of integrated acoustics systems. The ocean observations presently in the planning and implementation stages will require these integrated acoustics systems.

Beginning in October 1983, the most frequent occurrences of enhanced UVR over phytoplankton-rich waters occurred in the Weddell Sea and Indian Ocean sectors of the Southern Ocean, impacting 60% of the surface biomass by the late 1990s. These results suggest two reasons why more serious impacts to the base of the marine food web may not have been detected by field experiments: ( 1) the onset of UVR increases several years before dedicated field work began may have impacted the most sensitive organisms long before such damage could be detected, and ( 2) most biological field work has so far not taken place in Antarctic waters most extensively subjected to enhanced UVR.

J	Birsan, M				Birsan, M			Low-frequency transient (time domain) electromagnetic fields propagating in a marine environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL MODELLING-ELECTRONIC NETWORKS DEVICES AND FIELDS					5th International Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in the Time-Domain	JUN 17-19, 2003	Halifax, CANADA					The propagation of electromagnetic waves in seawater is quite different from the propagation in free air. Both the velocity of propagation and the attenuation of the wave reveal a strong dependency on frequency. When using electromagnetic methods for underwater purposes, the low-frequency bands are preferable since high-frequency components are attenuated very quickly. Consider a transmitted electromagnetic pulse travelling outward from a submerged electric dipole. Such a pulse contains many frequency components. Since the different components travel with different velocity, the shape of the pulse will become more and more distorted as it travels from the source. In seawater, the distance of propagation is very limited to encourage practical applications. However, when the environment contains several electrically different media, the electromagnetic wave can propagate along the boundaries to a much longer distance and this property makes them valuable tools in geophysical prospecting and radio communication. The purpose of this study is twofold: first the paper outlines a technique that generalizes the solution of Maxwell's equations to an arbitrary number of layers; the second goal is to investigate the propagation of low-frequency transient electromagnetic fields in a marine environment modelled as a layered media. The frequency-domain formula for the travelling field of a horizontal electric dipole excited by a current pulse is Fourier transformed to obtain the solution for the field in time domain. Possible application to remote sensing in the ocean is considered. (C) Crown Copyright 2004. Reproduced with the permission & Her Majesty's Stationary Office.

J	Naseer, A; Hatcher, BG				Naseer, A; Hatcher, BG			Inventory of the Maldives' coral reefs using morphometrics generated from Landsat ETM+ imagery	CORAL REEFS												In this study, we present exact measures of the number, area, and basic morphometric statistics for every single reef of the Maldivian archipelago, as derived from the interpretation of remotely sensed data collected by the Landsat-7 ETM+ earth-observing satellite sensor. We classified and mapped seven morphological attributes of reefs (six marine habitats and reef-top islands) to 30-m depth at 30x30 m spatial resolution (pixel size) for the entire archipelago. The total archipelagic area (all coral reef and lagoon habitats) of the 16 atolls, five oceanic faros, and four oceanic platform reefs which comprise the Maldives is 21,372.72+/-1,068.64 km(2) (approx. 20% of the Maldives' Territorial Sea). A total of 2,041+/-10 distinct coral reef structures larger than 0.01 km(2) occur in the Maldives, covering an area of 4,493.85 km(2) (including enclosed reef lagoons and islands) to 30-m depth. Smaller areas of coral reef substratum cover another 19.29 km(2), bringing the total area of Maldivian coral reefs to 4,513.14+/-225.65 km(2). Shallow coral platforms thus occupy 21.1% of the total area of the archipelago (0.0052% of the EEZ area of the Maldives). Of these reefs, 538 are rim and oceanic reefs, covering 3,701.93 km(2) (82.5% of the total reef area), and 1,503 are patch reefs within the atoll lagoons, covering 791.92 km(2) (17.5% of the total reef area). Islands occupy only 5.1% of the total reef area. Mapping the Maldives' coral reefs at high spatial resolution is only possible with remote sensing and spatial analysis technologies. These greatly reduce the large uncertainty around current estimates of reef area. Our accurate measure of total reef area is only 50.6% of the current best estimate, a result having significant implications for predictions of the Maldives' reef productivity and response to global climate change. Here we present current best practice and compare the methods and measures with previous approaches.																	0722-4028					APR	2004	23	1					161	168		10.1007/s00338-003-0366-6								WOS:000220937200016

Multiple images, each 626 mm by 467 mm, were acquired during Austral summertime using a Duncantech three-band CIR camera from two areas of mudflat in the upper reaches of Sydney Harbour. Sediment samples were obtained from within the field of view of the camera and their chlorophyll concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically. After the camera images were normalised to compensate for the effects of variations in the intensity of downwelling solar radiation, chlorophyll was estimated for each 0.9 mm square pixel using a suite of five different vegetation indices. Regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the relationship between the index values and the estimates of chlorophyll from the in situ samples. Indices constructed from near-infrared and red bands were found to have the strongest relationships with in situ chlorophyll estimates (R-2 ranging from 0.28 to 0.79) and indices derived from near-infrared and green bands the weakest (R-2 ranging from 0.16 to 0.22). The vegetation indices highlighted complex small-scale variability in chlorophyll distribution that was not evident in the original camera images. These findings indicate that field-based CIR photography will provide a useful tool for the non-destructive determination of benthic chlorophyll. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The algorithm enables the observation of the regional characteristics of aerosol and cloud optical thickness both over land and ocean surfaces. The aerosol and cloud optical thickness over Western Europe is derived from the high-resolution SeaWiFS data for October 11, 2001 (11:30 UTC). The most probable value of the aerosol optical thickness was found to be equal approximately 0.25. The frequency distributions of the aerosol and cloud optical thickness are skewed and have long tails for larger optical thickness. It was found that retrieved values of the aerosol optical thickness at wavelengths 0.412 and 0.440 mum are close to those measured by five ground-based instruments, placed at different locations.

Satellite data were employed for ocean colour, sea level, winds, sea surface temperature (SST), and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) were used to describe the response of the surface marine ecosystem associated with the ENSO event. Some of the large-scale anomalies in ocean colour include elevated biological activity to the north of the Equator in the Pacific coincident with lower sea levels associated with the classic ENSO-horseshoe pattern ecosystem response to the anomalous upwelling in the eastern Indian Ocean caused by the 1997-1998 dipole event, and the dramatic eastward propagating feature in the Equatorial Pacific in response to the La Nina dynamics. Ocean general circulation model (OGCM) experiments show that capturing the high-frequency wind changes is crucial for simulating the La Nina and the coupled biological physical model (OBGCM) runs clearly show that higher frequency winds are also important for capturing the mean upwelling and nutrient supply into the euphotic zone. Thus, the QuickSCAT winds are expected to play a major role in ecosystem modelling in the future. This study shows the utility of satellite data for understanding not only ocean circulation but also the coupled ecosystem variability. Moreover, it is also shown that spatio-temporal resolution of the satellite winds will directly affect the accuracy of oceanic and ecosystem simulations.

J	Haywood, JM; Osborne, SR; Abel, SJ				Haywood, JM; Osborne, SR; Abel, SJ			The effect of overlying absorbing aerosol layers on remote sensing retrievals of cloud effective radius and cloud optical depth	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Two types of partially absorbing aerosol are included ill calculations that are based on intensive aircraft observations: biomass burning aerosol characterized during the Southern AFricAn Regional science Initiative (SAFARI 2000) and mineral dust aerosol characterized during the SaHAran Dust Experiment (SHADE). Measurements during SAFARI 2000 reveal that the biomass burning aerosol layer is advected over the South Atlantic ocean at elevated altitudes above the marine boundary layer which is capped by semi-permanent stratocumulus Cloud sheets. Similarly. the mineral dust is measured at elevated altitudes during SHADE resulting in transport above Cloud for distances of several thousands of kilometres. We perforin theoretical calculations of the effect of these partially absorbing aerosol layers on satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius and cloud optical depth. and show that. in these cases. retrievals Of Cloud optical depth or liquid water path are likely to be subject to systematic low biases. The theoretical calculations suggest that the cloud effective radius relay be subject to a significant low bias for Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) retrievals that rely on the 0.86 and 1.63 mum radiance pair for an overlying aerosol layer of either biomass burning aerosol or mineral dust. Conversely, the Cloud effective radius may be Subject to a significant high bias for Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometel or MODIS retrievals that rely on the 0.63 and 3.7 mum radiance pair for an overlying aerosol layer of mineral dust. Analysis of I kin resolution MODIS data for the SAFARI 2000 period suggests that the effective radius derived from the 0.86 and 1.63 pin radiance pair is, indeed, subject to a low bias in the presence of overlying biomass burning aerosol. These results show the difficulties associated with remote sensing retrievals, which must be kept in mind when attempting to assess any potential indirect effect.

J	Osborne, SR; Haywood, JM; Francis, PN; Dubovik, O				Osborne, SR; Haywood, JM; Francis, PN; Dubovik, O			Short-wave radiative effects of biomass burning aerosol during SAFARI2000	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												We present data from two case-studies during the Southern AFricAn Research Initiative (SAFARI2000) of the radiative effects of a biomass burning plume advecting over the ocean. In situ aircraft measurements were made of the aerosol vertical structure, the aerosol microphysics, and the aerosol optical properties (scattering and absorption coefficients). Remote sensing measurements of the upwelling broadband short-wave (SW) radiative fluxes (0.3-3.0 mum) were made above the plume. Together with modelling of the clear-air flux using a flexible radiation scheme, we have been able to determine the local mean direct radiative effects of the aerosol column for the two cases. Aerosol optical depths were derived using a number of techniques: the upwelling fluxes, vertical integration of the in situ extinction coefficient, and using downwelling sky radiances. These optical depths are compared and discussed; discrepancies are revealed through instrument sampling problems and horizontal inhomogeneity of the aerosol. Spectrally resolved downwelling SW sky radiances as a function of scattering angle were measured and modelled. The modelling technique illustrates the importance of including unpolluted marine boundary-layer aerosol as part of the aerosol column. A retrieval algorithm that uses the measured downwelling sky radiances as input has also been utilized. This algorithm derives a columnar aerosol size distribution for comparison against the measured biomass burning and marine boundary-layer size distributions. The retrieved columnar size distribution is acceptable in representing the atmospheric aerosol in terms of describing the effect on scattered radiances.

As a result, the ability to characterize dynamic hydrologic properties at adequate temporal and spatial scales has greatly improved. These advances have led to improved statistical and mechanistic modeling in monitoring of water quality trends at local, watershed and regional scales for freshwater, estuarine and marine ecosystems. In addition, they have greatly enhanced rapid (e.g., real-time) detection of hydrologic variability, recognized as a critical need for early warning systems and rapid response to harmful algal bloom events. Here, we present some of the landmark developments and technological achievements that led to the advent of real-time remote monitors for hydrologic properties. We conclude that increased use and continuing advancements of real-time remote monitoring (RTRM) and sensing technologies will become a progressively more important tool for evaluating water quality. Recent engineering and deployment of RTRM technologies by federal and state regulatory agencies, industries, and academic laboratories is now permitting rapid detection of, and responses to, environmental threats imposed by increased nutrient loadings, development of hypoxic and anoxic areas, toxicants, and harmful algal bloom outbreaks leading to fish kill events and potential human health impacts.

J	Nair, SK; Rajeev, K; Parameswaran, K				Nair, SK; Rajeev, K; Parameswaran, K			Cloud screening in IRS-P4 OCM satellite data: potential of spatial coherence method in the absence of thermal channel information	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Cloud screening of satellite data for the remote sensing of atmospheric aerosols, ocean sediments, chlorophyll, and phytoplankton in the marine environment is a major problem in the absence of information from thermal channel. This is particularly the case with the data from some of the highly potential satellite sensors such as the Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM-on board the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P4) and the SeaWiFS. Two main tests conventionally used for cloud screening of data from such satellite sensors are the threshold method applied to visible and near-IR bands and the visible to near-IR channel ratio method. These methods do not have the potential to eliminate the pixels with small cloud fractions, leading to overestimation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from satellite data, and might also identify the pixels with high values of AOD as cloudy. The purpose of this paper is to study the potential of Spatial Coherence Test (SCT) applied to the data from the near-IR bands for cloud screening of satellite data over the oceanic environment. We use here the data from IRS-P4 OCM. Though more computationally intensive, the SCT does not suffer from the serious limitations of the threshold and channel ratio methods and is found to be superior in identifying the clear sky pixels that are not affected by clouds. Although the SCT applied to near-IR channel data may be overestimating the number of cloud affected pixels, it neither leads to overestimation of AOD nor identifies the pixels with high AOD values as cloudy.

The present study reports an extensive HAB off southeastern Vietnamese waters during late June to July 2002 with in situ observations and analyzes the oceanographic conditions using satellite remote sensing data. The HAB had high chlorophyll a ( Chl a) concentrations ( up to 4.5 mg m-3) occurring -200 km off the coast and -200 km northeast of the Mekong River mouth for a period of -6 weeks. The bloom was dominated by the harmful algae haptophyte Phaeocystis cf. globosa and caused a very significant mortality of aquacultured fish and other marine life. In the same period, sea surface temperature (SST) imagery showed a cold water plume extending from the coast to the open sea, and QuikScat data showed strong southwesterly winds blowing parallel to the coastline. This study indicated that the HAB was induced and supported by offshore upwelling that brings nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface and from coastal water to offshore water and that the upwelling was driven by strong wind through Ekman transport when winds were parallel to the coastline. This study demonstrated the possibility of utilizing a combination of satellite data of Chl a, SST, and wind velocity together with coastal bathymetric information and in situ observations to give a better understanding of the biological oceanography of HABs.

Here we demonstrate how Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to define areas of high productivity and we use fishery data to verify model results and reveal areas of potential fishery locations. We develop a GIS model based on spatial data integration between monthly satellite imagery of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a) for Eastern Mediterranean waters. Data are analyzed for the production of climatology and mapping of anomaly distribution in these environmental parameters. The geographic distributions of anomalies are spatially integrated to map areas of combined persistent environmental anomaly of below average SST and above average Chl-a (lowSST/highChl-a) indicating marine productivity hotspots and potential fish feeding aggregation regions. A preliminary comparison of surveyed fisheries production data for small pelagic fish and pelagic cephalopods to lowSST/highChl-a areas is performed for the period from December 1997 to November 2001, revealing potential spatial associations among fishery resources and productivity hotspots in terms of unexploited regions as well as overexploited fishing grounds that could be characterized as candidate marine protected areas.

The suggested method (visual aerial census at a height of 80-200 m, flying speed 235-380 km/h) allowed one to detect 13 species of marine mammals and more than 30 waterfowl species. The influence of observation conditions on the census results, as well as merits and limitations of the proposed method as compared to ship-based and light plane-based surveys, are discussed. The use of plane-laboratories equipped with a computer complex and remote sensing facilities may provide a unique information pool for a relatively short time period. Such information characterizes not only the distribution and numbers of marine birds and mammals, but also the state of other environmental components. The merits of the proposed methods are as follows: the possibility to conduct a quasi-simultaneous broad-scale ecological survey over a large marine area supported by digital maps and exclusion of the factors preventing ship-based surveys (responses of animals to vessels, difficulties of studies in shallow and icy water, etc.). The maps characterizing the distribution of kittiwakes and capelins, fulmars, sea ducks, swans, marine mammals over the areas observed are presented. The method is recommended for regional complex monitoring of Arctic marine ecosystems.

The results of an intercomparison exercise of HPLC pigment determination, performed for the first time on natural samples and involving four laboratories (each using a different HPLC procedure), are used to address three main objectives: (a) estimate (and explain) the level of agreement or discrepancy in the methods used, (b) establish whether or not the accuracy requirements for ocean color validation activities can be met, and (c) establish how higher order associations in individual pigments (i.e., sums and ratios) influence the uncertainty budget while also determining how this information can be used to minimize the variance within larger pigment databases. The round-robin test samples (11 different samples received in duplicate by each laboratory) covered a range of total chlorophyll a concentration, [TChl a], representative of open ocean conditions from 0.045 mg m(-3), typical of the highly oligotrophic surface waters of the Ionian Sea, to 2.2 mg m(-3), characteristic of the upwelling regime off Morocco. Despite the diversity in trophic conditions and HPLC methods, the agreement between laboratories, defined here as the absolute percent difference (APD), was approximately 7.0% for [TChl a], which is well within the 25% accuracy objective for remote sensing validation purposes. For other pigments (mainly chemotaxinomic carotenoids), the agreement between methods was 21.5% on average (ranging from 11.5% for fucoxanthin to 32.5% for peridinin), and inversely depended on pigment concentration (with large disagreements for pigments close to the detection limits). It is shown that better agreement between methods can be achieved if some simple procedures are employed: (a) disregarding results less than the effective limit of quantitation (LOQ, an alternative to the method detection limit, MDL), (b) standardizing the manner in which the concentration of pigment standards are determined, and (c) accurately accounting for divinyl chlorophyll a when computing [TChl a] for those methods which do not chromatographically separate it from monovinyl chlorophyll a. The use of these quality-assurance procedures improved the agreement between methods, with average APD values dropping from 7.0% to 5.5% for [TChl a] and from 21.5% to 13.9% for the principal carotenoids. Additionally, it is shown that subsequent grouping of individual pigment concentrations into sums and ratios significantly reduced the variance and, thus, improved the agreement between laboratories. This grouping, therefore, provides a simple mechanism for decreasing the variance within databases composed of merged data from different origins. Among the recommendations for improving database consistency in the future, it is suggested that submissions to a database should include the relevant information related to the limit of detection for the HPLC method.

This revolution of information is the result of heavy investment in new technology by governments and industry, rapid developments in computing power and storage, and easy dissemination of data over the internet. Today, remotely sensed data are available to virtually anyone with a desktop computer. Here, we review the status of one of the most popular areas of marine remote sensing research: coral reefs. Previous reviews have focused on the ability of remote sensing to map the structure and habitat composition of coral reefs, but have neglected to consider the physical environment in which reefs occur. We provide a holistic review of what can, might, and cannot be mapped using remote sensing at this time. We cover aspects of reef structure and health but also discuss the diversity of physical environmental data such as temperature, winds, solar radiation and water quality. There have been numerous recent advances in the remote sensing of reefs and we hope that this paper enhances awareness of the diverse data sources available, and helps practitioners identify realistic objectives for remote sensing in coral reef areas.

Marine aerosols are the single largest contributor of the aerosol optical depth. Ocean Color Monitor data onboard Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Polar Series 4 (IRS-P4) has been analyzed to retrieve the aerosol parameters over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) and the surface forcing have been deduced over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The nature of the aerosol forcing and seasonal effects over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea have been compared. Surface forcing shows strong seasonal influence, which has not been found on the TOA forcing. In general, higher forcing over the atmosphere has been observed over the Bay of Bengal (-30 to -54 W/m(2)) compared to those over the Arabian Sea (-26 to -48 W/m(2)). During the winter season, the surface forcing over the Arabian Sea (-28 to -45 W/m(2)) is observed to be higher than the Bay of Bengal (-25 to -38 W/m(2)). (C) 2003 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Consalvey, M; Paterson, DM; Underwood, GJC				Consalvey, M; Paterson, DM; Underwood, GJC			The ups and downs of life in a benthic biofilm: Migration of benthic diatoms	DIATOM RESEARCH												Benthic diatom communities have been documented many times to exhibit a predictable pattern of migration entrained to diurnal and tidal cycles forming transient biofilms in the estuarine intertidal. The highly visible nature of these biofilms means that many anecdotal descriptions of this behaviour exist, yet much still remains to be elucidated about these behaviours and what drives them. There has been a resurgence in work examining the migratory patterns of benthic diatoms because of the important roles they play in the overall functioning of the ecosystem (e.g. primary production). It is the aim of this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the migratory literature to date. The paper will review the methodology that was historically used to examine patterns in diatom migration as well as introduce new technologies (e.g. remote sensing). The patterns and cues for migration are discussed, highlighting the fact that whilst a "classic" pattern of migration is often found (migration of cells to the sediment surface as the tide leaves the site followed by a downwards migration in anticipation of the incoming tide), these cannot be considered to be consistent, with many site and taxon specific idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, it has been suggested that cells also migrate within the biofilm, cycling their position at the sediment surface therefore maximising their overall fitness, and this hypothesis is discussed. The vertical migration strategy of the benthic diatoms is critical to their pivotal role in the structure and functioning of estuarine intertidal mudflats and the costs and benefits of a microphytobenthic existence are discussed in this context.

However, the physical and biogeochemical variables that affect the oceanic capacity to retain PCBs show an important spatial and temporal variability which have not been studied in detail, so far. The objective of this paper is to assess the seasonal and spatial variability of the ocean's maximum capacity to act as a reservoir of atmospherically transported and deposited PCBs. A level I fugacity model is used which incorporates the environmental variables of temperature, phytoplankton biomass, and mixed layer depth, as determined from remote sensing and from climatological datasets. It is shown that temperature, phytoplankton biomass and mixed layer depth influence the potential PCB reservoir of the oceans, being phytoplankton biomass specially important in the oceanic productive regions. The ocean's maximum capacities to hold PCBs are estimated. They are compared to a budget of PCBs in the surface oceans derived using a level III model that assumes steady state and which incorporates water column settling fluxes as a loss process. Results suggest that settling fluxes will keep the surface oceanic reservoir of PCBs well below its maximum capacity, especially for the more hydrophobic compounds. The strong seasonal and latitudinal variability of the surface ocean's storage capacity needs further research, because it plays an important role in the global biogeochemical cycles controlling the ultimate sink of PCBs. Because this modeling exercise incorporates variations in downward fluxes driven by phytoplankton and the extent of the water column mixing, it predicts more complex latitudinal variations in PCBs concentrations than those previously suggested.

J	Li, HY; Budd, JW; Green, S				Li, HY; Budd, JW; Green, S			Evaluation and regional optimization of bio-optical algorithms for central Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Bio-optical properties of the ocean have been broadly investigated using Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor imagery (SeaWiFS), from which numerous globally and regionally optimized bio-optical algorithms have emerged. As a first step in evaluating bio-optical algorithms for the Laurentian Great Lakes, we tested ten published marine bio-optical algorithms (9 empirical and I semi-analytical), in central Lake Superior using optical data and discrete water samples collected in 1998-2000. Although the semi-analytical algorithm provided a better result than the empirical algorithms, all of the algorithms overestimate chlorophyll a concentration. We derived optimized empirical parameters using two of the best algorithms (Ocean Color-Version 4 (OC4) and semi-analytical algorithms), but the models do not simulate chlorophyll a concentrations well. Compared to other coastal waters, the chlorophyll a concentration in Lake Superior is low (0.2-1.5 mu g L-1) and the fraction of total absorbance attributable to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is high. The ratio of absorbance due to chlorophyll a to that of CDOM ranges from 0.001 to 0.262 between 443 and 555 nm in Lake Superior, which is 2-3 times lower than in case I waters, and indicates that semi-analytical, as opposed to strictly empirical, bio-optical algorithms may provide better estimates of chlorophyll a concentration in Lake Superior.

The simulated global distribution of cloud droplet radius showed a land-sea contrast and a characteristic feature along the coastal region similar to the AVHRR results, although cloud droplet radii from GCM calculations and AVHRR retrievals were different over tropical marine regions due to a lack of calculation of cloud-aerosol interaction for convective clouds in the present model and also due to a possible error in the satellite retrieval caused by cirrus and broken cloud contamination. The simulated dependence of the cloud properties on the column aerosol particle number was also consistent with the statistics obtained by the AVHRR remote sensing when a parameterization with the aerosol lifetime effect was incorporated in the simulation. The global average of the simulated liquid water path based on the parameterization with the aerosol lifetime effect showed an insignificant dependence on the aerosol particle number as a result of a global balance of the lifetime effect and the wash-out effect. This dependence was contrary to the results of simulations based on the Sundqvist's parameterization without aerosol lifetime effect; that is, the simulated cloud liquid water path showed a decreasing tendency with the aerosol particle number reflecting only the wash-out effect.

Samples were collected at 2 sites, Bahia Nueva and Bahia Camarones (Chubut, Argentina), and exposed to solar radiation for 4 to 6 h under 3 quality radiation treatments (i.e. PAR + UVR, 280-700 nm; PAR + UR-A, 320-700 nm; and PAR only, 400-700 nm), and under 6 to 8 levels of ambient irradiance (i.e. by using 0 to 5-7 layers of neutral density screens). Samples collected at Bahia Nueva had relatively high P-max values (similar to3-4 mug C (mug chl a)(-1) h(-1)) during the pre-bloorn period (i.e. late summer to late fall) and relatively low values (similar to1.5-2.5 mug C (mug chl a)(-1) h(-1)) during the post-bloom period (i.e. late spring to early summer); similar results were observed in samples collected at Bahia Camarones. The light saturation parameter E-k, on the other hand, did not show a clear pattern and values ranging from 50 to 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1) were observed throughout the study period. High P-max values were Significantly correlated with the concentration of large diatoms (R-2 = 0.6, p < 0.05), the taxonomic group that characterized the pre-bloom period. UVR significantly reduced P-max values (p < 0.05) during the pre-bloom but not during the post-bloom period. UVR also significantly affected E-k (p < 0.05) in all Bahia Camarones samples but only in some from Bahia Nueva. UV-A was responsible for the bulk of photosynthetic inhibition throughout the study period; the highest UV-A-induced integrated inhibition values in the water column were similar to16.5 and 7% for Bahia Nueva and Bahia Camarones, respectively. On the other hand, UV-B-induced photosynthetic inhibition reached maximum values of 2.3 and 3.9% for Bahia Nueva and Bahia Camarones, respectively. Since under certain environmental conditions P vs. E parameters can be significantly reduced by UVR, we suggest that remote sensing algorithms using these parameters should also consider the impact of UVR in their estimates of primary production.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2004	284						23	34		10.3354/meps284023								WOS:000226518000003

Spectral signatures of end-members are now relatively well known for predominant reef taxa (coral, algae) and for the background of the living communities (e.g. sediments). What remains unclear is whether the criteria for spectral discrimination between endmembers at the millimeter or centimeter scale remain valid when attempting to process images at several meters resolution. In other words, is it possible to scale-up spectral criteria of identification from species/organisms to communities? We address this issue with in situ and 'compact airborne spectrometer imager' (CASI) hyperspectral measurements of the tropical marine flora of 2 South Pacific Ocean coral reefs. Targets were the dominant algal species and communities encountered in the shallow (0 to 3 m) barrier and fringing reefs of Moorea Island and the outer margin of the rim of Rangiroa Atoll (French Polynesia). Stepwise wavelength selection and linear discriminant analysis highlighted the key non-redundant wavelengths necessary to achieve good separation between the predefined ecological groups. Comparison of the wavelengths identified from in situ and airborne measurements allowed definition of a subset of common wavelengths that were robust to changes in spatial scale and still provided excellent discrimination and classification accuracy between the ecological groups. These results suggest that continuous spectral signatures acquired in situ at the centimeter scale can be used to select key discrete wavelengths for remote-sensing observations of communities at the meter scale despite the spatial heterogeneity in benthic cover and the resulting spectral mixing.

The large areas involved render its assessment difficult. In this paper, a spatial and comparative approach is presented assuming that hydromorphology together with organic matter production control the various consequences of nutrient overenrichment. We have developed 2 eutrophication indices of shallow marine ecosystems using hydrodynamic modelling and optical satellite remote-sensing. The indices are tested in systems characterised by contrasting physical regimes, i.e. the Adriatic and North Sea. The physically sensitive area index (PSA) integrates the supporting factors of eutrophication, i.e. the physical conditions driving primary production in the upper layer and oxygen availability near the bottom. The eutrophication risk index (EUTRISK) characterises the spatial distribution of potential hypoxia at a monthly timescale. It is based on an oxygen budget between the physical capacity to store and renew the oxygen near the seabed and the flux of organic matter reaching the sediment, estimated primarily from satellite-derived chlorophyll a data. The indices identify 3 main types of eutrophicated waters: (1) eutrophic and sensitive, (2) mesotrophic and sensitive and (3) eutrophic and resistant. In Category 1 oxygen depletion occurs recurrently because both the main pressure and supporting factors are unfavourable (e.g. coastal waters south of the Po river mouth). In Category 2, severe hypoxia or anoxia occur due to particularly adverse physical conditions, even when primary production is relatively low (e.g. the Kattegat and NE part of the northern Adriatic Sea). Category 3 comprises areas where severe hypoxia near the seabed is prevented by permanent tidally induced vertical mixing; however nutrient overenrichment is recognised as leading to alterations in the food-web structure and functioning (e.g. Bay of Seine). The EUTRISK index forms the basis of a comparative tool for the assessment and monitoring of marine eutrophication risk. The PSA index, which provides an understanding of physical vulnerability on a large scale, indicates the relative threshold of nutrient discharge, i.e. the assimilative capacity of marine ecosystems. This first assessment of the underlying processes controlling marine eutrophication is a prerequisite for efficient restoration strategies on a large scale.

It has been suggested that these differences could introduce a bias in satellite-derived concentrations of the phytoplankton pigment, chl a. In this paper, these differences in optical properties of diatoms are exploited to develop a bio-optical algorithm to distinguish diatom populations from other types of phytoplankton populations in the region. The algorithm is applied to SeaWiFS data on ocean colour, and the results are compared with in situ data on phytoplankton population types based on HPLC data. The comparison shows that the algorithm successfully distinguishes between diatoms and non-diatom populations in the majority of cases studied. A branching algorithm is then applied to the satellite data to estimate chl a concentration in the region: a diatom-specific algorithm is used when diatoms are identified in a pixel, and another algorithm for mixed populations when this is not the case. The estimated chl a concentrations are compared with in situ estimates when matching observations exist. The results show that the branching bio-optical algorithm often performs better than the OC4 algorithm used in standard processing of SeaWiFS data. However, the results may be poor when the initial identification of population types is wrong. Finally, the new algorithm is used to map the distribution of diatoms in the region in spring and summer: the patterns that emerge are consistent with the known features of diatom distributions in the region.																	0171-8630						2004	272						59	68		10.3354/meps272059								WOS:000222526900005

Results needed to be comprehensive, synoptic, objective, affordable, and on a suitable spatial scale. We chose to address these goals by applying accepted procedures utilizing existing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery and a computer-generated unsupervised classification. Unsupervised classification of high and low tide Landsat TM images yielded coherent habitat maps that were supported by reference data and independent habitat analyses. The high tide image revealed surface water patterns that supported the existence of a large, Central Bay dipole eddy predicted by a numerical three-dimensional circulation model. Classification of the low tide image resulted in 14 intertidal and water habitat classes being defined. Overall accuracy of the classification was 86%. Good agreement in habitat areas existed between the affordable and easily repeatable satellite survey and four other Cobscook Bay surveys which differed methodologically and temporally. The four studies agreed within 7% of total habitat area and 12% on intertidal habitat area. The area of both brown and green algae in the Bay apparently increased modestly over a 25-year period which saw the introduction of large-scale salmon aquaculture and the advent of intensive dragging for scallops and sea urchins. The increase in both groups is inconsistent with changes induced by nutrient additions observed elsewhere. Landsat imagery appears to be a valuable tool for the management and monitoring of macrotidal environments.																	1092-6194						2004	11				2		225	242		10.1656/1092-6194(2004)11[225:UOCERS]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000231132300013

In the French Antilles, about 80% of the coral communities are more or less damaged. A study has been undertaken in order to describe and understand the dynamics of this recent evolution. The aim of this study was also to detect the ecological descriptors able to characterize the state of health of coral communities by remote sensing. The species richness of coral communities, the most simple indicator of the biodiversity of the studied area, as well as diversity indices, revealed to be descriptors particularly stable and very little reactive to the degradation of the reef community. The coverage rate of the bottom by corals may be very different from one reef to another one or from one area to another one on the same reef. This does not necessarily imply the existence of a difference in the state of health between the communities. The most relevant criteria revealed to be associated with the state of health of coral colonies and the abundance of juvenile recruits. For the other components of the reef benthic community, the most pertinent descriptor was the ratio of the bottom covered with algal turf (healthy reefs) to that occupied by macro-algae (damaged reefs). These ecological descriptors revealed to be easy to estimate in a reproducible manner by observers who are not specialists of reef ecology. This extends the possibilities of monitoring the health of coral reefs through the assistance of non-scientific personnel (staff of the marine reserves, volunteers, etc.).																	0249-7395						2004	59	1-2					113	121										WOS:000220011300013

As such areas, particularly mudflats of limited access for point sampling, remote sensing techniques have the potential to map diatom biomass. This study used two monospecific cultures of the benthic, diatoms Navicula ramosissima and Entomoneis paludosa, isolated from mudflats in Bourgneuf Bay (France), to obtain a biomass range. Exponential and senescent stages of microalgal growth were also tested. The objective was to relate the spectral reflectance obtained by spectroradiometry to the composition and amount of principal and accessory pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of pigments vs. chlorophyll a ratios revealed differences between these two diatom species, mainly due to fucoxanthin and diadinoxanthin. These interspecific variations among the class of Bacillariophyceae were also detected by spectroradiometry. No differences were observed between the two growth stages, and cell senescence had no effects on spectral properties. The chlorophyll pigments used to establish a relationship between diatom biomass and spectral reflectance gave the most interesting results for an absorption band at 632 nm corresponding to chlorophyll a and chlorophyll e. This band, contrary to that at 673 nm related to chlorophyll a only and traditionally used for biomass estimations in green plants, provided the largest range of variations and was not saturated at a high biomass concentration.

The analysis examines the effects of dust on photolysis and heterogeneous uptake, operating independently and together. In numerical experiments the size-resolved, time-varying mineral dust distribution predicted by the global Dust Entrainment and Deposition (DEAD) model perturbs the gas phase species in a global chemical transport model (University of California at Irvine (UCI) CTM). We find that the photolysis perturbation dominates limited regions in the low to middle troposphere, while heterogeneous uptake dominates the rest of atmosphere. Coupling of the photochemical and heterogeneous effects of dust is weak in the global mean but moderate in dusty regions, where coupling is sometimes responsible for more than 20% of local O-3 changes. Ozone and odd-nitrogen concentrations are perturbed in opposite directions by photolysis and heterogeneous chemistry, resulting in a weak net change. However, both processes decrease the concentrations of OH and HO2. The global mean change due to dust is -0.7% for tropospheric O-3, -11.1% for OH, -5.2% for HO2, and -3.5% for HNO3. Large seasonal signals are present near dust source regions. Over the North African region and tropical Atlantic Ocean downwind, OH decreases by -66.8%, six times more than the global mean reduction. Interestingly, net photolysis-induced annual mean O-3 changes are greater in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, where significantly more dust and O-3 precursors reside. In polar regions, O-3 change is dominated by transported O-3 and is not sensitive to local dust concentration. O-3 change due to photolysis depends not only on dust vertical structure but also on the availability of O-3 precursors. O-3 change due to heterogeneous reactions on dust is sensitive to dust vertical structure, mainly through the influence of temperature on uptake rates.

We have analysed the effects of oceanographic factors on the post-nesting movements of three satellite-tracked leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) moving in the southwest Indian Ocean. By superimposing the turtle tracks on contemporaneous images of sea-surface temperatures and sea height anomalies, we show that current-related features dominate the shape of the reconstructed routes. After an initial offshore movement, turtles moved along straight routes when in the core of the current, or executed loops within eddies. Large parts of the routes were strikingly similar to those of surface drifters tracked in the same region. These findings document that long-lasting oceanic movements of marine turtles may be shaped by oceanic currents.																	0962-8452					NOV 7	2003	270			2			S129	S132		10.1098/rsbl.2003.0036								WOS:000186662700001	14667360

Prochlorococcus (Pro) (17 to 160 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) numerically dominated the ultraphytoplankton (UPP), followed by Synechococcus (Syn) (4.5 to 57 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) and eukaryotic algae (EA) (0.6 to 4.2 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)). The abundance of heterotrophic bacterioplankton (HB) was 0.4 to 1.3 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). A strong correlation (r = 0.8 to 0.97) was observed between sea-viewing wide field of view sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite estimates of total chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and chl a concentration, abundance and biomass of EA as well as abundance and biomass of HB. This shows the potential for deducing spatial distributions of these 2 groups for ecosystem modelling using satellite data. Although the correlation between satellite chl a estimates and Syn chl a concentration was strong (r = 0.83 to 0.88), the correlation with its abundance and biomass was poor (r < 0.6) due to high variability (factor of 12) in cellular chl a content and to a lesser extent to diurnal cycles. The relationships were similar when either only daytime or all UP measurements were compared with the satellite data. No relationship was found between satellite data and Pro chl a concentration, abundance or biomass, even after correction for a pronounced diel cycle, suggesting that the SeaWiFS instrument might not detect Pro chl a.

This location provided favorable opportunities to test and evaluate new instrumentation designed to improve measurements of marine aerosol and its physical, chemical, and optical properties, including the remote sensing (lidar) of coastal aerosol fields. Data acquired from the diverse instruments deployed before and during SEAS demonstrate that environmental and meteorological features actively influence aerosol measurements at this location. Both a ceilometer and a visibility sensor were operated continuously and found to be effective autonomous tools for characterizing mixed-layer aerosol conditions. These instruments also helped demonstrate that changes in physical and optical properties measured during SEAS were also linked to volcanic aerosol transported across the Pacific in the free troposphere from Japan and later entrained into the marine boundary layer. This and various local effects of wind direction, wind speed, tides, and sampling altitude were superimposed on the variations in offshore marine aerosol. Characterization of these site-specific effects provides a context and guidance for the interpretation of coastal aerosol data and evaluation of SEAS data.																	0739-0572					OCT	2003	20	10					1351	1361		10.1175/1520-0426(2003)020<1351:TSEASS>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000185679300002

Aerosol production from shoreline breaking waves and the more distant reef (similar to1 km) was characterized for dry sizes between 0.01 and 10 mum for both their contribution to the marine aerosol population and their influence on near-surface lidar extinction. Thermal volatility was used to extract the refractory sea-salt particles from the other constituents volatile at 360degreesC. At 7 m ASL and 20 m inland from the water's edge the production of sea-salt nuclei number was often in the range of 50 - 100 cm(-3) above the open-ocean value of similar to250 cm(-3). This number peak was near 0.03-mum dry diameter, while light scattering was dominated by a few particles larger than 1 mum. This indicates that production of sea salt from breaking waves contributes not only to aerosol mass and optical effects but also to nuclei mode particle number in remote regions. Separate studies of optical closure quantified links between the size distribution and optical scattering measurements, visibility, and extinction values for both nearshore breaking waves and open-ocean conditions. These data confirmed that extinction derived from coastal lidar measurements at 0.530 mum was accurate to better than the 25% uncertainty claimed for the lidar inversion.

It also affects the penetration of ultraviolet radiation (UV) into the water column and can confound remote estimates of chlorophyll concentration. Measurements of ocean color from satellites can be used to predict UV attenuation and CDOM absorption spectra from relationships between visible reflectance, UV attenuation, and absorption by CDOM. Samples were taken from the Bering Sea and from the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and water types ranged from turbid, inshore waters to the Gulf Stream. We determined the following relationships between in situ visible radiance reflectance, L-u/E-d (lambda) (sr(-1)), and diffuse attenuation of UV, K-d(lambda) (m(-1)): K-d(323nm) = 0.781[L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.07); K-d(338nm) = 0.604[L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.12); K-d(380 nm) = 0.302[L-u/E-d(412)/L-u/E-d(555)](-1.24). Consistent with published observations, these empirical relationships predict that the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM absorption increases as diffuse attenuation of UV decreases. Excluding samples from turbid bays, the ratio of the CDOM absorption coefficient to K-d is 0.90 at 323 nm, 0.86 at 338 nm, and 0.97 at 380 nm. We applied these relationships to SeaWiFS images of normalized water-leaving radiance to calculate the CDOM absorption and UV attenuation in the Mid-Atlantic Bight in May, July, and August 1998. The images showed a decrease in UV attenuation from May to August of approximately 50%. We also produced images of the areal distribution of the spectral slope coefficient of CDOM absorption in the Georgia Bight. The spectral slope coefficient increased offshore and changed with season.

Aiming to quantify the uncertainties in the modeling of coastal water radiometric quantities, we performed a closure experiment to intercompare theoretical and experimental data as a function of wavelength X and water depth z. Specifically, the study focused on above-water downward irradiance E-d(lambda, 0(+)) and in-water spectral profiles of upward nadir radiance L-u(lambda, z), upward irradiance E-u(lambda, z), downward irradiance E-d(lambda, z), the E-u(lambda, z)/L-u(lambda, z) ratio (the nadir Q factor), and the E-u(lambda, z)/E-d(lambda, z) ratio (the irradiance reflectance). The theoretical data were produced with the finite-element method radiative transfer code ingesting in situ atmospheric and marine inherent optical properties. The experimental data were taken from a comprehensive coastal shallow-water data set collected in the northern Adriatic Sea. Under various measurement conditions, differences between theoretical and experimental data for the above-water E-d(lambda, 0(+)) and subsurface E-d(lambda, 0(-)) as well as for the in-water profiles of the nadir Q factor were generally less than 15%. In contrast, the in-water profiles of L-u(lambda, z), E-d(lambda, z), E-d(lambda, z) and of the irradiance reflectance exhibited larger differences [to approximately 60% for L-u(lambda, z) and E-d(lambda, z), 30% for E-d(lambda, z), and 50% for the irradiance reflectance]. These differences showed a high sensitivity to experimental uncertainties in a few input quantities used for the simulations: the seawater absorption coefficient; the hydrosol phase function backscattering probability; and, mainly for clear water, the bottom reflectance.

DAISEX involved simultaneous data acquisitions using different airborne imaging spectrometers over test sites in southeast Spain (Barrax) and the Upper Rhine valley (Colmar, France, and Hartheim, Germany). This paper presents the results corresponding to the column-integrated aerosol optical properties from ground-based spectroradiometer measurements over the Barrax area during the DAISEX campaign days in the years 1998, 1999, and 2000. The instruments used for spectral irradiance measurements were two Licor 1800 and one Optronic OL- 754 spectroradiometers. The analysis of the spectral aerosol optical depth in the visible range shows in all cases the predominance of the coarse-particle mode over the fine-particle mode. The analysis of the back trajectories of the air masses indicates a predominance of marine-type aerosols in the lower atmospheric layers in all cases. Overall, the results obtained show that during the DAISEX there was a combination of maritime aerosols with smaller continental aerosols.

CALIPSO will be launched in the fall of 2004 and will provide, for the first time, a global picture of the profile of atmospheric scattering layers using an onboard lidar radiated at 0.532 and 1.064 mum. CALIPSO will fly in an orbital formation with passive radiometers, such as the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MODIS) and the Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance ( POLDER) instruments, that monitor Earth's atmosphere. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the improvement in retrieval capabilities of profiles of aerosol optical properties using a synergy between passive and active ( lidar) remote sensing techniques. Aerosol properties derived from the MODIS spectroradiometer are used to constrain the inversion of the lidar signal in terms of aerosol optical thickness and effective radius. We use the lidar spectral backscattering coefficient between 0.532 and 1.064 mm to determine the profile of backscatter-to-extinction ratio. The effective radius of an assumed bimodal aerosol size distribution is then retrieved as a function of the altitude. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the inversion procedure in case of noise detection and calibration error. The algorithm has been tested during the Saharan dust experiment, which took place in the northeastern tropical Atlantic in September 2000. The vertical profile of extinction compares well with in situ measurements of the aerosol extinction. Profiles derived from lidar measurements on 25 September highlight the presence of the Saharan air layer located between 2.2 and 4.5 km with particle effective radii of 1.19 +/- 0.6 mm. Another dust layer within the sub-Saharan transition layer over the marine boundary layer is also observed, with particle radii significantly smaller than within the Saharan air layer.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 8	2003	108	D18							8575	10.1029/2002JD002774								WOS:000189017200001

The method is derived from radiative transfer (RT) simulations and subsequent application of artificial neural network ( ANN) techniques. Information on absorption and total scattering of pure seawater, colored dissolved organic matter, and marine particles are mostly taken from published measurements or parameterizations. Additionally, a new model relating the backscattering of marine particles to pigment concentration and wavelength is introduced. The such defined inherent optical properties are input to a RT code in order to generate a synthetic data set of remote sensing reflectance spectra. This synthetic data set is then used for the training of a set of ANNs with the aim to approximate the functional relationship between ocean color and pigment concentration. The different ANNs are obtained by systematic variations of input parameters, architecture, and noise level added to the training data. The performance of each individual ANN-based pigment retrieval scheme is assessed by applying it to the remote sensing reflectance spectra contained in the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-optical Algorithm MiniWorkshop (SeaBAM) data set and comparing the retrieved pigment concentrations to those actually measured. The most successful ANN compares favorably with commonly used empirical pigment retrieval schemes. Compared, e. g., to the SeaWiFS algorithms OC2B and OC4, the square of the correlation coefficient r(2) is increased from 0.924 (OC2B), respectively, 0.928 (OC4) to 0.934 (ANN). The root mean square error of the retrieved log-transformed pigment concentration drops from 0.156 for OC2B, respectively, 0.151 for OC4 to 0.148 for the ANN-based pigment retrieval scheme. Furthermore, the latter shows a higher resistance against noisy input data.

The present work presents a complete DSS for managing marine pollution events caused by oil spills. The system provides all the necessary tools for early detection of oil-spills from satellite images, monitoring of their evolution, estimation of the accident consequences and provision of support to responsible Public Authorities during clean-up operations. The heart of the system is an image processing-geographic information system and other assistant individual software tools that perform oil spill evolution simulation and all other necessary numerical calculations as well as cartographic and reporting tasks related to a specific management of the oil spill event. The cartographic information is derived from the extant general maps representing detailed information concerning several regional environmental and land-cover characteristics as well as financial activities of the application area. Early notification of the authorities with up-to-date accurate information on the position and evolution of the oil spill, combined with the detailed coastal maps, is of paramount importance for emergency assessment and effective clean-up operations that would prevent environmental hazard. An application was developed for the Region of Crete, an area particularly vulnerable to oil spills due to its location, ecological characteristics, and local economic activities.

After summarising the literature on thermal bar hydrodynamics, a thorough review is made of all plankton observations taken in the presence of a thermal bar. Two distinct plankton growth regimes are found, one with production favoured throughout the inshore region and another with a maximum in plankton biomass near the position of the thermal bar. Possible explanations for the observed distributions are then discussed, with reference to numerical modelling studies, and the scope for future study of this interdisciplinary topic is outlined.

Some of these initiatives and the country members involved are discussed in this paper. Particular emphasis is given to long-term observing systems and modelling conducted in the Eastern Mediterranean Levantine Basin and the region around the island of Cyprus. A complete operational oceanographic forecasting and observing system has been developed in Cyprus, and has been operational since early 2002. Me system is called CYCOFOS-Cyprus Coastal Ocean Forecasting and Observing System-and is a component of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), and its European (EuroGOOS) and Mediterranean (MedGOOS) modules. CYCOFOS is the result of several years of research activities all carried out within the framework of European Union-funded projects including: (1) Mediterranean forecasting system, both pilot project and towards environmental predictions (MFSPP and MESTEP), (2) Mediterranean network to Access and upgrade Monitoring and forecasts Activities in the region (MAMA), (3) European Sea level Service Research Infrastructure (ESEAS-RI), (4) Mediterranean network of Global sea Level Observing System (MedGLOSS), and (5) Marine Environment and Security in the European Areas (MERSEA strand 1). CYCOFOS at present consists of several operational modules, including flow and offshore waves forecasts, satellite remote sensing, coastal monitoring stations and end user-derived applications. All these operational modules provide regular near-real-time information, both to local and sub-regional end users in the Eastern Mediterranean Levantine Basin. This paper discusses these as well as additional ocean observation stations and features soon to be added to CYCOFOS.

J	Switzer, AC; Kamykowski, D; Zentara, SJ				Switzer, AC; Kamykowski, D; Zentara, SJ			Mapping nitrate in the global ocean using remotely sensed sea surface temperature	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] Nitrogen is the most broadly limiting factor for marine phytoplankton on ecological timescales. Nitrate, as the most oxidized inorganic species, plays a significant role in nitrogen availability based on nutrient flux to the euphotic zone from deeper waters, and is a major determinant of new production. Increased new production relates to higher trophic level abundance and to carbon dioxide drawdown from the atmosphere. The present work is the first stage in the development of a technique to generate a scaled index of nitrate availability in the surface waters of the global ocean using satellite-derived temperature data. The technique currently involves a fixed matrix of nitrate depletion temperatures (NDT) and remotely-sensed sea surface temperature (SST) from the monthly-averaged AVHRR Pathfinder series. The magnitude of the difference between these two temperatures at a given location indicates the degree of nitrate presence or absence. Graded monthly nitrate presence/absence maps over a 10-year period were created based on the size of the difference between these two temperatures. A 10-year average of these differences exhibits major nitrate distribution features similar to those observed in maps based on National Oceanic Data Center archived measurements. In contrast, monthly nitrate maps provide a unique and dynamic representation of nitrate availability in the global ocean. This nutrient monitoring capability based on remotely sensed data can contribute to the estimation of new production in the global ocean, improving management of various world fisheries and improving estimation of the atmospheric draw down of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				AUG 27	2003	108	C8							3280	10.1029/2000JC000444								WOS:000185253100001

To investigate the cause of the problem, three cloud-free matchup stations around Japan were analyzed, where in situ measurements were made onboard R/V Ronald H. Brown at the time of satellite overpass. Using an optimization method, information on the possible composition of aerosols was obtained from sky radiance data collected onboard the ship. An iterative radiative transfer simulation was carried out in an attempt to reproduce the satellite-measured top-of-atmosphere reflectance. The resulting water reflectance and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) agreed well with in situ measurements when the effect of submicron absorbing particles was considered in the radiative transfer simulation. The error in the retrieved water reflectance was much decreased, with average values of about 6% at 412 and 443 nm for the three stations. The effect of the Asian dust was also simulated in comparison with that of small absorptive aerosols. The underestimation could not be solely attributed to Asian dust. It was also found that at one of the stations, where the presence of dust aerosols was anticipated, an aerosol model mixed with both dust and soot improved the accuracy of the estimated AOT compared with the case of soot as the only absorptive aerosol (error of 13% at 865 nm instead of 44%). Submicron absorbing particles, in addition of the Asian dust, should be considered in the optical remote sensing of east Asian waters.

J	Brenguier, JL; Pawlowska, H; Schuller, L				Brenguier, JL; Pawlowska, H; Schuller, L			Cloud microphysical and radiative properties for parameterization and satellite monitoring of the indirect effect of aerosol on climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The spatial variability of the microphysical fields in stratocumulus clouds is documented in this paper with statistics of droplet number concentration, droplet mean volume radius, and liquid water content for eight cases of the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. Statistics are calculated in five sublayers, from cloud base to cloud top, and they are utilized for deriving estimates of cloud optical thickness and liquid water path, by assuming either random or maximum overlap. The resulting in situ frequency distributions of optical thickness and liquid water path are validated against distributions of these two parameters retrieved from independent remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances. They are also used for testing parameterizations of optical thickness based on liquid water path and either the droplet effective radius or the cloud droplet number concentration. This unique data set of extensive, concomitant, and independent measurements of cloud microphysical and radiative properties is finally used for assessing the detectability of the aerosol indirect effect through examination of the correlation between cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius. If only cases of comparable values of geometrical thickness are considered, the correlation between optical thickness and effective radius is negative, as anticipated by Twomey [1977]. However, if the most polluted cases are also accounted for, the trend suggests a positive correlation. In fact, the most polluted cloud systems sampled during ACE-2 were slightly drier, hence thinner, than the marine and intermediate cases, hence producing a positive correlation between optical thickness and droplet effective radius. This study demonstrates that the monitoring of the aerosol indirect effect with satellite observations requires an independent retrieval of the liquid water path together with the cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius.

S. Navy, NASA, and university scientists conducted the Puerto Rico Dust Experiment (PRIDE). In this paper we give a brief overview of mean meteorological conditions during the study. We focus on our findings on African dust transported into the Caribbean utilizing a Navajo aircraft and AERONET Sun photometer data. During the study midvisible aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in Puerto Rico averaged 0.25, with a maximum >0.5 and with clean marine periods of similar to0.08. Dust AOTs near the coast of Africa (Cape Verde Islands and Dakar) averaged similar to0.4, 30% less than previous years. By analyzing dust vertical profiles in addition to supplemental meteorology and MPLNET lidar data we found that dust transport cannot be easily categorized into any particular conceptual model. Toward the end of the study period, the vertical distribution of dust was similar to the commonly assumed Saharan Air Layer (SAL) transport. During the early periods of the study, dust had the highest concentrations in the marine and convective boundary layers with only a weak dust layer in the SAL being present, a state usually associated with wintertime transport patterns. We corroborate the findings of Maring et al. [2003] that in most cases, there was an unexpected lack of vertical stratification of dust particle size. We systematically analyze processes that may impact dust vertical distribution and speculate that dust vertical distribution predominately influenced by flow patterns over Africa and differential advection coupled with fair weather cloud entrainment, mixing by easterly waves, and regional subsidence.

Calculations based on the vertically uniform plane-parallel cloud model have been currently used for the retrieval of cloud optical thickness and droplet effective radius. They were extended in a previous work to the retrieval of cloud droplet number concentration and cloud geometrical thickness, by assuming a vertically stratified cloud model, with prescribed droplet spectrum. The retrieved values of cloud droplet number concentration though were substantially underestimated. Improvements are presented here with a more realistic parameterization of the droplet size distribution, based on the theory of droplet growth by vapor diffusion. The retrieval technique is applied to eight case studies of the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment and the retrieved values are compared to estimates derived from in situ cloud microphysical measurements. The technique provides accurate retrievals of cloud droplet number concentration, with no bias. The retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness though is systematically overestimated compared to that directly measured. This bias partly reflects the difference of cloud sampling between the two strategies. Remote sensing measurements, which are continuous, are capable of detecting the thickest cells of the cloud layer within the field of view of the radiometer, while discontinuous in situ vertical profiles provide a statistical average of the geometrical thickness. Part of the bias could also reflect three-dimensional effects of the radiative transfer in spatially heterogeneous clouds, which are not accounted for by the plane-parallel models. The data are then processed for deriving statistics of the retrieved values of cloud droplet number concentration, optical thickness, and liquid water path, for validation of large-scale parameterizations of the aerosol indirect effect.

J	Lohmann, U; Lesins, G				Lohmann, U; Lesins, G			Comparing continental and oceanic cloud susceptibilities to aerosols	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A common practice in remote sensing studies of the aerosol indirect effect is to consider the correlation between the droplet effective radius and the aerosol index. However, this correlation is not unique as the relationship depends also on the liquid water path. Moreover, it differs for oceanic and continental clouds because clouds over land generally have higher cloud bases, are thinner and have a higher average cloud droplet number concentration for a given aerosol index than marine clouds. Only when using aerosol number concentration at cloud base instead of aerosol index and using an effective radius representative for the whole cloud rather than just at cloud top, do the defined susceptibilities of oceanic and continental clouds obtained from ECHAM4 climate model simulations agree within the standard errors. This has important consequences for properly interpreting the magnitude of the anthropogenic indirect aerosol effect on climate.

This paper reports (1) the morphological and facies development of part of the lower delta during the last full sea-level cycle between 1929 and 1995, as monitored using remote sensing and field mapping, and (2) the Holocene development of the delta from outcrop data and augered transects. During a sea-level fall of 3 m between 1929 and 1977, rapid progradation of levees, composed of fine sand, took place along over 800 distributary channels along the delta front. Smaller distributaries became filled with clay and organics. During the 3-m sea-level rise from 1977 to 1995, aggradation occurred, leading to deposition of silt and clay on the levees and minor filling of the flood basins. Sedimentation rates as established with Cs-137 dating are up to 2-5 cm/year. Total thickness of Holocene deposits in the lower delta plain is 4-10 m. A coarsening-upwards sequence in the Damchik sandpit shows freshening-upwards mollusc assemblages dated around 1000 BP, and has been attributed to the Derbent regression at that time. Four transects with a total of 79 augerings down to 7 m depth show rapid lateral facies changes of: (a) lagoonal clays deposited in the palaeo relief between the dunes, (b) channel sands, (c) levee sands and silts, (d) laminated overbank and interdistributary bay deposits, (e) mouthbar deposits and (f) prodelta clays. Holocene depositional patterns are unrelated to the present drainage network, though the spatial variability is similar to that of the present highly segmented network. Seven C-14 datings give a range of 6000-800 BP, and several phases of progradation seem to be present, but the lateral variability is too large and the age data too limited to make a solid correlation with known Holocene sea-level fluctuations. The Volga delta differs essentially from the classic river-dominated Mississippi delta because the offshore gradient is so gentle that no marine reworking takes place at the outlets, and the friction-controlled bifurcation continues basinward until a very fine maze of distributary outlets is produced. The Volga Holocene sequences more resemble those of the Atchafalaya and Saskatchewan lacustrine deltas. However, they differ from them in not being subsystems of a larger delta but the main depositional facies of the delta as a whole. Moreover, the recent Volga delta development shows that progradation is related to forced regression, not to avulsion triggered by base-level rise and/or subsidence. Thus, the Volga delta provides an excellent example of the impact of high-frequency sea-level changes on a ramp margin-type fluvio-deltaic system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Foster-Smith, RL; Sotheran, IS				Foster-Smith, RL; Sotheran, IS			Mapping marine benthic biotopes using acoustic ground discrimination systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This paper describes the use and appraises the performance of acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) for marine benthic biotope mapping for those who are more familiar with satellite or airborne remote sensing. The operation of AGDS is described and the nature of the data produced compared with more conventional remotely sensed data. Analysis of the AGDS data involves the interpolation of track point data to create areal coverages that can then be interpreted using classification and image processing techniques. AGDS data have been shown to be variable both within and between surveys and systems which affects the performance of interpretation. Additionally, the marine environment imposes limitations on the way that ground sampling can be undertaken and the spatial extent of information that can be obtained. In summary, the main issues that contribute to variability and uncertainty of biotope maps based on AGDS-based methodology are: (1) errors in position fixing of both AGDS and the ground samples; (2) inconsistent performance of the AGDS system; (3) single frequency of AGDS and its effect on discrimination; (4) tracking intensity of AGDS survey; (5) heterogeneity of the seabed at the scale of resolution of the system; (6) lack of vista for designating training sites and the reliance on buffers around ground samples; (7) unsuitable biotope categories. Variability due to AGDS hardware is often beyond the control of surveyors, but quality control procedures can at least alert operators to poor quality data. Performance of AGDS surveys also depends on intensity of both tracking and ground sampling in relation to heterogeneity of the sea floor. This relationship can be investigated through exploratory spatial data analysis, particularly the variogram. The performance of biotope maps can be measured using error and similarity matrices. The accuracy of the biotope maps resulting from AGDS surveys is modest when compared with the performance of satellite or airborne remote sensing and the similarity between maps derived from different datasets can be low. It is misleading to base expectations of the performance of AGDS on satellite or airborne remote sensing systems. AGDS are low resolution systems with limited powers for discrimination between different ground types. However, they afford the opportunity to map benthic biotopes in environments where electromagnetic spectra-based systems cannot operate. Thus, AGDS is a useful tool for benthic ecologists to study the spatial distribution of biotopes oil the sea floor although the limitations of AGDS for mapping may preclude their use for precise and accurate survey required for some monitoring applications.

Advances were identified in the benefit of high spatial and spectral resolution data and complementary remote sensing techniques (e.g. optical and acoustic, optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)). Further benefits are identified in rapid and more frequent data acquisition, faster and more automated processing and a greater sampling intensity over conventional field-based techniques. Issues associated with adoption of remotely sensed data for management are discussed. Research priorities include the need for improved understanding and description of biotope classes and the functional interpretation of biotope maps and continued developments in understanding the radiative transfer properties of coastal environments. New knowledge is required on spatial and temporal variations of water column optical properties and its constituents. Methods for the best approaches to processing hyperspectral data require further investigation, as does the need for further testing of hyperspectral sensors for bottom type discrimination using data obtained at space-borne altitudes. Areas of value which continue to remain poorly investigated include the improvements to be gained from synergistic use of multi-wavelength remote sensing approaches, change detection techniques and multi-temporal comparisons and knowledge-based approaches to improve classification. The importance of specifically dedicated coastal zone sensors is discussed, as is alternative means of deployment (e.g. International Space Station (ISS) and Un-inhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)). The potential role of airborne digital photography for marine mapping is highlighted. The lack of accurate near-shore bathymetric data is identified as a key limitation in the application of geospatial data to coastal environments.

J	Ekebom, J; Erkkila, A				Ekebom, J; Erkkila, A			Using aerial photography for identification of marine and coastal habitats under the EU's Habitats Directive	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Implementation of the E.U. Habitats Directive requires information on the distribution, abundance and area covered by the habitats listed in Annex I of the Directive. 2. In Finland, 21 of these habitats occur in marine and coastal areas. The demand for spatial information of these habitats is increasing, so rapid and relatively inexpensive mapping methods are needed. 3. This study examines the identification of 15 habitats using high altitude black and white aerial photographs. Our goal was to find out how well these habitats could be identified using these types of photographs. We used a test group of 34 persons who were given only brief instructions on how to identify the habitats prior to the test. Their results were compared to a set of field data from an archipelago area at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland, in August 1999 and autumn 2000. 4. The test group identified sandy beaches, lagoons, submerged sandbanks and cliffs with an accuracy of 82%, 71%, 66% and 65%, respectively. The main reasons for these high accuracy percentages were apparently the high contrast and/or easy delineation of the habitat from the surrounding areas. 5. Reefs, wooded dunes and submerged reefs were identified with an accuracy of 39%, 44% and 45%, respectively. The remaining habitats were less precisely identified, apparently due to their small size or poor contrast to the surrounding areas. 6. High altitude aerial photographs are shown to be a useful tool for identifying several of these habitats and can be used as a complement to field mapping methods, GIS methods and other remote sensing techniques. The use of high altitude photographs for monitoring change is discussed.

To extend previous observations, a numerical model utilizing satellite-derived distributions of O-3, clouds, sea ice, surface temperature, and phytoplankton biomass was developed to study the hemispheric-scale seasonal effects of a deep Antarctic O-3 hole on primary production in the Southern Ocean. UVR-induced losses of surface phytoplankton production were substantial under all O-3 conditions, mostly due to UVA. However, when integrated to the 0.1% light depth, the loss of primary production resulting from enhanced fluxes of UVB due to O-3 depletion was <0.25%. The loss of primary production is minimized by the strong attenuation of UVR within the water column and by sea ice which is at its peak extent at the time of the most severe O-3 depletion.

Low salinity water can transport natural and manmade river-borne contaminants into the sea, and can directly stress marine ecosystems that are adapted to higher salinity levels. An efficient method of mapping surface salinity distribution over large ocean areas is required to address such environmental issues. We describe here an investigation of the utility of airborne remote sensing of sea surface salinity using an L-band passive microwave radiometer. The study combined aircraft overflights of the scanning low frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR) with shipboard and in situ instrument deployments to map surface and subsurface salinity distributions, respectively, in the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. The goals of the investigation were (a) to assess the performance of the airborne salinity mapper; (b) to use the maps and in situ data to develop an integrated description of the structure and zone of influence of a river plume under prevailing monsoon weather conditions; and (c) to determine the extent to which the sea surface salinity distribution expressed the subsurface structure. The SLFMR was found to have sufficient precision (1 psu) and accuracy ( similar to 3 psu) to provide a useful description of plumes emanating from estuaries of moderate discharge levels with a salinity range of 16 to 32 psu in the open sea. The aircraft surveys provided a means of rapidly assessing the spatial extent of the surface salinity distribution of the plume, while in situ data revealed subsurface structure detail and provided essential validation data for the SLFMR. The combined approach allowed us to efficiently determine the structure and zone of influence of the plume, and demonstrated the utility of sea surface salinity remote sensing for studying coastal circulation in tropical seas.

Several experiments have shown that the buoy had radiometric accuracy similar to standard sea-going optical profiling equipment ( about +/- 8%). There were 15 match-ups of good quality SeaWiFS and PlyMBODy data during 10 months of deployment between May 1997 and September 1998. Differences between PlyMBODy measurements of Lwn and SeaWiFS data ( processed using SeaDAS version 4.1) were found to be spectrally variable and sometimes large. The differences were small in the blue-green and green bands ( SeaWiFS bands 3 - 5, 490, 510, and 555 nm) where the biases were < 3% and the mean absolute differences were &SIM;20%. Bands 1, 2, and 6 ( 412, 443, and 670 nm) were significantly underestimated by SeaWiFS: the average differences were 55%, 19%, and 58%, respectively. The mean absolute differences were also much larger in these bands (30-77%). SeaWiFS radiometric measurements were generally sufficiently accurate to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration using OC4v4 to within the mission target of +/- 35% but with a high bias of &SIM;8%, though the performance of the algorithm itself was not tested. Bias and scatter of SeaWiFS Lwn measurements relative to PlyMBODy measurements were much poorer when SeaDAS version 3.3p5, rather than version 4.1, was used. The upgrade from SeaDAS 4.0p3 to 4.1 made little difference to the agreement.

J	Hou, B; Frakes, LA; Alley, NF; Clarke, JDA				Hou, B; Frakes, LA; Alley, NF; Clarke, JDA			Characteristics and evolution of the Tertiary palaeovalleys in the northwest Gawler Craton, South Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Integrated geoscientific datasets have contributed to an understanding of the Tertiary palaeovalleys once draining the Gawler Craton. Systematic investigations of both the shape and depth of the channels are based on interpretations from field exposures, a compendium of geological and drilling data, computer modelling of ancient landscapes, topographic and evaluated digital elevation models, remote sensing imagery, magnetics, seismic, gravity, airborne and transient electromagnetics, and radiometrics. Physical property contrasts that exist between the channel sediments and the underlying bedrock, for example, can be differentiated by geophysical methods to locate the incised-valley thalweg. Evidence from sedimentology is combined with evidence from other geological and geophysical characteristics to arrive at a general reconstruction of palaeovalley architecture and history. The palaeovalleys were originally incised into the weathered pre-Tertiary landscape of mostly weathered basement, and Tertiary fluvial, lacustrine, estuarine and even marine sediments accumulated during the Eocene and Miocene. Marine influence extended at least 100 km up the palaeovalleys during at least three major transgressions in the Eocene and Miocene intervals. Major sedimentary phases occurred in the Paleocene to Early Eocene, Middle to Late Eocene, Oligocene to Early Miocene, and Middle Miocene to Early Pliocene times.																	0812-0099					APR	2003	50	2					215	230		10.1046/j.1440-0952.2003.00987.x								WOS:000182043700007						
J	Isoun, E; Fletcher, C; Frazer, N; Gradie, J				Isoun, E; Fletcher, C; Frazer, N; Gradie, J			Multi-spectral mapping of reef bathymetry and coral cover; Kailua Bay, Hawaii	CORAL REEFS												We used high-resolution, airborne, digital, multi-spectral imagery to map bathymetry and the percent of living coral in the nearshore marine environment of Kailua Bay, Oahu, Hawai'i. Three spectral bands, with centers at 488, 551, and 577 nm (each with a full-width half maximum of 10 nm), were selected for good water transmission and good coral/sand/algae discrimination. However, the third band (577 nm) was not used in the depth and bottom-type solutions. The spatial resolution of 1 m per pixel was selected to balance resolution with the size of the total data set. A radiative transfer model accounting for the optical effects of the atmosphere, ocean surface, water, and reflection off the ocean bottom substrates was applied to the multi-spectral images, normalizing multiple images to one another for a mosaic that spans the bay. Atmospheric parameters in the radiative transfer model were estimated from published values measured for similar environments. Water-attenuation coefficients for the model were determined from the observed spectral data values over the sand bottom type in the bay. Relative depth and bottom-type coefficients were derived by a method most simply described as the "differencing" of two spectral bands. Accuracy exceeding 85% in predicted depth was achieved to a depth of 25 in. Depth prediction errors were assessed with comparison to hydrographic survey data. Classification of bottom-type coefficients into seven "percent living coral" categories results in 77% overall accuracy tested by diver-obtained line-intercept transect data (ground truth). Bottom-type coefficients derived by the model were corrected for atmospheric and ocean conditions on the date of collection, so spatial changes in bathymetry and "percent living coral" through time can be analyzed and related to environmental factors. The radiative transfer model and the "differencing" method used to solve for depth and "percent living coral" can be applied to any airborne, passive remote sensing digital data with appropriate spectral bands.																	0722-4028					APR	2003	22	1					68	82		10.1007/s00338-003-0287-4								WOS:000183018300014						
J	Aslan, A; White, WA; Warne, AG; Guevara, EH				Aslan, A; White, WA; Warne, AG; Guevara, EH			Holocene evolution of the western Orinoco Delta, Venezuela	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The pristine nature of the Orinoco Delta of eastern Venezuela provides unique opportunities to study the geologic processes and environments of a major tropical delta. Remote-sensing images, shallow cores, and radiocarbon-dating of organic remains form the basis for describing deltaic environments and interpreting the Holocene history of the delta. The Orinoco Delta can be subdivided into two major sectors. The southeast sector is dominated by the Rio Grande-the principal distributary-and complex networks of anastomosing fluvial and tidal channels. The abundance of siliciclastic deposits suggests that fluvial processes such as overbank flooding strongly influence this part of the delta. In contrast, the northwest sector is represented by few major distributaries, and overbank sedimentation is less widespread relative to the southeast sector. Peat is abundant and occurs in herbaceous and forested swamps that are individually up to 200 km(2) in area. Northwest-directed littoral currents transport large volumes of suspended sediment and produce prominent mudcapes along the northwest coast. Mapping of surface sediments, vegetation, and major landforms identified four principal geomorphic systems within the western delta plain: (1) distributary channels, (2) interdistributary flood basins, (3) fluvial-marine transitional environments, and (4) marine-influenced coastal environments. Coring and radiocarbon dating of deltaic deposits show that the northern delta shoreline has prograded 20-30 km during the late Holocene sea-level highstand. Progradation has been accomplished by a combination of distributary avulsion and mudcape progradation. This style of deltaic progradation differs markedly from other deltas such as the Mississippi where distributary avulsion leads to coastal land loss, rather than shoreline progradation. The key difference is that the Orinoco Delta coastal zone receives prodigious amounts of sediment from northwest-moving littoral currents that transport sediment from as far away as the Amazon system (similar to1600 km). Late Holocene progradation of the delta has decreased delta-plain gradients, increased water levels, and minimized overbank flooding and siliciclastic sedimentation in the northwest sector. These conditions, coupled with large amounts of direct precipitation, have led to widespread peat accumulation in interdistributary basins. Because peat-forming environments cover up to 5000 km(2) of the delta plain, the Orinoco may be an excellent analogue for interpreting ancient deltaic peat deposits.																	0016-7606					APR	2003	115	4					479	498		10.1130/0016-7606(2003)115<0479:HEOTWO>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000181928300007

The anvil cirrus blowoff from the final surge of tropical convection became embedded in subtropical flow that advected the cirrus across the western United States, where it was studied from the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (FARS) in Salt Lake City, Utah, on 25 September. A day later, the cirrus shield remnants were redirected southward by midlatitude circulations into the southern Great Plains, providing a case study opportunity for the research aircraft and ground-based remote sensors assembled at the Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) site in northern Oklahoma. Using these comprehensive resources and new remote sensing cloud retrieval algorithms, the microphysical and radiative cloud properties of this unusual cirrus event are uniquely characterized. Importantly, at both the FARS and CART sites the cirrus generated spectacular halos and arcs, which acted as a tracer for the hurricane cirrus, despite the limited lifetimes of individual ice crystals. Lidar depolarization data indicate widespread regions of uniform ice plate orientations, and in situ particle replicator data show a preponderance of pristine, solid hexagonal plates and columns. It is suggested that these unusual aspects are the result of the mode of cirrus particle nucleation, presumably involving the lofting of sea salt nuclei in strong thunderstorm updrafts into the upper troposphere. This created a reservoir of haze particles that continued to produce halide-salt-contaminated ice crystals during the extended period of cirrus cloud maintenance. The inference that marine microbiota are embedded in the replicas of some ice crystals collected over the CART site points to the longevity of marine effects. Various nucleation scenarios proposed for cirrus clouds based on this and other studies, and the implications for understanding cirrus radiative properties on a global scale, are discussed.

J	Krasnopolsky, VM; Schiller, H				Krasnopolsky, VM; Schiller, H			Some neural network applications in environmental sciences. Part I: forward and inverse problems in geophysical remote measurements	NEURAL NETWORKS												A broad class of neural network (NN) applications dealing with the remote measurements of geophysical (physical, chemical, and biological) parameters of the oceans. atmosphere, and land surface is presented. In order to infer these parameters from remote sensing (RS) measurements, standard retrieval and variational techniques are applied. Both techniques require a data converter (transfer function or forward model) to convert satellite measurements into geophysical parameters or vice versa. In many cases. the transfer function and the forward model can be represented as a continuous nonlinear mapping. Because the NN technique is a generic technique for nonlinear mapping, it can be used beneficially for modeling transfer functions and forward models. These applications are introduced in a broader framework of solving forward and inverse problems in RS. In this broader context, we show that NN is an appropriate and efficient tool for solving for-ward and inverse problems in RS and for developing fast and accurate forward models and accurate and robust retrieval algorithms. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by several real-life examples-operational NN applications developed by the authors for SSM/I and medium resolution imaging spectrometer sensors.

Two experiments to test and to demonstrate the system took place: one on the coast of Norway, north of Bergen in March 2000 and the second on the north coast of Spain at Gijon in October-November 2000. Qualitative and quantitative intercomparisons of the wave measurements and wave model products from these experiments are presented. These include measurements using the Wellen Radar (WERA) high-frequency (HF) radar, the WaMoS (Wave Monitoring System) X-band radar, a directional Waverider and output from the WAM wave model. Comparisons are made of the full directional spectra and of various derived parameters. This is the first-ever intercomparison between HF and X-band radar wave measurements and between either of these and WAM. It has provided a data set covering a much wider range of storm and swell conditions than had been available previously for radar wave-measurement validation purposes and has clarified a number of limitations of the radars as well as providing a lot of very useful radar wave data for future model-validation applications. The intercomparison has led to improvements in the data quality control procedures of both WaMoS and WERA. The two radar sytems measured significant wave height with mean biases of 3% and 6%, respectively, and mean direction differences of less than 2degrees in both cases. Limitations in the WAM model implementation are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

By applying regional empirical bio-optical algorithms for chlorophyll a concentration (Chla), total suspended matter concentration (TSM), and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm K-d(490), match-ups analysis has shown mean relative percentage differences of 40% for Chla, 28% for TSM, and 30% for K-d(490). The analysis is supported by comparison of in situ and satellite-derived normalized water leaving radiances nL(w) to highlight the importance of the NIR turbid-water correction and to discuss the intrinsic uncertainties due to the use of empirical algorithms.																	0196-2892					MAR	2003	41	3					548	558		10.1109/TGRS.2003.809939								WOS:000182871300005						
J	Finkl, CW; Krupa, SL				Finkl, Charles W.; Krupa, Steve L.			Environmental impacts of coastal-plain activities on sandy beach systems: Hazards, perception and mitigation	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Managed sandy beach environments along developed shores often appear safe and healthy because obvious hazards such as beach erosion and flooding are considered within the purview of various mitigation programs. A range of insidious and generally unseen hazards, mostly related to pollution, often pose greater threats to the wellbeing of beach systems than do the highly visible, well publicized shoreline retreat and inundation events. Some unseen hazards, such as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) laden with nutrients from. agro-urban activities on adjacent coastal plains,,are pervasive, processes of environmental degradation that occur so gradually that sequential impacts escape public attention. The contribution of SGDs to the coastal hydrologic regime is occasionally recognized in association with crescendo events associated with marine algal blooms that degrade water quality, bottom habitats, and coral reef ecology. Because the real dangers of SGD are probably unknown at this time, it is essential to initiate seepage meter studies of the already known high levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that are discharged to beach and nearshore environments. Locations of some of the larger submarine freshwater springs along the southeast Florida inner continental shelf are generally known, although volumes of flow have historically been reduced by reduction of head on the coastal plain. Submarine. groundwater provides, on a continual basis, the most direct nutrient linkage to nearshore environments. The insidious nature of the problem requires specialized detection techniques that incorporate site inspection of rock outcrop and reef morphology (for submarine springs and seeps), satellite and airborne remote sensing (coastal morphology, turbidity plumes), physical seepage measurement in situ, monitoring wells, and mini-piezometers to measure hydraulic flow. Discharges of surface water into estuaries exacerbate SGD-related pollution, as do sewage spills and outfall. pipes that discharge in the open ocean fronting beaches. Groundwater discharges for Palm Beach County are, for example, estimated at 1,659 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1). Total N in groundwater below the coastal plain adjacent to remnant Everglades averages about 1.3 mg l(-1). Groundwater nutrient fluxes to the coast are 5727 and 414 metric tons per year for N and P, respectively. Surface water contributions for N and P are respectively 2,473 and 197 metric tons per year. Nutrient delivery to beach and nearshore environments is a serious problem that threatens coastal water quality which in turn will impact beach-related activities. The full impact of the problem has yet to surface because it takes about 5 to 8 decades for groundwater from the interior parts of the coastal plain to reach the nearshore zone. Pollution of groundwaters has increased over the past five decades due to higher doses of fertilizers on croplands and runoff from expanding urban areas. The environmental quality of beach systems along this developed shore is clearly at risk from continuous pollution via nutrient-laden SGD.																	0749-0208					SPR	2003					35		132	150										WOS:000202961200014

J	Sumner, MD; Michael, KJ; Bradshaw, CJA; Hindell, MA				Sumner, MD; Michael, KJ; Bradshaw, CJA; Hindell, MA			Remote sensing of Southern Ocean sea surface temperature: implications for marine biophysical models	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Nineteen years of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Multi-Channel Sea Surface Temperature (AVERR MCSST) data were used to calculate monthly averages of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for a large region of the Southern Ocean centred on Macquarie Island. Between October and February, the MCSST data were a reliable source of SSTs north of 60degreesS, but their quality (i.e. spatial and temporal density) was degraded severely at higher latitudes. Between April and August, the interpolated MCSST data were found to be unreliable in the study area, even at latitudes as low as 45degreesS. A specific problem has been identified to the west of Tasmania in the winter interpolated climatology which is likely an artefact of interpolation of sparse data. The poor coverage of valid MCSSTs during this time limits the data's application for many uses. Although the limitations of the MCSST data set are well recognised, the possibilities for ecological applications of these data remain largely unexplored and unquantified. The potential exists to maximize the information available from this and other similar data sets by determining the appropriate spatial and temporal scales at which they are best applied to biophysical models.

The Raman lidar allowed a direct determination of the volume extinction coefficient of the particles at 355 and 532 nm at ambient conditions. Heavily polluted air masses from the Asian continent passed over the Maldives during the northeast monsoon seasons. The mean 532-nm particle optical depth was about 0.3; maximum values of 0.7 were measured. Above the polluted marine boundary layer, lofted plumes were found up to 4000-m height. On average, the free-tropospheric aerosol layers contributed 30 - 60% to the particle optical depth. The volume extinction coefficient at 532 nm typically ranged from 25 to 175 Mm(-1) in the elevated layers. The pollution plumes are characterized separately for the air masses from Southeast Asia, North India, and South India. The analysis includes backward trajectories and emission inventory data for India. The extinction-to-backscatter ratio ( lidar ratio) at 532 nm was mostly between 30 and 100 sr, and accumulated at 50 - 80 sr for highly absorbing particles from northern India. The shift of the lidar-ratio distribution for northern Indian aerosols by about 20 sr toward larger values compared to European values is consistent with an aerosol black-carbon content of up to 20%. The Angstrom exponent ( for short wavelengths 355/400/532 nm) ranged mostly from 1 to 1.6 for Southeast Asian particles, from 0.8 to 1.4 for North Indian pollution, and from 0.6 to 1 for South Indian air masses. The comparably low Indian Angstrom exponents ( indicating a comparably large mean particle radius) are possibly caused by the high contribution of biomass combustion to the aerosol formation in India. Results of a correlation analysis based on the lidar ratio, extinction coefficient, Angstrom exponents, and relative humidity are presented. In most cases only a weak relationship or no relationship was found between the different parameters.

Figures indicate that, each year, the marine insurance industry pays out over $2 billion in claims for weather-related accidents, while bad weather causes one ship of over 500 t to sink somewhere on the globe every week. Accurate knowledge of local ocean conditions is therefore crucial in providing forecasts and early warnings of severe weather conditions. Space-borne systems, particularly satellites, provide the ideal platform for global monitoring of sea conditions via altimetric measurements. As an alternative to active altimetry, another concept is passively receiving reflected signals from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and other Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites. This concept was first developed by Dr Manuel Martin-Neira at ESA-ESTEC. ESA's Passive Reflectometry and Interferometry System makes use of GPS/GNSS signals from satellites and their reflection off the ocean surface to derive oceanic properties such as surface height, significant wave height, wind speed and wind direction. Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd are proposing a nanosatellite demonstration mission to ascertain the feasibility of the GPS ocean reflectometry concept.																	1364-503X					JAN 15	2003	361	1802					41	43		10.1098/rsta.2002.1105								WOS:000180535200006

Airborne measurements of both the coarse and fine mode aerosol during these campaigns provided assessment of the spatial variability in aerosol parameters (including optical properties and degree of internal versus external mixing) in continental plumes encountered over the Pacific Ocean. Large perturbations to the "pristine'' marine atmosphere were observed. Most plumes were encountered in the Southern Hemisphere during PEMT A, while the opposite was observed during PEMT B. A variety of anthropogenic and natural sources for these continental plumes are suggested by the data, including biomass burning, urban/industrial emissions, and in the case of Asian outflow, dust storms. Aerosol size distributions (particularly for the refractory component) varied from one plume to another and most combustion-derived aerosol appeared to be an internal mix of a refractory soot-like constituent in a volatile matrix. Within the sampled plumes, size-resolved volatility suggested that this volatile matrix was relatively well neutralized, implying the presence of ammonia in the particle phase. The radiatively important single scatter albedo () obtained from measured "dry'' scattering and absorption coefficients ranged from approximately 0.88 (pollution with no coarse particles) to 0.94 (pollution and dust) in the free troposphere (FT) to 0.98 (pollution and sea salt) within the marine boundary layer (MBL). Vertical profiles often revealed more concentrated plumes aloft, typically situated in dry air with ambient relative humidity (RH) <40%, and much lower values of omega than in the underlying MBL.																	2169-897X					JAN 3	2003	108	D2							8236	10.1029/2001JD001451								WOS:000181499400001

First, the properties and characteristics of HY-1A are briefly introduced; second, the quality and availability are evaluated by means of the complex signal noise ratio ( CSNR) which is simulated theoretically; third, the received HY-1A data are compared with SeaSTAR data to understand the accuracy of radiance measurement by the HY-1A; finally, the remote sensing products of ocean color and temperature are mapped to study the application potentiality of HY-1A.

By understanding how ocean dynamics affects the distribution and behavior of whales and the organisms forming the food web upon which the whales feed, it may be possible to conduct acoustic exercises in areas of low cetacean density. The first two Sirena multidisciplinary cruises were conducted in the Ligurian Sea in late summer time frame during 1999 and 2000. The focus of this analysis is to determine whether remotely sensed satellite data can indicate nutrient-rich regions in areas where the oceanography is known and to determine if these regions of higher productivity, coupled with knowledge of cetacean presence from all available sources, could be used as an indicator of marine mammal presence for acoustic risk mitigation purposes. For the two years of data examined here, cooler sea-surface temperature data correlated with high levels of chlorophyll production as seen by remotely sensed images. This remotely sensed data correlated well with measured subsurface values of the same parameters. Coincident sightings of three species of marine mammals indicated that in and sperm whales generally preferred the deep, nutrient-rich portion of the basin while Cuvier's beaked whales preferred a submarine canyon where there is a frontal influence, as indicated from satellite data and historical oceanography. This paper is intended as a contribution to the longer term objective of developing the means to accurately predict cetacean presence from physical oceanographic characteristics.

J	Fyfe, SK				Fyfe, SK			Spatial and temporal variation in spectral reflectance: Are seagrass species spectrally distinct?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The spectral signatures of the seagrasses Zostera capricorni, Posidonia australis, and Halophila ovalis were investigated to determine whether species could be discriminated by remote sensing. The spectral reflectance of fouled and unfouled leaf samples collected from marine and brackish habitats at three estuaries in southeastern Australia were measured in the field with a spectroradiometer during each season in 1999 and 2000. Seagrass species were spectrally distinct regardless of whether the leaves were fouled by epibionts and despite spatial and temporal variability in the reflectance of each species. The visible wavelengths that penetrate water coincide with the regions of maximum absorption and characteristic reflectance by plant photosynthetic and accessory pigments. Strong and consistent differences in reflectance between species were recorded in the green wavelengths at 530-580 nm with additional discrimination in the regions 520-530 nm and 580-600 nm and at the red chlorophyll absorption trough at 686-700 nm. Species discrimination should be possible in the remote sensing of benthic aquatic vegetation using a hyperspectral sensor that has narrow bands centered on pigment-related spectral features in the visible wavelengths. The detection of statistically significant differences in intraspecific reflectance associated with the year, season, estuary, and habitat of sample collection suggests a potential for monitoring seagrass health and estuarine water quality. This study has produced the first spectral library of aquatic plant species to take into account the range of spectral variability expected for the species under natural conditions. The results provide a sound basis for future mapping of seagrass species in Australia.

J	Stephens, FC; Louchard, EM; Reid, RP; Maffione, RA				Stephens, FC; Louchard, EM; Reid, RP; Maffione, RA			Effects of microalgal communities on reflectance spectra of carbonate sediments in subtidal optically shallow marine environments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This study was conducted in subtidal areas around Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, to investigate how microalgal biomass and community structure affect hyperspectral reflectance of sediments. Hyperspectral reflectance was measured on the surfaces of sediment cores collected from several types of carbonate sediments and habitats. Subsequently, photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments within the microalgae colonizing the top 5 mm of the sediment cores were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results of pigment analyses indicate that both microalgal biomass and community structure varied within and among sampling sites. Examination of spectral reflectance revealed differences both in the magnitude of overall reflectance between 400 and 710 nm and in the magnitude of absorption features. Second derivative analysis of reflectance spectra was used to identify nine narrow wavebands that correspond to wavelengths most affected by in vivo absorption by specific pigments. Results of linear regression analyses of the ratio of second derivatives at 676 nm to reflectance at 676 nm versus chlorophyll a plus chlorophyllide a indicate that total (living plus senescent or dead) microalgal biomass can be estimated from measurements of hyperspectral reflectance. Estimates of microalgal biomass can also be made based on the ratios of second derivatives at 444 nm to reflectance at 444 nm. Concentrations of other pigment groups can be estimated from second derivatives at 492 and 540 nm. These relationships between hyperspectral reflectance of sediments and benthic microalgal pigments suggest that remote sensing reflectance might be useful for distinguishing major differences among benthic habitats in some optically shallow areas.																	0024-3590					JAN	2003	48	1	2				535	546		10.4319/lo.2003.48.1_part_2.0535								WOS:000182049800022

Through examination of ancillary data, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with the view that the size structure and taxonomic composition of phytoplanktonic communities are regulated by physical processes, for which temperature is often a suitable proxy. Results obtained from multiple-linear regression analysis showed that by using temperature and chlorophyll a concentration, both of which can be retrieved by remote sensing, a larger proportion of the residual variance in a*(lambda) could be explained than if chlorophyll a concentration were used alone. Furthermore, as a single independent variable, temperature could explain nearly an equal proportion of the variance of a* (lambda) as chlorophyll a. These results show clearly the potential of using satellite-derived temperature data to improve retrieval of phytoplankton biomass from remotely sensed data on ocean colour.

J	Bell, WH; Fowler, EM; Stein, JA				Bell, WH; Fowler, EM; Stein, JA			Coastal seas as a context for science teaching: a lesson from Chesapeake Bay	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					5th International Conference on Environmental Management of Enclosed Coastal Seas	NOV 19, 2001	KOBE, JAPAN					Lessons that employ authentic environmental data can enhance the ability of students to understand fundamental science concepts. This differs from traditional "environmental education" in that school curricula need not set aside time for educators to teach only environmental topics. Rather, the "environment" is used to advance student learning in science and technology. The success of this approach depends on programs that encourage scientists to communicate more effectively with teachers at all education levels. The expanding diversity of research and monitoring activities on the world's marine waters constitutes an outstanding potential education resource. Many of these projects involve remote sensing with sophisticated instrumentation and employ Internet technology to compile measurements, interpret data using graphs and satellite imagery, and share the results among scientific colleagues and the general public alike. Unfortunately, these resources, which constitute a much shortened path between research findings and textbook presentation, are seldom interpreted for use by K-12 educators. We have developed an example that uses the Chesapeake Bay as a paradigm to demonstrate how such interpretation can assist educators in teaching important principles in physical oceanography and marine ecology. We present this example using PowerPoint to conduct a virtual tour of selected Internet sources. Our example begins with the conceptual "salt wedge" circulation model of Chesapeake Bay as a partially mixed estuary. Teachers have the opportunity to explore this model using salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen data taken from a research vessel platform during summer professional development programs. This source of authentic data, originally obtained by teachers themselves, clearly demonstrates the presence of a picnocline and deep-water anoxia. Our lesson plan proceeds to interpret these data using additional Internet-based resources at increasing scales of time and space. The "salt wedge," picnocline, and anoxia are examined using graphics derived from data taken by researchers using "ScanFish," a towed instrument that samples temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen at a resolution of only a few meters vertically and horizontally. The seasonal dynamics of these parameters at a given location are interpreted using biweekly monitoring data obtained as part of the state-federal Chesapeake Bay Program. The influence of annual variations in freshwater input is examined using stream flow data from US. Geological Survey gauging stations. Satellite remote sensing images from the TOPEX/Poseidon project are used to show how El Nino and La Nina events in the mid-Pacific affect the Chesapeake Bay system via rainfall on its watershed. Finally, the life cycle of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) is presented to show how an estuarine organism has adapted to this truly unique and dynamic coastal environment.

First, the parameters of an exponential model in different spectral intervals were determined. In addition, the suitability of some other models for the approximation of CDOM spectra was estimated. Specific absorption coefficients of CDOM were calculated from the absorption coefficients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. The experimental initial data were differences between spectral attenuation coefficients of filtered and distilled water. Two datasets were used: 1) for 13 Estonian and 7 Finnish lakes (altogether 404 spectra between 350 and 700 nm) measured by the Estonian Marine Institute (EMI); 2) for 10 Finnish lakes (73 spectra) measured by the Finnish Environment Institute (FEI). The spectra of CDOM absorption coefficients (a(CDOM)) were calculated from experimental data taking into account the correction due to scattering properties of colloids in the filtered water. The total content of CDOM in natural waters of Estonian and Finnish lakes was expressed by means of a(CDOM) at the wavelength of 380 nm. It varied significantly, from 0.71 to 19.5 m(-1), the mean value (of all the investigated lakes) being around 6.6 m(-1). Slopes of the exponential approximation varied widely, from 0.006 to 0.03 nm(-1). Averaged over all lakes values of slope for the interval 380-500 nm obtained from the EMI dataset are close to those obtained from the FEI dataset: from 0.014 nm(-1) (without correction) to 0.016-0.017 nm(-1) (with different types of correction). These results are in good correspondence with most published data. Attempts to describe the spectra in the region of 350-700 nm by means of hyperexponential functions (similar to exp(-alphalambdaeta)) show that: (1) eta < I (in the case of traditional exponential approximation eta = 1); (2) a promising idea is to seek the best fit only for wavelengths lambda > lambda(1), where lambda(1) will be chosen taking into account the real shape of a(CDOM) spectra. The mean value of the specific absorption coefficient (a*(CDOM)) at the wavelength 380 nm obtained in this study (0.44 L mg(-1) m(-1)) is close to the values published in the literature, if we assume that a*(CDOM) (380) is calculated using the data of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The optically non-active fraction of DOM in our study was high and therefore a*(CDOM) (380) was considerably higher (1.01 L mg(-1) m(-1)) than a*(CDOM) (380). The results of the present work could be used in the modeling of underwater light field as well as in the interpretation of radiation measurements and optical remote sensing results.

Unlike previous models, the present one takes greater account of the complexity of the physiological processes in phytoplankton. We have focused in particular on photophysiological processes, which are governed directly or indirectly by light energy, or in which light, besides the nutrient content in and the temperature of seawater, is one of the principal limiting factors. To achieve this aim we have carried out comprehensive statistical analyses of the natural variability of the main photophysiological properties of phytoplankton and their links with the principal abiotic factors in the sea. These analyses have made use of extensive empirical data gathered in a wide diversity of seas and oceans by Polish and Russian teams as well as by joint Polish-Russian expeditions. Data sets available on the Internet have also been applied. As a result, a set of more or less complex, semi-empirical models of light-stimulated processes occurring in marine phytoplankton cells has been developed. The trophic type of sea, photo-acclimation and the production of photoprotecting carotenoids, chromatic acclimation and the production of various forms of chlorophyll-antennas and photosynthetic carotenoids, cell adaptation by the package effect, light absorption, photosynthesis, photoinhibition, the fluorescence effect, and the activation of PS2 centres are all considered in the models. These take into account not only the influence of light, but also, indirectly, that of the vertical mixing of water; in the case of 'photosynthesis, the quantum yield has been also formulated as being dependent on the nutrient concentrations and the temperature of seawater. The bio-optical spectral models of irradiance transmittance in case 1 oceanic waters and case 2 Baltic waters, developed earlier, also are described in this paper. The development of the models presented here is not yet complete and they all need continual improvement. Nevertheless, we have used them on a preliminary basis for calculating various photosynthetic characteristics at different depths in the sea, such as the concentration of chlorophyll and other pigments, and primary production. The practical algorithm we have constructed allows the vertical distribution of these characteristics to be determined from three input data: chlorophyll a concentration, irradiance, and temperature at the sea surface. Since all three data can be measured remotely, our algorithm can be applied as the 'marine part' of the remote sensing algorithms used for detecting marine photosynthesis.																	0078-3234						2003	45	2					171	245										WOS:000183916500001

(2003). We now describe an application of the model to determine quantities characterising the photosynthesis of marine algae, especially the quantum yield of photosynthesis and photosynthetic primary production. These calculations have permitted the analysis of the variability of these photosynthesis characteristics in a diversity of seas, at different seasons, and at different depths. Because of its structure, the model can be used as the 'marine part' of a 'satellite' algorithm for monitoring primary production in the sea (the set of input data necessary for the calculations can be determined with remote sensing methods). With this in mind, in the present work, we have tested and verified the model using empirical data. The verification yielded satisfactory results: for example, the statistical errors in estimates of primary production in the water column for Case I Waters do not exceed 45%. Hence, this model is far more accurate than earlier, less complex models hitherto applied in satellite algorithms.																	0078-3234						2003	45	3					395	423										WOS:000185721000003

Its survival and continuing vigour after 70 years is a testament to its utility, which has been achieved in spite of great changes in our understanding of the marine environment and in our concerns over how to manage it. The CPR has been superseded in several respects by other technologies, such as acoustics and remote sensing, but it continues to provide unrivalled seasonal and geographic information about a wide range of zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa. The value of this coverage increases with time and provides the basis for placing recent observations into the context of long-term, large-scale variability and thus suggesting what the causes are likely to be. Information from the CPR is used extensively in judging environmental impacts and producing quality status reports (QSR); it has shown the distributions of fish stocks, which had not previously been exploited; it has pointed to the extent of ungrazed phytoplankton production in the North Atlantic, which was a vital element in establishing the importance of carbon sequestration by phytoplankton. The CPR continues to be the principal source of large-scale, long-term information about the plankton ecosystem of the North Atlantic. It has recently provided extensive information about the biodiversity of the plankton and about the distribution of introduced species. It serves as a valuable example for the design of future monitoring of the marine environment and it has been essential to the design and implementation of most North Atlantic plankton research.

The measurement of ocean colour by satellite remote sensing makes it possible to map the near-surface phytoplankton distribution, although the subsurface vertical structure cannot be measured. In this study, we investigated the shape of vertical chlorophyll profiles from the Benguela upwelling system seasonally and with respect to environmental variables such as surface temperature and chlorophyll, and mixed layer and water column depth. We used an artificial neural network technique called a self-organizing map to identify characteristic classes of vertical chlorophyll profiles, and then classify existing profiles into these representative classes. The self-organizing map identified a continuum of patterns, ranging from those with small deep peaks (1 mg m(-3), 45 m) to those with large near-surface peaks (9 mg m(-3), 7 m). Although profile shape varied seasonally, profiles were very variable within each season, making chlorophyll profiles averaged seasonally meaningless. A canonical succession in profile shape following upwelling of cold water in spring and summer could be identified, with large surface peaks in cool water and small deep peaks in warm water. The approach presented here can be used in a semi-quantitative manner to predict the subsurface chlorophyll field from known (water column depth) or easily measured variables from satellites (surface temperature or surface chlorophyll), as the relative frequency of each characteristic profile under different environmental conditions is presented. This approach enables prediction of profile shapes in the dynamic coastal domain and thus superior regional estimates of primary production.

A retrieval algorithm has been developed which computes the AOD using band 7 data by treating the ocean surface as a dark background after removing the Rayleigh path radiance in the sensor-detected radiances. This algorithm has been used to detect marine aerosol distributions at different coastal and offshore locations around India. A comparison between OCM derived AOD and the NOAA operational AOD shows a correlation similar to0.92 while that between OCM derived AOD and the ground-based sun photometer measurements near the coast of Trivandrum shows a correlation of similar to0.90.

The concentration of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is a primary factor affecting the absorption of incident sunlight in coastal and estuarine waters. In estuaries, CDOM concentrations vary due to changes in salinity gradients, inflows of industrial and domestic effluents, and the production of new dissolved organic matter from marine biologic activity. CDOM absorption data have been collected from a variety of waters. However, there are a limited number of measurements along the US east coast and a general lack of data from New England waters. This study characterized the temporal and spatial variability of CDOM absorption over an annual cycle in Narragansett Bay and Block Island Sound (Rhode Island). Results suggested that, in Narragansett Bay, the magnitude of CDOM absorption is related to the seasonal variability of freshwater input from surrounding watersheds and new CDOM production from in situ biologic activity. The data show that the average CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm was 0.45 m(-1) and the average spectral slope was 0.020 nm(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The technique of differential optical absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the column density of the nitrate radical (NO3)as a function of solar zenith angle (SZA) during sunrise. The tropospheric column densities show a large degree of day-to-day variability and indicate that a significant fraction of tropospheric NO3 exists in the free troposphere (FT). The change in the NO3 column density with SZA was then used to retrieve the vertical concentration profile of NO3,by applying an optimal estimation method [see Coe et al., 2002]. This analysis indicates that there is often substantially more NO3 in the upper boundary layer and lower FT than at the surface. Back-trajectory calculations and a simple box model are used to account for the observations.

J	Jacobson, AR; Shao, XM				Jacobson, AR; Shao, XM			FORTE satellite observations of very narrow radiofrequency pulses associated with the initiation of negative cloud-to-ground lightning strokes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] The FORTE satellite's radiofreqency receiver/recorder system has been used to study extremely narrow (similar to100 ns width) radiofrequency pulses accompanying the initiation of negative cloud-to-ground strokes. These pulses have been observed from the ground for over two decades. The FORTE space-based observations are substantially consistent with the prior ground-based results, at least in regard to pulsewidth, distance-scaled pulse amplitude, and the pulses' basic association with negative cloud-to-ground strokes, relative to either positive cloud-to-ground or intracloud strokes. New results from the FORTE observations include (1) information on the radiation pattern (versus elevation angle), (2) the tendency of the underlying fast-pulse radiation process to occur preferentially in marine, rather than dry-land, locations, and (3) the high degree of linear polarization of the radiated signal. These three new results were not accessible to ground-based measurements, which do not sample elevation angles other than zero, whose signal distortion with overland propagation paths (at zero elevation angle) tends to confuse the issue of the (land versus sea) location affinity of the pulse source itself, and whose received signal is a fortiori linearly polarized because of the adjacent ground plane. The narrow radiofrequency pulse that accompanies negative cloud-to-ground strokes provides a useful identifier, in the satellite's radiofrequency datastream, of the occurrence of this particular kind of stroke. Additionally, the observations reported here indicate that the radiating element is a single, vertical current stalk, rather than a collection of randomly oriented, mutually incoherent dipoles, such as are believed to be responsible for most very high frequency signals from lightning.																	2169-897X					NOV	2002	107	D22							4661	10.1029/2001JD001542								WOS:000180867500062

Observations were made at Palmer Station, Antarctica, under uniform marine stratus clouds during both ice-free and iced-in ocean conditions. The model results using actual snow/ocean area coverage show good qualitative agreement with all-sky images and high spectral resolution radiometer scans. When viewing over the island, toward the northeast, observations and modeling indicate that sky radiance in the visible bands is up to a factor of two greater than for directions toward the southwest, viewing out over open ocean. Owing to a decrease in snow reflectance at longer wavelengths, modeled and observed radiance distributions in the near infrared tend to be much more symmetric. Results of the modeling study indicate that details of the snow BRDF, or island topography, have a very small effect on model predictions. In addition, the model indicates that the angular distribution of sky radiance is fairly insensitive to cloud optical depth (assumed homogeneous) and is independent of cloud height as long as cloud layer thickness is not much larger than the cloud base height.

Air-surface exchange processes, where temperature plays a central role in controlling volatilization and deposition, are of key importance in controlling global POP dynamics. The present study is an assessment of the role of oceanic biogeochemical processes, notably phytoplankton uptake and vertical fluxes of particles, on the global dynamics of POPS. Field measurements of atmospheric polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), and furans (PCDFs) are combined with remote sensing estimations of oceanic temperature, wind speed, and chlorophyll, to model the interactions between air-water exchange, phytoplankton uptake, and export of organic matter and POPS out of the mixed surface ocean layer. Deposition is enhanced in the mid-high latitudes and is driven by sinking marine particulate matter, rather than by a cold condensation effect. However, the relative contribution of the biological pump is a function of the physical-chemical properties of POPs. It is concluded that oceanic biogeochemical processes play a critical role in controlling the global dynamics and the ultimate sink of POPS.

The water quality at two 'hot spot' areas along the Mediterranean coast of Israel was mapped with the hyper-spectral Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) sensor during two airborne campaigns (April 1997 and October 1999). The present study demonstrates the advantage of hyper-spectral remote sensing techniques as a rapid synoptic monitoring tool in coastal sites affected by land-based point sources of nutrients and particles. The coastal sites are characterized by patchy distribution and sharp concentration changes of SPM and Chl a. It is suggested that integration of CASI in compliance monitoring at 'hot spot' areas can provide vital information on the state of the environment and on the effectiveness of pollution control measures taken.																	1018-4619	1610-2304				OCT	2002	11	10A			SI		782	787										WOS:000180159600011

In order to advance in our understanding and quantification of this coupled ocean-atmosphere system, both synoptic and predictive capabilities must be largely improved. Hitherto, large-scale oceanic DMS has eluded being captured from remote sensing, correlated with synoptic variables, or simulated by mechanistic modeling. We have found a simple empirical relationship that permits global-ocean monthly distributions of DMS concentration to be computed from a combination of remotely sensed biospheric data (chlorophyll a) and climatological geophysical data (mixed layer depth). This relationship allows for the desired synopticity and predictability in the ocean-to-atmosphere sulfur flux, which we have globally quantified as 23-35 Tg S yr(-1). Also, our algorithm stands in support of a biogenic-DMS/solar-radiation negative feedback and opens the door toward quantifying its strength and its response to global warming.																	0886-6236					OCT-NOV	2002	16	4							1078	10.1029/2001GB001829								WOS:000180874100026						
J	Zecchetto, S; De Biasio, F				Zecchetto, S; De Biasio, F			On shape, orientation, and structure of atmospheric cells inside wind rolls in two SAR images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING					International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium	JUL 09-13, 2001	SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA					Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the sea surface often show roll-vortex structures and other features which, in general, are spread out over several length scales and may present spatial periodicity as well as intermittence. Standard techniques, such as two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier analysis, are unsuitable both when it is of interest to detect intermittent phenomena and to analyze the spatial disposition of the backscatter structures inside the SAR images. For the above reasons, the 2-D continuous wavelet transform analysis has been applied to two European Remote Sensing mission SAR images over the Mediterranean Sea, showing wind rolls and atmospheric gravity waves. Through the evaluation of the wavelet variance map, which ideally corresponds to the 2-D Fourier spectrum, it has been possible to assess the presence of two main energy areas at large (from 7-28 km) and small (from 0.5-2 km) spatial scales. While the large-scale fluctuations may be ascribed to atmospheric gravity waves and other features induced by the surroundings, the small-scale fluctuations reveal the inner structure of the atmospheric mind rolls. The SAR-like maps, obtained by adding the wavelet coefficient maps pertaining to the small scales, have permitted to highlight the high- and low-intensity backscatter cells associated with the wind rolls. These cells have been statistically characterized by means of the frequency distributions of the size of the cells maximum and minimum axes, of the orientation of the maximum axis, and of their area. The results indicate that high-and low-intensity backscatter cells have similar characteristics in both cases studied: they appear of elliptic shape, with the major axis along the wind roll direction; the average axes ratio is 2.5:1. The frequency distributions of the cells area indicate a continuous distribution of sizes, without significant gaps.

It is a dynamic and complex system that is vulnerable to human activities. This article summarizes results of geo-environmental mapping in the northwestern delta. Geo-environments are land- and water-resource units that are defined by the physical, chemical, hydrological, and biological properties and processes that establish, maintain, and modify them. More than 20 geo-environments were defined and delineated in a Geographic Information System (GIS) format through integrated remote sensing, statistical, and field analyses. Map units were grouped into five major geomorphic/ecologic systems: 1) marine-influenced coast; 2) marine-influenced distributary-channel. and island, 3) fluvial/marine transitional, 4) distributary-channel, and 5) interdistributary basin. The most extensive, are the interdistributary basins and distributary-channel systems, which comprise 44% and 15% of the map area, respectively. Although the Orinoco Delta is largely undeveloped, human activity in the northwestern delta,,especially construction of the Volcan dam, has substantially altered geo-environments in this region. The defined distribution and characteristics of the geo-environments provide a basis for designing strategic plans for prudent and sustained development of this portion of the Orinoco Delta ecosystem complex.																	0378-1844					OCT	2002	27	10					521	+										WOS:000178717400003

We present in-situ reflectance spectroscopy techniques (usually applied in remote sensing) to analyse the organic fraction of marine and terrestrial sediment. From absorption band depths, photosynthesis pigment variations are derived for sediments from the upwelling region off Peru, where productivity is related to the annual variability of El Nino strength. Quantitative estimations of diagenetic photosynthesis pigments derived from absorption band analysis in reflectance spectra are highly correlated to organic carbon content. The ratio of pigment fractions is related to chlorine concentration and reflects organic matter preservation and deep-water ventilation changes. The import of terrigenous mineroclastics (TM) by local rivers is semi-quantitatively documented in the spectrum continuum. TM is inversely varying with organic matter preservation and chlorine concentration.																	1437-3254					OCT	2002	91	5					950	954		10.1007/s00531-002-0264-0								WOS:000178989500015

Measurements were taken at Ny-Angstromlesund, Spitsbergen (79degrees N, 11degrees E), in winter and spring 1996 and 1997 and at Andoya (69.3degrees N, 16degrees E) from summer 1998 until summer 1999. AM and PM differential slant column densities (DSCDs) at 90degrees SZA of BrO and OClO reached their maxima during polar vortex conditions in the winter months and were anti-correlated to temperature and NO2. Comparison of BrO with a 3-D chemical transport model showed good agreement for seasonal trends and non-vortex conditions. BrO AM/PM ratios were underestimated by the model for vortex conditions, indicating the need for better quantification of BrO source and sink reaction rates. The detection of OClO above 200 K at the 475 K isentropic level indicates the possible activation of chlorine on sulphate particles. Several episodes of boundary layer ozone depletion due to marine-derived BrO were evident in our zenith-sky spectra during April 1997 in Ny-Angstromlesund.

J	Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ				Mumby, PJ; Edwards, AJ			Mapping marine environments with IKONOS imagery: enhanced spatial resolution can deliver greater thematic accuracy	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The IKONOS 2 satellite was launched in late 1999 and carries the first commercial multispectral instrument to achieve 4 in spatial resolution. The cost and accuracy of using IKONOS imagery to map shallow-water marine environments is evaluated and compared directly to that using a suite of satellite and airborne instruments including Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High-Resolution Visible (HRV) multispectral and panchromatic, and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Evaluations were conducted in the Turks and Caicos Islands which are ideally suited to aquatic remote sensing because of the large areas of clear, shallow water containing a range of different habitats. Over 600 field sites were surveyed and used to define habitat categories, supervise image classification, and make an independent assessment of thematic map accuracy. For the high-resolution IKONOS imagery, pixel sizes were small enough to allow within-habitat textural information to be added to the classification. Making full use of this textural information in supervised classifications significantly improved (P<.01) thematic map accuracy for fine-level habitat discrimination (13 classes). Although significantly (P<.001) and almost 20% more accurate than Landsat TM, like other satellite-borne sensors, IKONOS data were unable adequately to discriminate 13 categories of coral, algal, and seagrass habitats (overall accuracy 50%). Comparison with CASI in a restricted area where only nine of these habitats were represented indicated that CASI (81% user accuracy) was significantly (P<.01) more accurate than IKONOS (64% user accuracy). Comparisons of IKONOS, Landsat TM, and CASI along a transect in the maximally penetrating blue part of the spectrum suggest that the poor descriptive resolution of satellite sensors is partly due to loss of radiance contrast, presumably as a result of atmospheric Rayleigh scattering. Problems of scattering, coupled with the relatively poor spectral resolution of satellite sensors such as IKONOS, currently constrain their use for fine-level marine habitat mapping. IKONOS data enabled significantly more accurate mapping at a geomorphological scale (e.g., coral vs. seagrass) than other satellite sensors except Landsat TM. While reasonably high accuracies (75%) were obtained for such coarse-level habitat mapping, Landsat TM was more cost-effective than IKONOS, even for small (50 km(2)) areas. IKONOS may only be a cost-effective option if (i) independent field data are available to identify habitat patches, (ii) the area to be mapped is fairly small (<500 km(2)), and (iii) small-scale (<10 in) habitat dynamics are to be monitored. IKONOS data are unlikely to identify deterioration in coral reefs directly because changes in community structure cannot be resolved spectrally from the satellite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

In the Pampa del Tamarugal, 50 km from the sea, conditions exist for the formation of radiation fog. Advective fog has been studied on the coast and orographic fog was observed at a few coastal sites near mountain ranges with elevations above 1000 in. Fog water collected by two standard fog collectors (SFC) for 3 1/2 years showed an average flux of 8.5 l m(-2) day(-1) on the coast and 1.1 l m(-2) day(-1) inland 12 km from the coastline. On only a few days in 10 months was water collected at the inland site of Pampa del Tamaragal. GOES satellite images are shown to illustrate the pattern of formation of the stratocumuli cloud over the sea, its approach to the coastline, the entrance of fog by corridors through the coastal range and the presence of radiation fog inland. The results are important for the understanding of fog formation and dissipation along the coastal mountain range and for the recognition of potential sites for the installation of fog water collectors, which can be used as a water source in the Atacama Desert. The results also provide vital information for use in the preservation of the unique ecosystems of the most and desert of the world.

The system combines data on the spatial and temporal patterns of cephalopod population dynamics focusing on geo-distribution of abundance, environmental variation, fisheries, spawning areas and migration habits. The system is developed as a customisation of a workstation ARC/INFO environment and features a series of innovative GIS map-overlay and integration routines for analysis and modelling of surveyed, statistical, and remote-sensed data. Geo-referenced datasets include cephalopod catch and landings, coastline-bathymetry, bottom substrate types, and a set of environmental variables provided by satellite sensors (AVHRR/sea surface temperature and SeaWiFS/chlorophyll-a concentration) and climatologic datasets (sea surface salinity). The innovative aspect of this marine system is the integration of species life history data to GIS analysis. Species preferences on certain spawning conditions, migration habits, and depth ranges are used as constraints in GIS analysis and integration. The application of GIS and Remote Sensing technologies has proved useful for the mapping of seasonal spatial components of cephalopod population dynamics. Results from this application may be used for information-based species management proposals, which is the goal of further development of this marine information system.

Field-measured sediment chlorophyll concentrations. 2 ranging from 23-1.153 mg chl a m(2), were classified into low, medium, and high concentration classes (1-170, 171-290, and > 291 mg chl a m(-2)) using a K-means clustering algorithm. The mapping process assumed that areas in the Thematic Mapper image exhibiting similar reflectance levels in red and blue bands would correspond to areas of similar chlorophyll a levels. Regions of homogenous reflectance values corresponding to low, medium, and high chlorophyll levels were identified over the reef sediment zone by applying a standard image classification algorithm to the Thematic Mapper image. The resulting distribution map revealed large-scale ( > 1 km 2) patterns in chlorophyll a levels throughout the sediment zone of Heron Reef. Reef-wide estimates of chlorophyll a distribution indicate that benthic Microalgae may constitute up to 20% of the total benthic chlorophyll a at Heron Reef. and thus contribute significantly to total primary productivity on the reef.

Slant columns, which are directly fitted without low-pass filtering or spectral smoothing, are corrected for an artificial offset likely induced by spectral structure on the diffuser plate of the GOME instrument. The stratospheric column is determined from NO2 columns over the remote Pacific Ocean to minimize contamination from tropospheric NO2. The air mass factor (AMF) used to convert slant columns to vertical columns is calculated from the integral of the relative vertical NO2 distribution from a global 3-D model of tropospheric chemistry driven by assimilated meteorological data (Global Earth Observing System (GEOS)-CHEM), weighted by altitude-dependent scattering weights computed with a radiative transfer model (Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer), using local surface albedos determined from GOME observations at NO2 wavelengths. The AMF calculation accounts for cloud scattering using cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, and cloud optical thickness from a cloud retrieval algorithm (GOME Cloud Retrieval Algorithm). Over continental regions with high surface emissions, clouds decrease the AMF by 20-30% relative to clear sky. GOME is almost twice as sensitive to tropospheric NO2 columns over ocean than over land. Comparison of the retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns for July 1996 with GEOS-CHEM values tests both the retrieval and the nitrogen oxide radical (NOx) emissions inventories used in GEOS-CHEM. Retrieved tropospheric NO2 columns over the United States, where NOx emissions are particularly well known, are within 18% of GEOS-CHEM columns and are strongly spatially correlated (r = 0.78, n = 288, p < 0.005). Retrieved columns show more NO2 than GEOS-CHEM columns over the Transvaal region of South Africa and industrial regions of the northeast United States and Europe. They are lower over Houston, India, eastern Asia, and the biomass burning region of central Africa, possibly because of biases from absorbing aerosols.

J	Pradelle, F; Cautenet, G; Jankowiak, I				Pradelle, F; Cautenet, G; Jankowiak, I			Radiative and microphysical interactions between marine stratocumulus clouds and Saharan dust - 1. Remote sensing observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] This work emphasizes the radiative impact of Saharan dust particles in the presence of clouds, over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. A first analysis based upon recent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts data confirms the classical observations; that is, in summer, the dust plume lies over the trade wind inversion, that is to say, over the main cloud layer. In winter, however, dust particles generally are transported in the trade wind layer, namely, where the major part of clouds is developing. In a second part, we present a statistical analysis based upon a 6-year series of daily VIS and IR Meteosat data. Our study reveals, at any season, a decrease in the apparent cloud reflectivity derived from satellite measurements. Minimum values of this albedo are found in geographical areas where dust particles are most often observed and where they have their highest values in optical thickness. This albedo decrease can exceed 20% during spring months, when the dust outbreaks are the most frequent. A final discussion puts forward some physical processes that may explain the observations. In summer, dust presence may result in a change of the reflectance of the system, due to an increase of the absorption of the surface-cloud-dust plume system. On the other hand, during the winter season, the cloud albedo decrease may be in part explained by the drying of the atmosphere due to the dry air masses associated with the dust outbreaks coming from the Saharan desert. However, an interesting and complementary explanation is put forward for the winter case: Because of its lower altitude, the dust plume is likely to mix with cloud water. Consequently, in-cloud processes may lead to a change in droplet spectrum size, which in turn, could affect the cloud reflectivity and therefore the reflectance measured at the top of the atmosphere. Therefore, whatever the physical processes involved, the dust outbreaks seem always to lead to a decrease in the cloud cover albedo over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. In part 2 of this study, the observations will be completed by numerical modeling dealing with radiation, microphysics, and mesoscale transport, in order to better explain and understand this radiative effect.																	0747-7309					SEP-OCT	2002	107	D19							4412	10.1029/2000JD000155								WOS:000180428300080

Salinity provides a unique tracer that gives clues to the origin of river-borne contaminants and allows the influences of storm-induced resuspension and river discharge on turbidity to be clearly distinguished. We describe a field investigation of the evolution and dynamics of the Herbert River plume in the central GBR. Its primary goals were to use an airborne salinity mapper and in situ instruments to study the three-dimensional structure and evolution of the plume and to lay a foundation for numerical modeling studies of its dynamics. The aircraft surveys provided a rapid assessment of the plumes spatial extent, while the in situ data revealed details of its subsurface structure. The Herbert River plume was produced by heavy rainfall associated with tropical storms during the La Nina-dominated 1999/2000 monsoon season. In the near field, the surface expression of the plume boundaries was indicated by sharp color and salinity fronts that were clearly visible from the air and sea surface. In the far field and middle Lagoon, the plume was more dispersed and ultimately merged with the larger-scale salinity gradients and with the remnant plume of the more distant, and larger, Burdekin River. The plume location and structure evolved in response to changing river flows, tidal and subtidal circulation, and wind. Using Garvine's Kelvin number-based scheme, the plume was classified as intermediate in dynamical character and thus is subject to a variety of forcings. The plume evolved in response to changes in the relative intensity of tidal currents and low-frequency circulation due to wind and western boundary current forcing. It also displayed a characteristic "hook-shaped'' structure, which has been identified previously in numerical plume model studies. This structure appeared in the presence of accelerating along-shelf current flow and horizontal shear and it indicates that the plume circulation had a strongly three-dimensional character. The approach demonstrates the efficacy of combining airborne and in situ methods to observe rapidly evolving coastal salinity structure and dynamics and sets the stage for future satellite-borne studies of larger-scale features showing contrasting salinity distributions.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP-NOV	2002	107	C12							8016	10.1029/2001JC001024								WOS:000180574100016						
J	Rankey, EC				Rankey, EC			Spatial patterns of sediment accumulation on a Holocene carbonate tidal flat, northwest Andros Island, Bahamas	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												To characterize spatial patterns of sedimentation and analyze the morphology of part of the modern tidal flats of northwest Andros Island in the Bahamas, this study integrated remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and carbonate sedimentology. The fundamental data are a Landsat TM image that has been classified to create a thematic map of eight subfacies, interpreted to represent a distinct tidal-flat subenvironment such as adjacent marine, exposed levee-beach ridge, pond, and algal marsh. Spatial statistics of the thematic map characterize the patterns of sediment accumulation. Quantitative analysis highlights several interesting results concerning subfacies character and distribution: (1) of the eight mapped subfacies, low algal marsh is most widespread, representing 27.5% of the total area, whereas exposed levee-beach ridge is the least widespread, accounting for 10% of the area; (2) the patches of different subfacies have different shape complexities, with low algal marsh, high algal marsh, and mangrove ponds being the least complex and exposed levee-beach ridge being the most complex; (3) Markov chain analysis suggests that lateral transitions between different subfacies are highly ordered; and (4) frequency distribution of subfacies patch area and lacunarity (gap size distribution) data exhibit power law relationships over several orders of magnitude, consistent with fractal characteristics. The fractal nature of patch size and gaps between facies illustrate that on this tidal flat neither the size nor the spatial distribution of subfacies has a characteristic scale. This statistical behavior is consistent with the presence of self-organization, or emergence of pattern in the absence of a template or external forcing. The statistical self-organization on the tidal flat is the cumulative expression of local processes, but it becomes apparent only through analysis of the whole system. These results are inconsistent with models suggesting that tidal flats include a migrating complex of randomly distributed, randomly sized subenvironments. Ancient successions that include random patterns may reflect the more pronounced influence of forces external to the sedimentary system, instead of an absence of those forces.

Despite their high abundance, marine viruses have generally been thought to play a minor role in ocean optics because of their small scattering cross-sections. Nevertheless, the role of specific viral infection on the optical properties of bacteria and phytoplankton has remained unknown (i.e., as viruses disrupt micron-sized host cells to produce submicron cell debris). Here, we used laboratory and mesocosm cultures of marine bacteria for virus infection experiments in which growth conditions and host-virus specificity were controlled. We report that the chief optical impact of viruses is associated with infection and lysis of their hosts. We quantitatively describe, for the first time, two optical changes associated with infection and lysis of marine bacteria by bacteriophage: (1) rapid, strong shifts in the magnitude and shape of the optical volume scattering function and (2) rapid production of colored dissolved organic material. Qualitatively, these changes result in nearly complete clearing of turbid host bacterial suspensions. Although some optical differences would be expected between infection of bacteria in laboratory cultures versus field populations (mainly because of differences in cell size), these results are applicable to the field, especially for dense host suspensions such as in blooms. Even in nonbloom situations, as long as the host bacteria contribute a significant amount of the total particle backscattering, we expect that virus-induced backscattering changes would be detectable by use of satellite or aircraft remote-sensing techniques.																	0024-3590					SEP	2002	47	5					1554	1561		10.4319/lo.2002.47.5.1554								WOS:000178081800029						
J	Bergstad, OA; Godo, OR				Bergstad, OA; Godo, OR			The pilot project "Patterns and processes of the ecosystems of the northern Mid-Atlantic": aims, strategy and status	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA												The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is the target of an emerging international ecosystem study under the Census of marine life programme. This pilot project shall gather new knowledge on biodiversity, distribution patterns, and ecological processes, and the overriding aim is "to describe and understand the patterns of distribution, abundance and trophic relationships of the organisms inhabiting the mid-oceanic North Atlantic, and identify and model ecological processes that cause variability in these patterns". The project will focus on pelagic, benthopelagic and epibenthic macrofauna, and analyse distribution and abundance patterns in relation to the abiotic and biotic environment, as well as trophic relationships and life history strategies. Fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and gelatinous plankton and nekton have the highest priority in the study. A major challenge of the project is to overcome observation difficulties at large depths and in rugged terrain. A central aim is thus to utilise modern remote sensing technology (acoustics, optics) using advanced instrument carriers (e.g. towed vehicles, ROVs, AUVs, etc.). The project will be carried out as a multi-ship operation in 2003-2005, and the ongoing planning is a collaborative effort involving many nations around the North Atlantic. The project will work on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and in adjacent waters from the Azores to Iceland, both by surveying large areas by acoustics and mid-water trawling, and by focusing on three selected sub-areas for intensive sampling and observation by traditional and novel methods and technology. Overlapping with the field seasons, the period 2004-2008 will be an analytical phase, also including submission of data to OBIS.

Sequential data of IRS-P4 OCM has been analysed over parts of both east and west coast of India and a methodology to retrieve sea surface current velocities, has been applied. The method is based on matching suspended sediment dispersion patterns, in sequential two time lapsed images. The pattern matching is performed on a pair of atmospherically corrected and geo-referenced sequential images by Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) technique. The MCC technique involves computing matrices of cross-correlation coefficients and identifying correlation peaks. The movement of the pattern can be calculated knowing the displacement of windows required to match patterns in successive images. The technique provides actual flow during a specified period by, integrating both tidal and wind influences. The current velocities retrieved were compared with synchronous data collected along the east coast during the GSI cruise ST-133 of R.V. Samudra Kaustubh in January 2000. The current data were measured using the ocean current meter supplied by the Environmental Measurement and CONtrol (EMCON), Kochi available with the Geological Survey of India, Marine Wing. This current meter can measure direction and magnitude with an accuracy of +/-5degrees and 2% respectively. The measurement accuracies with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.99, for both magnitude (cm.s(-1)) and direction (deg.) were achieved.

J	Karl, DM				Karl, DM			Nutrient dynamics in the deep blue sea	TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY												For more than a century, oceanographers have studied the interactions between the photosynthetic production of organic matter and nutrient dynamics in the sea. This research has been field-oriented and transdisciplinary, occurring at the intersections of research in microbiology, physics, analytical chemistry, cell physiology and ecology. The global database derived from this collective effort established a sound scientific understanding of nutrient dynamics and the vital role of microorganisms, both autotrophic and heterotrophic, in the coupled organic-matter production and decomposition cycles in the sea. However, novel approaches used over the past two decades, including new designs for field experiments, repeat field observations and remote-sensing capabilities, together with updated methods of sample analysis, have led to a revolution in our thinking about the mechanisms and controls of nutrient dynamics in the deep blue sea. Contemporary paradigms bear only partial resemblance to the dogma of the past, and are likely to evolve further as new data and new ideas are presented for open discussion and debate.																	0966-842X					SEP	2002	10	9					410	418		10.1016/S0966-842X(02)02430-7								WOS:000177880200010	12217506

The algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem of conditional probability and combines prior information on cloud microphysics with the remote sensing observations. Prior probability distribution functions for liquid water clouds were derived from the second, third, and sixth moments of droplet size distributions measured by in situ aircraft probes in shallow tropical cumuli. The algorithm also calculates error bars for each retrieved parameter. To assess the algorithm, we perform retrieval simulations using radar reflectivity and brightness temperatures simulated from tropical cumulus fields calculated by a large eddy simulation model with explicit microphysics. These retrieval simulations show that the Bayesian algorithm has similar magnitude errors to current retrieval methods for liquid water content and liquid water path retrievals but has much smaller errors for effective radius and optical depth. We also perform retrievals on three months of data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program's site on Nauru in the tropical west Pacific. For nonprecipitating liquid water clouds over Nauru during June-August 1999 we retrieve a mean optical depth of 9.2, mean liquid water content of 0.112 g/m(3), and mean effective radius of 7.8 mum. The Bayesian method is a flexible approach to cloud profile remote sensing and could be expanded to other sites or cloud types.

For the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), aerosols were presumed to be a mixture of a continental haze that had small particles, contained soot, and absorbed sunlight, and a marine haze that had large particles and absorbed practically no sunlight. Because of the difference in particle sizes, the two aerosols reflect sunlight differently at visible and near infrared wavelengths. Reflectances at visible and near infrared wavelengths were thus used to determine mixing fractions for the continental and marine aerosols and the optical depth of the aerosol mixture. The fractions and optical depths along with the optical properties of the aerosols were then used in radiative transfer calculations to estimate the diurnally averaged top of the atmosphere and surface aerosol direct radiative forcing for ocean regions. Comparison of retrieved optical depths at visible and near infrared wavelengths with surface measurements revealed that several different retrieval schemes employing a variety of aerosol types provided comparable levels of agreement, but none of the aerosol models or retrieval schemes produced ratios of the near infrared to visible optical depths that agreed with the ratios obtained with the surface measurements. In estimating the top of the atmosphere radiative forcing, errors in the retrieved optical depths were in some cases found to be partially compensated by the effect of the aerosol on the radiative flux. For example, different aerosol models led to retrieved optical depths that differed by as much as 60%, but the top of the atmosphere forcing obtained with the models differed by less than 35% for cloud-free conditions. When aerosols absorb sunlight, there is no comparable compensation for the surface forcing. Cloud conditions contribute sizable uncertainties to estimates of the aerosol direct radiative forcing. For INDOEX, estimates of the aerosol direct radiative forcing for average cloud conditions were obtained by (1) setting the forcing to zero for all 1 1 latitude-longitude boxes that contained any amount of upper-level cloud; (2) ascribing to regions with upper-level clouds the radiative forcing obtained for regions having only low-level clouds and, (3) setting the forcing to zero for all regions containing upper-level clouds and all portions of regions overcast by low-level clouds. Relative differences in the extreme values for the top of the atmosphere aerosol direct radiative forcing were less than 50%, but for the surface, the relative differences of the extreme values reached 70%.

Comparison of aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere with those in the Southern Hemisphere suggests that the additional pollution sources augment the 0.55-mum optical depth by, on average, 0.1 in the Northern Hemisphere. As a result of the aerosol, the region of the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere loses about 1.6 Wm(-2) in reflected sunlight and the ocean surface loses about 5 Wm(-2) during the months of the winter monsoon. Aerosol burdens and the aerosol direct radiative forcing are a relatively constant feature of the Northern Hemisphere, although the southeastern Arabian Sea experienced considerably larger aerosol burdens during the February-March 1999 INDOEX Intensive Field Phase (IFP) than in other years. Frequency distributions of the optical depth for 1degrees x 1degrees latitude-longitude regions are well represented by gamma distribution functions. The day-to-day and year-to-year variability of the optical depth for such regions is correlated with the long-term average optical depth. Interannual variability of the monthly mean optical depths for such regions is found to be as large as the day-to-day variability. Such large variability suggests that long-term records of in situ observations will be required in order to assess the performance of models that generate climatologies of aerosol concentrations.																	0747-7309					AUG 20	2002	107	D19							8010	10.1029/2000JD000183								WOS:000179756900002

Although both models have succeeded in helping to understand variation in ecological communities, most tests have been qualitative. Until recently, two roadblocks to more quantitative tests in marine environments have been a lack of (1) inexpensive, field-deployable technology for quantifying (e.g.) temperature, light, salinity, chlorophyll, and productivity, and (2) methods of quantifying the sub-organismal mechanisms linking environmental conditions to their ecological expression. The advent of inexpensive remote-sensing technology, adoption of molecular techniques such as quantification of heat-shock proteins and RNA:DNA ratios, and the formation of interdisciplinary alliances between ecologists and physiologists has begun to overcome these roadblocks. An integrated ecophysiological approach focuses on the determinants of: distributional limits among microhabitat patches and along (local-scale) environmental gradients (e.g., zonation); among-site (mesoscale) differences in community pattern; and geographic (macroscale) differences in ecosystem structure. These approaches promise new insights into the physiological mechanisms underlying variation in processes such as species interactions, physical disturbance, survival and growth. Here, we review two classes of models for community dynamics, and present examples of ecological studies of these models in consumer-prey systems. We illustrate the power of new molecular tools to characterize the sub-organismal responses of some of the same consumers and prey to thermal stress and food concentration. Ecological and physiological evidence tends to be consistent with model predictions, supporting our argument that we are poised to make major advances in the mechanistic understanding of community dynamics along key environmental gradients.

J	Chang, FL; Li, ZQ				Chang, FL; Li, ZQ			Estimating the vertical variation of cloud droplet effective radius using multispectral near-infrared satellite measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] This paper presents a satellite-based retrieval method for inferring the vertical variation of cloud droplet effective radius (DER) by utilizing multispectral near-infrared (NIR) measurements at 1.25, 1.65, 2.15, and 3.75 mum, available from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite observations. The method is based on the principle that these multispectral NIR measurements convey DER information from different heights within a cloud, which is sufficient to allow for the retrieval of a linear DER vertical profile. The method is applicable to low-level, nonprecipitating, stratiform clouds as their DER often increases monotonically from cloud bottom to cloud top. As such, an optimum linear DER profile can be derived by comparing multispectral NIR measurements to corresponding model values generated for a large set of linear DER profiles. The retrieval method was evaluated and compared to the conventional 3.7-mum retrieval method by applying both methods to some marine stratocumulus clouds with in situ observations of microphysical profiles. Capable of capturing the DER variation trend, the retrieved linear DER profiles showed large improvement over the conventional 3.75-mum m retrievals. Mean differences between the linear DER retrievals and observed profiles were generally small for both cloud top and bottom (<1.0 &mu;m m), whereas the conventional retrievals are prone to systematic overestimation near cloud bottom. The sensitivities of the linear DER retrieval to various parameters, as well as the error analyses, were also investigated extensively.

The mechanisms by which platform-derived neritic carbonates are transported to the pelagic water column and deep benthos are significant to the geological history of shallow carbonate platforms and the role of neritic carbonates in the marine carbon cycle. Aerial photography and satellite remote sensing observations of the Bahamas Banks and Bermuda indicate that major sediment transport events are caused by strong surface winds associated with storm systems. While this mechanism is not unexpected, these observations provide an initial assessment of the potential ability of remote sensing to detect these events and quantify the offshore mass transport of neritic carbonate. Strategies for observational monitoring of selected platform environments are described.

J	Iwabuchi, H; Hayasaka, T				Iwabuchi, H; Hayasaka, T			Effects of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity on the optical thickness retrieved from moderate-resolution satellite data	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Cloud remote sensing techniques are conventionally based on the independent pixel approximation (IPA). Here, three-dimensional (3D) radiative effects on IPA-based retrieved optical thickness from a visible-wavelength moderate-resolution (about 1 km) sensor are investigated. A Monte Carlo 3D radiative transfer model and a lognormal spectral cloud model are used to simulate monochromatic radiance reflected from overcast boundary layer cloud. A characterization of statistical properties of the optical thickness by the mean (M) and variance (S-2) of the logarithm of the optical thickness is proposed, where S represents a degree of cloud inhomogeneity. Biases in retrieved values of the two parameters with the IPA are defined as DeltaM and DeltaS(2) and attributed to neglect of net horizontal radiative transport in the IPA. Sensitivities of DeltaM and DeltaS(2) are tested with respect to geometrical roughness, M, S, mean geometrical thickness, spectral exponent of optical thickness fluctuation, ground surface reflectance, and bidirectional angles. The 3D radiative effects are sensitive to the geometrical roughness of cloud top rather than internal inhomogeneity of the extinction coefficient. The bias DeltaM is negative in forward scattering viewing geometry due to cloud-side shadowing, while positive in backscattering viewing geometry due to side illumination. It is found that DeltaM is proportional to S-2 and large for a dense cloud. On the other hand, DeltaS(2) largely depends on the solar zenith angle; smoothing is exhibited for high solar elevation and roughening for low solar elevation. The smoothing and roughening phenomena are found to be almost independent of the inhomogeneity parameter. An optically thick cloud exhibits more roughening, while for a geometrically thick cloud both smoothing and roughening are enhanced. It is suggested that for the bias removal some empirical assumptions are required in geometrical and microphysical properties of cloud, which should be studied with in situ observation data.																	0022-4928					JUL	2002	59	14					2227	2242		10.1175/1520-0469(2002)059<2227:EOCHIO>2.0.CO;2								WOS:000176312500004

This task is accomplished using optimal interpolation (OI) to blend satellite wind data from European remote sensing (ERS-2) satellite scatterometers, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scatterometers (NSCAT), and TOPEX/Poseidon and ERS-2 altimeters with numerical weather prediction (NWP) model wind estimates. The NWP model wind fields are produced using the MC2 atmospheric model (Canadian mesoseale compressible community atmospheric model). The grid for these fields is 0.25degrees. OI correlation functions and variances are derived from remotely sensed data. A second objective of the study is to provide a methodology for validation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) derived vector winds from RADARSAT-1 images collected during the 1997 Labrador Sea Deep Convection Experiment (LSDCE). These winds are derived from the observed radar cross section and a scatterometer wind retrieval model. The validation of the SAR-derived winds is based on the OI winds and in situ ship-based winds.																	0703-8992	1712-7971				JUN	2002	28	3					450	465		10.5589/m02-045								WOS:000176839900013

The technique is based on vertically pointing measurements from high-sensitivity millimeter-wavelength radar and produces height-resolved estimates of cloud particle effective radius. Although most meteorological radars lack the sensitivity to detect small cloud droplets, millimeter-wavelength cloud radars provide opportunities for remotely monitoring the properties of nonprecipitating clouds. These high-sensitivity radars reveal detailed reflectivity structure of most clouds that are within several kilometers range. In order to turn reflectivity into usable microphysical quantities, relationships between the measured quantities and the desired quantities must be developed. This can be done through theoretical analysis, modeling, or empirical measurements. Then the uncertainty of each procedure must be determined in order to know which ones to use. In this study, two related techniques are examined for the retrieval of the effective radius. One method uses both radar reflectivity and integrated liquid water through the clouds obtained from a microwave radiometer; the second uses the radar reflectivity and an assumption that continental stratus clouds have a concentration of 200 drops per cubic centimeter and marine stratus 100 cm(-3). Using in situ measurements of marine and continental stratus, the error analysis herein shows that the error in these techniques would be about 15%. In comparing the techniques with in situ aircraft measurements of effective radius, it is found that the radar radiometer retrieval was not quite as good as the technique using radar reflectivity alone. The radar reflectivity alone gave a 13% standard deviation with the in situ comparison, while the radar-radiometer retrieval gave a 19% standard deviation.

Evidence for a bloom of Emiliania huxleyi (Prymnesiophyceae) in spring 1998	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A coccolithophorid bloom, dominated by Emiliania huxleyi, was detected by sea viewing wide field of view sensor (SeaWiFS) images on the French continental shelf break in April 1998. Concentrations of up to 3.2 x 10(6) coccospheres l(-1) and up to 8.6 x 10(7) coccoliths l(-1) were measured by Microscope countings of samples taken during the first days of the bloom. Moderate chlorophyll a concentrations (range: 0.8-1.1 mugl(-1)) characterised the Study area. Chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), confirmed the dominance of Pry-mnesiophytes in the bloom area. The bloom was not monospecific and diatoms, mainly belonging to the genus Rhizosolenia, as well as silicoflagellates were observed in the phytoplankton. Outside of the bloom area. "green algae" and cryptophytes dominated the phytoplankton. Diatoms were a dominant group of the Vilaine plume community and dinoflagellates were dominant in the Southern part of the study area. The development of the dissipative phase of coccolithophorid bloom and its persistence for at least 4 weeks is explained by the conjunction of water mass preconditioning by Liver inputs on the continental shelf, increasing PAR during spring, and internal wave formation at the shelf break during spring tides. Partial dissolving of coccoliths and lack of horizontal displacement of the bloom, during the 4 weeks, are interpreted in terms of rapid settling of coccoliths due to packaging by grazers as well as ongoing production maintained by nutrient injection via the action of internal waves.

Seeps area dynamic component of the carbon cycle and can be important indicators for economically significant hydrocarbon deposits. The northern Gulf of Mexico contains hundreds of active seeps that can be studied experimentally with the use of submarines and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Hydrocarbon flux through surface sediments profoundly alters benthic ecology and seafloorgeology at seeps. In water depths of 500-2000 m, rapid gas flux results in shallow, metastable deposits of gas hydrate, which reduce sediment porosity and affect seepage rates. This paper details the processes that occur during the final, brief transition - as oil and gas escape from the seafloor, rise through the water and dissolve, are consumed by microbial processes, or disperse into the atmosphere. The geology of the upper sediment column determines whether discharge is rapid and episodic, as occurs in mud volcanoes, or more gradual and steady, as occurs where the seep orifice is plugged with gas hydrate. in both cases, seep oil and gas appear to rise through the water in close proximity instead of separating. Chemical alteration of the oil is relatively minor during transit through the water column, but once at the sea surface its more volatile components rapidly evaporate. Gas bubbles rapidly dissolve as they rise, although observations suggest that oil coatings on the bubbles inhibit dissolution. At the sea surface, the floating oil forms slicks, detectable by remote sensing, whose origins are laterally within similar to1000 m of the seafloor vent. This contradicts the much larger distance predicted if oil drops rise through a 500 m water column at an expected rate of similar to0.01 m s(-1) while subjected to lateral currents of similar to0.2 m s(-1) or greater. It indicates that oil rises with the gas bubbles at speeds of similar to0.15 m s(-1) all the way to the surface.

The 2-D radar cross section (RCS), or "echo width," is computed as a function of time as the sea surface evolves linearly using the spectrally accelerated generalized forward-backward method. It is shown that the RCS varies with time on the order of seconds, which is much longer than the typical pulse width or pulse repetition rate of search radars. It is also observed that for low-grazing angles of incidence the primary sea surface influence on the RCS comes from the long waves in the ocean spectrum.

Both the mean and variable components of model alongshore wind stress increase by factors of 3-4 from north to south along the Oregon coast. There is evidence of orographic intensification near Cape Blanco, which is supported by previous aircraft and ship observations during August 1995. The systematic southward increase of southward stress will drive enhanced ocean upwelling along the southern Oregon coast and suggests the new hypothesis that systematic variations in local wind stress may contribute to the observed offshore displacement of the coastal upwelling jet in this region. It is inferred from an analysis of the model and surface data that ocean upwelling modifies coastal surface air temperatures by 1-5degreesC over timescales of 12-24 hours.					Kosro, P.

The sediment is characterized by varying scales of biologically controlled random roughness and heterogeneity as well as surficial stratification on centimeter scales. The interface roughness was determined from stereo photogrammetric digitization and parameterized by a power spectrum, whereas sediment volume heterogeneity was determined from core measurements and parameterized by first-order autoregressive models for sound speed and density fluctuations. In contrast to previous investigations, fine-scale sediment bulk density fluctuations were examined in sediment cores with computerized tomography in addition to the standard gravimetric technique. Furthermore, the strongly delineated sediment density and sound velocity transition layer was parameterized by piecewise linear fits. These characterizations of the random and deterministic properties were used in acoustic scattering models in an effort to determine the feasibility of remotely measuring fine-scale features of the seafloor. The result was negative: older, low-resolution models gave moderately good fits to the acoustic data, but the fit did not improve for newer, higher-resolution models. It is suggested that scattering due to shell fragments must be included to account for all features observed in the scattering data at this site.

Fisheries that overlap nationally controlled and high seas waters cause particular problems, as few management data are available for the high seas. The Argentinean short-finned squid, Illex argentinus, exemplifies such a "straddling stock". Here we demonstrate that light emitted by fishing vessels to attract squid can be detected via remote-sensing. Unlike conventional fisheries data, which are restricted by political boundaries, satellite imagery can provide a synoptic view of fishing activity in both regulated and unregulated areas. By using known levels of fishing effort in Falkland Islands waters to calibrate the images, we are able to estimate effort levels on the high seas, providing a more comprehensive analysis of the overall impact of fishing on the stock. This innovative tool for quantifying fishing activity across management boundaries has wide-ranging applications to squid fisheries worldwide.

J	Holden, H				Holden, H			Characterisation of optical water quality in Bunaken National Marine Park, North Sulawesi, Indonesia	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY												Effective passive optical remote sensing of submerged coral reef ecosystems requires not only appropriate atmospheric correction, but also water column correction. Algorithms accounting for atmospheric effects are fairly well established and readily available, but water column correction algorithms are still under development. Many approaches to water column correction assume horizontal homogeneity and strict adherence to Beer's Law of logarithmic vertical attenuation, which may not be the case in many coral reef ecosystems. Water column optical properties were measured using a multispectral dropsonde radiometer in Bunaken National Marine Park, North Sulawesi, Indonesia, to examine the vertical and horizontal variability of light in a typical coral reef environment. This largely descriptive case study demonstrates the complexity of the interaction of light in shallow coastal environments with often highly reflective substrata and serves to warn against assumptions of water optical property homogeneity. Downwelling attenuation coefficients are provided for use in water column correction of future remote sensing missions.																	0129-7619					MAR	2002	23	1					23	36		10.1111/1467-9493.00116								WOS:000175215700002						
J	Rochelle-Newall, EJ; Fisher, TR				Rochelle-Newall, EJ; Fisher, TR			Chromophoric dissolved organic matter and dissolved organic carbon in Chesapeake Bay	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is the light absorbing fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The optical properties of CDOM potentially permit remote sensing of DOC and CDOM, and correction for CDOM absorption is essential for remote sensing of chlorophyll a (chl a) in coastal and estuarine waters. To provide data for this purpose, we report the distributions of CDOM, DOC, and chl a from seven cruises in Chesapeake Bay in 1994-1997. We observed non-conservative distributions of chl a and DOC in half of the cruises, indicating net accumulations within the estuary; however, there were no net accumulations or losses of CDOM, measured as absorption at 355 nm or as fluorescence. Freshwater end member CDOM absorption varied from 2.2 to 4.1 m(-1). Coastal end member CDOM absorption was considerably lower, ranging over 0.4-1.1 m(-1). The fluorescence/absorption ratio was similar to those reported elsewhere for estuarine and coastal waters; however, in the lower salinity/high CDOM region of the Bay, the relationship was not constant, suggestive of the mixing of two or more CDOM sources. Chl a was not correlated with the absorption for most of the cruises nor for the data set as a whole; however, CDOM and DOC were significantly correlated, with two groups evident in the data. The first group had high CDOM concentrations per unit DOC and corresponded to the conservative DOC values observed in the transects. The second group had lower CDOM concentrations per unit DOC and corresponded to the non-conservative DOC values associated with net DOC accumulation near the chl a maximum on the salinity gradient. This indicates the production of nonchromophoric DOC in the region of the chl a maximum of Chesapeake Bay. In terms of remote sensing, these data show that (1) the retrieval of the absorption coefficient of CDOM from fluorescence measurements in the Bay must consider the variability of the fluorescence/absorption relationship, and (2) estimates of DOC acquired from CDOM absorption will underestimate DOC in regions with recent, net accumulations of DOC.

Five systems can potentially be used for determination of location: VHF (Very High Frequency) telemetry, PTT (Platform Terminal Transmitters) telemetry, GLS (Global Location Service) geolocation methods, dead reckoning and GPS (Global Positioning System), each with its own advantages with respect to accuracy, potential number of fixes and size. Temperature and light were used to illustrate potential difficulties in recording environmental variables. Systems currently used on seabirds for measurement of temperature respond slowly to environmental changes; thus, they may not measure sea surface temperature adequately when contact periods with water bodies are too short, Light can be easily measured for light extinction studies, but sensor orientation plays a large role in determining recorded values, Both problems can be corrected. The foraging behaviour of seabirds was also examined in order to identify those features which would be useful for determination of marine environmental variables at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Area coverage by birds is highly dependent on breeding phase and tends to be concentrated in areas where prey acquisition is particularly enhanced. The identification of these sites may be of particular interest to marine biologists. 'Plungers' and 'divers' are potentially most useful for assessment of variables deeper within the water column, with some divers spending up to 90% of their time sub-surface. Few seabirds exploit the water column deeper than 20 m, although some divers regularly exceed 50 m (primarily penguins and auks), while 2 species dive in excess of 300 m. The wide-ranging behaviour of seabirds coupled, in many instances, with their substantial body size makes them potentially excellent carriers of sophisticated environmental measuring technology; however, the ethical question of how much the well-being of birds can, and should, be compromised by such an approach needs to be carefully considered.																	0171-8630	1616-1599					2002	228						241	261		10.3354/meps228241								WOS:000174655000021

Changes in concentration, sometimes exceeding the entire seasonal variation, often occurred within an hour and attempts to find the reasons for them are described. Vertical profiles of aerosol concentration in Aitken and accumulation mode particles obtained on helicopter flights revealed intense concentration gradients in the lowest 1000 m. Those below 100 m were common. Concentrations of accumulation mode particles were usually greater near the surface than at 100 m. Four representative case studies for which vertical aerosol profiles were obtained are presented. Observations of rapid large changes in near-surface concentration of aerosols in different size ranges are compared with the vertical profiles, meteorological information, and acoustic or optical remote sensing to infer processes causing the changes. Comparison of simultaneous variations in aerosols and precursor gas concentrations are used to define the vertical profiles of the gases. It was found that dimethyl sulfide and ammonia concentrations usually must have been strongly depleted near the surface relative to concentrations at about 100 m. Sulfur dioxide profiles appeared to be more complex. Turbulence or vertical air motions initiated by atmospheric wave motions trapped within the stable boundary layer appeared to be directly responsible for many of the sudden concentration changes, through interaction with concentration gradients close to the surface. The presence of low-level jets also had direct or indirect influences on mixing in the lowest few hundred meters. The extent to which aerosols measured near the surface can determine the microphysics of central Arctic marine boundary layer clouds is examined.																	2169-897X					DEC 16	2001	106	D23					32167	32185		10.1029/2000JD900753								WOS:000173479100040

J	Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A				Nayak, S; Bahuguna, A			Application of remote sensing data to monitor mangroves and other coastal vegetation of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES												Remote sensing data, because of its repetitive, synoptic and multi-spectral nature, has proved to be of an immense value in monitoring of coastal vegetation. Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) data have been extensively used to map mangroves and other coastal vegetation for the entire country's coastline. Large database on spatial extent of mangroves and their condition has been created on 1:250,000, 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 scale using IRS data (the database provides information for the first time on the mangrove areas of the entire Indian coast). Based on this study, it was observed that the Kori creek, Gujarat, has large area under mangroves. The repetitive nature of the data has helped in monitoring vital and critical areas, periodically. In one such study, on the Marine National Park, in the Gulf of Kachchh, mangrove areas were monitored for the last 25 years. The degradation of mangroves continued up to 1985 and the condition significantly improved due to the adoption of conservation measures. This has helped in planning various management actions to conserve this vital ecosystem. IRS data have been used in identifying dominant plant communities in many mangrove areas such as Bhitarkanika, Coringa, Mandovi estuary in Goa and the Gulf of Kachchh, etc, This is a unique approach for providing spatial information at plant community level and can be seen as a first step towards bio-diversity assessment. Along with the mangroves, seaweed, seagrass beds and dune vegetation have also been mapped with reasonable accuracy. With the better sensors planned for future, remote sensing-based information is going to be one of the major inputs in the preparation of management action plans.																	0379-5136					DEC	2001	30	4					195	213										WOS:000173106900001

The study was focused on simulating the real conditions of the EURHOGLI campaign, performed in summer in the Gulf of Lions (June-July 1983). Results of the coupled model showed the high variability of the Rhone river plume position and the associated phytoplankton biomass. The validation of the model was in good accordance with field measurements and CZCS and AVHRR remote sensing pictures available at the period considered. In addition, results showed that the phytoplankton biomass induced by freshwater nutrients was strongly controlled by the variability of the local wind conditions. The model, performed with representative forcing conditions, allowed to better understand the representative phytoplankton features that prevails in summer in the Gulf of Lions, where both strong winds and freshwater runoffs interact.

The variability of the aerosol load over NIO is discussed based on three-dimentional numerical simulations made at a local scale by use of Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) and at a regional scale using the zoomed Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique global circulation model (LMD-Z version 3.3). Ground-based measurements of the columnar aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and of surface black carbon (BC) concentration were carried out at two different sites in India: Goa University on the NIO coast and Dharwar 150 kin inland. Local-scale investigations point out that the trend in BC concentration at the ground is not correlated with AOT. Lidar profiles obtained both from the surface at Goa and in the NIO from the Mystere-20 research aircraft indicate that a significant contribution to the total AOT (more than 50%) is due to a turbid monsoon layer located between I and 3 kin height. RAMS simulation shows that the advection of aerosols in the monsoon layer is due to the conjunction of land-sea breeze and topography. We present the regional-scale extent of the aerosol plume in terms of AOT derived from the visible channel of Meteosat-5. During March, most of the Bay of Bengal is overcast by a haze with a monthly average AOT of 0.61 +/-0.18, and a spatially well-defined aerosol plume is spreading from the Indian west coast to the Intertropical Convergence Zone with an average AOT of 0.49 +/-0.08. Those values axe bigger than in February with AOT at 0.35 +/-0.18 and 0.37 +/-0.09 for the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, respectively. One of the principal findings of this paper is that a significant contribution to the aerosol load over the NIO is due to the advection of continental aerosols from India in a well-identified monsoon layer above the marine boundary layer. Moreover, it is suggested that the increase in biomass burning plays a significant role in the increasing trend in AOT during the winter dry monsoon season.

J	Toole, DA; Siegel, DA				Toole, DA; Siegel, DA			Modes and mechanisms of ocean color variability in the Santa Barbara Channel	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Characterizing the substances, processes, and mechanisms that regulate ocean color variability is crucial for assessing marine resources and impacts of land-ocean interactions with remote sensing data. Bimonthly optical and in situ water column observations from a 3-year field program within the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are used to assess sources of ocean color variability in a semiarid coastal region. Correlation analyses demonstrate that remote sensing reflectance variability is tightly coupled to biologically and terrestrially derived particles throughout the visible spectrum. An empirical orthogonal function analysis indicates that nearly two thirds of the observed variability in remote sensing reflectance is contained in a backscattering mode, whereas phytoplankton-driven absorption processes contribute only similar to 30% of the observed variance. Observations from the Santa Clara River outflow during a period of high discharge demonstrate that under extreme conditions, ocean color spectra are regulated almost entirely by backscattering processes. A mechanistic partitioning of ocean color variability confirms the dominance of backscattering processes and a strong coupling between the roles of backscattering and absorption at this site. A similar analysis of data from the Sargasso Sea demonstrates a lack of coupling between the role of absorption and backscattering. Application of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) operational chlorophyll algorithm highlights the degraded predictive power of band ratio algorithms in coastal settings such as the Santa Barbara Channel. For this case II environment, backscattering is the dominant driver of ocean color variability and must be correctly incorporated into future ocean color modeling efforts.

Only via such integrated systems will realistic representation of the initial state be derived and properly utilized to provide reliable and accurate forecasts of, for instance, location of eddies, upwelling patterns, and high-concentration of toxic algae. The role of SAR in such systems is addressed and characterized in terms of current status and further need for research and development.

The European programme MARSAIS is part of this effort. One important component of such actions aims to better predict the sea surface wind and wave dynamics in these vulnerable regions where most economic marine activity is taking place. Indeed, ocean surface wind and wave observations serves both oceanographic and meteorological communities and have direct applications for driving ocean circulation models, numerical predictions and short term forecasts, but also for advancing in the physical understanding of the complex interactions that take place at the ocean-atmosphere interface. As now well recognised, satellite data and particularly the weather independent radar remote sensing data present potential advantages and applications to achieve these requirements. Nowadays, sea surface remote sensing techniques are rapidly developing throughout the world and need some kind of assessment. Altimetry and scatterometry are well proven techniques, which result in recognised operational applications. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Missions have not enjoyed such successes. However numerous space borne radar images of the ocean surface have revealed a wealth of information on different dynamical processes and SAR images of the ocean surface very, often reveal a remarkable range of signatures on the uppermost layers of the sea. These data have resulted in numerous quantitative scientific findings and theoretical advances in upper-layer and lower atmosphere dynamics. In this review, the main different techniques developed to retrieve surface wave and wind information are recalled. Illustrations are given for ENVISAT wave mode products.

Transatlantic shipping incurs significant southerly detours during the ice season and offshore oil production facilities and procedures must be specially designed for operation in iceberg-frequented waters, including additional ships dedicated to iceberg "management". As a result, considerable effort has been expended in the development of various remote sensing tools for reliable, all-weather detection of icebergs. The RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite provides the opportunity to substantially increase iceberg detection frequency and accuracy. This paper presents some of the results of the validation study for the iceberg detection capabilities of RADARSAT-1 that was conducted during 2000 on the East Coast of Canada. Wide 2, Wide 3 and ScanSAR Narrow B scenes were acquired at various near-shore and offshore locations in Newfoundland during the months of May and June. Ground-truth data on icebergs, mainly using scaled aerial photography, were collected coincident with RADARSAT-1 acquisitions. The ground-truth iceberg positions were correlated to the locations of targets in the RADARSAT-1 imagery, and the characteristics of the iceberg signatures within the SAR images were documented. Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) techniques were used in the empirical determination of the probability of iceberg detection as a junction of iceberg size, wind speed and radar incidence angle. For SAR incidence angles greater than around 35 degrees, icebergs with sizes on the order of the resolution of the particular SAR mode can generally be detected. Larger icebergs will be detected more consistently, and even during rough sea states.																	0703-8992					OCT	2001	27	5					476	486		10.1080/07038992.2001.10854888								WOS:000172811700008

It is suggested that gypsum primarily precipitates at isolated points of evaporitic concentration, such as inland playas, and that deflation of evaporitic-rich gypsum dust from these playas contributes to the formation of pedogenic gypsum duricrusts on the coastal gravel plains of the Namib Desert surrounding these playas. This study establishes the nature, extent and distribution of playas in the Central Namib Desert and provides evidence for playa gypsum deflation and gravel plain deposition. Remote sensing shows the distribution of playas, captures ongoing deflation and provides evidence of gypsum deflation. It is proposed that, following primary marine aerosol deposition, both inland playas and coastal sabkhas generate gypsum which through the process of playa deflation and gravel plain redeposition contributes to the extensive pedogenic crusts found in the Namib Desert region.

The science behind the long-range performance of HFSWR was presented in Part 1. The system described was installed on Canada's east coast, where it is being used to demonstrate continuous, all-weather surveillance of the EEZ to beyond 200 nm. The system consists of two land-based HFSWRs and an Operations Control Center (OCC). The two unmanned radars provide coverage of the Grand Banks region of Newfoundland, renowned for its offshore resources, particularly fish and oil. The system has been designed to assist authorities to more efficiently monitor such illegal activities as drug trafficking, smuggling, piracy, illicit fishing and illegal immigration. In addition, the system may be used for tracking icebergs, environmental protection, search and rescue, resource protection, sovereignty monitoring, and remote sensing of ocean surface currents and winds. Extensive performance testing of the system has been conducted using the two fully functional radars. It is shown that the HFSWR system complements existing surveillance assets to dramatically increase the effectiveness of air and surface reconnaissance missions by vectoring them directly to targets of interest.

J	Boers, R; Rotstayn, LD				Boers, R; Rotstayn, LD			Possible links between cloud optical depth and effective radius in remote sensing observations	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												The theoretical relationship between cloud optical depth and effective radius is examined. The relationship between cloud optical depth and effective radius is shown to depend on (a) the relative variability of droplet concentration, cloud depth, mixing and precipitation, and (b) the correlation between the two most important parameters, namely cloud depth and droplet concentration. It is possible to obtain positive, negative or zero correlation between optical depth and effective radius for different values of (a) and (b). Of all these parameters, mixing appears to be the least important. If clouds are not affected by precipitation, negative correlations between optical depth and effective radius (the expected signature of the first indirect aerosol effect) can be caused by a small spread in cloud depths relative to that in droplet concentration, or (more importantly) by a positive correlation between droplet concentration and cloud depth. Precipitation tends to reduce the correlation between optical depth and effective radius, because one of the main effects of precipitation is to increase the spread in droplet effective radius. If the effect of increases in aerosols is a reduction in precipitation, our results indicate that the correlation coefficient between optical depth and effective radius should increase, an effect that should be most clearly visible over the ocean. These findings illustrate the complexity of the physical processes that underpin the linkage of optical depth and effective radius.

Over the ocean, scatterometer surface winds are deduced from multiple measurements of reflected radar power made from several directions. In the nominal situation, the scattering mechanism is Bragg scattering from centimeter-scale waves, which are in equilibrium with the local wind. These data are especially valuable where observations are otherwise sparse-mostly in the Southern Hemisphere extratropics and Tropics, but also on occasion in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The history of scatterometer winds research and its application to weather analysis and forecasting is reviewed here. Two types of data impact studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of satellite data, including satellite scatterometer data, for NWP. These are simulation experiments (or observing system simulation experiments or OSSEs) designed primarily to assess the potential impact of planned satellite observing systems, and real data impact experiments (or observing system experiments or OSEs) to evaluate the actual impact of available space-based data. Both types of experiments have been applied to the series of satellite scatterometers carried on the Seasat, European Remote Sensing-1 and -2, and the Advanced Earth Observing System-1 satellites, and the NASA Quick Scatterometer. Several trends are evident: The amount of scatterometer data has been increasing. The ability of data assimilation systems and marine forecasters to use the data has improved substantially. The ability of simulation experiments to predict the utility of new sensors has also improved significantly.

J	Holland, TK				Holland, TK			Application of the linear dispersion relation with respect to depth inversion and remotely sensed imagery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing methods have been developed to estimate bathymetry through the use of a theoretical relationship between wave speed and water depth known as the linear, finite depth, dispersion equation for surface gravity waves. We describe a validation effort encompassing several hundred observations of wavenumber magnitude for sea-swell frequencies obtained over a wide variety of conditions to investigate possible error sources resulting from the practical application of this relationship. These wavenumber estimates were computed from pressure gauge signals using signal processing algorithms that can be equivalently applied to measurements of wave phase as imaged through remote sensors. The major goal was to determine the accuracy of the dispersion relation while attempting to minimize errors associated with sensor positioning, tidal variations, and Doppler shifts due to mean currents. For water depths outside the surf zone, the linear dispersion relation is highly accurate, with average depth estimation errors on the order of 3-9% of the observed depth. In shallower regions, nominally less than 4 in for this field site, where wave breaking is evident and nonlinear shoaling effects are more pronounced, normalized depth errors of over 50% were commonly observed with most predictions being deeper than observations. Strong correlation between these bias errors and measured wave heights emphasizes the importance of accounting for wave amplitude in the calculation of shallow water phase speeds for depth estimation. A simple depth correction is provided to allow for bathymetry estimation within the surf zone.				Holland, K. Todd/A-7673-2011	Holland, K.

J	Gillespie, TW				Gillespie, TW			Remote sensing of animals	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												The improved accuracy and precision of animal tracking via satellites has made a significant impact on quantifying large-scale biogeographic patterns for a variety of taxa with important implications for conservation and natural resource management. This paper reviews research undertaken from 1995 to 1999 to provide an overview of advances in the remote sensing of animal movements in both terrestrial and marine environments and to identify promising trends for biogeographic research in the twenty-first century. Remote sensing of animals by satellite provides a new method to test a number of biogeographic hypotheses related to migration and can identify a number of environmental correlates associated with the distributions of species. Tracking of smaller species and increases in sample size are sure to occur as transmitter size and cost continue to decrease in the next decade. Geographers can significantly contribute to the understanding of species dispersal and distributional patterns by combining real-time and archived global and regional datasets with existing data from past studies and future research projects. Only four studies used GIS data or remote sensed imagery in this review, while the remaining studies cited used simple digital line graphs of countries, topography, land and sea boundaries.																	0309-1333					SEP	2001	25	3					355	362		10.1177/030913330102500303								WOS:000170569400003

The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT, Chennai) has deployed this buoy at 13 degreesN, 87 degreesE, by fixing various meteorological instruments and sensors to acquire sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature (Ta), wind speed (Ws), wind direction (Wd) and ocean currents (Cs) using remote sensing technique through (NSAT-1D) satellite at an interval of 3 h. The results of the analysis of the above parameters have shown clearly a response (SST difference between before and after formation) of about 0.7 degreesC for the Gopalpur cyclone and 0.9 degreesC for the Paradip cyclone. Ta has shown rapid variations following the rapid movement of cloud decks across the buoy during the cyclone period. The observed changes in the wind speed and direction are in concurrence with analysed mean sea level pressure oscillations. Finally, this study recommends more buoy-based marine meteorological observations over this region and the neighbouring areas, where the tropical cyclones generally occur and subsequently hit the Coromandal coast.

Due to problems of accessibility, adequate spatial coverage cannot be achieved using field surveys alone. However, maps of geochemical composition produced from remotely sensed data can be calibrated against limited field data and the results extrapolated over large, inaccessible areas. This technique is applied to part of the Rub' Al Khali in the northern United Arab Emirates. Trend surface analysis of the results suggests that the sand sea at this location can be modelled as an east-west mixing zone of two spectral components: terrestrial reddened quartz sands and marine carbonate sands. Optical dating of these sediments suggests that dune emplacement occurred rapidly around 10 ka BP, when sea level was rising rapidly. The spatial distribution of mineralogical components suggests that this phase of dune emplacement resulted from coastal dune sands being driven inland during marine transgression, thereby becoming mixed with rubified terrestrial sands.

To reduce the cost of these investigations, we propose to evaluate the vineyard mortality by estimating, for each field, the rate of missing vinestocks from high resolution aerial photographs. In order to identify possible causes of vineyard mortality, this information is then combined with maps of candidate factors, e.g. soil, age of vineyard, vine-variety, weeding technique, training system, by using a Geographical Information System. The proposed approach is tested over four sampling areas of 356 ha and 196 vineyard fields which are representative of the lower Peyne valley (Herault -South of France). The main results are as follows -The rates of vineyard mortality are satisfactorily predicted from aerial photographs (RMSE= 6.5 p. cent), -The average rate of vineyard mortality is high (e.g. 35 p. cent of the fields have more than 12 p. cent of death vinestocks), -The rates of vineyard mortality are extremely variable both from a sampling area to another and from a field to another within a given sampling area. -They seem to be more in relation with soil and agricultural practices than with age or vine-variety. Particularly, colluviosols with redoxic horizon developped on colluvion of miocene marine sediments reveal rates of vineyard mortality which are significantly higher than other soil types.

J	Mumby, PJ				Mumby, PJ			Beta and habitat diversity in marine systems: a new approach to measurement, scaling and interpretation	OECOLOGIA												Habitat diversity is a widely used criterion for locating conservation activities such as protected areas. Most habitat diversity indices are measures of alpha diversity at the scale of habitats and are therefore insensitive to the underlying biological differences between habitats. To incorporate such inter-habitat differences, a new method is presented which calculates a measure of beta (beta) diversity from pixels within a window passed throughout a habitat map. To avoid confusion with beta diversity indices, the new measure is called beta -dissimilarity. beta -Dissimiliarity is calculated from the mean Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, D-m, of field data which comprise each habitat class. The variance of D-m distinguishes discrete beta -dissimilarity distributions from homogenous patterns. The method also attempts to remove some of the arbitrary aspects of habitat mapping, can be scaled to other levels of diversity or measures of community structure, is readily interpretable and permits hypothesis testing. Its applications to ecosystem science and coastal management are discussed and illustrated.

It has been suggested that these migration corridors may correspond with near-surface oceanographic features that can be detected by remote sensing. This idea is examined by superimposing the tracks of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) migrating from Ascension Island to Brazil, on sea surface temperature (SST) data derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images. The turtles did not follow specific isotherms during migration nor make turns en-route where specific thermal cues were encountered. These results suggest that for this population, SST plays a minimal role in influencing the exact route that individuals follow.

J	Leathers, RA; Downes, TV				Leathers, RA; Downes, TV			Self-shading correction for upwelling sea-surface radiance measurements made with buoyed instruments	OPTICS EXPRESS												Upwelling radiance measurements made with instruments designed to oat at the sea surface are shaded both by the instrument housing and by the buoy that holds the instrument. The amount of shading is wavelength dependent and is affected by the local marine and atmospheric conditions. Radiance measurements made with such instruments should be corrected for this self-shading error before being applied to remote sensing calibrations or remote sensing algorithm validation. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to compute the self-shading error of a commercially available buoyed radiometer so that measurements made with this instrument can be improved. This approach can be easily adapted to the dimensions of other instruments.(C) 2001 Optical Society of America.																	1094-4087					MAY 7	2001	8	10					561	570		10.1364/OE.8.000561								WOS:000168521400005	19417854

Weather influences the transport and dissemination of these microbial agents via rainfall and runoff and the survival and/or growth through such factors as temperature. Federal and state laws and regulatory programs protect much of the U.S. population from waterborne disease; however, if climate variability increases, current and future deficiencies in areas such as watershed protection, infrastructure, and storm drainage systems will probably increase the risk of contamination events. Knowledge about transport processes and the fate of microbial pollutants associated with rainfall and snowmelt is key to predicting risks from a change in weather variability. Although recent studies identified links between climate variability and occurrence of microbial agents in water, the relationships need further quantification in the context of other stresses. In the marine environment as well, there are few studies that adequately address the potential health effects of climate variability in combination with other stresses such as overfishing, introduced species, and rise in sea level. Advances in monitoring are necessary to enhance early-warning and prevention capabilities. Application of existing technologies, such as molecular fingerprinting to track contaminant sources or satellite remote sensing to detect coastal algal blooms, could be expanded. This assessment recommends incorporating a range of future scenarios of improvement plans for current deficiencies in the public health infrastructure to achieve more realistic risk assessments.																	0091-6765					MAY	2001	109			2			211	221		10.2307/3435011								WOS:000168824500006	11359688					
J	Klein, M; Zviely, D				Klein, M; Zviely, D			The environmental impact of marina development on adjacent beaches: a case study of the Herzliya marina, Israel	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												The objectives of this study were to identify coastal changes to the north and south of the Herzliya (Israel) marina using remote sensing techniques, and to compare them to the changes forecast by a physical model built by the Coastal and Marine Engineering Research Institute, at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel (CAMERI). The: initial physical model output predicted coastal erosion north of the marina. The proposed solution to this problem was the building of detached breakwaters, complying with the planning demands and confined to the area studied. By adding such breakwaters, the model predicted soil accumulation and under-predicted the degree of erosion. It is clear from ground evidence that this solution only 'pushed' the area of erosion northward. The model also did not predict coastal erosion already occurring 750 m north of the marina and ignored any changes in the area south of the marina. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Suspended sediment converges and is deposited rapidly along the shear front zone; this is because a low-velocity zone is formed between two inverse flow bodies. Some small eddies occur in the shear front zone, shown on (method of concentration-temperature ratio) mapping; this is conducive to rapid convergence and accumulation of the suspended sediment in the shear front. At the same time, some hyperpycnal plumes and gravity-driven underflow may be formed; these move away from the shear front zone, due to the high sediment concentrations there. The shear front is formed firstly at the prodelta area; it then moves to the river mouth, in response to the flood or ebb tidal controls and deep sea influences, It moves along the subaqueous delta slope for 1/2-1/3 or me tidal cycle, during the over flood season. The shear front zone of low velocity forms a wall of water that prevents dispersal of the river outflow. The temperature image from TM6 shows that a river-sea interaction zone, a transition between the river and sea water temperatures, occurs around the mouth. The shear front is formed within this zone. A four-stage dynamic process, related to the shear front during the tidal cycle, is discussed, The results show that the shear front occurs twice during a tidal cycle. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Frette, O; Erga, SR; Stamnes, JJ; Stamnes, K				Frette, O; Erga, SR; Stamnes, JJ; Stamnes, K			Optical remote sensing of waters with vertical structure	APPLIED OPTICS												Optical remote sensing of ocean color is a well-established technique that is used to produce maps of marine constituents on a routine basis. Retrieval algorithms used to infer pigment concentrations from measurements of ocean color are usually based on the assumption that the upper ocean column is vertically homogeneous. However, stable stratification of the water column is often encountered in coastal waters and in fjords. This stratification is decisive for the initiation, maintainance, and species composition of phytoplankton blooms. Here we present an optical remote-sensing algorithm with the ability to resolve such a vertical structure of oceanic waters. The vertical structure is assumed to consist of two homogeneous layers with different concentrations of chlorophyll a. The algorithm is designed to determine the chlorophyll-alpha concentrations of the two layers as well as the thickness of the upper layer. These three parameters influence the ocean color and are simultaneously retrieved through an inverse-modeling technique. This technique consists of using radiative-transfer computations for a coupled atmosphere-ocean system to simulate radiances received in various bands of the satellite sensor and to compare these simulated results with measured radiances. The sum of absolute values of differences between simulated and measured radiances is minimized by use of an optimization algorithm, and the retrieved parameters are those that yield the minimum sum of differences between measured and simulated data. The optimization algorithm that we used in our study is the simulated annealing method, which is an extension of the downhill simplex algorithm. In this study the algorithm was tested on synthetic data generated by the forward model. The results indicate that it should be possible to retrieve vertical variations in the pigment concentration. The synthetic data were generated for spectral bands that coincide with those of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer sensor, which will be a part of the instrument package of the upcoming Environmental Satellite.
